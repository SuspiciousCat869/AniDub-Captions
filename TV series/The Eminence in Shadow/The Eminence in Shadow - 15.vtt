WEBVTT

00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:03.507
(loud click)

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:05.512
(bell tolling)

00:00:05.612 --> 00:00:07.749
(wings fluttering)

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:13.026
[men] You here for the
Bushin Festival too?

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:15.632
-Damn right I am.
Every fighter in the world

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:17.368
who thinks their skills
are worth anything

00:00:17.468 --> 00:00:19.238
comes to the Bushin Festival.
(general chatter)

00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:20.575
-As a gladiator myself,

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:23.080
there's no way I would
miss this opportunity.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.117
Oh, no, no,
that guy's dead for sure.

00:00:25.217 --> 00:00:26.520
[men] Dude, awesome!

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.489
They're warming up before the
official tournament.

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:31.296
-Yeah, get him!
Knock his head off.

00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:34.402
Oh wait, this one here
looks pretty strong.

00:00:34.503 --> 00:00:36.641
[kids] Dark Knights,
a whole bunch of them.

00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:38.143
-Whoa, cool.

00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:39.746
-Wait for me!

00:00:39.846 --> 00:00:41.416
[people] Velgalta? Oriana?

00:00:41.517 --> 00:00:43.353
Whoa,
even fighters from the east.

00:00:43.454 --> 00:00:45.759
-I wonder if there
are any hot guys?

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:47.227
-Whoa, he's huge.

00:00:47.327 --> 00:00:49.231
-I just felt a chill
down my spine.

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:51.369
-Over there,
at the edge of the road.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.607
[Cid] Who the heck is that guy?

00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:56.680
(chuckles)

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.118
Thank you, background extras.

00:00:59.218 --> 00:01:02.525
You have helped me remember
what it is that I must do.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:05.531
This transcends the lines
of race and nationality.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.203
The sponsors, the fighters,
the spectators...

00:01:08.303 --> 00:01:10.841
They all want one thing
and one thing only:

00:01:11.744 --> 00:01:13.246
Absolute strength.

00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:15.518
Here at this festival
where all are unified

00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:17.756
in the quest to find the
strongest among us,

00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:19.325
I know what I must do.

00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:21.797
And that is to conceal
my eminent powers,

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:24.368
enter the tournament, make all
the spectators first think,

00:01:24.468 --> 00:01:26.239
"Oh no,
that guy's dead for sure."

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:28.110
Then make them
gradually realize,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.713
"Wait,
this one's pretty strong."

00:01:29.813 --> 00:01:33.019
Until finally, "Who the heck is
that guy? He's amazing,"

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.421
they will scream.

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:36.125
It is one of the top items

00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:38.630
on my Eminence in Shadow
bucket list.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.033
And it is time!

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.870
(wings fluttering)

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.845
The big wave has come to town,
and I'm gonna ride it!

00:01:46.814 --> 00:01:49.151
(OPENING THEME)

00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:38.002
Uh... (gasps)

00:03:38.102 --> 00:03:39.639
(mmuhm-mmuhm)

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.279
Thank you for gracing our
establishment, my Lord.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.618
What brings you here- (trips)

00:03:47.054 --> 00:03:48.490
(in pain) ...today?

00:03:48.591 --> 00:03:50.493
[Cid] Your nose is bleeding.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.569
I have a favor to ask of you.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.540
I am honored to serve you.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.677
Whatever you wish will
be granted, my Lord.

00:03:58.777 --> 00:04:02.284
[Cid] I want to disguise myself
and enter the Bushin Festival.

00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:04.255
Disguise yourself?

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:06.693
But why would you
do such a thing?

00:04:07.795 --> 00:04:11.102
I'm sorry, but, would you
please not ask me that?

00:04:11.202 --> 00:04:12.104
(gasps)

00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:13.240
[Cid] Forgive me,

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.477
but I can speak
of it to no one.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.582
I see, my Lord.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.420
Then I will ask no questions.

00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:22.290
Bring in the items.

00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:24.729
(racks rattling)

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:29.371
(laidback guitar music)

00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:32.712
Now, if you'll pardon me,
my Lord, please use this.

00:04:32.812 --> 00:04:33.680
[Cid] What is that?

00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:35.150
[Gamma]
Slime that we have enhanced

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.720
using the god-like
Wisdom of the Shadows

00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:39.258
that you so kindly
bestowed upon us.

00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:40.795
When charged with
magical energy,

00:04:40.895 --> 00:04:44.802
it changes to a texture as
real as that of human skin.

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:46.673
Rub, rub, rub...

00:04:46.773 --> 00:04:50.380
[Cid] So anyone can use it?
That's cool.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.317
[Gamma] I've placed Eta in
charge of mass producing it.

00:04:52.418 --> 00:04:55.958
[Cid] Right now, it just feels
like I've slathered clay all
over my face.

00:04:56.058 --> 00:04:58.564
[Gamma] Next we carve the
slime, put a finish on,

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:01.202
and voila, a different person!

00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:02.773
I understand.

00:05:02.873 --> 00:05:04.709
What sort of face
would you like to have?

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:06.445
[Cid]
One that looks kind of weak.

00:05:06.547 --> 00:05:08.885
[Nu]
You want to look weak, my Lord?

00:05:08.985 --> 00:05:12.057
[Gamma] Then how would you like
to be this individual?

00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:13.593
His name is Mundane Mann.

00:05:13.694 --> 00:05:16.600
He's lazy, and is a Dark Knight
with no skill to speak of.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.372
He was disowned by his noble
family five years ago,

00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:21.877
and died an unremarkable
and undiscovered death.

00:05:21.977 --> 00:05:25.751
His bone structure is similar
to yours, so I recommend him.

00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:26.987
I like it.

00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:30.026
Not just his face, but his
whole profile is perfect.

00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:32.131
Let's do it!
I'll be Mundane.

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.402
As you wish, my Lord.

00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:36.272
Very well, here it goes.

00:05:36.372 --> 00:05:38.710
(machinery whirring)

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:41.716
(bicycle rattling)

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:44.121
(steam whistle)

00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:46.593
(machinery rattling
and banging)

00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:50.466
(ding)
(hiss of steam)

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:53.541
Well, what do you think?

00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:56.647
Yeah, yeah, I totally see it.

00:05:56.747 --> 00:05:59.084
He looks really weak,
doesn't he?

00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:03.126
(sighs)

00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:05.832
If we're doing this, I guess
it would be more appropriate

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:09.138
to use bad posture,
with hunched shoulders,

00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:10.575
and my voice and face,

00:06:10.675 --> 00:06:12.177
(deeper voice)
should also be lifeless.

00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:15.216
[Gamma] Oh, impressive as
always. You're so good at this.

00:06:15.317 --> 00:06:16.887
Looking at someone's
gait and posture

00:06:16.987 --> 00:06:19.425
will tell you exactly
how much they understand

00:06:19.526 --> 00:06:21.395
about how to
utilize their bodies.

00:06:21.495 --> 00:06:23.399
I remember when you
taught me that, my Lord,

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:26.607
and now you are embodying the
concept brilliantly.

00:06:26.707 --> 00:06:29.178
[Kagenou] <i>Gamma remembers all
the knowledge I've given her,</i>

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:30.681
<i>and she understands it.</i>

00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:32.484
<i>This entertaining
form of disguise</i>

00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:34.823
<i>is probably one of the
fruits of that knowledge.</i>

00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:35.925
(sighs)

00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:39.264
It's her brains.
It has to be her brains.

00:06:39.364 --> 00:06:40.935
You will need clothing
and a sword.

00:06:41.035 --> 00:06:44.008
We have gathered an assortment
of cheap secondhand items-
(ack)

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:46.847
(thumping and crashing)

00:06:46.947 --> 00:06:48.049
[Kagenou] <i>But...</i>

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:51.122
<i>she still has absolutely
no athletic ability.</i>

00:06:51.222 --> 00:06:52.758
...for your selection.

00:06:52.858 --> 00:06:54.996
[Mundane] Your nose is bleeding.

00:06:55.096 --> 00:06:55.898
(laughs)

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:57.167
No doubt about it.

00:06:57.268 --> 00:06:58.436
Hey, over there.

00:06:58.537 --> 00:06:59.606
[both] Huh?

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:01.710
Isn't that Annerose,

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.814
from Velgalta's Seven Blades?

00:07:03.914 --> 00:07:05.718
[green shirt] Oh, you mean
the one who supposedly

00:07:05.818 --> 00:07:07.989
summoned an ancient warrior
at the last Goddess' Trial?

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:10.828
[grey shirt] She's got a real
presence about her, huh?

00:07:10.928 --> 00:07:12.297
(gasps)

00:07:12.397 --> 00:07:14.301
[Annerose] Hey, you, excuse me.

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:15.738
Huh?

00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:18.710
Are you planning on competing
in the Bushin Festival?

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.982
A cheap sword, a sickly body...

00:07:21.082 --> 00:07:22.952
Anyone can see that
you're an amateur,

00:07:23.052 --> 00:07:25.324
so I suggest that
you take my advice.

00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:27.796
Forget about entering
the Bushin Festival.

00:07:27.896 --> 00:07:31.570
If you underestimate this event,
you may never recover.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.908
[Mundane] (sighs)
[Annerose] Hmm?

00:07:34.008 --> 00:07:37.047
You know,
you really shouldn't judge a
book by its cover, missy.

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:41.389
Hey, excuse me, but I'm just
trying to help YOU here.

00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:42.926
[Mundane]
I don't need your help.

00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:45.063
[Annerose] Wait,
I'm not done talking to you!

00:07:45.163 --> 00:07:47.134
[Kagenou] <i>I knew this was
the right disguise.</i>

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:50.107
<i>I can't believe I'm already in
the perfect position
to pull off my</i>

00:07:50.207 --> 00:07:53.312
<i>"He looks weak, but he's
actually the Eminence in
Shadow" moves.</i>

00:07:53.412 --> 00:07:56.485
[man]
Hey, stop right there, kid.

00:07:56.586 --> 00:07:58.356
When a kind soul
gives you advice,

00:07:58.456 --> 00:07:59.859
you really oughtta
listen to it.

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:01.429
[Kagenou]
<i>Look who we have here!</i>

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.399
<i>The guy who's obviously
doomed to lose!</i>

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:06.072
Hate to say it,
but I told you so.

00:08:06.172 --> 00:08:07.676
Folks here, call me Quinton.

00:08:07.776 --> 00:08:09.980
I've fought in the Bushin
Festival a few times,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.719
and every time there's some
weak-ass killjoys like you

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:15.223
ruining all the fun.
Do us all a favor

00:08:15.323 --> 00:08:19.231
and go home and suck on your
mommy's tit or something.

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.001
[onlooker] That's classic!

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.438
[Quinton] Huh?

00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:23.774
Well, one thing's for sure.

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:24.976
[Kagenou] <i>Gotta ride it.</i>

00:08:25.077 --> 00:08:26.580
I'm at least stronger
than you are.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.116
[Kagenou] <i>Ride the big wave!</i>

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:30.555
[onlookers] Hey, Quinton,
he thinks you're a weakling.

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:32.759
-You gonna let him talk
to you like that?

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:35.931
We'll see who's stronger
than me. Come here!

00:08:36.032 --> 00:08:39.572
You better watch your filthy
mouth, you stupid little shit!

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:44.181
(onlookers laughing)

00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:47.154
I'm giving you one last
chance to apologize.

00:08:47.254 --> 00:08:50.895
[Mundane]
Man, you really are third-rate.

00:08:50.995 --> 00:08:54.334
(growling) I'll murder you!

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:55.838
[Kagenou] <i>Truly an amateur.</i>

00:08:55.938 --> 00:08:58.309
<i>If I'm honest, the unarmed
combat in this world</i>

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:00.313
<i>is entirely unsophisticated.</i>

00:09:02.017 --> 00:09:03.754
<i>There are several options
I could choose from</i>

00:09:03.854 --> 00:09:05.323
<i>in this situation.</i>

00:09:05.424 --> 00:09:07.261
(punches landing)
(Quinton grunting)

00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:09.633
<i>If there was a tournament
for unarmed gorillas...</i>

00:09:09.733 --> 00:09:12.137
<i>I mean humans,
I would definitely win.</i>

00:09:12.237 --> 00:09:14.576
<i>If this was a battle against
a powerful opponent</i>

00:09:14.676 --> 00:09:16.279
<i>that I was actually
TRYING to win,</i>

00:09:16.379 --> 00:09:19.619
<i>first, I would go for the eyes.</i>
(blood splattering)

00:09:19.719 --> 00:09:22.958
<i>But I have no intention of
fighting just yet.</i>

00:09:23.326 --> 00:09:25.196
(growls)

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:28.804
[Quinton] There's a lot more
where that came from.

00:09:28.904 --> 00:09:30.908
He could at least try to
fight back a little.

00:09:31.008 --> 00:09:33.413
Geez, he's just as
pathetic as he looks.

00:09:33.514 --> 00:09:34.849
(sighs)

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:38.557
[Quinton] What, too scared
to even fight back?

00:09:38.657 --> 00:09:40.661
[Mundane] My fists are
too good to be wasted

00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:43.701
on a low-level street fight.

00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:46.038
Sounds to me like
you haven't had enough.

00:09:46.138 --> 00:09:48.342
[Annerose] I think it's
time you stop this.

00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:51.381
Or I'll be forced to step in.

00:09:53.219 --> 00:09:54.889
(sighs)

00:09:57.327 --> 00:09:59.632
[onlookers] Where you going,
Quinton? To take a leak?

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:02.170
-What, over already?
That's no fun.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.841
[Quinton] Bah!

00:10:03.941 --> 00:10:05.878
[Annerose] Are you all right?

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:10.555
I'm really sorry. I had no idea
this would get SO out of hand.

00:10:10.655 --> 00:10:12.157
If you really wanted
to stop him,

00:10:12.257 --> 00:10:15.162
you could have done it sooner,
couldn't you?

00:10:15.263 --> 00:10:18.604
I just thought it would be
better for you to get hurt now,

00:10:18.704 --> 00:10:20.406
rather than suffer
permanent damage

00:10:20.507 --> 00:10:22.912
from something that might
happen in the tournament.

00:10:23.012 --> 00:10:24.549
Anyway, let me patch you up.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.553
There's no need.

00:10:26.653 --> 00:10:29.124
It's been a long time since
I've tasted blood.

00:10:29.492 --> 00:10:30.561
(hmm)

00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:31.830
(gasps)

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.767
[Annerose]
He used you like a punching bag.

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:35.738
Aren't you hurt at all?

00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:39.177
It's been a long time since
I've tasted blood.

00:10:39.277 --> 00:10:41.550
Oh...
Please wait.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.486
(hmpfh)

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:46.527
I go by the name of
Annerose Nichtsehen.

00:10:46.627 --> 00:10:48.295
What do they call you?

00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:52.170
I'm Mann, Mundane Mann.

00:10:53.574 --> 00:10:56.078
Your name is Mundane?

00:10:59.084 --> 00:11:01.088
[staff] Apply here to enter
the fighting contest.

00:11:01.188 --> 00:11:02.825
-Make sure to
keep the road clear.

00:11:02.925 --> 00:11:05.964
-Hey, draw that sword,
and I'm calling the Knights.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.202
[Kagenou] <i>I've done it.</i>

00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:10.807
<i>He's a low level grunt that
everyone thinks is worthless,</i>

00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:12.511
<i>except a few
who may have noticed</i>

00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:14.181
<i>there's something
unusual about him.</i>

00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:16.987
<i>I am loving the reaction from
that girl back there.</i>

00:11:17.087 --> 00:11:20.092
But don't get ahead of yourself.
The best is yet to come.

00:11:20.193 --> 00:11:22.565
After the tournament starts,
that's when people will think

00:11:22.665 --> 00:11:24.168
"Wait,
he might be pretty good."

00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:26.506
And when things really ramp up,
they'll go,

00:11:26.606 --> 00:11:28.710
"He's the toughest guy
I've ever seen."

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.112
And that would be when I-

00:11:30.212 --> 00:11:32.283
[staff] Next, Mr. Mundane Mann?

00:11:32.383 --> 00:11:33.987
Uh, yes, right here.

00:11:34.087 --> 00:11:35.389
[all] Huh?

00:11:36.894 --> 00:11:39.398
(general hubub)

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:40.634
[Skel] Tomorrow is the day,

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:43.038
the Bushin Festival is
finally starting.

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:44.709
They'll start with
the preliminaries

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:46.713
and only the toughest fighters
who get through those

00:11:46.813 --> 00:11:48.016
will go on to the
main tournament.

00:11:48.116 --> 00:11:49.886
<i>I wanna show my
true eminent power</i>

00:11:49.986 --> 00:11:51.923
<i>when the tournament is
reaching its climax.</i>

00:11:52.023 --> 00:11:54.261
<i>So I just have to fight
like I always do.</i>

00:11:54.361 --> 00:11:56.265
<i>I doubt it'll be a problem,
but...</i>

00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:59.338
Gotta be really careful about
how to approach those prelims.

00:11:59.438 --> 00:12:02.879
[Skel] Exactly!
The betting won't get good
until the main tournament,

00:12:02.979 --> 00:12:04.315
but if we wanna
rake in the winnings,

00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:06.586
we'll need to collect data
on the earlier fights.

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:08.089
Definitely
don't wanna go all out,

00:12:08.189 --> 00:12:10.928
but it's not a good idea to
hold back too much either.

00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:13.800
Precisely. For the moment,
I've got my eye on the

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.405
repeat competitor Quinton.
What do you think, huh?

00:12:16.506 --> 00:12:18.409
[Kagenou] <i>Ideally,
I'll get the crowd to think,</i>

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.717
<i>"That guy's a total pushover,
but I can't stop watching him."</i>

00:12:21.817 --> 00:12:24.487
<i>But it won't be easy to
hit that sweet spot.</i>

00:12:26.091 --> 00:12:27.962
This calls for some
careful observation.

00:12:28.062 --> 00:12:29.899
[Skel] Yep,
we gotta watch very closely,

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.135
and guess right the first time.

00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:33.606
So, if you would
kindly provide funds...

00:12:33.707 --> 00:12:35.143
[Cid]
Who's the most likely to win?

00:12:35.243 --> 00:12:37.949
[Skel] Ah, well, the favorite
would be Princess Iris.

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:39.251
If she wins this year,

00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:40.955
she'll be the first repeat
champion in ages.

00:12:41.055 --> 00:12:42.758
So, the crowds are
pretty stoked.

00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:44.796
Then there's Student Council
President Rose,

00:12:44.896 --> 00:12:47.067
who got seeded in by winning
the school tournament.

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:48.970
There's a fair amount of buzz
about her potential

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.277
to be the first Bushin champion
from the Oriana Kingdom.

00:12:52.377 --> 00:12:53.446
That's cool.

00:12:53.547 --> 00:12:55.049
[Skel] And so, Cid,
if we're gonna make the most

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:56.987
of this festival,
we'll need some funds to-

00:12:57.087 --> 00:12:58.489
There's not anyone else?

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.963
Oh, well, there's also talk
about an ultra, super-strong

00:13:02.064 --> 00:13:04.167
gladiatrix from the
Velgalta Empire,

00:13:04.267 --> 00:13:05.904
and then there's
a totally awesome

00:13:06.004 --> 00:13:08.209
and battle-hardened Dark Knight
that I'm a HUGE fan of.

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:10.213
So Cid,
some funds would be nice.

00:13:10.313 --> 00:13:14.221
Oh, here, I got you
a souvenir in Lindwurm.

00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:16.358
What is this?
It's really cool.

00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:17.995
When the heck did
you go to Lindwurm?

00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:19.699
You never told me about that.
(chair scraping)

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.369
You should have
taken me with you.

00:13:21.469 --> 00:13:24.041
Hey, where are you going?
What about the money?

00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:27.180
[Cid] If you're so sure you'll
win, you don't need it, right?

00:13:28.315 --> 00:13:30.287
[Cid] I would like three
sandwiches to go, please.

00:13:30.387 --> 00:13:33.459
[staff] Very good.
Three sandwiches to go!

00:13:36.098 --> 00:13:37.735
[Kagenou] <i>Any fight with
one of the favorites</i>

00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:39.839
<i>is going to attract
a lot of attention.</i>

00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:42.611
<i>I really have to think about
how to win those.</i>

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:44.447
(gah)

00:13:44.548 --> 00:13:45.650
Hmm?

00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:48.757
Carelessness is
the greatest enemy.

00:13:48.857 --> 00:13:50.360
Strange seeing you
in a place like this,

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.531
at a time like this,
in clothes like that.

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:55.469
Oh, well, it's because I'm
meeting someone later.
That's all.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.742
I'm guessing you were
just at Tuna King, huh?

00:13:57.842 --> 00:13:59.211
Yeah.

00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:01.348
[Rose] The three of us went
there just the other day.

00:14:01.448 --> 00:14:03.486
The food was delicious.

00:14:03.587 --> 00:14:04.622
[Cid] Three of you?

00:14:04.722 --> 00:14:06.358
[Rose]
Yes, me, Princess Alexia,

00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:08.964
and believe it or not,
Natsume Kafka.

00:14:09.064 --> 00:14:11.168
[Cid] That sounds like the most
painful grouping ever.

00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:12.738
But I guess you're friends?

00:14:12.838 --> 00:14:16.078
Yes, Natsume Kafka and I have
gotten really close, actually.

00:14:16.178 --> 00:14:18.115
And Alexia's
a really nice girl,

00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:22.090
so I'm sure we'll be the best
of friends in no time.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.194
[Kagenou] <i>As long as you think
Alexia's a nice girl,</i>

00:14:24.294 --> 00:14:27.334
<i>nothing you do will
make her your friend.</i>

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:29.906
Unfortunately, Alexia
and Natsume are still

00:14:30.006 --> 00:14:32.611
somewhat awkward around each
other, but it's okay.

00:14:32.712 --> 00:14:35.450
[Kagenou] <i>Yeah, it's like
hating your own reflection.</i>

00:14:35.551 --> 00:14:38.222
[Cid] I'm sure they'll work it
out before too long.

00:14:38.322 --> 00:14:40.060
[Rose] I hope you're right.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.263
I want the three of us
to all work together

00:14:42.363 --> 00:14:45.336
to make the world a better
place in any small way we can.

00:14:45.436 --> 00:14:47.641
[Cid] World peace is really
important after all.

00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:48.844
[Rose] Right.

00:14:48.944 --> 00:14:51.248
[Cid]
Anyway, shouldn't you get going?

00:14:53.452 --> 00:14:57.393
Actually, I'm supposed to
meet with my father.

00:14:57.493 --> 00:15:00.767
He is going to introduce
me to my fiance.

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:03.472
(unhappy)
His name is Perv Asshat.

00:15:03.573 --> 00:15:05.443
[Cid] Perv Asshat?

00:15:05.544 --> 00:15:07.046
[Rose] (flatly) Yes.

00:15:10.286 --> 00:15:13.560
I'll spare you congratulations.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.098
[Rose] I'm the princess of the
land of art and culture.

00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:20.306
People have had great
expectations for me
my entire life.

00:15:20.406 --> 00:15:24.013
But I defied all of them and
chose the path of the sword.

00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:26.385
[Cid] That IS unusual.

00:15:26.485 --> 00:15:28.523
I've heard the Dark Knights
don't rank very high

00:15:28.623 --> 00:15:30.694
in the Oriana hierarchy.

00:15:30.794 --> 00:15:34.201
[Rose] My father and everyone
in the kingdom were against it.

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:35.971
Couldn't see the point in
swinging a sword

00:15:36.071 --> 00:15:37.508
and getting covered in dirt.

00:15:37.608 --> 00:15:40.380
But for me, I have
never been able to forget

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.553
the beautiful sight
I witnessed on that day.

00:15:46.458 --> 00:15:47.961
Who are you?

00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:50.634
Me? I'm-

00:15:52.103 --> 00:15:54.074
Even if no one
would accept them,

00:15:54.174 --> 00:15:57.314
I could never, ever turn my
back on my ideals,

00:15:57.414 --> 00:15:59.618
and I still refuse to do it.

00:16:00.854 --> 00:16:02.692
It's possible that
my stubbornness

00:16:02.792 --> 00:16:05.430
will cause me to betray
countless people again.

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:08.971
But this time, it's not the
selfish demand of a child.

00:16:09.071 --> 00:16:10.540
Hey, Cid...

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.748
Would you keep believing in me,
no matter what happens?

00:16:18.824 --> 00:16:20.326
[Cid] Sure.

00:16:21.428 --> 00:16:23.098
I will.

00:16:24.101 --> 00:16:25.436
(happy sigh)

00:16:25.537 --> 00:16:28.676
I'm glad I got to talk to you.
This was nice.

00:16:32.551 --> 00:16:33.787
[Cid] Hey!

00:16:33.887 --> 00:16:35.389
You can have this.

00:16:38.162 --> 00:16:40.232
You should try
to relax a little.

00:16:51.556 --> 00:16:52.858
(swords clashing)

00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.129
(fighters straining)

00:16:55.229 --> 00:16:56.533
Yeah, get him!
(general chatter)

00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:58.335
Put your back into it.

00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:01.910
Oh, come on.
Don't wimp out on us yet.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.212
Where's Po, by the way?

00:17:03.312 --> 00:17:06.653
Probably plowing
potato fields back home.

00:17:06.753 --> 00:17:08.488
Darn it, this match is a bust.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:10.193
What is it that
you're doing anyway?

00:17:10.293 --> 00:17:12.598
I'm collecting data
on all of the battles.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.904
Amateurs place their bets based
on gut instinct, but not me.

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:19.077
I calculate my own statistics,
and then I make smart bets,

00:17:19.177 --> 00:17:21.649
based on proper data.
[Cid] Uh huh...

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:25.524
[Skel]
Bets are won based on totals.
[Cid] Uh huh.

00:17:25.624 --> 00:17:28.029
[Skel]
Instead of gambling on winning
or losing a SINGLE match,

00:17:28.129 --> 00:17:32.403
I converged the odds by betting
on ten matches at once!
[Cid] Cool.

00:17:32.504 --> 00:17:36.478
You see, I am a man who uses
the odds to his advantage.
[Cid] Cool.

00:17:36.579 --> 00:17:39.150
Come on, Cid,
to raise the odds to 100%,

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.355
I'm gonna need
some funds to start.

00:17:41.455 --> 00:17:43.560
[man]
I find all of that fascinating.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.595
Huh?

00:17:44.695 --> 00:17:47.668
[Skel] Uh! You're...
[Cid] You know him?

00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:50.339
[Skel] He's Goldy Gilded,
the Unbeaten Legend!

00:17:50.439 --> 00:17:53.913
(hah) Please,
that nickname embarrasses me.

00:17:54.013 --> 00:17:57.688
Call me Goldy Gilded, the
Ever-Victorious Golden Dragon.

00:17:57.788 --> 00:18:00.359
Yes, Goldy,
the Effervescent Garden Kraken.

00:18:00.459 --> 00:18:02.163
Victorious Golden Dragon.

00:18:02.263 --> 00:18:04.300
Yes, Baldy,
the 10-Wheeled Wagon!

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.474
The winner is Imatry Nottalose!

00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:10.580
[Goldy] I understand you're
tabulating battle data?
(crowd cheering)

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.882
[Skel] Uh, yes, sir.

00:18:11.983 --> 00:18:13.653
[Goldy]
(chuckles) You have promise.

00:18:13.753 --> 00:18:16.225
I know because I,
the Ever-Victorious,

00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:18.196
never fail to tabulate data.

00:18:18.296 --> 00:18:19.731
[Skel] R-really, sir?

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:23.438
Oh yes, it always helps me win.
[Skel] That's so awesome!

00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:26.212
Tell me what you know,
Mr. Queen Victorious Gladden.

00:18:26.312 --> 00:18:27.782
Fine, but again, it's

00:18:27.882 --> 00:18:30.319
"Ever-Victorious
Golden Dragon."

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:31.922
[Cid] I'm gonna take a dump.
[Skel] Yeah, have fun.

00:18:32.023 --> 00:18:35.797
Just for an example, let's
analyze the next match together.

00:18:35.897 --> 00:18:36.966
Yes, sir!

00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:38.503
[Ref] Round 3, Match 12.

00:18:38.603 --> 00:18:43.011
Gonzales Machombre versus
Mundane Mann.

00:18:43.112 --> 00:18:44.414
[Goldy]
I have a theory that one can

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:46.351
get a general idea of a
fighter's strength

00:18:46.451 --> 00:18:48.322
BEFORE the battle begins.

00:18:48.422 --> 00:18:50.092
I'll start with Gonzales.

00:18:50.192 --> 00:18:52.363
The glint in his eyes and
his arrogant smile

00:18:52.463 --> 00:18:54.267
tell me he's
experienced and tough.

00:18:54.367 --> 00:18:56.304
As for physical strength,
one look at his muscles,

00:18:56.404 --> 00:18:58.108
will tell you he's got it.

00:18:58.208 --> 00:19:02.652
His power level is 1,364.
(gleam)

00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:05.122
[Skel] Power level?
What's a power level?

00:19:05.222 --> 00:19:07.528
Their fighting prowess
in numerical form.

00:19:07.628 --> 00:19:11.268
1,364 is not a
BAD figure at all.

00:19:11.368 --> 00:19:13.941
Mundane Mann,
on the other hand is a...

00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:15.243
Oh...

00:19:15.343 --> 00:19:16.613
[Skel] What, what is it?

00:19:16.713 --> 00:19:20.386
Oh my, it's just too...
But this is...

00:19:20.486 --> 00:19:23.058
Don't tell me,
he looks weak and pathetic,

00:19:23.158 --> 00:19:25.429
but he could be a dark horse?

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:30.339
No way,
he is astoundingly inept.

00:19:30.439 --> 00:19:31.676
No idea how someone like that

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:34.213
could have made it
all the way to Round Three.

00:19:34.313 --> 00:19:38.155
He has a weak face,
a weak build, a weak aura.

00:19:38.255 --> 00:19:41.896
He's dreadful.
I would say his power level is:

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:44.100
33.
(gleam)

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.272
Say you're saying
Gonzales is gonna win?

00:19:46.372 --> 00:19:47.908
In less than a second.

00:19:48.008 --> 00:19:50.881
Watching this match would be
a total waste of my time.

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:54.121
Wow, what a levelheaded
and accurate analysis that was,

00:19:54.221 --> 00:19:55.990
Never-Ending
Drink-Filled Flagon!

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.662
(forced chuckle) Golden Dragon.

00:19:57.762 --> 00:20:00.332
[ref] Let the fight begin.
(crowd gasping)

00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:02.369
[both] Huh?

00:20:03.338 --> 00:20:06.144
Mr. Gonzales, stand up please.

00:20:06.244 --> 00:20:07.581
Mr. Gonzales?

00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:09.852
[spectators] Hey, what in
blue blazes just happened?

00:20:09.952 --> 00:20:11.221
-Gonzales tripped and fell?

00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:13.125
-Is this for real?

00:20:13.225 --> 00:20:14.361
[Skel] Hmm?

00:20:14.461 --> 00:20:17.267
The, the winner is,
Mr. Mundane Mann.

00:20:17.367 --> 00:20:19.705
(angry crowd shouting)

00:20:20.707 --> 00:20:23.445
-Give me back my money, jackass!

00:20:23.546 --> 00:20:25.316
(Gonzales shouting)

00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:27.453
(punches landing)

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.392
(ungh)

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:34.835
With a punch to the chin...

00:20:34.936 --> 00:20:36.171
No, two punches.

00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:37.842
Well, I hope you've
learned a lesson here.

00:20:37.942 --> 00:20:40.881
With data, it's possible to
predict an outcome,

00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:42.317
but there are no absolutes.

00:20:42.417 --> 00:20:43.720
Wha? You don't mean...

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.659
You knew this was gonna happen,
Professor Goldy?

00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:50.032
Allow me to give you
a piece of advice.

00:20:50.132 --> 00:20:52.571
There are two ways
to win when betting.

00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:56.679
One is to bet on strong
competitors with high
power levels.

00:20:56.779 --> 00:21:01.221
The other is to seek out
WEAK competitors, and bet
on their opponents.

00:21:01.321 --> 00:21:02.256
(gasps)

00:21:02.356 --> 00:21:03.960
In his fourth match tomorrow,

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:09.337
Mundane Mann, Power Level 28,
will be pitted against...

00:21:09.437 --> 00:21:12.711
me, Goldy Gilded,
Ever-Victorious Golden Dragon.

00:21:12.811 --> 00:21:14.582
Y-you mean to say...

00:21:14.682 --> 00:21:16.719
(Goldy chuckles)
Will you be able to solve

00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:19.357
the formula for victory,
I wonder?

00:21:19.457 --> 00:21:22.463
Adieu, adieu.
(Skel laughing)

00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:25.169
He, he's so amazing!

00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:26.304
I'm back from my dump.

00:21:26.404 --> 00:21:27.874
Hey, Cid,
there's a match tomorrow

00:21:27.975 --> 00:21:30.446
that I know I can win on,
so gimme all your life savings.

00:21:30.547 --> 00:21:32.684
[Cid] No.
[Skel]
Just take my word for it.

00:21:32.784 --> 00:21:34.487
[Cid] No.
[Skel] You'll regret it,

00:21:34.588 --> 00:21:35.456
and it won't be my fault!

00:21:35.557 --> 00:21:36.792
Just gimme some money!

00:21:36.892 --> 00:21:38.930
[Kagenou] <i>(chuckles)
I like that reaction.</i>

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.869
<i>The look on her face says
she thinks it might not
have been a fluke.</i>

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:44.474
[Cid]
Really gonna have to make sure
not to disappoint tomorrow.

00:21:44.575 --> 00:21:47.581
[Skel] Right, no disappointment!
And for that, I NEED MONEY!

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:49.751
[Cid]
Ah, that's not gonna happen.

00:21:50.386 --> 00:21:53.125
(running footsteps)

00:21:53.225 --> 00:21:55.563
(pounding on door)

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:58.770
Open the door, Cid.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.372
Get outta bed.

00:22:00.472 --> 00:22:02.210
Get outta bed, Cid.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.347
Come on!

00:22:04.447 --> 00:22:06.117
There's been an incident!

00:22:07.954 --> 00:22:10.594
President Rose stabbed her
fiance, Perv Asshat,

00:22:10.694 --> 00:22:13.900
and then she ran off!
No one knows where she is!

00:22:17.874 --> 00:22:19.377
Why?

00:22:21.081 --> 00:22:23.418
(ENDING THEME)
