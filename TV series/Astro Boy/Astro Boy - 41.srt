[BEEPING]

24
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,854
DR. O'SHAY:
They established an observatory

25
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,687
and equipped it with Galileo,

26
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,187
our latest
plasma-wave telescope.

27
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:07,954
They were hoping to observe

28
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:11,687
the Chronos star system
deep in space.

29
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:14,687
There are 200 billion stars
in our galaxy.

30
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:17,754
Approximately
750 million of them

31
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:19,187
are surrounded
by planets.

32
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:21,821
But we believe
the Chronos system

33
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:23,254
to be the one
most like our own.

34
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:25,054
In fact,

35
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:26,787
we may find a planet

36
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:29,121
and inhabitants there
just like on Earth.

37
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:31,421
So the observatory on Mount Elbe

38
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:34,687
was built to search
the Chronos system

39
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,187
and perhaps find
extraterrestrial life,

40
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:38,954

would be--

DR. O'SHAY:
The robot AR-1

43
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:49,254
was dispatched to the snowcap
to manage the observatory.

44
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:52,254
However, six months later--

45
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:56,187
Both AR-1 and the telescope
just vanished into thin air.

46
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:58,854
When the investigation team
got there,

47
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,754
the base was wrecked,
and there was no sign of AR-1.

48
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:03,821
They concluded that
the observatory

49
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:06,021
had been destroyed
by a terrible avalanche.

50
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:08,854
And with
the Galileo telescope gone,

51
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:10,787
the Chronos Project
was cancelled.

52
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:14,954

they are sending out

53
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,221

to the snowcap.

54
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:20,054
I'd like you to send me
to represent the Ministry.

55
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,954
But you shouldn't go
to the snowcap.

56

There could be another
dangerous avalanche.
