Wow!

00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,440
How deep are we going again,
Dr. O'Shay?

4
00:01:12,474 --> 00:01:13,540
DR. O'SHAY:
Three thousand meters

00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,274
beneath the earth, Astro.

00:01:15,307 --> 00:01:18,174
Geo Raider is an
amazing machine!

7
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:23,140
Chief! This is unbelievable!

8
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:26,240
The decision has been made,
Commander Damon!

9
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:27,507
But--

10
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,374
I'm afraid you have
no choice in the matter.

11
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:30,540
Since the Geo Raider's
mainframe

12
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:32,107
is experiencing
technical problems,

13
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,974
it's standard procedure

14
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:36,407
to switch over
to a backup system.

15
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,174
The problem is that
the backup is a robot!

16
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:41,940
You're not actually nervous

17
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:45,107
about working with a walking,
talking computer, are you?

18
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,340
No, sir, I am not.

19
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,340
But the last thing I need
is a robot with feelings

20
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:52,640

how to do my job!

21
00:01:52,674 --> 00:01:54,307
DAMON: My crew
depends on me.

22
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,940
And in a tight situation,

23
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:59,007
there cannot be any confusion
as to who's in command!

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,907
O'SHAY: Is there
a problem here, chief?

25
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,074
Oh, forgive me, Dr. O'Shay.

26
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:04,274
This is Damon,
the team commander.

We were just discussing
the expedition.

28

Don't worry, commander.

29
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:10,640
I'm quite sure Astro will
prove very useful to you

30
00:02:10,674 --> 00:02:12,207
and your crew too.

It looks like
I'm stuck with you.

32

But I want to make it clear
that I'm in charge around here.

Yes, sir!

35

DAMON:
This is Astro.

36
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:33,307
He's been brought in as a backup
to the Geo Raider's mainframe.

37
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,040
And he has promised that
he will stay out of our way.

38

Hey, everybody,
what's up?

Dr. Cho Tan-Meng, aerobiologist.

But the Geo Raider goes
underground, not into space.

00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:53,440
Why, yes, but the environment
we'll be exploring

45
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,507
is like an alien world.

Man has never had the chance
to study the Earth's core.

This is a momentous
and historic day.

48
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,974
Yes, indeed. This voyage
is the first of its kind.

of new and exciting discoveries
