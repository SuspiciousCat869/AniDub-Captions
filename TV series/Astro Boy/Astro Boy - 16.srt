Doctor! Boon!

00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,826
BOON:
Hang on, kid.
We're here to help.

326
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,992
Kid, insert this Boon Unit
into <i>Ganymede's</i> main engine.

327
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:18,759
It'll repair whatever's
broken down inside it.

328
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,426
Try to set it in the drive port.

329
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:29,326
Argh!

330
00:19:15,392 --> 00:19:17,326
Wow!

You did it, kid!

333
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:31,392
And the Boon Unit worked!
It repaired <i>Ganymede.</i>

334
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:32,692
What just happened?

335
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:34,059
Oh, nothing special.

336
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:37,359
Astro, he just saved the world.
That's all.

337
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:46,092
Not too shabby.

338
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:48,526
I knew Boon was right
about his Boon Unit.

339

O'SHAY:
Our deepest thanks.

This will

00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:58,126
Aha!

343
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,126
Boon spotted. Boon spotted.
I got you this time.

344
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,926
Let me at him!
Let me at him!

ASTRO:
Wait! He's innocent.

346
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:07,526
No, not you again. No.

347
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,092
Stop that. Boon isn't
on the run anymore.

348
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,926
Not even
a little?

349
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:15,759
The Boon Unit worked perfectly.
It proves he wasn't a crook.

350
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,826
Isn't that right,
Boon?

351
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:19,859
BOON:
Thanks to you.
I owe you one, kid.

352
00:20:19,892 --> 00:20:21,559
No prob.

Welcome back, Astro.
