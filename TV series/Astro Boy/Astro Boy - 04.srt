324
00:19:10,813 --> 00:19:14,513
Someday we'll
rule the world together.

325
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:16,480
I won't join you.

326
00:19:16,513 --> 00:19:21,546
Yes, you will. That is
the reason I built you, Tobio.

327
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,480
No, Tenma. Not Tobio.

328
00:19:24,513 --> 00:19:27,746
I'm Astro!

329
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,046
A mere slip of the tongue.
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:40,780
I will see you soon, Astro.

331
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:06,080
Another chance.
That's all I need.

332
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:08,480
I'll treat him right this time.

333
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:12,480
One more chance,
please.

334
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:15,480
[SOBBING] Please.

335
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:18,980
Doctor, I'll go find Atlas.
I know I can save him.

336
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:23,680
Well, actually, Astro,
I think you already have.

337
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:42,680
