I was trapped here

327
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,986
by the collision
of two great planets.

328
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,725
The mining robots heard my pleas
and tried to rescue me.

329
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,031
But only you had the power
to release me.

330
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,200
Now I can go home.

331
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:24,606
Come with me.

332
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,011
I'll show you a world
no robot has ever seen.

333
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:27,579
Whoa.

334
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:35,459
Ahh!

335
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,185
Astro...

336
00:18:51,622 --> 00:18:53,090
Astro!

337
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:57,432
Astro!

338
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,815
Wait.

339
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:09,419
What is it?

340
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:12,625
I can't go with you.

341
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:14,729
My home is back on Earth
with Dr. O'Shay.

342
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:19,605
Astro!

343
00:19:21,441 --> 00:19:23,812
Are you really certain
this is what you want to do?

344
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:28,320
Pity.

345
00:19:28,353 --> 00:19:29,655
Well, then it's goodbye.

346
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:32,227
We'll meet again, Astro.

347
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:44,682
[GASPS]

348
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:51,495
O'SHAY:
Astro!

349
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,164
Ah! Oh! Whoa!

350
00:19:53,866 --> 00:19:55,769
Whoa! Ah! Ah! Ah!

351
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:58,441
Astro.
Doctor.

352
00:19:58,474 --> 00:20:00,277
Oh!

353
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,713
Goodness.

354
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,787
Doctor,
what is that?

355
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,958
I think it's
a kind of message.

356
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:10,195
Message?

357
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:13,568
According to my neurotranslator,
it appears to be Galaxian.

358
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:17,706
It says that mankind and robots
must learn to work together.

359
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:20,739
And that you will lead the way.

360
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,473
Me? Really?

361
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:25,306
Then we will meet again.

362
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,839
