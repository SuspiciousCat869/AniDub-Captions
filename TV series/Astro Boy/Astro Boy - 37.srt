319
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:48,182
When I woke up,

320
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:51,415
I was back at my home
here in Metro City.

321
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:54,449
Since then,
the doctor's been
hiding me here in his lab,

322
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:56,682
keeping me safe from
the Ministry of Defense.

323
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,015
Without Lumanite,

324
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:00,182
the Earth's atmosphere
turns Penelope to stone.

325
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:02,082
But Lumanite
has a short half-life

326
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:03,449
and we keep
running out.

327
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:06,415
And somehow Rock convinced you
he could find some more?

328
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:10,215
Yes. He said he had the money to
purchase more Lumanite for us.

329
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:12,315
He claimed to be
a wealthy investor

330
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:14,682
interested in helping me
fund my research.

331
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,849
I knew
it was too good
to be true.

332
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,315
But still--

333
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:21,015
I know.
You were thinking
about Penelope.

334
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:23,282
We're now
down to our final
piece of Lumanite.

335
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:25,415
The only way
Penelope can survive

336
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:27,882
is if we can
make contact with
the Moon Tower again.

337
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:29,282
How are you
going to do that?

338
00:15:29,315 --> 00:15:30,882
I wish
I knew.

339
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:32,982
ROCK:
I know. And Astro's
gonna help us.

340
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:36,749
We need
your mechanized strength

341
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:39,015
and <i>Kokoro</i>
to establish contact.

342
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:40,882
Astro's
electronic brain

343
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:43,215
still might not
be able to stand up to
the intense pressure.

344
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:44,949
He could be
completely destroyed.

345
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:46,315
There must be
another way.

346
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:48,349
There is no other way.

347
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:51,815
Besides, he's just a machine.
Who cares what happens?

348
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:53,049
Oh!

349
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:54,182
Why, you!

350
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:56,015
You never wanted
to help my research.

351
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:57,682
You just wanted
to find the Moon Tower

352
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:59,782
so you could learn its secrets
and exploit them.

353
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:01,682
You got me.

354
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:04,049
With the secrets of the Moon
Tower, I could rule the world.

355
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:05,849
And there's no one

356
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,749
more qualified to handle
that responsibility than me.

357
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:11,049
Throughout history, someone has
always risen to power

358
00:16:11,082 --> 00:16:14,082
and failed because
they lacked knowledge.

359
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:16,815
This time
will be different, Astro.

360
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:19,982
You're crazy if you think
I'm gonna help someone like you.

361
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:22,349
Is that right?
How about if I do this?
