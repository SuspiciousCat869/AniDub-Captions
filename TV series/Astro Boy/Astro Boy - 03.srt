My creator, Dr. O'Shay,
can help.

Dr. O'Shay?

Is that what he told you,
little brother?

You don't know
who your real creator is.

Huh?

Fight him now
or you will be destroyed.

You're lying.
My creator is Dr. O'Shay.

Whatever.
Not like it matters.

Why won't you fight back?

Cool your jets, Atlas.
I won't fight you.

Okay. Then I'll just destroy
