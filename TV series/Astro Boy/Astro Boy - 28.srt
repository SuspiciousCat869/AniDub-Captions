I can't do it without you.

Please, don't leave me.

Micro-Bear is lying to you.

Don't listen to him.
He's trying to trick you.

No, Kennedy, please.

came and cheered for you?

See, Ken, I'm your friend,

listened to you.

ASTRO: What you're trying
to do is wrong!

360
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:22,470
I will fight each
and every one of you,

00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:25,570
and you can just take your
little toys somewhere else!

You are stronger than I thought,

But I will be back.

We did it, Ken!
We did it.

368
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,237
Micro-Bear's leaving,
but is it over?

Yes. Take a look
around us, Zoran.

The Micro-Bears are gone.

So do you think you've learned
anything by this, Shadow?

SHADOW: Astro is very strong,
as are his friends.

I never expected that the thing
I used against mankind

would end up saving it.

Do not underestimate anyone,
Shadow, especially Astro.

He will lead the machines

Yes, Tenma. We must guide Astro
to ultimate victory.

why Kennedy asked
for a rematch today.

Well, the last game
didn't really count,

and he wanted
a second chance.

Hey, look!
