I'll be fine.

321
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:47,365
Hmm.

322
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,798
I mean it. You must go.

323
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:55,798
Atlas.

324
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:26,298
A long time ago,
Atlas said something to me.

325
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:28,965
He said he wanted
to go to a place

326
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:31,498
where he felt like
part of a family.

327
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:36,765
I never realized how much he
meant to me until he was gone.

328
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,465
Forgive me.
I was a fool, Daichi.

329
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:44,231
But I swear I will find you.
I promise.

330
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:54,798
You know, I still
don't understand

331
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:57,165
why the Nexus chip
suddenly stopped working.

332
00:20:58,998 --> 00:21:01,965
Maybe someone was looking
over my shoulder and helping me.

333
00:21:01,998 --> 00:21:04,531
You think so?

334
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:05,898
Yeah.

335
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,198
I just have
this feeling, doctor.

336
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:14,336
TENMA: <i>I will always</i>
<i>be watching over you, Astro,</i>

337
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:18,603
<i>because I have</i>
<i>big plans for you.</i>

338
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,103
