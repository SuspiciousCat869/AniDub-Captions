<i>Today</i>

328
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:00,582
<i>the Federal Council</i>
<i>has approved</i>

329
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:03,315
<i>a fundamental change</i>
<i>to our constitution.</i>

330
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,315
<i>This legislation declares</i>

331
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:07,415
<i>the civil rights</i>
<i>of robots everywhere</i>

332
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:10,915
<i>in a worldwide</i>
<i>partnership with mankind.</i>

334

Today is a day

335
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:17,915
<i>that I have</i>
<i>dreamed about for years,</i>

336
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:20,315
<i>but never truly</i>
<i>expected to see.</i>

337
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,015
<i>From this moment forward,</i>

338
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,315
<i>humans and robots</i>
<i>stand united as partners,</i>

339
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:28,015
<i>working together as a team.</i>

340
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,982
<i>Robots were first designed</i>
<i>to be tools for man,</i>

341
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:35,415
<i>mere machines</i>
<i>working to improve the lives</i>

342
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:37,382
<i>of the humans who owned them.</i>

343
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:40,849
They were programmed to follow
<i>our every command.</i>

344
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:43,649
<i>But then robots</i>
<i>were given</i> kokoro,

345
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:45,482
<i>and we soon learned</i>

346
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,649
<i>their hearts and minds</i>
<i>made them more like humans.</i>

347
00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:51,715
Some of us thought
that was a wonderful thing.

348
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:54,849
But others became fearful.

349
00:18:54,882 --> 00:18:56,849
<i>Through disagreements</i>
<i>and misunderstandings,</i>

350
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:59,682
we entered into a dark period.

351
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:02,715
<i>Many turned against</i>
<i>our robot friends.</i>

352
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:07,049
<i>How could we understand</i>
<i>their anger and resentment?</i>

353
00:19:07,082 --> 00:19:10,015
<i>If we had stopped to consider</i>
<i>the feelings of robots,</i>

354
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,782
<i>the Robotonia Revolution</i>
<i>could have been avoided.</i>

355
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:15,915
<i>As we move forward,</i>

356
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:18,849
<i>we must learn</i>
<i>from our past mistakes</i>

357
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:22,782
<i>and make changes</i>
<i>to improve our future.</i>

358
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:26,515
<i>Above all, we must be</i>
<i>willing to forgive.</i>

359
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:37,949
I speak now on behalf
of all humankind,

360
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:40,515
when I hereby declare

361
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:44,015
<i>that robots are no longer</i>
<i>tools for man.</i>

362
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:48,049
They are our equals,
our partners

363
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:50,515
and our friends.

364
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:53,382
And they are here to stay,

365
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:56,982
to share this wonderful
planet with us.
