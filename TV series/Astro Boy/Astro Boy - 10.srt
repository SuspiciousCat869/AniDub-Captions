Beloved captain,
we now go to do our duty

317
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:56,783
and fulfill the dreams
of mankind.

318
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:59,216
Yes, go and make me proud.

319
00:18:05,816 --> 00:18:08,649
Helen, I'm sorry the Ministry
scrubbed the Venus mission.

320
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:10,616
I know it meant a lot.

321
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,283
Once my robots reach
the ocean floor,

322
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:13,816
their memories
will be erased

323
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:16,516
and they'll never know how
great they could have been.

<i>they were human,</i>

Farewell,
<i>all my beautiful friends.</i>

327

Surely, they understand now.

<i>Don't be fooled.</i>

Don't listen to them.
I am your captain.

334
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,683
No, our captain would not
ask us to harm humans.
