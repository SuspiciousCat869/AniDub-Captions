Oh, I get it.

This is where it keeps
all those robot minds.

There you are, Astro.

A little misunderstanding
back there.

Hey, what do you say
we head on outta here
and grab a soda?

343
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:30,357
Take my hand!

Erasabot, stop right there and
listen to me!

Ain't no use trying
to reason with him.

348
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:53,524
He can't think
for himself.

That was
the whole point.

We'll see about that!

Maybe it'll
spit us out.

All right, Erasabot. I'll
give you some of my brainpower.

Oh, Astro, you're back.

Uh, what did you do to make
the Erasabot back down?

375
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,924
He just needed
to think for himself.

So I gave him a piece
of my mind, Dr. O'Shay.

No! It was him!

They really are much more

You taught me
