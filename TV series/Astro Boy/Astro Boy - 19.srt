319
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,474
We might be able to use
the coolant in the pipes

320
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:40,408
to put out the fires, but it's
going to take a lot of force.

321
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:41,641
The Blue Knight!

322
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:42,641
Hmm.

323
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:55,641
ROBOT:
All right!

324
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:57,674
ROBOT 2:
The plan worked!

325
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,308
We did it!

326
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:01,374
We'll be able to launch
the shuttle now.

327
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,508
Almost time for Hydra
to go kablooie.

328
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,674
Hey, boss?

329
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,741
Where'd you go?

330
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,574
JASPER:
Everyone's on board.

331
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:14,608
Okay, Jasper!

332
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:15,808
Hit it!

333
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:18,674
Opening the gateway now!

334
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,974
All systems
now ready for launch.

335
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:23,874
Gravity system disengaged.

336
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:26,308
Firing the main engines.

337
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:30,274
Hey, isn't that--?

338
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:32,274
<i>Mr. Donner?</i>

Those robots
aren't going anywhere.

00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:52,574
Not as long as they know

343
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:54,841
that I'm the one who's
responsible for this meltdown!

344
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:57,274
You will have
to deal with me now.

345
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:58,641
Let's rocket!

346
00:15:58,674 --> 00:15:59,774
Rocket this!

347
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:03,274
That all you've got?

348
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:04,274
Grrr!

349
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:10,674
You will pay!

No! Don't!

351
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,274
Argh!

00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:18,707
ASTRO:
No!

00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:21,074
Aah!

00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:26,974
JASPER:
The shuttle
hit the docking bay!

355
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,641
He must be hurt!

356
00:16:28,674 --> 00:16:30,307
Jasper, we need
to get out of here!

357
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:32,007
I know!
That's not the way!

358
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,774
But I've got
to help Donner.

359
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:35,241
But he's responsible
for all this!

360
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:51,841
Ugh.

361
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:52,841
JASPER:
Mr. Donner!

362
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:54,074
Huh?

363
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:55,907
Jasper?

364
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:57,107
You're alive!

365
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,841
But not for long.

366
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:01,774
So, did you come here
to say goodbye?

367
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:02,974
No, sir.

368
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:04,007

371
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,174
He's hurt bad!

372
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:11,107
Ugh.

373
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:12,274
BLUE KNIGHT:
Don't move him.

374
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:14,841
These humans are
extremely fragile.

375
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:18,874
ASTRO:
But he's really hurt

376
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,141
and there's a crack
in the boot of his spacesuit.

377
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:24,074
If we don't get him to a doctor
soon, he's not going to make it.

00:17:31,874 --> 00:17:33,774
Forget about me.

00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:36,307
Just get out of here
while you still can!

383
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:38,274
Listen, just give me
the password

384
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,307
and you can save all of us
and yourself.

DONNER:
I'm nothing but a criminal now.

386
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,674
I'm going to lose everything.

387
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:47,341
But you still have
one thing left, Mr. Donner.

388
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:48,907
You've still got your life.

We serve you and protect you.

Even when it gets hard,
we still do it with pride.

392

I don't understand humans.

393
00:17:57,974 --> 00:18:00,974
Do a good thing now.
Make up for your crime.

why would anyone have to

We're here for the human!

414
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:32,174
He needs a shuttle, doesn't he?

415
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:36,141
Sir, it's time to go.

416
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:39,274
Back home to Earth
with all of us.

Great teamwork,

understand my fight?

00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:08,007
What?

00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,241
We saved the robots
this time,

but there are other humans out
there determined to destroy us.

You can't continue
to fight for both sides.

423

Next time, I won't
hold anything back.

00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:21,707
And I won't let you
or anyone else stop me.
