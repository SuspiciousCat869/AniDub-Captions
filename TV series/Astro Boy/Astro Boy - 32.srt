00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:38,576
Now, you really need
to control that anger!

329
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:40,142
You're right!

330
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:43,309
And I know just what
would make me feel better!

331
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:53,442
TENMA:
Finally, it comes to this.

332
00:18:53,476 --> 00:18:56,209
Pluto has defeated all the
world's strongest robots

333
00:18:56,242 --> 00:18:59,476
and gained
each of their powers.

334
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:01,576
Now he brings them
all to bear on Astro,

335
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,542
who will evolve
or be destroyed!

336
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:16,876
Astro's gotten even stronger!

337
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:17,976
You see!

338
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:19,376
Astro is evolving!

339
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:24,076

340
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:29,842
Some day, we'll rule the world,
together.

341
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:31,909
Dr. Tenma?

342
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:33,576
We will rule.

343
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:35,942
That is the reason
I built you.

344
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:43,909
I will see you soon,

345
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:46,042
<i>Astro.</i>

346
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:53,809
Astro,
your evolution is complete.

347
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:07,842
Shadow, have you reviewed
the data that I sent you?

348
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:09,409
I have.

349
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,076
It seems you were right
about Astro.

350
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,376
All the pieces are in place

351
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:14,876
for Astro to fight alongside us.

352
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,909
He is the leader
you have always hoped for.

353
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:20,809
I'm glad we have come
to this understanding.

354
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:23,409
Now we wait for the humans
to make the first move.

355
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:26,242
Until that time, I will
assemble our robot armies,

356
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:29,942
ready for the first sign
of war.

357
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:39,309
The time has come.

358
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:43,209
