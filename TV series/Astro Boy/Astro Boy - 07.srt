323
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:13,755
Astro, I'm proud of you too.

324
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:15,655
Thanks.

325
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,722
Doctor, do you think there will
always be people in this world

326
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:20,389
who hate robots?

327
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:23,889
I hope not, Astro.

328
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:28,022
You fools. If we let robots
remain free, we're all doomed.

329
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:30,655
They're going to take over
the entire world.

330
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:37,789
Katari was part of
an anti-robot group.

331
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:39,889
This won't be the last
we hear of them.

332
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:44,322
As long as I've got
Grandpa and the vege-bots,

333
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:45,689
we can start over.

334
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:47,655
Yeah, you'll do just fine, Mimi.

335
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:49,689
Astro, I'm sorry.

336
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,355
Why?

337
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:55,522
What I said about robots
not having hearts.

338
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:57,955
I think you have a heart
as big as Grandpa's tomatoes.

339
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,022
Thanks.

340
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:01,955
Wow. Look at that rainbow.

341
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,989
It's beautiful.

342
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:13,089
Let's go take a look.

343
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:14,889
Huh?

344
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,322
[MIMI GIGGLING]

345
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:22,522
Astro...

346
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:27,689
This is the absolute best way
to see a rainbow.

347
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:29,989
Hang on.

348
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,822
