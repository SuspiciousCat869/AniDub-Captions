Astro!

317
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:58,541
All right, Neon Express.
From here on,

318
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:01,243
it's just us robots.
I'm with you, Astro.

319
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:03,245
Okay, let's track down
that hyper-virus.

320
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:05,379
We've already looked everywhere.

321
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:07,448
I'm afraid it's hopeless
to search further.

322
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:10,250
But we have to find it.
It's the only chance we have.

323
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:12,418
There's one other way, Astro.

324
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:14,786
At the next curve,
I can shift my weight

325
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:16,888
and crash in a place
where no one will be hurt.

326
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:19,457
I'm not important.
It's the people that matter.

327
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,859
No way! We're gonna save you
and the people.

328
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:23,560
Now let's do another search.

329
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:26,796
But the parasite's hidden
where it can't be identified.

330
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:28,364
That's what
the clown said.

<i>will never find.</i>

Hey, that's it.

336
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:41,140
There's one place
that a scanner can't scan.

337
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:43,275
Whoa!

338
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,911
It can't scan itself.

339
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:49,480
So the hyper-virus must be
inside the scanner.

We've cleared the tunnel
