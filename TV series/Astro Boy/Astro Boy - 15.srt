ASTRO:
No problem.

Hey, there's a whole network
of underground tunnels.

38

If poison got in there, it'd
spread across the whole area.

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
But those tunnels would also

40
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,166

for dragons.

ASTRO: Just kidding.

I wanted to make sure
you were paying attention.

43

O'SHAY:
Now, that's enough
nonsense about dragons.

44
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,533
The point is this needs
immediate attention.

it stirred up the lake.

318
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:20,710
That's what brought it
to the surface.

319
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,676
Did you
find something?

320
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,843
Well, what is it? Oh!

321
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,976
That's him,
isn't it?

322
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,610
My father.

323
00:19:33,643 --> 00:19:35,976
I thought he forgot about me
when he went away,

324
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,376
but he was thinking
about me all along.

325
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,810
I guess he built this ship
to look like a dragon

326
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,010
so he'd blend in
with the real dragons.

327
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:45,576
Too bad there aren't
any real dragons.

328
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,810
But he followed his dream...

329
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:49,876
to the end.

330
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:57,010
GULLIVER:
Astro, I think it's time

331
00:19:57,043 --> 00:20:00,643
for me to give up my hunting
and start a new life.

332
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,910
Are you going to go back
to the city, Gulliver?

333
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,343
Uh-uh.

334
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:07,976
I wanna help clean up
wilderness areas like this.

335
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,110
Instead of inventing traps
to catch UMAs,

336
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,943
I'll build machines
to protect nature.

337
00:20:11,976 --> 00:20:12,976
You never know,

338
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,343
one of my inventions
might actually work some day.

339
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:19,110
Could you use some help
from a friend?

340
00:20:19,143 --> 00:20:21,610
You bet!

341
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:25,043
Too bad there weren't
any dragons here after all.

342
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:26,976
It was a great dream.

343
00:20:39,676 --> 00:20:40,743
