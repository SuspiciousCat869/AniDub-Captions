00:19:38,096 --> 00:19:40,766
Sorry, but the audience
isn't allowed on the field.

321
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,369
Rules are rules.

322
00:19:42,402 --> 00:19:45,773
Harley.
Back to your old self, I see.

323
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:49,045
Astro, look what you did.

TENMA:
<i>Ah, yes, very impressive.</i>

327
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:04,366
<i>Tobio, you are the most</i>
<i>powerful robot ever built.</i>

328
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:09,306
The humans love you.
But will they always?

329
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,214
<i>Or will they turn their backs</i>
<i>on you someday?</i>

330
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:17,081
This is far from over.

331
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:22,881
Huh. Hm.

332
00:20:25,414 --> 00:20:26,847
Hmm.

333
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:28,214
Tenma's work.

334
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:33,881
O'SHAY:
When are you going to realize
he's not Tobio anymore?

335
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:37,214
He's Astro!
