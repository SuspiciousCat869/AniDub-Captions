She's probably looking for me,

When things get weird,
he's always around.

So this

Look, my watch here

00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:17,469
Skunk must have sent in

Astro, look at this map.

284
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:22,536
This is the route
the magnetic robot took

00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:23,602
for the first robbery,

286
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:25,602
and this route
to access the bank.

287
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:28,736
In both cases, the distance
the magno-bot traveled

288
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,469
was exactly the same.

289
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:31,969
Obviously, Skunk is no dummy.

290
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,336
He doesn't want to be
anywhere near the crime scene.

291
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:37,002
So he starts each caper
as far away as he possibly can

292
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:38,836
and still control
the magno-bot.

293

he's going to commit
