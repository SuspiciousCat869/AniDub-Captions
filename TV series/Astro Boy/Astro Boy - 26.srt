Listen, Matthew,
when I was your age,

165
00:08:58,732 --> 00:09:00,765
I lived in a make-believe world,
just like you.

166
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:05,232
I used to build
model spaceships,

167
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:08,565
<i>and I dreamed of flying</i>
<i>all the way to the stars.</i>

168
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,599
<i>But then my father told me</i>
<i>it was time to stop pretending</i>

169
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:19,065
<i>and stop dreaming.</i>

170
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:23,999
<i>Instead of building models,</i>
<i>I studied books.</i>

171
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:27,532
And he said to be a pilot like
<i>him, I'd have to train hard</i>

172
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:29,265
<i>and learn discipline.</i>

173
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:34,299
<i>My father wanted me</i>
<i>to be the best,</i>

174
00:09:34,332 --> 00:09:36,899
<i>and I didn't wanna</i>
<i>disappoint him.</i>

175
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:44,999
That's how I became a pilot,
Matthew, through hard work.

176
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:48,699
Not by dreaming.
But--

177
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:50,632
No "buts." It's time for you

178
00:09:50,665 --> 00:09:52,165
to quit playing robot,
young man.

179
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:56,165
Stop daydreaming,
and stay away from robots.

180
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:59,065
Mom, can I go and see
your space launch tomorrow?

However, the system
is completely theoretical.

00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:34,699
It's never actually been tried.
Reno, can you run the demo?

That's neat. But how'd
they figure it all out?

233
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:58,865
The calculations were
too complex

234

for our
normal computers.

235
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:03,299
So they had to install
a new number-crunching system,

236

but there's no backup.

Reno, can you run those numbers
by me again from the beginning?

look right.

239

00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:20,848
Matthew.

323
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:21,848
[GRUNTING]

324
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:32,181
There they are! We're gonna
have to do this really quick.

325
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:33,948
Let's rocket!

326
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:41,414
Come on!

327
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:54,548
Ha-ha-ha!
All right! He did it!

328
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:56,514
Whew. That was close.

329
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:03,981
Matthew.

330
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:15,781
Ha-ha-ha!

331
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:19,214
I put a new thruster in it.
What do you think?

332
00:19:19,248 --> 00:19:21,014
Not bad.

333
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,048
ERICA:
Matthew...

334
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:26,314
are you ready
for a special birthday present?

335
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,148
It's for me?

336
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,248
That's right. Dario.

337
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:35,981
BOTH:
Hi, Matthew. Happy birthday.
I love parties.

338
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:39,081
Jig and Gyro. All right!

339
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:41,181
They can talk and move
and stuff.

340
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:44,014
You showed me
how much fun robots can be.

341
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:46,048
I've been working
on them all week.

342
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:49,481
You're the best, Mom.
You really surprised me.

343
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:54,981
Matthew, you have
a big imagination.

344
00:19:55,014 --> 00:19:57,781
Your dreams will take you
a long way in life.

345
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,014
Don't ever lose them.

346
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:07,214
Astro, I hope you'll
be Matthew's friend

347
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,314
for a long time.

348
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:11,248
Yeah! Uh-huh.

349
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:12,814
ZORAN:
Momo. Momo,

350
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:15,148
you come back here!

351
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,781
I'm gonna get you!

352
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:18,381
Ha-ha-ha!

353
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:21,814
Uh, sorry, my sister
gets carried away.

354
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:23,148
She's under attack.

355
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,014
My robo-rescue functions
will save her

356
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:27,281
from the evil bird-monster.

357
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:31,381
Let's rocket!

358
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:32,848
Ha-ha-ha!

359
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,481
All right!
Catch him!

360
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:36,148
Get him!

361
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,481
Go on, Zoran!

362
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:41,414
