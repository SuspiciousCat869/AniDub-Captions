I will depart with the robots
who remain in Robotonia.

324
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,073
We will find our own future.

325
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:10,740
What do you mean,
"your own future"?

Shadow, I now understand
your words!

327
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,506
It's time for us to carry out
your ultimate plan!

328
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,273
Huh?

Robotonia. It looks like...

333
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,573
some kind of spacecraft!

334
00:17:56,306 --> 00:17:58,540
The Blue Knight thought
he needed a backup plan,

335
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:01,440
so he secretly constructed
a gigantic ship.

336
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:04,406
A flying city?
Yes.

337
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,206
He and the remaining robots must
be planning to leave the Earth

338
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,706
and search for an ideal homeland
somewhere off in outer space.

00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:15,773
Should we authorize an attack
against their ship?

341
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:20,606
Robotonia no longer poses
any threat to humanity.

342

Welcome, Pluto, Atlas.

Goodbye, Blue Knight,
and good luck.

345
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,173
Huh?

346
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:37,606
What is that?

347
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,740
They're only leaving
to strengthen their forces.

348
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:46,073
Then they'll return to Earth
to exterminate mankind!

349
00:18:46,106 --> 00:18:47,673
We cannot let them escape!
