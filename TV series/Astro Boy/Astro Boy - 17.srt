I'll be there to testify

333
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,512
that you also came up
with the antidote.

334
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:22,379
Is there anything else
you want to say before we go?

335
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:24,646
Okay.

336
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:27,746
I'll tell the professor that
you're grateful for his help.

337
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:29,646
What?

338
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,446
Right!
"Don't make it too sappy."

339
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:32,512
Got it!

340
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:43,946
