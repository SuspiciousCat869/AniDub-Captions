Catch ya later!

Hey, guys. I sort of
lost track of time there.

00:19:49.612 --> 00:19:50.781
[GOKU]
Gohan, where's your mom?

00:19:50.814 --> 00:19:52.183
--[CHICHI] I'm right here!
--[GOKU shrieks]

Who do you think you are?

00:19:53.553 --> 00:19:55.322
Rushing in here
sweating and filthy,

00:19:55.356 --> 00:19:57.728
just as everyone else
is leaving the party!

00:19:57.761 --> 00:19:59.164
Uh, yeah, about that.

00:19:59.197 --> 00:20:01.569
I really did mean to
get here earlier, but--

00:20:01.602 --> 00:20:02.571
Sorry!

00:20:02.604 --> 00:20:05.176
[CHICHI grunts]
Well, it's not like it's

00:20:05.209 --> 00:20:06.913
the first time
you've missed a party.

00:20:06.946 --> 00:20:09.017
I couldn't have stayed
your wife all these years

00:20:09.051 --> 00:20:11.488
if I let every small thing
set me off.

00:20:11.523 --> 00:20:14.829
--[BOTH chuckle]
--[CHICHI] Have you eaten today?

00:20:14.862 --> 00:20:17.535
Oh, for Pete's sake, Goku.
You're so forgetful!

00:20:17.568 --> 00:20:19.337
But I can't let you starve.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.041
Bulma, you mind
giving me a hand?

00:20:21.074 --> 00:20:22.578
[BULMA]
Where's the help?

00:20:22.611 --> 00:20:25.083
[GOTEN]
So, did they hatch?!

00:20:25.116 --> 00:20:26.151
Yeah!

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:27.822
So, what was it
about these eggs?

00:20:27.855 --> 00:20:28.890
Why was it a big deal?

00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:31.529
Well, there was
a pterosaur nest on a cliff

00:20:31.562 --> 00:20:34.568
with four eggs
that were about to hatch.

00:20:42.016 --> 00:20:43.252

Dad, who was cuter
when they were born:

00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:04.829
the dinos or me?

00:21:04.862 --> 00:21:07.802
I can't answer that one.
I mean, seriously, Goten,

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:10.339
when you were born,
I was dead in Other World!

Hm? Hey! Come on, Vegeta!

Cheer up and join the party!

00:21:18.656 --> 00:21:21.427
You're missing out
on all this great food!

[NARRATOR]
Ever since he was a boy,

00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:27.541
something about Goku has
always brightened a room.

00:21:27.575 --> 00:21:30.714
His mere presence brings
smiles to his friends,

00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:33.452
making them feel better
about themselves.

00:21:33.485 --> 00:21:36.392
Whether on the battlefield
or at the dinner table,

00:21:36.425 --> 00:21:39.463
he truly is number one.

Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:49.738
And you're about to see ten
whole years into the future!

00:22:49.772 --> 00:22:52.009
It's tournament time,
and I'm especially concerned

00:22:52.042 --> 00:22:54.480
about a new fighter,
so I'm entering, too,

00:22:54.515 --> 00:22:56.417
along with my
granddaughter, Pan!

[BULMA]
What? She can't fight!

00:22:58.155 --> 00:22:59.692
She's only four years old!

[GOKU]
Next time, on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

[GOHAN]
I wonder who the fighter is

00:23:07.206 --> 00:23:08.876
that Dad's so anxious about?
