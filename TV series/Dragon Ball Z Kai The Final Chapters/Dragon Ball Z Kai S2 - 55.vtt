The monster

a simpleminded butterball is
now as smart as he is strong!

The merging of Vegeta

I think Vegetto has a nice ring.

Honestly, I was worried
about how this would work,

than I thought possible.

Aw, poor baby. Well,
you won't be happy to hear

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.415
that that was just
a fraction of my powers!

Heh. Well that was fun.
But I hope it'll take

it would've deprived me
of my great victory.

Heh. I will admit, you are
clearly more powerful as one

Of course I'm stronger.
Far stronger, in fact.

Strong enough to
destroy you all by myself.

enough of your arrogance!

to rip your whole planet apart.

You're so proud
of your new power--

it's enough to stop this,

I'd suggest you
get out of the way.

once this hits the ground,

Buu can't even
defend himself from Vegetto!

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:36.172
Oh, wow! I never thought
the Potara would work this well!

00:15:36.205 --> 00:15:38.877
Well, don't give the earrings
all the credit, dummy.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.514
The Potara
aren't what's important.

00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:41.716
It's who uses them!

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.954
We've been watching
three of the greatest warriors

00:15:43.987 --> 00:15:46.291
to ever exist in the Living
World or Otherworld,

00:15:46.324 --> 00:15:48.128
and now two have
combined into one.

00:15:48.162 --> 00:15:50.266
And the fact they've been
fighting each other for years

00:15:50.299 --> 00:15:52.303
only makes the union stronger.

00:15:52.337 --> 00:15:55.544
Their rivalry seems so small
and petty in retrospect.

00:15:55.577 --> 00:15:57.681
Anyway, the earth is saved.

00:15:57.715 --> 00:16:00.587
No, the universe is saved!

all out of trash talk?

[SUPER BUU groaning]

[VEGETTO] This isn't even
fun anymore. It's just sad.

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:41.267
You could at least
put in some effort.

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:43.072
Or is this pathetic
fighting display

00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:44.675
already the best
you have to offer?

00:16:44.709 --> 00:16:47.715
If that's the case, then I'm
sorry for being hard on you.

I don't care how
powerful you've become,

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.319
there's no way you're
sending back this meal!

00:17:40.353 --> 00:17:41.856
Say your prayers, Vegetto!

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:46.197
I'm about to begin destroying
your body from the inside out!

00:17:56.786 --> 00:17:59.626
You're the one who
should be saying his prayers.

I can't move
around your body anymore.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:52.865
Of course you can't move.

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:54.133
I'm using some of my energy

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:56.271
to keep you bottled up
in that one tiny spot.

As long as you're in my body,

you'll be nothing more
than a giant back pimple.

stay there or fight?

And disappointing

that after all the people
you absorbed,

00:19:20.921 --> 00:19:22.323
that was your big move.

our final showdown, Buu.

disappointed you?!
