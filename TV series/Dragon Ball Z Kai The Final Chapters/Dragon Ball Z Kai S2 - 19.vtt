00:00:06.714 --> 00:00:09.485
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.355
to reach the heart
of Babidi's ship,

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.126
Goku and the others
have been forced

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.999
to fight their way down,
level by level.

00:00:16.032 --> 00:00:18.203
Vegeta dominated in Stage One;

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:21.242
while in Stage Two,
Goku gave the ravenous Yakon

00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:23.013
too much of a good thing!

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:25.585
Stage Three begins now!

00:00:26.186 --> 00:00:31.395
♪ Opening Song ♪

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.516
That was incredible, Dad!

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.723
You really hit that monster with
everything you had, didn't you?

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:09.092
Oh, I dunno.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.463
[VEGETA] That darn Kakarot's
actually done it!

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:14.268
He's broken through
the Super Saiyan barrier!

00:02:14.302 --> 00:02:15.572
[BABIDI]
Aaaah!

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:19.379
What just happened, Dabura?
Why did he pop?

00:02:19.412 --> 00:02:21.282
What did he do to my Yakon?

00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:22.719
Yakon was a fool.

00:02:22.752 --> 00:02:25.959
He has nobody to blame for
his destruction but himself.

00:02:25.992 --> 00:02:28.330
In his gluttony,
he devoured more energy

00:02:28.363 --> 00:02:29.633
than his body could handle.

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:33.039
Yes, but how?
Yakon's appetite was legendary!

00:02:33.072 --> 00:02:36.312
How could a mere Earthling have
made a predator of his caliber

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:39.218
burst like an
overinflated balloon?

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:42.057
Those three are stronger
than I could have imagined

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.128
and I lured them onto my ship!

00:02:44.162 --> 00:02:46.299
Master, don't be alarmed.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.706
Allow your faithful servant
to set your mind at ease.

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.510
[BABIDI]
Huh?

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:56.453
Hmph! I, myself,
will proceed up to level three

00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:57.822
and be their next opponent.

00:02:57.856 --> 00:02:59.993
Majin Buu's ball will
be filled with their energy

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:02.198
soon enough, Babidi--
I guarantee it.

00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:03.767
There's nothing to fear.

00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:05.370
Oh, nothing to fear, huh?

00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:06.774
If they do manage to beat you,

00:03:06.807 --> 00:03:09.245
I'll be completely
defenseless down here!

00:03:09.278 --> 00:03:11.149
Are you absolutely sure
that you'll win?

00:03:11.182 --> 00:03:13.554
That I am.
[chuckles]

00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:16.660
For I am Dabura,
King of the Demon World.

00:03:16.694 --> 00:03:20.033
No matter how many kilis of
power they're able to muster,

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:21.369
they will fall at my feet

00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:24.976
and beg for mercy
before I am finished!

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.346
[GOKU] I wonder
who or what's gonna

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.851
come charging out this time.

00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:30.420
Hey, Gohan.

00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:32.024
Get ready. You're up next.

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:33.259
Goku, wait!

00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:35.230
This isn't the World
Martial Arts Tournament!

00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:37.501
Babidi's minions are some of
the strongest warriors

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:40.575
the universe has ever seen,
and if you lose, that's it!

00:03:40.608 --> 00:03:43.146
Fighting them one-on-one
has worked out so far but,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.685
from now on,
let's face them together!

00:03:45.718 --> 00:03:48.824
Well, I don't think we need
to go as far as all that.

00:03:48.858 --> 00:03:51.096
Besides, it just wouldn't
be right, y'know?

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.799
It wouldn't?

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:56.138
No. I mean, Vegeta and I
got to fight our matches alone,

00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:58.644
so it'd be wrong not to
let Gohan have his turn.

00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:01.415
[GOHAN] And whoever they send,
I can take 'em, no sweat!

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.856
Don't worry about me,
Supreme Kai!

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.531
[GOHAN grunts]

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:10.935
All right! I'm ready to go!

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.980
Well? What are you
waiting for? Do it!

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:20.888
After I'm done with them,
only their energy will remain!

00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:23.594
[UNDERLING 19A] Uh. Wait!
Where are you going, Dabura?

00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:26.298
The passageway to the upper
levels is on this side!

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:28.670
[BABIDI]
Don't question his methods.

00:04:29.773 --> 00:04:32.377
The meditation room?

00:04:33.112 --> 00:04:34.883
[DABURA]
Ha!

00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:36.620
Oh, I get it! Dabura's going to

00:04:36.654 --> 00:04:40.460
boost his energy even higher
before he takes them on!

00:04:41.563 --> 00:04:44.970
[electric motor hums]
[BABIDI laughs]

00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:48.276
Listen well. Dabura is
not to be disturbed in there.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.280
He'll come out
when he's ready to.

00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:51.750
Right!

00:04:51.784 --> 00:04:54.221
[BABIDI] He's getting himself
into the proper frame of mind.

00:04:54.255 --> 00:04:56.527
Once Dabura
sets himself to the task,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.733
I'm sure he'll deal with
our guests easily enough.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:02.505
[laughs]

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.580
[GOHAN] Whoever it is, they're
sure taking their time in there.

00:05:06.614 --> 00:05:08.518
Try not to get antsy, son.

00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:10.219
I'm sure they're getting
some real hotshot

00:05:10.253 --> 00:05:12.123
all prepped and ready
to face you.

00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:13.259
[GOHAN]
Yeah.

00:05:13.293 --> 00:05:14.730
Y'know, I wonder
what's been going on

00:05:14.763 --> 00:05:16.600
at the World Martial Arts
Tournament since we left.

00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:19.338
It did lose a lot
of contestants all at once.

00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:20.908
Augh! I can't believe
you convinced me

00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:23.413
to leave the tournament behind
for this, Kakarot.

00:05:23.447 --> 00:05:25.083
I should be fighting you,

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.254
not these intergalactic
pushovers!

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:28.724
[GOHAN]
He's got a point.

00:05:28.758 --> 00:05:30.695
I was looking forward to taking
a crack at you, too, Dad.

00:05:30.728 --> 00:05:33.567
[GOKU] Yeah, same here.
Oh well, maybe next time.

00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:35.605
At least Android 18
is still in it.

00:05:35.638 --> 00:05:37.608
[SUPREME KAI] These Saiyans
are unbelievable.

00:05:37.642 --> 00:05:40.480
All they seem to care about
is the thrill of the fight.

00:05:40.515 --> 00:05:43.120
They have no regard
for danger at all!

00:05:43.153 --> 00:05:44.956
[CROWD cheers, chatters]

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.893
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies and
gentlemen, I have an update!

00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:49.599
If you could please just
quiet down for a second!

00:05:49.632 --> 00:05:51.870
Now, since we don't
quite know what's going on,

00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:53.339
we're gonna take
a little break while

00:05:53.372 --> 00:05:55.243
we get all of this sorted out!

00:05:55.277 --> 00:05:56.813
[MAN 19A]
"Sorted out," huh?

00:05:56.846 --> 00:05:57.615
Get on with it!

00:05:57.648 --> 00:06:00.654
Hey, announcer! I'll fight you!

00:06:01.657 --> 00:06:03.359
[GOTEN] Aw, we don't
get to fight yet.

00:06:03.392 --> 00:06:05.898
And I was all ready
for us to do our thing.

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:08.269
If your big brother hadn't
lost to those weirdos,

00:06:08.303 --> 00:06:10.140
the tournament would
still be going on!

00:06:10.173 --> 00:06:11.710
[GOTEN]
Stop talking bad about Gohan!

00:06:11.744 --> 00:06:13.179
Well, if he hadn't just
stood there and let them

00:06:13.213 --> 00:06:15.050
stab him, we'd be
fighting right now!

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:18.256
[GOTEN] If you're looking
for a fight, you've got one!

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.225
[TRUNKS]
Hey!

00:06:19.258 --> 00:06:20.326
[GOTEN]
Come here right now!

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.863
[TRUNKS]
Stop it!

00:06:21.896 --> 00:06:24.803
[TRUNKS grunting,
GOTEN shouting]

00:06:24.836 --> 00:06:26.740
[BOTH yell]

00:06:27.642 --> 00:06:28.711
[MAN 19B]
What was that?

00:06:28.744 --> 00:06:30.047
[MAN 19C]
Somebody fall?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.188
[GOTEN, TRUNKS groan]

00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:36.025
Oh my gosh--
it's Mighty Mask!

00:06:36.058 --> 00:06:37.696
Hey, are you okay?

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.464
[groans]

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.235
[MONK 19A]
Is anything broken?

00:06:41.268 --> 00:06:43.406
Hey! Don't worry,
we're fine! Heh!

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:46.580
[GOTEN] He means
"I'm fine! I'm fine!" Ow!

00:06:46.613 --> 00:06:48.182
[TRUNKS]
That was on purpose!

00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:49.351
[GOTEN]
Watch what you're saying!

00:06:49.384 --> 00:06:50.622
[TRUNKS]
Watch where you're going!

00:06:50.655 --> 00:06:52.625
The waiting must be
making him anxious.

00:06:58.002 --> 00:07:00.373
[MONK 19B] We should tell the
other fighters about the delay.

00:07:00.406 --> 00:07:02.144
[GOTEN]
Can I stop walking?

00:07:02.178 --> 00:07:03.346
Why?

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:04.583
[GOTEN] I'm kinda getting
thirsty, Trunks.

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:05.985
I wanna take a break.

00:07:06.018 --> 00:07:07.689
Okay. Let's do it.

00:07:07.722 --> 00:07:09.626
I know I've got it
easier up here,

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:12.030
but doing this
is wearing me out.

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:13.900
Take a right, Goten!

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:17.742
[TRUNKS]
That way!

00:07:20.948 --> 00:07:23.587
Oh, right.
I should tell Mighty Mask

00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:26.158
that we're in a bit of
a holding pattern right now.

00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:28.195
[TRUNKS]
Hard left! There ya go!

the coast is clear.

[GOTEN] Come on, Trunks!
Get off my shoulders already!

00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:50.775
[TRUNKS]
Don't rush me!

It's enough to make

Y'know, I'd love to get
past you if you don't mind.

Hold on. You two?

You're that kid Trunks,
and you're Goten, right?

Uh. Y-Yes, sir!

00:08:43.112 --> 00:08:44.816
[ANNOUNCER] Sorry, but this
lounge is for contestants

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.485
who are still
actively competing.

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:48.356
We, uh. We didn't
mean to trespass!

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:51.563
We just wanted to try an' get
Mr. Satan's autograph.

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.066
That's right! We sure did!

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.903
Hmmm. That sounds legit.

00:08:54.936 --> 00:08:56.540
And you did well
in the junior division,

00:08:56.573 --> 00:08:58.176
so I guess I'll let it slide.

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:00.079
[BOTH laugh nervously]

00:09:00.113 --> 00:09:03.019
Oh, I almost forgot.
Did you kids see Mighty Mask?

00:09:03.052 --> 00:09:05.490
I saw him duck in this room
a few moments ago.

00:09:05.525 --> 00:09:07.060
[BOTH]
Huh?!

00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.068
[ANNOUNCER] Isn't this
Mighty Mask's outfit?

00:09:11.102 --> 00:09:12.772
[TRUNKS]
Uhhh.

00:09:12.805 --> 00:09:14.542
He's gotta be
in here somewhere.

00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:18.817
Uh. Oh yeah.
About that. He's, uh...

00:09:18.851 --> 00:09:21.723
[ANNOUNCER] Hey, Mighty Mask!
Where're you keeping yourself?

00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:27.334
--[ANNOUNCER] Huh?
--[TRUNKS chuckles]

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:30.440
[ANNOUNCER] So, he's in the
shower. That makes sense.

00:09:30.473 --> 00:09:31.844
Mighty Mask!

00:09:31.877 --> 00:09:34.247
[GOTEN] What? I'm sorry, sir!
You can't go in there!

00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:37.387
His identity's a secret!
That means no peeking!

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.224
[ANNOUNCER]
Mm. Oh. Good call.

00:09:39.257 --> 00:09:41.095
Fighters who hide their face
get pretty weird

00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:43.600
about folks seeing
what's under the disguise.

00:09:43.634 --> 00:09:45.237
It's cool. I'm hip.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.573
[sighs]

00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:48.644
[ANNOUNCER] I came in here
to tell you something!

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:50.280
Can you hear me?

00:09:50.313 --> 00:09:52.150
Aaah!

00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:53.520
Yeah! Go ahead!

00:09:53.554 --> 00:09:55.223
Ah, well, then.
We're not sure when

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:56.860
the tournament's going
to start up again,

00:09:56.894 --> 00:09:59.432
so make sure you stick
around the arena, okay?

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:01.402
Fine. I'll stick around.

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:03.206
--Ain't he great?
--Uh!

00:10:03.239 --> 00:10:04.509
[laughs]

00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:05.912
[ANNOUNCER]
That's that.

00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:08.750
And you two, don't bother
Mighty Mask once he's out.

00:10:08.784 --> 00:10:10.053
[TRUNKS]
Right!

00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:13.125
[BOTH laugh, sigh]

00:10:13.158 --> 00:10:14.796
[CROWD chatter]

00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:16.900
The ones that left have
been gone for an hour now.

00:10:16.933 --> 00:10:18.436
We have to disqualify them.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.577
[MONK 19E] I know, but that only
leaves us with five contestants.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.049
[OX KING] Hey, everybody.
So, what did I miss?

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:27.454
Nothing yet. Goku and
the others still aren't back

00:10:27.487 --> 00:10:29.424
from wherever they flew off to.

00:10:29.457 --> 00:10:30.694
Why on Earth
did he have to leave

00:10:30.727 --> 00:10:32.330
in the middle of the tournament?

00:10:32.364 --> 00:10:33.634
[ROSHI]
Mmm. Wherever they are,

00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:35.905
something strange
is going on there.

00:10:35.938 --> 00:10:39.746
I'm picking up a lot of very
strong energies all in one spot.

00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:41.649
[YAMCHA]
Huh.

00:10:43.453 --> 00:10:44.622
Oh, check it out, Goten.

00:10:44.656 --> 00:10:46.191
The rest of
the fighters are here.

00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:48.128
[GOTEN] Good thing
we came back when we did!

00:10:48.162 --> 00:10:50.466
[MR. SATAN] Hmph! Those chumps
who left must've come down

00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:52.605
with a case of
Mister-Satan-itis!

00:10:52.638 --> 00:10:54.776
Hats off to you guys
who faced your fears

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.646
and stuck around,
not that it's gonna change

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.817
the outcome when
we fight or nuthin'.

00:10:58.851 --> 00:11:01.956
Oh, man! To hear that kind of
thing from you is an honor!

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.660
[TRUNKS]
Heh. It's just hot air!

00:11:03.693 --> 00:11:05.664
Wait! I got it!

00:11:05.697 --> 00:11:07.601
[CROWD cheers]

00:11:07.635 --> 00:11:09.506
You came to see
the best, didn't ya?

00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:11.008
Well as long as I'm still here,

00:11:11.042 --> 00:11:12.779
that's exactly what
you're gonna get--

00:11:12.812 --> 00:11:14.047
don't worry about that!

00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:16.452
You fine folks are
still gonna see a tourney

00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:18.489
to tell your grandkids about!

00:11:18.523 --> 00:11:19.626
[CROWD cheers]

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:21.395
Mr. Satan, you're such a giver!

00:11:21.428 --> 00:11:23.299
Oh, man! You're incredible!

00:11:23.332 --> 00:11:25.671
I can't wait to watch you fight!

00:11:25.704 --> 00:11:30.013
[MR. SATAN laughs]

00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:31.783
Don't look so worried,
you guys!

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:33.085
Better grab your umbrellas,

00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:35.323
'cause Mr. Satan
had a brainstorm!

00:11:35.356 --> 00:11:37.928
[MONK 19E] Okay! If you have
an idea, we'd love to hear it.

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:40.100
A battle royale
with who's left!

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:42.403
First, we disqualify
those chumps who ran away.

00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:44.776
Then we gather the remaining
fighters into the ring

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:46.747
to let us duke it out
all at the same time

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.182
for maximum awesomeness!

00:11:48.216 --> 00:11:50.019
It goes without saying
that a tournament with

00:11:50.052 --> 00:11:52.858
five people is pretty lame.
But a battle royale?

00:11:52.892 --> 00:11:56.700
The fans'll eat it up
sideways! Guaranteed!

00:11:56.734 --> 00:11:58.670
Ah! You're a genius!

00:11:58.704 --> 00:12:00.273
That's a great idea!

00:12:00.306 --> 00:12:01.843
Just one problem.

00:12:01.877 --> 00:12:02.912
[MR. SATAN]
Mm?

00:12:02.945 --> 00:12:04.783
If we do a
battle royale, then--

00:12:04.816 --> 00:12:06.953
Well, spit it out.
If you've got a problem

00:12:06.986 --> 00:12:09.425
with my brilliant idea,
just say it already.

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:10.594
No, I--!

00:12:10.627 --> 00:12:11.863
No. It's fine.

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:14.434
You think it's that bad
an idea, I'll head home.

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:15.737
I think it's wonderful, Champ!

00:12:15.771 --> 00:12:17.909
And the others all agree
with me--right, guys?

00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:20.548
Well, in that case,
blondie, go do your thing!

00:12:20.581 --> 00:12:21.784
Got it!

00:12:21.817 --> 00:12:23.118
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:12:23.152 --> 00:12:25.658
Thank you for waiting
so patiently out there!

00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:28.530
Right now, at Mr. Satan's
wise prompting,

00:12:28.564 --> 00:12:30.967
it was decided that
the five remaining contestants

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.707
will square off
in a battle royale!

00:12:33.741 --> 00:12:35.778
Everybody's fighting
at once, folks--

00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:37.548
and whoever's
the last one standing

00:12:37.581 --> 00:12:40.086
will be our tournament champion!

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.457
All right! That's my
kind of fighting!

00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:44.629
Muscles and brains! Oh my!

00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:46.265
Did he say
a battle royale?

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:49.572
But if they start things up
before Gohan and Goku get back,

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:51.008
then they're out of the running.

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.479
[ROSHI grunts] Well, I'm not
getting any younger here.

00:12:53.513 --> 00:12:54.816
And I'm not
getting any richer!

00:12:54.849 --> 00:12:57.321
We need that prize money, okay?

00:12:57.354 --> 00:12:58.288
[sighs]

00:12:58.322 --> 00:13:00.126
Our savings
could use some saving.

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:02.397
Y'know, I've got to
hand it to you, Mr. Satan--

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.604
it was really brave of you to
go with the battle royale idea.

00:13:05.637 --> 00:13:08.176
Most fighters find it too risky.

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:08.911
Risky?

00:13:08.944 --> 00:13:10.279
Exceedingly so, yeah!

00:13:10.313 --> 00:13:12.217
You have to assume
the other four contestants

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.420
will band together
to take you out first,

00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:17.294
since you're the reigning
champion and so heavily favored

00:13:17.327 --> 00:13:18.564
to win the tournament.

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:21.334
[laughs]

00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:23.172
If I let stuff like
that spook me,

00:13:23.205 --> 00:13:25.878
what the heck kind of fighting
master would I be, huh?

00:13:25.911 --> 00:13:27.948
Yeah, I guess you're right!

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.954
[MR. SATAN]
I didn't think of that!

00:13:43.446 --> 00:13:44.649
All right, tournament fans!

00:13:44.682 --> 00:13:47.186
Without further ado, let's
introduce the five fighters

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.257
taking part
in our battle royale!

00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:53.232
First up, you know him
and love him--Mr. Satan!

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:54.434
[CROWD cheers]

00:13:54.468 --> 00:13:57.809
[MR. SATAN] Okay, self,
put on your game-face!

00:13:57.842 --> 00:14:00.947
[MR. SATAN yells]

00:14:02.484 --> 00:14:04.856
[groans]

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:08.162
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:09.832
Next, the only woman competing

00:14:09.866 --> 00:14:11.235
in the World
Martial Arts Tournament!

00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:14.575
A lady with digits
for a name, it's Number 18!

00:14:14.609 --> 00:14:17.882
Oh! I give you a 9.5 baby!

00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:19.685
--[A18] Hmph!
--[OX KING] Go 18!

00:14:19.719 --> 00:14:20.854
Good luck!

00:14:20.888 --> 00:14:23.860
Hey, Mommy! You can do it!

00:14:23.894 --> 00:14:25.965
Next up,
a contestant who lost

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:27.869
in the first round
of the last tournament,

00:14:27.902 --> 00:14:30.641
it's Mighty Mask!

00:14:30.674 --> 00:14:32.110
Well, it's time to get in there!

00:14:32.143 --> 00:14:34.247
So, let's give 'em
a cool entrance!

00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:35.617
[GOTEN]
Yeah!

00:14:40.627 --> 00:14:41.897
[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
Wha--whoa!

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.432
[MAN 19H] Save it
for the fight, Mighty Mask!

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:45.336
Our fourth contestant
was eliminated

00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:47.708
in the second round
of the last tournament.

00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:49.377
It's Killa!

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.082
[MAN 19I]
Look at the arms on him!

00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:53.352
Now for our fifth
and final contestant.

00:14:53.385 --> 00:14:56.391
A man, who's a hit with
the ladies and came close

00:14:56.424 --> 00:14:59.799
to winning it all last time
around. It's Jewel!

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.536
[WOMAN 19C]
You're absolutely gorgeous!

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:03.038
I love you!

00:15:03.072 --> 00:15:05.410
[ANNOUNCER] These five titans
of the ring will square off

00:15:05.443 --> 00:15:07.180
in our battle royale!

00:15:07.213 --> 00:15:08.951
Who will be the first to fall?

00:15:08.984 --> 00:15:11.055
Who will be eliminated
late in the game?

00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:15.396
And who will tough it out
to win it all?

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.500
[chuckles]

00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:20.039
[grunts]

00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:22.811
Okay, it's about to start!

00:15:22.845 --> 00:15:23.980
[GOTEN] Wouldn't it
be neat if we won

00:15:24.013 --> 00:15:25.885
the adult category, too, Trunks?

00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:26.986
Yeah!

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:28.422
I know we gotta
fight each other,

00:15:28.455 --> 00:15:31.262
but let's knock Mr. Satan
out-of-bounds before we do.

00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:32.430
Sound good?

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:35.837
Yeah, whatever! I don't
need help knocking him out.

00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:37.240
The only one
you have to worry about

00:15:37.274 --> 00:15:39.645
is that Number 18. Right?

00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:40.914
[GOTEN]
Right!

00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:42.250
What is the deal
with that guy?

00:15:42.284 --> 00:15:44.555
He's a ventriloquist
or somethin'?

00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:48.229
Why, hello,
my scowling lovely.

00:15:48.262 --> 00:15:50.701
It is a shame for one
as beautiful as you

00:15:50.734 --> 00:15:53.206
to mar yourself with combat.

00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:56.846
After I win, how about
you and I grab a bite to eat?

00:15:56.879 --> 00:15:59.284
Take a hike.
You repulse me.

00:15:59.318 --> 00:16:01.990
[JEWEL] Eeh! What the--?
Did I just hear that right?

00:16:02.023 --> 00:16:03.727
I hope you're ready,
fight fans!

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.100
Because our five-man battle
royale championship match

00:16:07.134 --> 00:16:09.506
is mere seconds away
from starting up!

00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:11.543

Number 18!

00:16:16.853 --> 00:16:18.455
[JEWEL]
How dare she reject me?

00:16:18.489 --> 00:16:21.061
Doesn't she know how
irresistible I am?

00:16:21.094 --> 00:16:23.867
[KILLA] Mighty Mask think
he better than us, huh?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.236
Soon as the match starts up,

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:28.275
I'm feeding that guy
a knuckle-sandwich!

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.348
[CROWD]
Satan! Satan!

00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:34.054
[MR. SATAN] If you're gonna
gang up on me, then bring it on!

00:16:34.087 --> 00:16:37.293
I dare ya! I got four limbs!
One for each of ya!

00:16:37.326 --> 00:16:39.765

00:16:58.436 --> 00:17:01.174
What the--? I don't believe
what I'm seeing, folks!

00:17:01.207 --> 00:17:03.478
Just seconds into the match,
both Jewel and Killa

00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:06.152
were knocked
clear out of the ring!

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:07.387
[MAN 19N]
C'mon, Killa!

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.723
[WOMAN 19F]
Jewel, what did they do to you?

00:17:08.757 --> 00:17:12.329
Beauty and brawn?
Man, Number 18 is awesome!

00:17:12.363 --> 00:17:15.136
Seems like that Mighty Mask
fellow is no slouch, either!

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:18.476
Yay! Good job!
Keep it up, Mommy!

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.783
[OX KING] Way to go, 18!
Good technique!

00:17:21.816 --> 00:17:24.254
[MARRON]
Go, Mommy! You can do it!

00:17:24.288 --> 00:17:26.425
[MR. SATAN] Well, it looks
like I lucked out!

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:29.866
I dunno what happened exactly,
but two of my opponents

00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:31.569
have been taken out already!

00:17:31.603 --> 00:17:34.274
Now I just gotta
deal with these two!

00:17:34.307 --> 00:17:37.213
This battle royale
is in the bag!

00:17:37.247 --> 00:17:39.017
[A18] I shouldn't
underestimate this fighter

00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:40.352
with the long torso.

00:17:40.386 --> 00:17:42.725
Those twiggy little arms
of his pack more punch

00:17:42.758 --> 00:17:44.127
than I would have expected.

00:17:44.161 --> 00:17:46.131
Make sure you
stay focused, Goten.

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:48.368
She may not look it,
but I heard that Krillin's wife

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:50.874
was even stronger
than our dads once!

00:17:50.907 --> 00:17:52.343
[GOTEN]
Yeah! I'm ready!

00:17:52.376 --> 00:17:54.347
[MR. SATAN] Come on! What're
you waiting for, you two?

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.286
I'll put you both down for
the count at the same time!

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.956
[TRUNKS]
Don't worry about the chump.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.025
[GOTEN]
'Kay!

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:01.929
[A18]
Hmph.

00:18:01.963 --> 00:18:03.866
[MR. SATAN]
Hm?

00:18:06.573 --> 00:18:07.808
[growls]

00:18:07.842 --> 00:18:10.413
[ANNOUNCER] Suddenly, the field
is whittled down to three!

00:18:10.446 --> 00:18:14.120
It's Mighty Mask! Number 18!

00:18:14.153 --> 00:18:18.329
And our reigning champion,
the peerless Mr. Satan!

00:18:18.362 --> 00:18:21.001
Which of these contestants
will overpower the others

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:23.873
to win the match
and take home the title?

00:18:23.907 --> 00:18:25.443
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:27.480
What's he mean
"Who's gonna win"?

00:18:27.514 --> 00:18:30.787
It'll be me! Only question now
is how to make it look good.

00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:34.394
Let's see here. First, I'll take
that masked punk to school

00:18:34.428 --> 00:18:37.233
with moves that show off
the ol' razzle-dazzle.

00:18:40.073 --> 00:18:42.443
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

00:18:42.476 --> 00:18:44.114
Once he's out of the picture,

00:18:44.147 --> 00:18:46.451
I'll square off against
the cutie in the mom-jeans

00:18:46.485 --> 00:18:49.726
and knock her out of the ring
as gentlemanly as possible.

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:52.230
He-heh. She'll think
I'm the bee's knees!

00:18:52.263 --> 00:18:55.504
And so will the folks
up in the stands!

00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:56.639
[CROWD cheers]

00:18:56.672 --> 00:18:58.943

struck a triumphant pose!

00:18:58.977 --> 00:19:01.114
He's already
declaring his victory!

Just listen to 'em!

00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:05.691
They love me! I so nailed it!

[laughs]

00:19:06.893 --> 00:19:08.362
How lame is this guy?

00:19:08.395 --> 00:19:09.866
[GOTEN] I guess
we should leave him alone.

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:12.637
All right! I've got
your number, Mighty Mask!

00:19:12.671 --> 00:19:15.442
I hope you're ready for
a top-drawer Dynamite Kick!

00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:18.917
Sorry, but it's a hard lesson
I'm about to teach you, punk!

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.888
[laughs]

00:19:20.921 --> 00:19:24.995
Don't forget, Goten. Focus on
Number 18. Understand?

00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.897
[GOTEN]
'Kay.

--Amazing!

00:19:50.246 --> 00:19:51.750
Since our men
are nowhere to be found,

let's root for Number 18
instead, shall we?

[GOKU] How long
is this going to take?

00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.051
All right, I'm breaking
down the door.

00:20:43.085 --> 00:20:44.588
No! You mustn't
do that, Vegeta!

00:20:44.621 --> 00:20:46.124
We are wasting
our time in here!

00:20:46.158 --> 00:20:47.661
But you can't start
breaking things

00:20:47.694 --> 00:20:50.499
because you're
feeling impatient!

00:20:50.533 --> 00:20:54.207
Provoking Babidi
unnecessarily is a bad idea.

Is Dabura done yet?

inside the room.

sits within the meditation
chamber to maximize his power

00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:18.623
