Excuse me. I'll be back
in just a minute.

[GOTENKS] That's not
how I saw that going!

way more of an impact on him!

Ha! I bet he's just
putting on a brave face

you've got, Gotenks!

The fate of the world
depends on it!

This... doesn't look promising.

00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:26.860
Foolish! This is
what happens when

00:12:26.893 --> 00:12:29.632

at Super Saiyan.

[GOTENKS] Ha! Ha-ha! You're not
so easy to beat, are you?

Well, that's okay.
I knew all along...

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:43.753
...you'd be a real handful. Ha!

[PICCOLO groans]
Hm?

00:16:03.058 --> 00:16:04.728
All right. Tell me straight.

00:16:04.762 --> 00:16:07.902
You think that I'm totally
losing here, don't you, Piccolo?

00:16:07.935 --> 00:16:09.772
I would rather
not be thinking that.

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:13.145
But given the way you've been
fighting, I see no choice.

00:16:13.178 --> 00:16:16.351
[GOTENKS]
Hold it right there! I...

Where the heck
are you taking me?

Don't worry. This is exactly

00:16:33.987 --> 00:16:36.091
how I wanted the fight
to go down, okay.

00:16:36.125 --> 00:16:38.228
So far, everything's going
according to plan.

00:16:38.262 --> 00:16:39.565
You planned to lose?

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:42.303
No! Not that!

00:16:43.973 --> 00:16:45.276

is I came into this

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.850
with a very clear vision
for the best way to win.

00:16:48.884 --> 00:16:53.225
[PICCOLO] All right, that sounds
promising. What's your strategy?

00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:55.630
[GOTENKS] See, at first, I act
like I'm getting my butt kicked,

00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:58.202
then at the last second,
I make a huge comeback.

00:16:58.236 --> 00:17:00.106
That's the most exciting,
crowd-pleasing way

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:01.642
of winning, right?
'Cause I really want people

00:17:01.676 --> 00:17:03.814
to always remember
this victory as legendary

00:17:03.847 --> 00:17:06.452
and entertaining! You know?

00:17:06.485 --> 00:17:07.521
Right?

00:17:07.555 --> 00:17:09.124
[PICCOLO] Stop worrying
about trivial nonsense

00:17:09.157 --> 00:17:10.694
and hit him with
everything you've got now!

Aw, man. Sorry, but
you just don't appreciate

goes into a great fight!

about these theatrics earlier

so I could've
put a stop to them!

starts now!

going too easy on Buu.

according to his plan, too?

Is this what
he calls showmanship?

00:18:16.024 --> 00:18:18.563
That's enough!

how powerful I am.
