Goku and his

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:13.026
by two mysterious strangers

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.032
who seemed oddly eager
to assess their skills

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:17.736
in the upcoming tournament.

No clue.

[GOKU] But y'know,
meeting someone like that

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:28.189
has a funny way of
making me think that

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:31.797
maybe this tournament
isn't a sure win after all.

[NARRATOR] As the Round One
line-up drawing wraps up,

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:37.441
Goku's gut-instinct
may turn out to be

00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:40.448
closer to the truth
than he realizes.

you forfeit the match.

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:03.741

number of matches,

of thirty minutes per.

00:10:13.493 --> 00:10:14.763
[OOLONG]
That was uncalled for.

00:10:14.796 --> 00:10:18.570
Okay! It's time!
Let's get this show started!

00:10:18.603 --> 00:10:20.875
Who is gonna
be king of the hill?

00:10:20.908 --> 00:10:26.653
Give it up for our first
combatants: Krillin and Pintar!

00:10:26.686 --> 00:10:27.922
[GOKU]
Good luck, buddy.

00:10:27.955 --> 00:10:31.061
Ha! Like I'll need it
with this chump.

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:34.970
[PINTAR]
Whoopsie-daisy.

00:10:35.003 --> 00:10:35.871
[laughs]

00:10:35.905 --> 00:10:37.775
What is your problem, pal?

00:10:37.808 --> 00:10:39.712
Oh, hey.
Well, look at that.

00:10:39.745 --> 00:10:40.915
You have stayed.

00:10:40.948 --> 00:10:42.417
Thought you would
have run away by now.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.988
Anyone else
in your shoes would.

00:10:44.021 --> 00:10:46.025
I'm telling you, pipsqueak,
you will be ruined

00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:48.864
for all other matches--
not that you will see any.

00:10:48.897 --> 00:10:51.435
My gracious offer;
since this is your first time,

00:10:51.468 --> 00:10:54.107
I'll go easy.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.079
In your dreams.

00:10:56.112 --> 00:10:57.247
[ANNOUNCER]
You can feel the air thicken

00:10:57.281 --> 00:10:59.217
as both contestants
approach the ring.

00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:00.220
Krillin boasts some truly

00:11:00.253 --> 00:11:01.723
impressive showings
in this competition

00:11:01.757 --> 00:11:03.459
from younger days,
and this appearance

00:11:03.493 --> 00:11:05.831
marks his return
after a long hiatus.

00:11:05.864 --> 00:11:08.002
Pintar, notorious
for his ferocity,

00:11:08.036 --> 00:11:10.073
is here to set the record
straight after a ring-out in the

00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:11.943
last tournament
denied him the chance

00:11:11.976 --> 00:11:13.346
to move beyond the semifinals.

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:17.955
If ever there was a face
that said "confidence" it's his.

00:11:23.567 --> 00:11:26.807
[yells]

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.342
That man looks really mean.

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:31.917
I don't want Daddy to
fight him! Make 'em stop.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.286
Oh, it's okay, sweetie.

00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:35.389
Your pop can handle
this clown no prob.

00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:38.095
You know he's the strongest
man in the world, right?

00:11:38.128 --> 00:11:39.164
Is he really?

00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:40.768
Yeah. You betcha.

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:43.405
So far as earthlings
are concerned at least.

00:11:43.439 --> 00:11:44.776
[SPECTATOR 12A] Check it out.
The big one's like,

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:46.979
a million times
the other guy's size.

00:11:47.013 --> 00:11:48.784
[SPECTATOR 12B] This'll be
over before it's even started.

00:11:48.817 --> 00:11:50.755
[SPECTATOR 12C] Anyone
else feel bad for Krillin?

00:11:50.788 --> 00:11:52.892
Once Pintar sets
his sights on somethin',

00:11:52.926 --> 00:11:54.295
he don't back down.

00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:56.231
Dude's like an animal.

00:11:59.539 --> 00:12:01.876
[growls, chuckles]

00:12:03.747 --> 00:12:06.018
[laughs]

00:12:26.124 --> 00:12:27.729
[ANNOUNCER]
Oh dear, folks!

00:12:27.762 --> 00:12:30.366
Pintar has that
crazed look in his eye.

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:33.139
Despite the glaring difference
in size between he and Krillin,

00:12:33.172 --> 00:12:36.813
the big man clearly does not
intend to scale back his game.

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:39.519
Is his opponent ready for this?

00:12:39.552 --> 00:12:40.721
Do you hear that, runt?

00:12:40.754 --> 00:12:41.924
They expect you to lose.

00:12:41.957 --> 00:12:43.026
Well of course they do!

00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:45.162
They know what is what!

00:12:45.429 --> 00:12:46.465
If you would like to concede,

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:48.837
best do it now while you
can still move your jaw.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.075
[KRILLIN] Right.
I'm shakin' in my boots.

00:12:51.108 --> 00:12:54.114
Can he be any more
of a jackass?

00:13:07.173 --> 00:13:08.242
[ANNOUNCER]
Combatants!

00:13:08.276 --> 00:13:12.183
On your marks,
get set, and fight!

00:13:12.652 --> 00:13:15.322
[bellows]

00:13:22.037 --> 00:13:26.680
[laughs]

00:13:26.713 --> 00:13:28.416
That's right. I bet you
were not expecting

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:31.823
someone my size to
be so nimble! Oh yeah!

00:13:31.856 --> 00:13:33.894
Try to outmaneuver me
all you want, little man!

00:13:33.927 --> 00:13:35.897
Pintar moves like a cat!

00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:40.440
'Kay. No outmaneuvering.
Fine.

00:13:40.473 --> 00:13:42.110
[laughs]

00:13:42.143 --> 00:13:44.181
Aw, pumpkin.
Are you frightened?

00:13:44.214 --> 00:13:46.385
How about I offer
you the first punch, eh?

00:13:46.418 --> 00:13:49.559
Just to give you,
how do you say, perspective?

00:13:49.592 --> 00:13:50.761
[KRILLIN sighs]

00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:53.166
C'mon! Hit me with
everything you have got!

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.535
Do it!

00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:55.838
Don't be a wuss!

00:13:55.872 --> 00:13:56.673
[KRILLIN]
Fine!

00:13:56.706 --> 00:14:02.350
[yells, groans]

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:04.187
[CROWD gasps]

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.324
Offer accepted!

00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:18.951
[ANNOUNCER] We have a ring-out!
The big man got himself tossed!

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:21.857
The win goes to Krillin!

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.125
[SPECTATOR 12A]
Whoa, that was incredible!

00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:24.461
[SPECTATOR 12C] He packs
enough umph for a dude

00:14:24.494 --> 00:14:25.764
ten million times his size!

00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:27.668
[BOTH]
Yay! Go Krillin!

00:14:27.702 --> 00:14:29.772
Oh, neat-o! He is strong!

00:14:29.806 --> 00:14:31.007
See?

00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:33.245
[ANNOUNCER]
Outstanding! I knew it!

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:34.883
This is going to be
the tournament

00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:37.621
to end all tournaments!

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:39.457
Nice going, Krillin.

00:14:40.292 --> 00:14:41.897
Eh. Too easy.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.834
Piccolo. Not that
I'm sayin' you need it,

00:14:43.867 --> 00:14:46.171
but good luck with your guy.

00:14:48.577 --> 00:14:49.645
Come on.

00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:52.216
You know you've
got this in the bag!

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.691
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear you were nervous.

00:14:55.724 --> 00:14:59.164
No, really; what is it?

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:03.372
On to the next! Oh, yes!

00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:04.776
This will be good!

00:15:04.809 --> 00:15:06.812
We've got Shin and Ma Junior.

00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:09.317
Right-o, let's show
them some love!

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:14.360
[CROWD cheers]

00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:22.277
Excellent.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.984
I've a strong suspicion
that I shall enjoy myself.

00:15:28.055 --> 00:15:30.727
[ANNOUNCER] Gentlemen,
approach the ring.

00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:33.867
This match will be Shin's
first appearance here with us.

00:15:33.901 --> 00:15:36.338
His opponent, Ma Junior,
is a tournament veteran

00:15:36.372 --> 00:15:38.275
who many of you will no
doubt remember from his

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:40.981
dazzling championship
bout a few years back--

00:15:41.014 --> 00:15:44.388
one etched
in this emcee's mind.

00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:46.325
Uh, 'scuse me--
we'll thank you to not

00:15:46.358 --> 00:15:48.062
destroy the
grounds this time.

00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:49.297
Correct me if I'm wrong,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.868
but isn't he one of
the weirdos who tried to

00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:52.370
shoulder in on Mr.
Satan's action

00:15:52.404 --> 00:15:54.007
while he's was
givin' Cell the biz?

00:15:54.041 --> 00:15:57.413
Yeah, that's gotta be it.
He was on the TV.

00:16:04.361 --> 00:16:05.664
[KRILLIN]
What's the problem?

00:16:05.697 --> 00:16:08.737
This Shin guy can't be
that big of deal, can he?

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:09.873
Yeah.

00:16:09.906 --> 00:16:12.745
Seriously? Okay then.

00:16:12.778 --> 00:16:15.650
I guess looks
can be deceiving.

00:16:21.028 --> 00:16:22.063
[VEGETA]
At the very least,

00:16:22.096 --> 00:16:24.267
this match will be instructive.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.342
Whoever he is, we need
to gauge his power level.

00:16:28.977 --> 00:16:30.045
[ANNOUNCER]
Combatants!

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:34.287
On your marks,
get set, and fight!

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:42.704
[PICCOLO]
What is wrong with me?

00:16:42.738 --> 00:16:47.213
[grunting]

00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:56.331
[PICCOLO]
Can it be nerves?

00:16:56.364 --> 00:16:58.236
I've never met this
guy before in my life!

00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:00.540
Why would I be nervous?

00:17:08.924 --> 00:17:11.796
What's the deal?
Come on, give us a fight!

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.833
Stop staring at each other!

00:17:15.203 --> 00:17:18.308
[CROWD shouts angrily]

00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:20.280
Uh, perhaps you
didn't hear me.

00:17:20.313 --> 00:17:22.317
I gave you the green light.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.187
[SPECTATOR 12A]
Aw, man! This is lame!

00:17:24.221 --> 00:17:25.791
[SPECTATOR 12B]
Hey, in case you're wonderin',

00:17:25.824 --> 00:17:27.060
all these people here?

00:17:27.093 --> 00:17:29.699
Kinda waiting for
some movement.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.636
If you both would
be so kind.

00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:35.142
This is after all a
martial arts tournament!

00:17:50.006 --> 00:17:52.176
[PICCOLO]
That's not possible!

00:17:53.111 --> 00:17:55.584
What on Earth is going
on in his head right now?

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.153
[VEGETA]
No.

00:18:04.903 --> 00:18:07.406
[PICCOLO]
Who are you?

00:18:09.746 --> 00:18:12.250
You will know. Very soon.

00:18:12.785 --> 00:18:15.155
You will know.
Very soon.

00:18:22.738 --> 00:18:26.444
But for now let us
simply enjoy the match.

00:18:33.192 --> 00:18:34.929
[GOKU]
Piccolo!

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:37.802
[ANNOUNCER] Fellas!
What's the hold up?

00:18:38.269 --> 00:18:40.372
[PICCOLO]
I'm sorry, I--

00:18:45.016 --> 00:18:46.619
I concede.

00:18:46.653 --> 00:18:47.688
[ALL gasp]

00:18:47.721 --> 00:18:48.757
What?

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.128
Wait. You--You concede?

00:18:51.161 --> 00:18:52.598
Without even a proper fight?

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:54.234
[PICCOLO]
Yes.

00:18:54.636 --> 00:18:55.771
[SHIN]
Of course.

00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:58.509
He is bound to the
guardian of this world.

00:18:58.543 --> 00:19:00.312
That may give
him special insight

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:03.052
into just who I really am.

00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:05.156
Uh.
Ma Junior concedes!

00:19:05.189 --> 00:19:07.426
Newcomer Shin wins
his inaugural battle in

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.700
the World Martial Arts
tournament by default!

00:19:12.137 --> 00:19:14.942
Didn't expect that.
Huh. Oddball.

00:19:14.976 --> 00:19:16.679
Think maybe he
wasn't feelin' well?

00:19:16.712 --> 00:19:17.748
Probably, yeah.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.952
He was lookin' a little
green around the gills.

00:19:19.986 --> 00:19:21.088
[GOHAN]
What happened out there?

00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:22.157
[KRILLIN] Are you
having an off day?

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:24.294
This is serious, huh?

00:19:24.327 --> 00:19:27.500
Yes. He's in
a class by himself.

00:19:28.035 --> 00:19:31.007
[KRILLIN] You're joking, right?
Or at least exaggerating?

00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:32.343
Aw, come on Piccolo!

00:19:32.376 --> 00:19:36.384
I--I gotta square off with
him in the next round!

00:19:39.257 --> 00:19:41.529
Okey-dokey!
Moving right along!

00:19:41.562 --> 00:19:43.967
Match three will be a doozey!

[CROWD] Go Videl!
Go Videl! Go Videl!

00:19:57.259 --> 00:19:59.965
Heh, they're losing
their minds over you.

00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:01.936
The popularity
is nice, I'll bet.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:02.972
Heh.

Yo. Weren't you
payin' attention, man?

00:20:08.717 --> 00:20:10.620
They just called ya up.

00:20:11.989 --> 00:20:13.092
Hey, Veins.

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:14.862
Somebody's talkin' to you--

Hey, you and me
got a date for round two.

00:20:44.722 --> 00:20:46.191
[ANNOUNCER] Though
I'm sure none of you

00:20:46.225 --> 00:20:47.293
needs me to tell you this,

00:20:47.327 --> 00:20:49.532
Videl comes from
championship stock.

00:20:49.565 --> 00:20:51.569
As Mr. Satan's daughter,
she's worked closely

00:20:51.602 --> 00:20:54.374
with law enforcement to
keep her city crime-free.

00:20:54.407 --> 00:20:56.613
She rocked the Junior
Division as a little girl.

00:20:56.646 --> 00:20:58.382
Now, after seven long years,

00:20:58.416 --> 00:21:01.087
she's ready to take her
place alongside Daddy.

00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:02.390
Her opponent, Spopovitch,

00:21:02.423 --> 00:21:04.561
didn't make it past
the first round last time,

00:21:04.595 --> 00:21:09.638
but after a dramatic makeover,
he's hungry for a title shot!

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.965
[NARRATOR] Tensions mount
as Videl's burly opponent

00:21:22.998 --> 00:21:26.405
steps toward the ring to
take on a crowd favorite.

00:21:26.438 --> 00:21:29.143
But Shin watches
his approach like a hawk.

00:21:29.176 --> 00:21:30.513
Who is this man?

00:21:30.547 --> 00:21:33.251
What about him drove Piccolo
to forfeit their match?

00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:36.191
And why is he staring
daggers at Spopovitch?

00:21:36.224 --> 00:21:39.531

Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:49.337
No question Videl knows
how to handle herself,

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.741
but this Spopvitch guy--

00:22:50.774 --> 00:22:52.777
something about
him just isn't right.

[VIDEL]
Hi-ya!

00:22:55.316 --> 00:22:56.685
Persistent, aren't you?

Well if you think I'm not,
