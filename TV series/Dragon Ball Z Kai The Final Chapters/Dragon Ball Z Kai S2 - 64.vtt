Shhh!

He's giving a very important
speech to Earth.

No! This can't be real life! No!

Hey, big guy, listen up.

00:11:21.128 --> 00:11:22.497
If you've got time
to put on this farce,

00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:26.138
you've got time to help
the good Buu fight the bad one!

Just give us a minute.

Buu will come
though okay. Relax.

00:11:30.748 --> 00:11:32.885
And on this distant world,
from where I speak,

00:11:32.918 --> 00:11:36.960
a great warrior fights Buu
on behalf of all Earthlings!

00:11:36.993 --> 00:11:39.030

that despite his bravery,

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:40.834
the odds are against him.

once and for all!

rather weak afterward.

already impressive!

it is with just them,

Not bad! But we need more!

Hmm. Well, that's strange.

Sure it's bigger
than a normal blast,

00:14:56.826 --> 00:14:58.564
but if Goku is actually
absorbing the energy

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:01.168

the Spirit Bomb should be

00:15:01.201 --> 00:15:03.306
way more intense than that!

Hey! You stupid Earthlings.

00:21:06.397 --> 00:21:08.536
You have to start
listening to me!

00:21:08.569 --> 00:21:12.677
Do you wanna get turned into
candy again by Buu?

00:21:12.711 --> 00:21:16.184
I swear this isn't some sort
of dream or practical joke.

It's your future! Now, come on!

planet for once!

[NARRATOR] The more Vegeta tries
to get the people of Earth

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.605
to give Goku
their spirit energy,

00:21:26.639 --> 00:21:28.809
the more they ignore him!

00:21:28.843 --> 00:21:31.281
The Spirit Bomb
is the only way left

00:21:31.314 --> 00:21:35.524
to defeat Majin Buu,
but Earth must be convinced!

We finally have a chance
to get rid of Majin Buu.

00:22:49.404 --> 00:22:51.141
But how come
you guys won't help?!

[MR. SATAN]
People of Earth!

00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:55.750
