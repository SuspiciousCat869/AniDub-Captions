00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:39.799
What was all that about, huh?

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:43.574
And you went Super Saiyan on me!
I should get a do-over!

00:11:43.607 --> 00:11:45.343
Yeah. Sorry about that.

00:11:45.377 --> 00:11:46.580
Heh.

00:11:46.613 --> 00:11:48.416
I got kinda carried away
there for a second,

00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:51.422
like this kid I was up against
in a tournament once.

00:11:51.456 --> 00:11:55.029
Guess when the chips are down,
neither one of us can help it.

00:11:55.063 --> 00:11:58.637
C'mon, though! It's not like
I hit you with my left arm.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.275
Lighten up.
You had fun, right?

00:12:01.308 --> 00:12:02.343
Just so we're square.

00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:05.016
Tell you what: I'll give
you three of my toys.

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:08.055
Whoa, for real?
That'd be awesome!

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:12.463
Uh. I mean, I guess,
if you promise.

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:16.906
[VIDEL stammers]

00:12:18.176 --> 00:12:21.717
So, uh. Both of 'em
can so Super Saiyan.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.622
Huh. Those are
some impressive kids.

00:12:24.655 --> 00:12:25.858
[VEGETA chuckles]

00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:28.597
Too bad about
your boy, Kakarot.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.099
I suppose some
children are just

00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:32.672
genetically inferior
to their peers.

00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:34.074
[GOKU laughs]

00:12:34.107 --> 00:12:35.877
[MALE SPECTATOR 10C] Uh.
I'm not sure what I just saw,

00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:39.653
but I'm thinkin' that was,
like, the greatest match ever.

00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:42.290
Understatement of
the year right there.

00:12:44.862 --> 00:12:46.231
[ANNOUNCER]
I don't know about you, folks,

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:49.238
but after a nail-biter like
that, I need some fluff!

00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:51.409
How 'bout as a prelude
to the main event,

00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:53.981
we pit our brand new
Junior Division champion,

00:12:54.014 --> 00:12:55.818
Trunks, head to head
with none other than

00:12:55.851 --> 00:12:58.355
Mr. Satan himself?

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.095
[CROWD chanting]
Mister!

00:13:01.128 --> 00:13:02.932
Satan!

00:13:02.966 --> 00:13:07.140
[MR. SATAN stammers]

00:13:07.173 --> 00:13:09.512
Oh no!

00:13:09.545 --> 00:13:17.227
[groans]

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:27.480
[CROWD continues]
Mister! Satan!

00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:30.987
[MR. SATAN]
I am so up a creek.

00:13:43.312 --> 00:13:53.566
[CROWD] Mister! Satan!
Mister! Satan!

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.946
Heh. I hope he has
an exit plan. Right?

00:13:59.979 --> 00:14:02.451
I'll bet he'll just cry
foul like he always does.

00:14:02.484 --> 00:14:05.023
[laughs]

00:14:05.056 --> 00:14:08.429
Trunks is going to
wipe the floor with this fool.

00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:14.441
Those guys!
What a bunch of kidders!

00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:23.159
[CROWD] Mister! Satan!
Mister! Satan!

00:14:23.192 --> 00:14:26.532
All right!
Lucky you, huh?

00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:34.347
My...

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.053
It's quite the formidable
tyke you're up against.

00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:39.023
The odds are, however
this pans out,

00:14:39.057 --> 00:14:41.195
you'll have a major
crowd pleaser.

00:14:41.228 --> 00:14:42.263
[laughs]

00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:44.869
Yeah. I'm gonna have to
watch myself out there.

00:14:44.903 --> 00:14:47.174
[laughs]
Oh, sure.

00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:48.644
[laughs]

00:14:48.677 --> 00:14:50.848
No. Really.

00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:53.151
[BOTH laugh]

00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:57.561
[MR. SATAN] What do I do?
This kid's gonna tear me apart!

00:14:57.594 --> 00:14:58.830
Care for a small
break before

00:14:58.863 --> 00:15:00.466
we get this show on the road?

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:01.736
Nah.
I'm good.

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:02.938
All righty, then.

00:15:02.971 --> 00:15:07.180
It's time to bring out
the World Champion!

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.386
Break a leg
out there, Champ.

00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:12.323
[MR. SATAN yells]

00:15:12.356 --> 00:15:14.027
Yeah-ah! Satan!

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.098
Go get 'im, Champ!

00:15:16.365 --> 00:15:19.606
Yeah! What's this I hear
about some whiney

00:15:19.639 --> 00:15:23.079
two-bit punk who thinks he's
got what it takes to beat me?

00:15:23.112 --> 00:15:30.795
[CROWD] Mister! Satan!
Mister! Satan!

00:15:30.828 --> 00:15:32.064
[laughs]

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.399
This can't be the guy!

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:39.444
I got combs bigger
than you! Yeah!

00:15:42.383 --> 00:15:45.322
[MR. SATAN] I'm a dead man!
I'm a dead man!

00:15:45.356 --> 00:15:46.458
Wait, no.

00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:48.396
Maybe this is all
just a bad dream.

00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:51.201
Maybe I'm about to
wake up at home in bed.

00:15:51.235 --> 00:15:53.540
[TRUNKS]
This is the World Champion?

00:15:53.574 --> 00:15:54.542
Hm.

00:15:54.575 --> 00:15:56.178
Guess this is what
my mom's talking about

00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:59.051
when she says you can't
judge a book by its cover.

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:02.124
Show 'em all what
you're made of, Trunks!

00:16:02.157 --> 00:16:04.093
Knock it off with
all the encouragement!

00:16:04.127 --> 00:16:06.900
The runt doesn't
need a cheerleader!

00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:09.838
Well... things look
just about wrapped up.

00:16:09.872 --> 00:16:12.845
So do you guys wanna head
down and start getting ready?

00:16:12.878 --> 00:16:13.981
Might as well.

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:15.651
There's really
no point staying here.

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:17.922
Wait, what? Seriously?

00:16:17.955 --> 00:16:19.559
So, there's nothing
you might wanna see?

00:16:19.592 --> 00:16:21.428
Like, maybe, one of
your own in the ring

00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:23.398
with the strongest man
in the world?

00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:24.802
Oh! Yeah!

00:16:24.835 --> 00:16:25.838
Good point there!

00:16:25.871 --> 00:16:27.073
Should be worth a look!

00:16:27.106 --> 00:16:28.910
After all, it's not
every day that you, uh--

00:16:28.944 --> 00:16:31.414
[GOKU] Well, see
two you down there.

00:16:46.746 --> 00:16:48.783
Oh yeah!

00:17:02.143 --> 00:17:05.249
[MR. SATAN]
Yeah!

00:17:05.884 --> 00:17:08.857
[TRUNKS] Okay.
What was that all about?

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.495
This guy's moves
look totally weak!

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:13.800
Nah. He's the
World Champion, right?

00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:17.808
He must just be putting on
an act to catch me off guard.

00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:19.645
Better get ready.

00:17:25.422 --> 00:17:28.362
Ugh! Kid! What's with
all the gymnastics?

00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:30.099
It's not like it's a real fight!

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:33.239
See. In the business we call
this kinda thing filler.

00:17:33.272 --> 00:17:35.578
We don't wanna
bore the fans, y'know?

00:17:35.611 --> 00:17:36.979
Eh? Eh?

00:17:37.013 --> 00:17:38.983
[chuckles nervously]

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:42.524
Whatever. A fight's
a fight, old man.

00:17:44.127 --> 00:17:44.929
Oh, come on!

00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:46.098
Work with me here!

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:47.968
Just quit acting like a child!

00:17:48.002 --> 00:17:49.137
I am a child, hello!

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.308
Why you--You stubborn
little rug rat!

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:54.615
Stop messin' around
already! I am serious!

00:17:54.649 --> 00:17:55.584
[TRUNKS]
So am I.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.320
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but these people

00:17:57.354 --> 00:17:58.623
are waiting to see a show.

00:17:58.657 --> 00:18:01.830
Perhaps it'd be a good
idea to give them one?

00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:04.400
Hah! You say the kid
will give Mr. Satan

00:18:04.434 --> 00:18:06.940
a run for his money and
I say you're full of it!

00:18:06.973 --> 00:18:08.910
Nobody said he'd beat
him; I mean c'mon,

00:18:08.944 --> 00:18:10.413
this is the man
who clobbered Cell.

00:18:10.446 --> 00:18:12.651
Take this
clown to school!

00:18:12.684 --> 00:18:15.791
[MR. SATAN] I'm a dead man!
I'm a dead man! I'm a dead man!

00:18:15.824 --> 00:18:17.928
Wait! No I'm not.

00:18:18.095 --> 00:18:19.566
[groans]

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:20.634
Aaah!

00:18:20.668 --> 00:18:23.774
Something appears to be
amiss with Mr. Satan!

00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:27.280
An old sports injury come
back to haunt you?

00:18:27.313 --> 00:18:30.019
Take my word for it, buddy,
you said a mouthful.

00:18:30.052 --> 00:18:33.158
Ever since Cell,
I haven't been the same.

00:18:34.494 --> 00:18:37.334
Oh, the humanity!
I had no idea!

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.870
I've been keeping
it a secret,

00:18:38.904 --> 00:18:42.310
but the truth is Cell did
some kinda number on my knee.

00:18:42.344 --> 00:18:44.280
Flares up sometimes.

00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:46.853
Have no fear, we've got
a specialist on staff.

00:18:46.887 --> 00:18:48.556
Let's bring him out!

00:18:49.558 --> 00:18:51.829
Hey, whadda know?
False alarm!

00:18:51.863 --> 00:18:53.398
Ha! Funny thing
about this knee:

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:56.238
uh, it fixes itself as
quickly as it flares up.

00:18:56.272 --> 00:18:58.109
We should be good
to go now, I think.

00:18:58.142 --> 00:18:59.845
Are you absolutely sure?

00:18:59.879 --> 00:19:00.881
Uh, yeah.

00:19:00.914 --> 00:19:02.416
There you have it, my friends.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.724
You can't keep
a good man down!

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:11.636
[MR. SATAN] This--This
is really happening.

00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:14.073
The whole world's about
to see its hero get

00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:16.712
his lunch eaten by
a pug-nosed toddler.

00:19:16.746 --> 00:19:19.084
I'll be a laughing stock.

00:19:19.251 --> 00:19:20.754
Wait! Wait, that's it!

00:19:20.787 --> 00:19:23.560
He's a kid! No one really
expects me to fight a kid!

00:19:23.593 --> 00:19:25.697
I'll spin it like I let him win!

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:26.933
Are you ready?

00:19:26.967 --> 00:19:28.770
Gimme just a second!

00:19:29.103 --> 00:19:30.172
Here's the deal.

00:19:30.206 --> 00:19:31.676
Forget what I said.

00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:34.347
The thing is, I didn't tell you
about the special salutation

00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:36.986
we're supposed to give each
other going into this match.

00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:38.055
Why's it special?

00:19:38.088 --> 00:19:40.092
Ah, well! It's
different than one

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:41.428
you'd give
before a normal match.

00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:43.265
When they give us
the word, you stick out

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:45.169
your fist and
give me a lil' nudge.

00:19:45.202 --> 00:19:46.438
Got it?

00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:48.109
Now, when I say lil' nudge.

00:19:48.142 --> 00:19:50.179
That's exactly what I mean.

00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:51.850
Shouldn't even tickle.

00:19:51.883 --> 00:19:52.918
You read me?

00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:54.387
Now listen,
it's very important

00:19:54.421 --> 00:19:55.858
you understand me on this!

00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:57.026
It's not a punch.

00:19:57.059 --> 00:19:58.095
It's a salutation.

00:19:58.129 --> 00:20:01.267
I get ya.
I gotta be gentle.

00:20:02.203 --> 00:20:04.909
All right, blondie!
Let's get on with it!

00:20:04.942 --> 00:20:06.144
[laughs]

00:20:06.177 --> 00:20:07.581
Sorry for the hold up, folks.

00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:09.417
Boy was anglin'
for an autograph.

00:20:09.451 --> 00:20:11.990
I told him he'd get one
after he'd cleaned my clock.

00:20:12.023 --> 00:20:14.795
Right. That makes sense.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.133
On with the show!

00:20:17.166 --> 00:20:18.870
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare yourselves

00:20:18.903 --> 00:20:20.507
for the David and Goliath match!

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.747
Mr. Satan versus the
Junior Division champion!

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.416
Yeah!

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.955
Boy! Do your worst!

Oh, what's this I see?

00:20:41.315 --> 00:20:43.452
Is he throwing caution
to the wind and actually

00:20:43.486 --> 00:20:46.025
allowing his opponent
to take the first swing?

00:20:46.058 --> 00:20:47.894
Absolutely unbelievable!

00:20:47.928 --> 00:20:50.399
His composure is amazing!

You've gotta be...
kidding me.

Ugh! That boy's
really gotta learn

00:21:21.194 --> 00:21:23.265
how to pull his punches.

[NARRATOR] The Junior
Division title bout

00:21:25.703 --> 00:21:27.608
may have been a photo finish,

00:21:27.641 --> 00:21:30.346
but the showdown between
Trunks and Mr. Satan

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:32.852
paints a very different
picture indeed.

00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:35.389
Is the fight over
before it's even begun?

Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.666 --> 00:22:48.536
When we first got here,
I was so confident

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.439
we'd win I was
sorta disappointed.

00:22:50.472 --> 00:22:52.109
Now, though, I'm not so sure.

00:22:52.143 --> 00:22:53.345
Just how I like it!

[TRUNKS] Hey, Goten,
I gotta a plan.

00:22:54.882 --> 00:22:57.319

some real weirdos
this time around?
