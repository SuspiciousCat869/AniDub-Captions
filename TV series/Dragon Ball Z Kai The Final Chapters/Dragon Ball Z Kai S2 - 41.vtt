Hey! Come out, Majin Buu!

Mr. Satan's here!
No, you're not coming out?

Um, excuse me again, sir?

Have you strained
your voice or something?

00:13:47.655 --> 00:13:50.459
Because it kinda sounds to me
like you're whispering.

[MR. SATAN clears throat]

00:13:51.495 --> 00:13:53.634
A strained voice; yes.
That's what it is.

[MR. SATAN] You idiot.
What are you thinking?

00:14:06.993 --> 00:14:08.596
If you shout
he's gonna hear you!

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.234
It's called the
element of surprise!

00:14:12.137 --> 00:14:15.076
Okay, I don't think
he heard you.

00:14:15.109 --> 00:14:17.549
Look, you guys are
slowing down my heroics.

You need to back it up!

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.353
[OFFICER 41A] Of course, sir.
We'll leave the earth

Just be careful, okay!

[MR. SATAN]
I'll signal when it's safe!

00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:28.504
If the press calls, tell 'em
I'm still available to talk--

00:14:28.537 --> 00:14:30.172
Huh?!

00:14:40.193 --> 00:14:44.001
Oh well. I'm glad they
left me here all alone!

00:14:44.034 --> 00:14:46.707
Now I can fight
without distractions.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.912
Or help. From anyone.

00:15:07.548 --> 00:15:09.518
[MR. SATAN]
All right.

00:15:18.169 --> 00:15:20.005

Hmmm.

I see you lost
your nerve, Majin Buu!

00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:21.161
Well, there's not much
I can do if you run away

00:16:21.194 --> 00:16:23.365

I come around!

to go home knowing

No! I was talking
about myself. I'm the fatty!

And farting's a show
of respect in my culture!

Please don't kill me! I'm sorry!
I'll do anything!

A lizard? Damn it!

Don't startle me like that!

00:16:55.029 --> 00:16:56.632
And don't tell anyone
what I said!

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:59.972
I was just joking about joking!
I'm not scared of nobody!

Oh, thank goodness
you're here, Majin Buu, sir.

00:17:27.794 --> 00:17:29.230
I was so scared I'd missed you.

00:17:29.264 --> 00:17:30.834
It's such an honor
to meet your strong

00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:33.372

you're my hero!

What Buu turn you into:
hard candy, or gummy, or cookie?

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:40.587
Buu let you pick.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.092
No! No, wait. Please, don't
turn me into anything yet!

00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:46.298
I got a present for ya!
Don't you want to see it?

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:49.137
Here you go! I know
it's nothing much, but...

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.976
If nothing much, Buu not
want it. Forget it.

00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:53.446
Oh no! I misspoke.

00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:55.617
It's not nothing.
It's a whole lotta something!

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.755
Ritzy chocolates, see?
Help yourself!

00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:59.424
Ooh, its chocolate!

00:17:59.457 --> 00:18:02.765
Hmm. But what does
this "ritzy" mean?

00:18:02.798 --> 00:18:05.270
Oh, that just means
they're expensive and fancy--

00:18:05.303 --> 00:18:07.674
the best chocolate there is!

00:18:17.762 --> 00:18:18.863
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:20.934
[MR. SATAN] That's right,
you fool. Munch away!

00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:23.740
Those chocolates are filled
with the deadliest poison!

You'll soon be writhing in pain!

00:18:26.979 --> 00:18:29.317
[BUU] You right.
These much more ritzy

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.322
than chocolate
made from people.

00:18:31.355 --> 00:18:33.426

You can play games on it, see?

00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:42.277
You fight people
on the little screen!

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.483

title! Like this!

00:18:59.411 --> 00:19:05.256

pretty... hard... too.

is fun. Buu like big ending!

exactly what I wanted!

Oh, they're delicious.
What an interesting flavor!

And knowing
what they're made from

crying or vomiting at all!
