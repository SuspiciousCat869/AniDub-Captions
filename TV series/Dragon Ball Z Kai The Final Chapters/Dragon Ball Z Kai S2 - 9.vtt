Yeah, I thought so.

I'm gonna miss the whole thing.

Sorry, son.

Call him what you want!

It doesn't change
the fact that he's

gonna clean your kid's clock!

You knew he'd win.

one day of fighting.

Ha! As if!

I was meditating to get myself
set for the fights later on.

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:02.671
Any musclehead
can waltz into the ring

00:15:02.705 --> 00:15:03.874
and toss his fists around,

00:15:03.907 --> 00:15:05.777
but thanks to the
mental prep-work I do,

00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:08.182

Well, the championship match
for the Junior Division is

about to get started,
and the two children who are

00:15:14.494 --> 00:15:17.367

both uncommonly strong.

I thought you might want to
see them in action, that's all.

It's going to be a
very interesting match,

from the looks of it.

Seeing as how I'm done
meditating, I guess I'll watch.

00:15:26.452 --> 00:15:29.457
I do have to let the winner
take a swing at me later on.

far by shutting out their

unrivaled strength!

that defies belief,

really close friends!

has already amazed the crowd,
but they're not done yet!

00:21:23.966 --> 00:21:25.970
There's a title on the line,
and even though the

00:21:26.004 --> 00:21:30.045
two boys are close friends,
only one can win it all!

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:33.419
Who will be the next World
Martial Arts Junior Champion,

00:21:33.452 --> 00:21:36.057
and earn a shot at
Mr. Satan himself?

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.765
Find out,
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.832 --> 00:22:48.903
Goten and Trunks
aren't too shabby, huh!

00:22:48.936 --> 00:22:51.642
I'd expect no less from a
couple of half-Saiyan kids!

00:22:51.676 --> 00:22:53.045
[TRUNKS]
You've gotten better, Goten!

00:22:53.078 --> 00:22:55.784
But I'm still gonna be the
one to win this match!

00:22:55.817 --> 00:22:56.786
Sorry!

00:22:56.819 --> 00:22:58.422
[GOTEN] You might
be in for a surprise!

00:22:58.455 --> 00:23:00.893

[GOHAN]
C'mon guys.

00:23:06.137 --> 00:23:07.473
You can't go
turning Super Saiyan

00:23:07.507 --> 00:23:09.511
in front of all these people!
