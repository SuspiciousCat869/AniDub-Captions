WEBVTT

00:00:07.147 --> 00:00:09.553
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:13.126
Vegeta paid the ultimate price
to destroy Majin Buu,

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:15.799
but the pink menace
still regenerated.

00:00:15.899 --> 00:00:17.134
After healing himself,

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:19.840
Buu then restored
a very angry Babidi,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.777
who'd been
struck down by Piccolo

00:00:21.877 --> 00:00:23.180
and now
swore vengeance upon

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.417
him, Goten, and Trunks.

00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:28.290
Elsewhere, Goku at last
regained consciousness

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.331
after Vegeta had blindsided him
to steal the last senzu bean.

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.301
I can still sense
Majin Buu's energy,

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:36.373
but I don't feel
Vegeta's at all now.

00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:39.478
I hope he didn't get himself
killed trying to prove himself.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.484
And I don't sense
Gohan, either.

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:45.024
But I am picking up
Krillin and Piccolo at least,

00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:47.896
and it feels like
they're back to normal now.

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:51.035
Maybe they can tell me
what's going on.

00:00:51.135 --> 00:00:53.006
[NARRATOR] Goku and
the remaining Z Fighters

00:00:53.106 --> 00:00:54.910
develop their
most desperate plan yet

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.883
for stopping Majin Buu, now!

00:00:58.217 --> 00:01:03.426
â™ª Opening Song â™ª

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.869
So Videl,
where do you think

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.973
Gohan and the boys were going?

00:02:50.073 --> 00:02:51.643
No clue. I just know that

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:53.681
before we search for
more Dragon Balls,

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.385
our first priority
should be finding them.

00:02:56.485 --> 00:02:58.591
[sighs]
Bulma, what should we do?

00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:00.060
[BULMA] We haven't
been able to find them

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.463
and the trail's gone cold.

00:03:01.564 --> 00:03:03.032
It's hard to make
finding them a priority

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:05.872
without leads.

00:03:05.972 --> 00:03:07.074
I mean, don't get me wrong,

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:08.443
Vegeta and Trunks
are missing, too,

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:11.684
and I'm just as worried
as anybody else.

00:03:11.784 --> 00:03:13.755
Especially with
my husband having attacked

00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:15.056
all those spectators.

00:03:15.156 --> 00:03:18.430
As long as Goku's with them,
I'm sure they'll be okay.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:21.236
We've got six of the
Dragon Balls with us, right?

00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:22.839
If we get the last one--

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.344
Bulma, I hope you're not
assuming our families are dead.

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:27.615
That's not why you want to find
the Dragon Balls, is it?

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:30.153
Because you think that's the
only way to bring them back?

00:03:30.254 --> 00:03:32.391
No, I'm not that
pessimistic, Chichi.

00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:34.428
But since we don't know
where our families are,

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:36.165
we should focus on
what we can do,

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:37.769
and that's finding
the Dragon Balls.

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:39.807
That way we can
wish all the spectators

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:41.911
Vegeta killed back to life.

00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:45.183
I feel... so guilty for it.

00:03:45.283 --> 00:03:47.622
You're right.
Let's find that Dragon Ball!

00:03:47.722 --> 00:03:50.126
But do you have
any clue where it is?

00:03:50.226 --> 00:03:51.630
[BULMA]
Let's see.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.034
[beeps]

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:56.472
It's hard to believe
this bag of shiny orange balls

00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:58.443
lets you bring people
back from the dead.

00:03:58.544 --> 00:04:00.013
Yeah, once you got 'em all,

00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:02.485
you summon the dragon Shenron
and he grants you three wishes.

00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:03.688
[BULMA]
Yamcha, found it!

00:04:03.788 --> 00:04:05.859
The last Dragon Ball's
straight ahead.

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.929
[YAMCHA]
Roger that!

00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:15.009
[DENDE, MR. POPO pant]

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:19.686
[DENDE]
We've been expecting you.

00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:22.725
Hey, what's wrong with
the boys? Are they injured?

00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:26.398
Oh dear,
I hope it's not serious.

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:27.936
No, Vegeta just
knocked 'em out

00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:30.006
so we could get 'em
to safety. They'll be fine.

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:32.011
Take 'em inside
so they can rest.

00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:34.248
That sounds
easy enough. Popo?

00:04:34.348 --> 00:04:36.586
Of course.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.573
So it's true.

00:04:46.674 --> 00:04:50.280
The nightmarish Majin Buu has
been unleashed once again.

00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:51.783
And these two children
might be our

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:55.390
last remaining hope
to defeat him.

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.595
Hey, Dende!
Surely you can tell us

00:04:57.695 --> 00:04:59.633
if Goku's okay, can't ya?

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:01.302
No need to worry about Goku.

00:05:01.402 --> 00:05:03.106
He's dead already, remember?

00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:04.843
Uhhh... Right.

00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:07.515
[chuckles]
That's a pretty good point.

00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:09.720
--[PICCOLO growls]
--[KRILLIN] Aah!

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.822
[coughs]

00:05:10.922 --> 00:05:12.859
I do sense, however,
that Goku has sustained

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:14.295
a lot of damage.

00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:16.432
And Majin Buu and Babidi:
what about them?

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:18.102
The wizard's power
is fueled by hate,

00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:20.073
which grows stronger
every minute.

00:05:20.173 --> 00:05:21.910
And Gohan?

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.817
I'm sorry, Krillin.
I don't sense him.

00:05:24.917 --> 00:05:26.352
Oh, man.

00:05:26.452 --> 00:05:28.023
Dende, what about
Supreme Kai?

00:05:28.123 --> 00:05:29.458
Can you still sense him?

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:30.662
Why are you asking?

00:05:30.762 --> 00:05:32.197
You should be able
to sense it, too.

00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:34.402
Yes. If I focus I can,
but his energy

00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:36.840
is extremely low
and hard to zero in on.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.577
Yeah. This is chaos.

00:05:38.677 --> 00:05:40.715
What's gonna happen
to this planet, Piccolo?

00:05:40.815 --> 00:05:42.484
You're the Guardian
of Earth now, Dende!

00:05:42.585 --> 00:05:43.954
If you don't know
the answer to that,

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:45.725
how am I supposed to know?

00:05:45.825 --> 00:05:47.127
[huffs]

00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:48.396
Sorry, you're right.

00:05:48.496 --> 00:05:49.967
We're facing
an enemy so powerful

00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:52.639
he's left the Supreme Kai
lying broken in the dirt.

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:54.441
Only thing I'm
certain of is our chances

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:56.780
of stopping him are slim.

00:06:02.792 --> 00:06:05.931
So, all we did was
delay the inevitable, huh?

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:07.868
[MR. POPO] All right, they're
both resting comfortably.

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.471
They'll be back
on their feet soon.

00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:10.741
Now, let's get some food in you.

00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:12.679
Can't fight on an empty stomach.

--[KRILLIN'S stomach growls]

00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:16.085
Go on, Krillin.

[laughs]

00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:22.230
[PICCOLO] Supreme Kai.
Is there nothing we can do

00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:26.740
except hope for some sort of
miracle from these children?

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.472
Huh?

--[RIDERS yell]

No, no. No, no, no.

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.771

[yells]

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:16.372
I feel sick!

00:07:16.472 --> 00:07:18.911
Stop it! I wanna get off!

00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:20.915
[yells]
I'm stopped! Buu save me!

00:07:21.015 --> 00:07:22.585
Save me, Buu!
Save me right now!

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:24.087
If you don't,
I'll seal you right back up

00:07:24.187 --> 00:07:27.093
in your magic cocoon!
[yells]

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:29.498
What is that?

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:31.903
Some special effect.

Dragon Ball's right below.

What do you see?

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:41.122
[YAMCHA] It's probably
on that island in the lake.

00:07:41.222 --> 00:07:43.492
[BULMA] Sounds good. Set us
down gently on the beach.

00:07:43.594 --> 00:07:45.163
[YAMCHA]
Okay!

"gently," not "stupidly"!

You nearly killed us!

00:07:57.923 --> 00:08:01.028
[YAMCHA] I'm sorry! The beach
was rockier than I thought!

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:05.370
I didn't mean to
fall on you like that,

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.740
it's just that the crash
threw me into you

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.042
and I had to
hold onto something.

00:08:08.142 --> 00:08:11.148
If you wanna blame someone,
blame Yamcha!

Yup, it's all Yamcha's fault.

[KRILLIN] I wonder how much
longer the boys are gonna sleep.

[PICCOLO] At least another hour.
They've been through a lot.

00:08:42.244 --> 00:08:43.714
[KRILLIN sighs]
We all have.

00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:45.450
Majin Buu
killed Vegeta and Gohan

00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:47.822
and I haven't even
had time to cry yet.

00:08:47.922 --> 00:08:49.660
And we still don't know
what happened to Goku!

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.532
This is the worst day ever.

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:55.437
So Dende, do you mind
me bringing 18 and Marron

00:08:55.538 --> 00:08:57.875
up here to the Lookout,
to keep 'em safe?

00:08:57.975 --> 00:08:59.546
I know it might
violate the rules,

00:08:59.646 --> 00:09:02.484
but I don't want to leave
them down there, either.

00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:03.754
What do <i>you</i> think?

00:09:03.854 --> 00:09:04.889
I thought we went over this;

00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:06.560
these are
your decisions to make.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.162
Your family's
welcome here, Krillin.

00:09:08.262 --> 00:09:10.233
The only reason I still
have an Earth to protect

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:11.435
is because of all of you,

00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:13.072
so I think it's
the very least I can do.

00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:15.811
Yeah? Thanks!
I'll go get 'em right away.

00:09:15.911 --> 00:09:18.617
--[PICCOLO grunts]
--You felt that, too, huh?

Hey.

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:28.169
Guys, Goku is back!

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:33.179
[laughs]

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:34.616
[sniffles]

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:36.051
Are you okay?

00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:37.856
I'm sorta in between
worlds right now.

00:09:37.956 --> 00:09:39.693
Technically, I'm still dead.

00:09:39.793 --> 00:09:41.228
Oh yeah, I knew that.

00:09:41.328 --> 00:09:43.634
Just kinda hard to get used to.

00:09:43.734 --> 00:09:45.938
[GOKU] Krillin, can you tell me
what's been happening?

00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:48.176
[KRILLIN] What? I was hoping
you could fill <i>us</i> in.

00:09:48.276 --> 00:09:50.581
Where've you been,
and what's with those bruises?

00:09:50.681 --> 00:09:52.585
Don't worry, Goku,
I'll heal you.

00:09:52.685 --> 00:09:55.223
Thanks. I need it, Dende.

00:09:56.659 --> 00:10:05.611
[ringing]

00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:07.014
With Goku back in peak form,

00:10:07.114 --> 00:10:09.084
our chances of defeating
Majin Buu and Babidi

00:10:09.184 --> 00:10:11.388
get a lot better,
don't they, Piccolo?

00:10:11.488 --> 00:10:12.859
[MR. POPO chuckles]

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:15.463
[NARRATOR] A renewed Goku and
the remaining Z Fighters

00:10:15.564 --> 00:10:17.769
must quickly regroup,
and make a plan

00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:21.976
for defeating the destroyer
of worlds--next!

00:10:43.286 --> 00:10:45.323

C'mon, Bulma!
You can do it!

00:11:00.486 --> 00:11:01.990
That's not gonna motivate her.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.729
Yo, granny!
Make it snappy!

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:08.402
You better watch your mouth,

Hey, you big dino-bully!
You can't eat that ball!

00:11:37.127 --> 00:11:39.064
Spit it out!

Ball thief! Ball thief!

[YAMCHA grunts]

[roars]

00:11:53.226 --> 00:11:54.228
Oh yeah!

00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:55.964
[cries out]

00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:01.609
Yamcha! Thanks to you,
the last Dragon Ball

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.446
is now at the
bottom of the ocean!

00:12:03.547 --> 00:12:04.882
[YAMCHA]
I got it!

00:12:04.982 --> 00:12:09.224
Ooh! Uh, actually, that's
kind of a long way down.

00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:15.003
This suit is hand-tailored
and imported, Bulma!

00:12:15.103 --> 00:12:17.074
[BULMA]
So then take it off and jump!

00:12:17.174 --> 00:12:18.644
Yeah but my
underwear might be

00:12:18.744 --> 00:12:20.581
a little wild for mixed company.

00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:23.019
Jeez! Enough with the excuses!

00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:24.288

I'm fighting a cold.
I can't get wet.

00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:28.864
And 18?

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:31.002
My power system doesn't
react well with water,

00:12:31.102 --> 00:12:32.304
you should know that.

00:12:32.404 --> 00:12:34.876
Okay, fine! Everyone's
got an excuse today!

00:12:34.976 --> 00:12:36.513
What about you, Chichi?

00:12:36.613 --> 00:12:39.351
All right! Here we go.

00:12:39.451 --> 00:12:40.888
[screams]

to marry Gohan!

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.064
Protect your face!

All right, Videl!
Go get that ball!

If I don't dive in there,
I'm only half a man.

[CHICHI]
Hey, buster!

00:13:41.408 --> 00:13:43.881
Get your scaly tongue off

00:13:43.981 --> 00:13:45.016
[YAMCHA] Oh, I knew
I should have gotten

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.720
one size smaller.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.093

[A18 grunts]
Go!

[ROSHI hollers]

Hey guys, I don't feel
all stuffy anymore!

[ROSHI groans]

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.292
You got the ball.
Thanks, Roshi!

00:14:40.393 --> 00:14:42.330
The wise master
surprises us again!

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.736
Seems he's not as feeble
and decrepit as he looks.

00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:48.977
[ROSHI]
Yeah! Eeh...

00:14:53.085 --> 00:14:54.922
[train horn blares]

00:14:55.022 --> 00:14:56.592
Majin Buu, watch
out for the train!

00:14:56.692 --> 00:14:57.961
Turn right! No turn left!

00:14:58.061 --> 00:15:00.768
No turn right! Just turn!

00:15:00.868 --> 00:15:03.540
[BABIDI groans, yells]

00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:18.436
[PICCOLO] So yeah,
that's what happened.

00:15:18.537 --> 00:15:20.841
[GOKU] It's almost
impossible to believe.

00:15:20.941 --> 00:15:23.613
Gohan and Supreme Kai.

00:15:23.713 --> 00:15:26.686
And even Vegeta have all
been murdered by Buu!

00:15:26.786 --> 00:15:28.155
Just as Supreme Kai
warned us,

00:15:28.255 --> 00:15:30.661
Majin Buu's strength and
endurance are of a level

00:15:30.761 --> 00:15:32.598
we've never encountered before.

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:35.003
I have no doubt that
if we can't stop him,

00:15:35.103 --> 00:15:36.673
he'll wipe out Earth
then move from one planet

00:15:36.773 --> 00:15:39.645
to the next until nothing
in the universe is left.

00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:41.048
Okay, that's the negative.

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:42.885
But the positive is at least
we've got Goku back

00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:43.987
and he's alive and well.

00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:45.223
Ah! I forgot about the halo!

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:46.893
So, you're not back yet exactly.

00:15:46.993 --> 00:15:49.031
I mean, you're here,
but you're not alive-alive

00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:51.302
any more than you're
dead-dead, am I right?

00:15:51.402 --> 00:15:53.306
Ah! This is giving me
a huge headache!

00:15:53.406 --> 00:15:55.142
Here's the deal:
you're the only one left

00:15:55.242 --> 00:15:56.947
who can defeat Majin Buu.

00:15:57.047 --> 00:15:58.316
But you only have
the rest of today

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.219
before you have to
leave this world, right?

00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:02.491
So we gotta figure
this out right now.

00:16:02.592 --> 00:16:03.861
C'mon, man, let's go!

00:16:03.961 --> 00:16:06.131
Krillin. I hate to say this,

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.102
but I'm not strong
enough to stop him.

00:16:08.202 --> 00:16:10.139
[gasps]
Oh, don't say that.

00:16:10.239 --> 00:16:12.477
He's stronger than
any foe we've ever faced.

00:16:12.578 --> 00:16:14.181
Yeah. But you're Goku.

00:16:14.281 --> 00:16:16.152
Vegeta's powers and
abilities were almost

00:16:16.252 --> 00:16:18.221
on the same level as my own.

00:16:18.322 --> 00:16:21.094
And Piccolo says he used every
bit of energy he could muster,

00:16:21.194 --> 00:16:24.168
but Buu recovered easily.

00:16:24.268 --> 00:16:26.806
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing I can do.

00:16:26.906 --> 00:16:28.209
[ALL gasp]

00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:33.385
I guess that's it.
If Goku can't win, it's over.

00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:34.889
[GOKU]
Damn it! Why did Vegeta

00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:36.458
and Gohan have to die?

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:39.197
If either one of them had lived,
there might have been a way.

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:41.135
Doubt it. Even attacking
him all at once

00:16:41.235 --> 00:16:43.138
probably wouldn't have
left a scratch.

00:16:43.238 --> 00:16:45.944
Majin Buu's abilities
are of a whole other kind.

00:16:46.044 --> 00:16:48.950
[GOKU] No. I mean
we could use Fusion.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.420
--[PICCOLO grunts]
--[KRILLIN] Ah.

00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:52.625
Sorry, but I missed that.
Did you just say fuchsia?

00:16:52.725 --> 00:16:54.662
I said "Fusion."

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:57.500
Are you serious?
A real Fusion?

00:16:57.601 --> 00:16:59.204
Oh, so you're
familiar with it?

00:16:59.304 --> 00:17:01.676
Yes. I've never
seen it done in person,

00:17:01.776 --> 00:17:03.012
but when I lived
on Planet Namek,

00:17:03.112 --> 00:17:04.582
I learned the theory behind it.

00:17:04.682 --> 00:17:07.120
It's a technique perfected
by the Metamorans.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.659
Exactly! I became friends
with some Metamorans

00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:11.829
back in Otherworld,
and they taught it to me.

00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:13.099
So what does it do?

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.668
Basically, it's a
combination technique

00:17:14.768 --> 00:17:16.940
where two fighters in
similar size and power

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.276
can merge their bodies together.

00:17:18.376 --> 00:17:19.879
Okay, you just lost me.

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:21.281
Once the two fighters
are combined,

00:17:21.382 --> 00:17:23.319
they become
a new person entirely,

00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:25.456
and with control over
incredible powers.

00:17:25.557 --> 00:17:27.561
Powers they could never have
even dreamed of possessing

00:17:27.662 --> 00:17:29.431
--if they remained separate.
--Whoa.

00:17:29.532 --> 00:17:31.603
That's kind of like what
happened to you and Nail, right?

00:17:31.703 --> 00:17:33.940
You fused into
one being to get stronger?

00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:38.215
Hm! It was more like
an assimilation.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.891
[chuckles]

00:17:42.991 --> 00:17:44.929
[PICCOLO groans]

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:48.503
[yells]

00:17:51.341 --> 00:17:57.554
[breathes heavily]

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.675
Incredible! This strength!

00:18:07.775 --> 00:18:09.679
This unimaginable strength!

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:12.149
If I had known that
merging with another being

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.053
could result in
this kind of power,

00:18:14.154 --> 00:18:16.826
I would have
sought it out years ago!

00:18:17.695 --> 00:18:21.101
I am invincible!
No one can stop me now!

00:18:21.202 --> 00:18:22.571
And I'll show Frieza
what it means

00:18:22.671 --> 00:18:25.744
to face the ultimate
Namekian warrior!

00:18:25.844 --> 00:18:29.786
[laughs]

00:18:29.886 --> 00:18:32.056
[GOKU] Assimilation
is powerful, that's true.

00:18:32.156 --> 00:18:34.060
But Fusion
is even more powerful!

00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:35.396
The Metamorans
who taught it to me

00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:37.300
were these two weak,
mild-mannered guys,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.004
but once they used
the Fusion technique

00:18:39.104 --> 00:18:40.741
to combine into a new person,

00:18:40.841 --> 00:18:42.276
they became this awesome warrior

00:18:42.376 --> 00:18:44.181
with unbelievable
strength and power.

00:18:44.281 --> 00:18:45.651
That's my experience.

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:47.721
When I assimilated Nail's
essence into my own,

00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:50.126
I underwent a substantial
increase in power

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:51.261
and fighting ability.

00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:52.598
[GOKU]
Mhm!

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:54.333
[PICCOLO] If Gohan and
Vegeta were still alive,

00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:57.140
you could have fused with them
into a new hybrid Saiyan.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.710
I'm confident that
new Saiyan would have

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.247
been able to
defeat Majin Buu in a fight.

00:19:01.347 --> 00:19:03.252
Yeah. But easier
said than done.

00:19:03.352 --> 00:19:04.923
Just learning Fusion
from the Metamorans

00:19:05.023 --> 00:19:06.425
took me a whole week.

00:19:06.526 --> 00:19:08.262
Even if Vegeta
and Gohan were alive,

00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:10.868
there's no guarantee I'd teach
it to them successfully,

00:19:10.968 --> 00:19:12.170
let alone have the time.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.907
Don't forget,
I can't stay in this world

00:19:14.007 --> 00:19:15.309
for longer than a day.

00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:17.648
Plus, I only understand
the theory behind Fusion.

00:19:17.748 --> 00:19:19.652
I haven't had a chance
to actually try it.

00:19:19.752 --> 00:19:21.422
Besides no one I know
is compatible

00:19:21.523 --> 00:19:22.725
with my size and power.

00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:24.360
Uh...

00:19:25.129 --> 00:19:26.298
I guess you could say
it's my fault

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:28.402
for getting too strong, right?

00:19:28.503 --> 00:19:30.439
[KRILLIN] Actually,
it still might work.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.009
[GOKU]
How? What do you mean?

00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:33.312
Goku, you're gonna
be forced back

00:19:33.412 --> 00:19:34.882
to Otherworld soon, right?

00:19:34.982 --> 00:19:37.186
But since Vegeta and Gohan
have already crossed over,

00:19:37.287 --> 00:19:38.756
they're gonna be there
to meet you!

00:19:38.857 --> 00:19:41.428
So you can just fuse with one of
them right then and there!

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:43.767
Yeah! You're right!
That could be the answer!

00:19:43.867 --> 00:19:45.302
That won't work.

00:19:45.403 --> 00:19:48.175
Once he's back in Otherworld,
Goku can never return to ours,

00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:50.614
even if he's combined
with another person.

00:19:50.714 --> 00:19:52.483
[BOTH sigh]

00:19:58.495 --> 00:20:00.299
What about those two boys?

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:02.036
Goten and Trunks,
they're very close to being

00:20:02.136 --> 00:20:04.274
the same size and power, right?

00:20:04.374 --> 00:20:06.645
What if you were
to teach them to fuse?

00:20:06.746 --> 00:20:08.048
[ALL]
Uhhh...

00:20:08.148 --> 00:20:10.153
Wait, that could really work?

00:20:10.253 --> 00:20:11.589
Hmmm.

00:20:11.689 --> 00:20:14.160
Yes! That's it,
Mr. Popo! Yes!

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.965
That's a plan
that has a real chance!

00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:17.568
Ah! Good, there's hope!

00:20:17.668 --> 00:20:19.772
You did it, Mr. Popo!
You saved the world!

00:20:19.872 --> 00:20:23.212
Mr. Popo's a hero!
Earth is saved! Yeah!

00:20:23.312 --> 00:20:25.182
Goku. Do you have enough time?

00:20:25.282 --> 00:20:26.586
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:20:26.686 --> 00:20:28.589
I'll teach Goten and Trunks
how to master Fusion

00:20:28.689 --> 00:20:31.462
right up until I leave, but that
still might not be enough time.

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:32.865
If that's the case, Piccolo,

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.535
can you pick up where
I leave off with the boys

00:20:34.635 --> 00:20:36.071
when I go back to Otherworld?

00:20:36.171 --> 00:20:37.140
Of course.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.344
Eat that, Buu!
[laughs]

00:20:39.444 --> 00:20:41.381
We've got a shot! Heck,
we've got a great chance

00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:44.688
with those kids.
They could easily do it!

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.494
[PICCOLO]
Not so fast.

00:20:47.595 --> 00:20:49.765
We should assume that
even in the best-case scenario,

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:53.305
it might take days for Goten and
Trunks to safely master Fusion.

00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:54.509
That means
that while they learn,

00:20:54.609 --> 00:20:56.010
many people across the world

00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:57.982
will become victims
of Majin Buu.

00:20:58.082 --> 00:21:01.254
Whole countries could be
exterminated. Mass extinctions.

00:21:01.354 --> 00:21:03.827
The earth's surface
could be made uninhabitable.

00:21:03.927 --> 00:21:05.229
[gulp]

00:21:05.329 --> 00:21:06.464
This is a gamble.

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:08.268
So no matter how bad
it gets with Buu,

00:21:08.368 --> 00:21:10.139
we have to remember
that our first priority

00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:12.443
is always teaching
Goten and Trunks.

00:21:12.544 --> 00:21:14.915
Piccolo, if things go
bad to worse with Buu,

00:21:15.016 --> 00:21:17.386
as long as you guys stay safe
and have the Dragon Balls,

00:21:17.486 --> 00:21:19.390
we'll be able to
undo his damage.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:20.794
[KRILLIN]
Yeah, good point!

00:21:20.894 --> 00:21:23.065
We finally have
a reason to be hopeful.

00:21:23.165 --> 00:21:24.568
[PICCOLO]
Hm!

00:21:24.668 --> 00:21:27.306
[NARRATOR] For the first time
since Majin Buu appeared,

00:21:27.407 --> 00:21:29.344
there is hope
he can be destroyed.

00:21:29.444 --> 00:21:30.814
The fate of the world now rests

00:21:30.914 --> 00:21:33.787
in the tiny hands
of Goten and Trunks!

00:21:33.887 --> 00:21:39.330
If only the world could wait.
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.577
â™ª Closing Song â™ª

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.800
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.703
With the kids learning
to master Fusion,

00:22:48.803 --> 00:22:50.339
there's a light at
the end of the tunnel.

00:22:50.439 --> 00:22:53.078
Wait, what's that?
Why is the sky getting dark?

00:22:53.179 --> 00:22:56.586
[KIBITO] Supreme Kai, it's a
miracle you're still alive!

00:22:56.686 --> 00:22:58.055
[SUPREME KAI]
Kibito, let's move out!

00:22:58.155 --> 00:22:59.324
We must save Gohan!

00:22:59.424 --> 00:23:01.563
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:01.663 --> 00:23:05.336
"Found! A Faint Ray of Hope!
Awaken, Warriors!"

00:23:05.436 --> 00:23:06.939
[GOHAN] We're coming
for you, Majin Buu!

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:09.544
You're gonna be sorry
you messed with our world!
