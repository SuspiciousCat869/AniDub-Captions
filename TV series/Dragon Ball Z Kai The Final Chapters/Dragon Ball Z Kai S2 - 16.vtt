00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.684
[SUPREME KAI] Indeed. Long ago,
at a time when the human race

00:09:18.718 --> 00:09:22.157
was still in its infancy
here on Earth, Bibidi--

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.461
a powerful wizard
from the distant edge

00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:26.399
of the universe
first appeared.

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:29.606
With him, he brought a terrible
monster of his own creation,

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.743
who existed only to destroy.

00:09:31.777 --> 00:09:34.882
A monster by
the name of Majin Buu.

00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:37.522
[GOKU] Buu, huh? Sounds
pretty harmless to me.

00:09:37.555 --> 00:09:39.526
[SUPREME KAI] You couldn't
be more wrong, Goku.

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:41.663
Majin Buu was an instrument
wrought to bring

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:43.967
terror and destruction
to all living things,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.738
and that's exactly what he did,

00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:48.544
without a shred of
conscience to deter him.

00:09:48.577 --> 00:09:50.379
With Majin Buu
under his control,

00:09:50.413 --> 00:09:54.254
Bibidi set about to eradicate
every planet he could find.

00:09:54.287 --> 00:09:57.294
Hundreds of worlds--
empty and inhabited alike--

00:09:57.327 --> 00:09:59.566
were reduced to rubble.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.938
Entire galaxies were
erased from existence.

00:10:02.972 --> 00:10:06.813
No one could withstand the
full force of his malevolence.

00:10:08.016 --> 00:10:10.187
[VEGETA] This Buu sounds
like nothing we Saiyans

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.856
couldn't have handled.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.928
That's where
you're wrong, my friend.

00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:16.131
There used to be
four more Supreme Kai.

00:10:16.165 --> 00:10:18.637
Each had such power that
any one of us could have

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.676
defeated Frieza
with but a single blow.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.747
Strong as we were,
Majin Buu prevailed

00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:26.720
over four of us, leaving me
as the sole survivor.

00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:29.157
Whoa! Unreal!

00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:30.894
[VEGETA] Tch! How long
has this "Supreme Kai"

00:10:30.928 --> 00:10:32.799
been prowling through
my thoughts?

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:34.769
Majin Buu grew in might.

00:10:34.802 --> 00:10:37.508
In time, even Bibidi
had trouble controlling him.

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:38.944
[GOKU]
Wha--!

00:10:38.977 --> 00:10:41.048
Not trusting his creation
to obey while he was unaware,

00:10:41.082 --> 00:10:43.219
Bibidi used a spell
to seal Majin Buu

00:10:43.252 --> 00:10:45.791
within a ball and
free him again later.

00:10:45.825 --> 00:10:47.762
[KIBITO] With this spell,
Bibidi was able to

00:10:47.796 --> 00:10:50.801
transport his creation
from planet to planet.

00:10:50.834 --> 00:10:52.337
He brought the
imprisoned monster

00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:54.809
to his next target--Earth.

00:10:54.842 --> 00:10:57.147
No way! So how'd
the Earth survive?

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.282
Luck favored you.

00:10:58.315 --> 00:11:00.788
The Supreme Kai succeeded
in finishing off Bibidi

00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:03.927
but not before the wizard could
set Majin Buu in motion.

00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:05.130
Mm.

00:11:05.163 --> 00:11:07.635
Fortunately, the ball in
which Majin Buu was contained

00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:09.337
was left where it had landed.

00:11:09.371 --> 00:11:11.643
[GOHAN] But why? If that
thing was such a threat,

00:11:11.677 --> 00:11:13.046
why not destroy it?

00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:14.949
So long as he is
confined within his ball,

00:11:14.982 --> 00:11:17.387
Majin Buu is
no threat to anyone.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.360
And until now, we thought
Bibidi was the only one

00:11:20.393 --> 00:11:21.563
who could set him free.

00:11:21.596 --> 00:11:22.799
Why until now?

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:25.203
Sad to say,
a horrible fact came to light.

00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:28.176
The dark wizard Bibidi
had sired a son!

00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:29.111
[GOKU gasps]

00:11:29.144 --> 00:11:31.449
A creature just
as evil as his father!

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:33.620
The wizard Babidi!

00:11:33.654 --> 00:11:35.157
But he can't
open the ball, right?

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.929
Unfortunately, the skill
to free Majin Buu

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:39.532
did run in the family.

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:40.968
So you're saying
the kid's the one

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:43.005
controlling Spopovitch and Yamu?

00:11:43.038 --> 00:11:46.045
Yes. Babidi's heart is just
as black as his father's,

00:11:46.078 --> 00:11:48.951
and his magic is
every bit as powerful.

00:11:48.984 --> 00:11:51.523
[KRILLIN] Evil wizards and
world-destroying monsters?

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:53.459
Man, I didn't sign on for this!

00:11:53.493 --> 00:11:55.163
So basically,
we gotta keep Babidi

00:11:55.196 --> 00:11:57.568
from busting Majin Buu
outta that ball?

00:11:57.601 --> 00:12:00.307
That is correct.
Once we defeat Babidi,

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.778
the threat should
be neutralized again.

00:12:02.811 --> 00:12:05.550
Then, none will remain
with the power to release

00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:07.721
the seal on
the creature's prison.

00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:09.993
[GOKU] How strong
is this wizard guy?

00:12:10.026 --> 00:12:11.963
Physically, he is
nothing to fear--

00:12:11.996 --> 00:12:15.136
but the magic at his disposal
is powerful indeed.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.940
It was the same
with his father.

00:12:16.973 --> 00:12:19.210
Thanks to his magic,
he can harness the evil

00:12:19.244 --> 00:12:21.850
in the hearts of those
such as Yamu and Spopovitch,

00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:24.321
thereby reducing them
to mere thralls.

00:12:24.354 --> 00:12:28.262
Let us hope no one with true
power falls prey to his spell.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.049
[GOHAN] Wait, I still don't
get why Spopovitch and Yamu

00:12:55.083 --> 00:12:57.187
bothered with the World
Martial Arts Tournament.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.924
And what did they
do to me, anyway?

00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:00.728
It would seem that
freeing Majin Buu

00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:02.631
after such a long
stretch of imprisonment

00:13:02.665 --> 00:13:06.539
will require a staggeringly
large amount of pure energy.

00:13:06.573 --> 00:13:08.811
So that's why
they came after me?

00:13:08.844 --> 00:13:10.948
Babidi sent his minions
to the tournament,

00:13:10.981 --> 00:13:12.818
secure in the knowledge
that such an event

00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:14.187
would be just
the place for them

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.827
to collect the power
they needed.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.030
When you turned
Super Saiyan in our match,

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:22.003
your strength was a prize
they couldn't help but target.

00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:24.208
Knowing that Babidi would
try something of the sort,

00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:26.780
the Supreme Kai and I entered
the tournament as well,

00:13:26.814 --> 00:13:28.382
and bided our time.

00:13:28.415 --> 00:13:30.954
The ball containing
Majin Buu has vanished.

00:13:30.988 --> 00:13:33.359
We knew of its location
of old, but as of late

00:13:33.392 --> 00:13:34.529
there is no sign of it.

00:13:34.562 --> 00:13:36.599
We believe it has come
into Babidi's possession,

00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:39.506
which is why we're following
those who attacked you.

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:41.342
They will lead us to Babidi.

00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:43.479
And wheresoever
Babidi may be hiding,

00:13:43.514 --> 00:13:46.986
I would wager there the ball
shall reside as well.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.657
Hey, Videl--you all right?

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.161
[VIDEL grunts softly]

00:13:51.195 --> 00:13:52.330
What's up?

00:13:52.363 --> 00:13:54.234
Nothing, I'm fine.

00:13:57.073 --> 00:13:59.913
[GOKU] I gotta ask, if this
Majin Buu is such a bad egg,

00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:01.950
why didn't you
take care of him last time,

00:14:01.983 --> 00:14:04.622
after you had
defeated Babidi's dad?

00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:06.660
I thought it
best at the time.

00:14:06.693 --> 00:14:08.697
I didn't want to
risk breaking the seal

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.569
and releasing Majin Buu
in the process.

00:14:11.602 --> 00:14:13.774
Besides, who would disturb it?

00:14:13.807 --> 00:14:16.312
It had landed
in a remote location.

00:14:16.345 --> 00:14:19.051
And humanity, a new
presence in the universe,

00:14:19.084 --> 00:14:21.221
was busy figuring out
tools and fire.

00:14:21.255 --> 00:14:23.626
The ball was
of no threat to them.

Mm!

00:14:49.712 --> 00:14:51.181
Yeah! We got it done!

00:14:51.214 --> 00:14:53.620
When we give him
this much pure energy,

00:14:53.653 --> 00:14:55.758
Babidi will be very pleased!

00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.993
[laughs]

00:14:57.026 --> 00:14:59.498

00:17:25.557 --> 00:17:27.126
I'll miss you, Gohan!

00:17:27.159 --> 00:17:29.899
I'll be waiting for you back
at the tournament grounds!

00:17:29.932 --> 00:17:31.001
Okay!

00:17:31.034 --> 00:17:32.169
Are you ready now?

00:17:32.203 --> 00:17:33.874
[GOHAN] Yeah.
Sorry for the delay!

00:17:33.907 --> 00:17:35.443
Then let us
increase our speed

00:17:35.476 --> 00:17:37.748
so we may catch up
with the Supreme Kai.

00:17:37.781 --> 00:17:39.317
Right!

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.396
Whoa! Just look at 'em go!

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.880
You better come back
in one piece,

00:17:53.914 --> 00:17:58.388
'cause I think my dad is just
gonna have to get used to you.

00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:21.703
Ah! We caught up to 'em!

00:18:21.736 --> 00:18:23.205
Right behind you, Dad!

00:18:23.238 --> 00:18:24.809
Hey! He's okay!

00:18:24.842 --> 00:18:27.480
Glad you made it
to the party, son!

00:18:28.382 --> 00:18:29.852
Mm!

00:18:31.187 --> 00:18:33.426
I take it that
you've recovered?

00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:34.194
Uh-huh!

00:18:34.227 --> 00:18:35.530
Did you get the lowdown?

00:18:35.563 --> 00:18:37.968
It sounds like our enemy's
an especially nasty guy

00:18:38.001 --> 00:18:39.438
this time round.

00:18:39.471 --> 00:18:40.774
No kidding!

00:18:40.808 --> 00:18:43.279
[GOKU] After all these years, we
get to fight side-by-side again!

00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:44.481
[GOHAN]
Let's do it, Dad!

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:46.018
While I'm glad
they're excited an' all.

00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:49.858
I really hope we're not getting
ourselves in over our heads.

00:19:01.448 --> 00:19:02.784
Hm?

00:19:05.957 --> 00:19:07.928
They arrive.

00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:12.804
[grunts]
It's just ahead.

00:19:12.838 --> 00:19:14.474
Hm!

00:19:18.482 --> 00:19:20.688
Look! They're
starting to land!

00:19:20.721 --> 00:19:21.990
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:22.023 --> 00:19:23.459
Out in the middle
of nowhere?

00:19:23.492 --> 00:19:25.330
This is odd.
I know for certain

00:19:25.363 --> 00:19:27.801
we checked this area before.

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:49.277
Everyone! Please
suppress your energies!

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.314
Do not delay!

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:54.521
I see someone!

00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:55.791
Huh?

00:19:55.824 --> 00:19:58.128
[GOKU] Is the one
with the funny head Babidi?

00:19:58.162 --> 00:19:59.397
[SUPREME KAI]
No, it is not.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.638
That must be another
of Babidi's henchmen.

00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:04.441
Hey, you guys, does it
look like the ground

00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:07.246
has been recently dug up to
anyone else, or is it just me?

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.685
But of course! There was
no sign because Babidi

00:20:09.718 --> 00:20:11.823
hid the whole of his
spaceship underground!

00:20:11.856 --> 00:20:14.394
He was hiding under
our noses this whole time!

00:20:14.427 --> 00:20:16.566
Which means Babidi
may already know

00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:19.505
that we are privy to his plans,
and have pursued him to Earth

00:20:19.539 --> 00:20:21.441
to stop him from
unlocking the ball.

00:20:21.475 --> 00:20:24.147
Else, why would he take care
to camouflage his ship?

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.184
Why are we waiting?
We should attack now!

00:20:26.217 --> 00:20:27.755
Every second that
passes brings them

00:20:27.788 --> 00:20:30.660
one step closer
to releasing Majin Buu!

00:20:30.693 --> 00:20:33.567
[SUPREME KAI] No. We wait
for Babidi to show himself.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.738
He'll perform the unsealing
outside the ship,

00:20:35.771 --> 00:20:37.642
so as to not destroy it
in the process of

00:20:37.675 --> 00:20:41.015
freeing the creature.
Patience, Piccolo.

00:20:41.048 --> 00:20:42.684
[gasps]

00:20:55.409 --> 00:20:57.748
It looks like
somebody's coming out.

00:20:57.781 --> 00:21:07.801
[electric motor humming]

00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:24.101
[eerie music plays]

00:21:24.134 --> 00:21:25.504
[gasps]

00:21:25.537 --> 00:21:27.674
[NARRATOR] The Supreme Kai and
the others have gathered

00:21:27.707 --> 00:21:30.647
to prevent the release
of the monster Majin Buu.

00:21:30.681 --> 00:21:32.584
But first, they'll
have to contend with

00:21:32.617 --> 00:21:35.557
the fearsome villains
that stand in their way--

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.963
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:45.429 --> 00:22:46.899
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.933 --> 00:22:49.571
So that's Babidi, huh?
The wizard guy who's trying

00:22:49.605 --> 00:22:51.775
to let Majin Buu
out of his ball.

00:22:51.809 --> 00:22:55.282
Huh? Whoa! Who's that
scary guy next to him?

00:22:55.316 --> 00:22:57.888
[SUPREME KAI] No!
If Babidi's enslaved him,

00:22:57.921 --> 00:23:00.226
then it's even worse
than I had thought!

00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:02.897
[GOKU] Next time
on Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:08.909
[GOHAN] Look out!
He's headed straight for us!
