00:10:52.104 --> 00:10:53.439
All right!

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:00.319
Huh? Instant Transmission?

00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:02.691
--[BABA] Well, good luck!
--[VEGETA grunts]

00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:03.760
[GOKU]
Vegeta!

00:11:03.793 --> 00:11:05.263
[VEGETA]
Uh!

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:08.269
Awesome! Finally,
something's going our way!

00:11:08.302 --> 00:11:10.006
What? Kakarot's here?

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.141
Ah! Goku!

00:11:11.174 --> 00:11:12.144
[GOKU]
Yo.

00:11:12.177 --> 00:11:14.147
How in the blazes
did you come back?

00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:16.820
You're not supposed to be
running around on Earth again.

00:11:16.853 --> 00:11:19.859
In fact, it violates
every law of the universe!

00:11:19.892 --> 00:11:22.330
What?! How did
Vegeta get back there?

00:11:22.363 --> 00:11:23.934
And with perfect timing, too.

00:11:23.967 --> 00:11:26.038
All he and Goku
need to do now is merge

00:11:26.072 --> 00:11:28.009
and the battle
against Buu is won!

00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:29.579
[KIBITO KAI] But how
could he have come back?

00:11:29.613 --> 00:11:30.848
Everyone who goes to Hell

00:11:30.881 --> 00:11:32.852
has their soul cleansed
and memories erased

00:11:32.886 --> 00:11:34.989
before they're turned
into a new life form.

00:11:35.022 --> 00:11:37.695
How could someone like Vegeta
have been spared?

00:11:37.729 --> 00:11:39.498
Great King Yemma
must have intervened

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.235
with a last second reprieve.

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:43.540
He may look goofy,
but when he comes through,

00:11:43.573 --> 00:11:50.386
boy does he come through!
[laughing]

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:07.187
[SUPER BUU laughing]
You really think you can hide?

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.326
Whether you cower in a hole,
or flee to some distant planet,

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.598
I'll stop at nothing
to hunt you down!

00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:15.436
And when I find you,
I will end you!

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:18.208
[MR. SATAN, BEE, DENDE groan]

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:21.215
[DENDE]
I think we're in the clear.

00:12:21.248 --> 00:12:23.420
Hey, so uh, that pal
of yours in the orange

00:12:23.453 --> 00:12:24.722
is named Goku, right?

00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:25.957
It looked like
he was gonna give me

00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:27.528
something important
a minute ago.

00:12:27.562 --> 00:12:28.931
What was that thing?

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:31.068
What? Forget about that--
it doesn't matter anymore.

00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:33.206
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've gotta find him!

00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:35.944
Whoa, hold on! You can't
just leave me here all alone.

00:12:35.978 --> 00:12:37.982
Please let me
tag along with you!

00:12:38.015 --> 00:12:39.785
And don't you say no.

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:41.923
[barking]

00:12:41.957 --> 00:12:43.426
Goku, how did this happen?

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:46.666
Not only are you back on Earth,
you don't have a halo?

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.002
Are you alive again?

00:12:48.036 --> 00:12:50.808
Uh... Oh yeah, that.
It's a long story.

00:12:50.841 --> 00:12:53.345
See, in exchange for the life
of this Elder Kai,

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:55.282
I got to come back--

00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:59.057
[VEGETA grunts]

00:13:02.798 --> 00:13:04.300
I'll fill you in
on the rest later.

00:13:04.334 --> 00:13:07.775
Right now, we gotta worry
about Buu coming this way fast!

00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:09.411
It's safer if you leave, Baba!

00:13:09.444 --> 00:13:11.081
Right. Thanks for the tip, Goku.

00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:13.152
I best be going now.
Good luck, boys,

00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:15.924
I'll cheer you on
from Otherworld! Bye!

00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:18.830
Honestly, Vegeta, I thought
you'd been sent down to Hell

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.499
and had your memory
wiped for sure.

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:22.470
That was pretty awesome
thinking by King Yama

00:13:22.504 --> 00:13:23.840
to keep you around like this.

00:13:23.873 --> 00:13:25.778
You must feel pretty lucky, huh?

00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:27.280
[VEGETA grunts]

00:13:27.314 --> 00:13:29.619
There's not much time!
Don't be difficult, Vegeta,

00:13:29.653 --> 00:13:33.459
just put this on your right ear
before it's too late! Please!

00:13:33.493 --> 00:13:34.662
What for?

00:13:34.695 --> 00:13:36.064
If we're both
wearing this earring,

00:13:36.098 --> 00:13:38.570
we can instantly merge
into an all-new fighter.

00:13:38.603 --> 00:13:40.039
Merge with you?

00:13:40.073 --> 00:13:41.543
[GOKU] Yes! And our powers
won't just be added together,

00:13:41.576 --> 00:13:45.550
they'll be multiplied. We'll be
the strongest fighter ever!

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:50.360
Ridiculous. Our fates ride on
me wearing an earring?

00:13:50.393 --> 00:13:52.063
But, Vegeta!

00:13:52.096 --> 00:13:53.566
[SUPER BUU] I sense
you've managed to find

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.102
another powerful warrior!

00:13:55.136 --> 00:13:57.775
Well, go on with your silly
fusion--it won't matter.

00:13:57.809 --> 00:14:00.046
Nothing can stop me now.
You'll see!

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:03.486
Please, Vegeta. This is the
only way to defeat Majin Buu--

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.922
there's no time for your ego!

00:14:04.956 --> 00:14:07.695
Why do I have to merge
with you of all people?!

00:14:07.729 --> 00:14:12.036
If our survival really hinges on
that, I'd rather be obliterated!

00:14:15.043 --> 00:14:17.581
Ha-ha! I found you!

00:14:17.614 --> 00:14:19.785
Crap, he's here!

00:14:20.353 --> 00:14:22.525
If you couldn't stop him
on your own last time,

00:14:22.558 --> 00:14:24.327
it's not happening now!

00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:25.831
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.635
I'm begging you.
We have to do this!

00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:31.308
I said no. It's never
going to happen, Kakarot!

00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:34.481
Augh!

00:14:34.516 --> 00:14:36.719
Give me your worst!

00:14:55.156 --> 00:14:57.060
[SUPER BUU]
Hm. I know that face.

00:14:57.093 --> 00:14:58.663
We fought before, didn't we?

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:01.536
When I first hatched
on this world?

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.841
It was pointless to come back.

00:15:03.874 --> 00:15:06.344
You're no match for me now!

00:15:09.785 --> 00:15:12.323
[DENDE]
Hang in there, Tien.

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:18.068
Good, I wasn't too late.

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:22.878
Dende, thanks. I owe you one.

00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:25.518
Where's Goku?

00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:27.053
And where's Majin Buu?

00:15:27.086 --> 00:15:29.926
Goku teleported himself
with Instant Transmission.

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:31.762
Then Buu flew off to find him.

00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:33.231
[TIEN]
I see.

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:34.902
[MR. SATAN] What? How many
magic tricks do you guys know?

00:15:34.936 --> 00:15:36.271
Whoa! Hey.

00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:40.013
[SUPER BUU] What's wrong, boys?
Lost your nerve?

00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:41.415
[GOKU]
No, Vegeta! Don't!

00:15:41.448 --> 00:15:43.486
You couldn't stop him before,
and this version of Buu

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.791
is way more powerful
than the one you faced.

00:15:45.824 --> 00:15:48.128
Look at him, you know it's true!

00:15:48.162 --> 00:15:49.532
[SUPER BUU]
Heh.

00:15:49.565 --> 00:15:51.301
Of course I realize
he's stronger than me,

00:15:51.334 --> 00:15:53.305
I'm not some power-blind idiot!

00:15:53.338 --> 00:15:54.809
But if you think I'll back down,

00:15:54.842 --> 00:15:58.015
then you still
don't know me at all!

00:15:58.048 --> 00:16:01.556
I'll stand against my enemies
until my final breath!

00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:03.159
I fight for my own pride

00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:07.768
and the honor of
the whole Saiyan race!

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:17.186
[VEGETA yelling]

00:16:26.506 --> 00:16:27.541

Damn it!

00:16:27.574 --> 00:16:29.545
No! Don't, Vegeta!

[yells]

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.146
[VEGETA]
Oh, crap!

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:52.423
[yells]

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:01.876
Go merge! I won't stop you!

00:17:01.909 --> 00:17:04.347
I'd like a little
challenge today!

00:17:09.124 --> 00:17:10.827
[SUPER BUU]
Now die!

00:17:14.903 --> 00:17:22.818
[laughing]

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.724
[GOKU]
Stop, Vegeta!

00:17:25.758 --> 00:17:27.962
If you really want
to honor the Saiyan race,

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:31.268
then give yourself
a true chance to win!

00:17:32.705 --> 00:17:34.174
Vegeta, you know I'm right!

00:17:34.207 --> 00:17:37.514
Put on this Potara earring, now!

00:17:37.547 --> 00:17:39.183
Please, Vegeta!

00:17:39.217 --> 00:17:40.319
I don't know why
you're so angry,

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:42.323
but this isn't the time
to be stubborn!

00:17:42.356 --> 00:17:44.628
Majin Buu will destroy
everything we know.

00:17:44.662 --> 00:17:46.766
Everything there is!

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.937
I can't forgive you!

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.708
When we fought,
you had the ability to reach

00:17:50.741 --> 00:17:52.043
a whole new level of power,

00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:53.980
but instead you hid it
from me completely

00:17:54.013 --> 00:17:56.084
and let me believe
we were equals!

00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:58.322
I saw it all from
Otherworld, Kakarot.

00:17:58.356 --> 00:18:00.192
You let me win so you
could keep the secret

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:02.497
of Super Saiyan 3
all to yourself!

00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:04.635
I hate every
fiber of your being!

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:08.109
How could I merge with someone
who's handled me like a child?

00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:09.879
Look. I'm sorry, Vegeta.

00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:11.181
But I wasn't trying to trick you

00:18:11.214 --> 00:18:13.352
or keep secrets
from you or anything.

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:15.924
I just couldn't stay at
Super Saiyan 3 for long and--

00:18:15.957 --> 00:18:18.730
I don't want to hear excuses!
You held yourself back

00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:21.803
like I didn't even
deserve your full power!

00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:24.107
It was complete humiliation!

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.646
All this bickering
is getting on my nerves.

00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:28.415
If you're not going
to merge and attack,

00:18:28.449 --> 00:18:30.754
I might as well
finish you both off!

00:18:30.787 --> 00:18:33.291
[yells]

00:18:39.538 --> 00:18:42.511
[VEGETA]
Damn it! Take this!

00:18:42.544 --> 00:18:44.715
[yells]

00:18:50.928 --> 00:18:56.906
[SUPER BUU laughing]

00:19:09.164 --> 00:19:12.671
It's no use. We can't
defeat him separately.

00:19:14.809 --> 00:19:17.180
[GOKU] He's going to destroy
the entire Earth!

00:19:17.213 --> 00:19:20.153
Are you really
gonna let that happen?

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:21.689
Well, why should I care?

00:19:21.722 --> 00:19:25.697
Vegeta! Buu has absorbed every
person we ever cared about.

00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:28.770
Krillin and Chichi, too.
Even Bulma!

00:19:28.803 --> 00:19:30.173
[gasps]

00:19:30.206 --> 00:19:33.045
[GOKU] Piccolo.
My sons, Gohan and Goten.

00:19:33.078 --> 00:19:34.180
And your boy, Trunks.

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:36.218
They're all trapped
in Majin Buu!

00:19:36.251 --> 00:19:38.055
They're the reason
for Buu's power.

00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:39.826
You can't fight him alone!

00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:43.700
If we lose, our friends
and families died for nothing!

00:19:43.733 --> 00:19:46.806
Is that what you want?
To go out like helpless victims,

00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:49.878
just so you can keep nursing
your foolish grudge?

00:19:56.593 --> 00:19:59.363
How do you want this
to end, Vegeta?

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.613
[VEGETA grunts]

00:20:06.646 --> 00:20:08.884
If we fuse, how sure
are you we can kill Buu

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.253
once and for all?

00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:12.157
Look, I can't
give you a guarantee.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.492
All I know for certain

00:20:13.526 --> 00:20:16.766
is it'll multiply
our strength exponentially!

00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:23.045
Are you ready for me
to put you out of your misery!

00:20:23.078 --> 00:20:24.280
[yells]

00:20:24.314 --> 00:20:26.318
Hurry. The earring!

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.157
What are you waiting for?
Give it to me now!

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.860
All right, catch!

00:20:32.163 --> 00:20:34.100
I'm done playing games with you!

00:20:34.134 --> 00:20:37.106
Damn it. You said
the right ear, yes?

00:20:37.139 --> 00:20:39.912
Oh, the one thing I forgot.
Once we merge into a new body,

00:20:39.946 --> 00:20:41.148
the fusion is permanent--

00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:43.051
we can never be
two separate people again.

00:20:43.084 --> 00:20:44.054
You got that?

00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:45.724
What? Seriously?!

00:20:45.758 --> 00:20:47.427
Thanks for the info!

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.032
Of course you wait
'til the end to tell me that.

00:20:50.066 --> 00:20:52.671
Your lives are at an end!

00:20:52.704 --> 00:20:54.408
It's on! What now?

00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:57.179
Thanks, Vegeta. Here we go!

00:20:57.213 --> 00:20:59.751
[laughing]

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.291
[BOTH]
Augh!

00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:05.697
Aah--huh?

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.750
[yells]

00:21:23.934 --> 00:21:26.238
All right!

00:21:26.271 --> 00:21:27.707
[SUPER BUU]
Uuuh!

00:21:27.741 --> 00:21:30.614
[NARRATOR] Goku and Vegeta
have fused into a new fighter!

00:21:30.647 --> 00:21:32.951
The greatest duel in
the history of the universe

00:21:32.985 --> 00:21:37.027
is about to begin!
Majin Buu versus Vegetto!

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.531
Next, Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.366 --> 00:21:45.543
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:47.099
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:48.469
Well, it took some convincing,

00:22:48.503 --> 00:22:50.607
but Vegeta finally agreed
to fuse with me!

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.143
Now let's take care of Buu!

00:22:52.176 --> 00:22:54.280
[SUPER BUU] All right, that's
enough of your showing off!

00:22:54.313 --> 00:22:55.717
You think merging with someone

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.453
I already sent
to Otherworld once

00:22:57.487 --> 00:22:59.157
is enough to take me down?

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.595
[GOKU]
Next time, on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:04.735 --> 00:23:06.539
[GOHAN] Nobody in
the universe can stand up

00:23:06.573 --> 00:23:09.443
to the combined might
of Vegeta and my dad!
