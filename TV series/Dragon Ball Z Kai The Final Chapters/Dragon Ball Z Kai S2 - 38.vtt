But your remaining time

00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:20.675

than 30 minutes.

If I were you, I'd be packing
my bags and saying my goodbyes.

[NARRATOR] With only a
short time left on Earth,

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.103
Goku began training
Trunks and Goten,

00:00:35.203 --> 00:00:37.108
attempting to teach them Fusion,

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:39.445
a maneuver that just might
be the secret weapon

the boys need to
take down Majin Buu.

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:44.890
First, step three paces
back from each other

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.461
so your arms can
swing free and clear.

00:00:47.562 --> 00:00:49.700
Then, put out your arms out,
same direction,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.504
parallel to the ground.

00:00:51.604 --> 00:00:54.408
Fu-- Swing your arms
in the opposite direction,

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:56.513
while moving back toward
each other three paces

00:00:56.613 --> 00:00:58.751
so you're standing
really close again.

00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:00.220
--sion!

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.725
Make fists. And pay close
attention to your leg angles.

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:04.195
Ha!

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:06.366
Then, touch your index fingers
and bend like I'm doing.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.972
But remember to keep this
angle going with your legs.

00:01:09.072 --> 00:01:11.042
The key is stretching
your outside leg.

00:01:11.143 --> 00:01:14.281

This looks so weird.

Really?

00:10:22.377 --> 00:10:23.680
[GOKU]
But in return,

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.551
you gotta work extra-hard
at your Fusion training.

00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:26.653
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:28.122
Don't do this, Goku!

00:10:28.222 --> 00:10:30.928
You'll burn through all the time
you have left on Earth!

that much more time anyway.

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:43.118
First up, I go Super Saiyan.

[BOTH]
Mh-hm.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.065
Next comes the level
beyond Super Saiyan,

00:10:49.165 --> 00:10:51.570
which I actually call
Super Saiyan Two.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.073
[BOTH]
Huh.

00:10:53.173 --> 00:10:54.274
Then...

That is so cool!

I'm fine, Piccolo,
don't sweat it.

00:11:59.772 --> 00:12:01.609
Now for your end of the deal.

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:03.813
Let's get back to
the Fusion training.

00:12:03.913 --> 00:12:06.687
[BABA] All right, Goku.
Time's just about up.

00:12:06.787 --> 00:12:08.389
Gotta go back to Otherworld.

00:12:08.489 --> 00:12:09.892
Already?

00:12:09.992 --> 00:12:11.963
Well, you squandered the last
of the time you were given.

00:12:12.063 --> 00:12:14.401
I've warned you a million times.

00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:15.971
All right.

00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:18.811
Hey, Piccolo, I hate to do this,
but can you take it from here?

00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:20.079
Knowing them,
they should finish up

00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:21.783
the Fusion training
sometime tomorrow.

00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:23.820
But, Goku.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.223
Once I'm outta here,

00:12:25.323 --> 00:12:27.261
you'll be the only one
who can teach it to them.

00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:29.665
You have to.

00:12:29.765 --> 00:12:31.001
All right.

00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:33.707
Okay, Trunks and Goten,
it's up to you guys now.

00:12:33.807 --> 00:12:34.942
There's nobody else out there

00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:36.847
who can defeat Buu
and save the world.

00:12:36.947 --> 00:12:38.416
So train your
butts off, you got it?

00:12:38.517 --> 00:12:39.819

Yes!

Chichi, you gotta get up,
I'm telling you!

00:12:43.694 --> 00:12:45.597
Wake up!

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:47.500
Where--? Where am I?
What happened?

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:50.541
There'll be plenty of time to
fill you in on everything later,

00:12:50.641 --> 00:12:54.782
but any minute now, Goku's gonna
be heading back to Otherworld!

00:12:54.882 --> 00:12:57.487
What?! He's leaving already?!

00:12:57.588 --> 00:12:59.191
I'll kill him again!

00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:00.827
[ROSHI] It's too bad
you didn't get a chance

00:13:00.927 --> 00:13:03.499
to kick back and relax
with us while you were here.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.003
[BULMA]
Goodbye, Goku.

00:13:05.103 --> 00:13:06.205
Goku.

00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:07.775
I know it sounds funny
telling you to take care,

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:09.245
but take care anyway.

00:13:09.345 --> 00:13:10.046
Thanks.

[OX KING groans]

00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:19.532
Oh, Goku. You can't leave
at a time like this.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:21.703
What am I gonna do
with Gohan dead?

00:13:21.803 --> 00:13:24.307
Chichi, it won't be so bad.

00:13:24.407 --> 00:13:26.880
After all, you've still
got Goten, don't you?

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.382
Yeah, I know.

00:13:28.482 --> 00:13:31.022
But you're sending him off
to get killed by Majin Buu.

00:13:31.122 --> 00:13:32.457
That's not gonna happen.

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:34.529
Once he's mastered the
technique he's working on,

00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:36.365
there's no chance of him losing.

00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:37.735
And don't worry.

00:13:37.835 --> 00:13:41.375
When I see Gohan in Otherworld,
I'll tell him you love him.

00:13:41.475 --> 00:13:43.079
Guys, I think--

00:13:43.179 --> 00:13:45.951
I think Gohan is safe.
He's out there somewhere.

Huh? How come?

I guess-- I just have a feeling.

I really wish you were right,

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.702
but I'm afraid
it's not possible.

00:13:54.802 --> 00:13:57.073
We would've sensed
his energy. Sorry.

00:13:57.173 --> 00:13:58.844
Still, how great
would it be if he was?

00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:00.647
Yeah, it would be.

00:14:00.748 --> 00:14:03.653
Well, come on, Goku.
Let's get going.

00:14:03.754 --> 00:14:04.421

from your daddy, don't you?

Is that right?

Well, why didn't
you just say so?

Goten, take good care
of your mom for me.

and this Fusion business...

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:27.688
...it seems this situation
is past the point

00:15:27.789 --> 00:15:31.596
where any of us are capable
of helping the cause at all.

00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:34.168
Yeah, I guess this
time there isn't much

00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:38.042
for us to do besides--Eh,
let's see here.

Oh, that's not necessarily true.

00:15:44.054 --> 00:15:46.960
I'm sure there must be
something we can do.

[GOKU groaning]

00:16:31.582 --> 00:16:33.987
Are you sure you made
the right call back there?

00:16:34.087 --> 00:16:36.526
I mean, really, entrusting
the fate of the planet

00:16:36.626 --> 00:16:37.862
to little boys is risky.

00:16:37.962 --> 00:16:39.464
I know what those kids
are capable of,

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:41.235
and I've got complete
confidence in them.

00:16:41.335 --> 00:16:42.838
As long as they get
the hang of Fusion,

00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:44.542
they can definitely
beat Majin Buu.

00:16:44.642 --> 00:16:45.744
I guess it makes sense.

00:16:45.844 --> 00:16:48.249
After all, Earth should be
protected by the people

on Earth, right?

And they just keep coming
and coming, one after another.

Actually, there's
a decent chance

just about every earthling's
gonna wind up here pretty soon.

Right before this crazy
flood of earthlings

00:18:49.357 --> 00:18:52.631
Just a second.

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:54.702
Hmm... Gohan.

00:18:54.802 --> 00:19:00.748
Gohan. Gohan. Gohan.

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:01.916
Nope.

00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:03.486
The kid hasn't been here.

00:19:03.587 --> 00:19:06.560
And come to think of it, if your
son had shown up at my desk,

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.830
that's something I'd
be sure to remember.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.003
So then... that must mean...

00:19:12.103 --> 00:19:16.111
He's not dead! Ha-ha!
Gohan's alive!

00:19:16.211 --> 00:19:17.614
Yes, however,

00:19:17.714 --> 00:19:20.119
we did have a real piece of
work come in here earlier.

00:19:20.219 --> 00:19:22.858
Name's Dabura.
King of the Demon World.

00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:25.162
[grunts] Dabura?

00:19:25.262 --> 00:19:27.433
[YEMMA] Yeah, imagine
him turning up dead.

00:19:27.535 --> 00:19:30.808
Now normally I'd send a creep
like him directly to Hell.

00:19:30.908 --> 00:19:32.343
Ha, ha.

00:19:32.444 --> 00:19:34.447
But, you know, Hell's an awful
lot like the Demon World.

00:19:34.548 --> 00:19:38.022
He'd feel way too at home there,
so I sent him to heaven instead,

00:19:38.122 --> 00:19:38.990
just to mess with him.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.796
[chuckles] That's awesome!

00:19:41.896 --> 00:19:44.434
Thanks for your help! Bye now!

00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:51.181
[GOKU]
Yahoo! Gohan's still alive!

00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:53.418
That Videl girl's
intuition was spot-on!

00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:55.156
Guess we shoulda
listened to her.

00:19:55.256 --> 00:19:57.126
Woo-hoo!

00:19:57.226 --> 00:20:00.968
My boy took on Majin Buu
and he survived!

00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:03.940
Well done. I'm so proud.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.442
Hm?

00:20:05.543 --> 00:20:07.548
What I don't get though...
is how come I couldn't sense

00:20:07.648 --> 00:20:10.052
even a hint of his
presence back on Earth.

00:20:10.152 --> 00:20:11.822
What was that about?

00:20:11.922 --> 00:20:14.294
Uh?

00:20:14.394 --> 00:20:18.570
It's Gohan's energy!
I'd know it anywhere!

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.705
That's Gohan!

00:20:19.805 --> 00:20:22.076
But why would I be able
to feel his energy here?

00:20:22.176 --> 00:20:23.546
Huh, where is he?

00:20:23.646 --> 00:20:25.951
He's not in Otherworld
or at King Kai's place.

00:20:26.051 --> 00:20:27.554
So where could he--?

00:20:27.654 --> 00:20:29.357
Ahh.

00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:49.064
Yippee, yippee! Yippee, yippee!

00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:52.571
Yippee, yippee! Yippee!
Yippee, yippee!

00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:57.615
Hm. That so fun!
What Buu make go bye-bye now?

00:20:57.715 --> 00:20:59.751
Yahoo!

00:21:03.492 --> 00:21:06.031
Buu make more city go boom!

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:08.770
Buu make every city boom!

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:09.905
[laughing]

00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:13.445
[NARRATOR] As Majin Buu's
rampage continues,

00:21:13.546 --> 00:21:15.550
off on the World of the Kais,

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.656
at the far reaches
of the universe...

00:21:18.756 --> 00:21:20.527
[GOHAN grunting]

00:21:20.627 --> 00:21:22.396
[NARRATOR]
...Gohan is hard at work,

00:21:22.497 --> 00:21:24.768
practicing with
the mighty Z-Sword.

00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:29.344
While at the Lookout, the boys
resume their Fusion training.

00:21:29.444 --> 00:21:33.285
Hurry, Gohan, Goten, and Trunks.

00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:35.289
Only you can save the Earth

00:21:35.389 --> 00:21:40.032
from total destruction--
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:46.966
[GOKU]
Hey, it's me, Goku!

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:49.204
What the heck are you
doin' out here, Gohan?

00:22:49.304 --> 00:22:50.673
I've been lookin'
all over for you.

00:22:50.773 --> 00:22:52.711
Are you doing some kind
of super-secret training

00:22:52.812 --> 00:22:54.715
with Supreme Kai
and what's-his-face?

00:22:54.815 --> 00:22:57.755
[PICCOLO] Goten! Trunks! You've
gotta learn this Fusion now!

00:22:57.855 --> 00:23:00.560
[GOKU]
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:04.134 --> 00:23:06.606
[GOHAN] I wonder how good
I have to get with this Z-Sword

00:23:06.706 --> 00:23:09.010
before I can
defeat Majin Buu.
