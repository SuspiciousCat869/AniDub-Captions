This is no longer a battle
royale in any sense of the term!

00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:43.293
This is a one-on-one match
between Mighty Mask

00:12:43.326 --> 00:12:46.834
and Number 18
for the whole ball of wax!

00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:49.037
I just want my momma.

[bellows]

00:13:05.905 --> 00:13:08.442
Get us outta the way!

00:13:08.476 --> 00:13:09.713
[MR. SATAN]
Huh?

00:13:09.746 --> 00:13:12.718

Uh?

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:21.335
[MR. SATAN]
Huh?

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.376
[laughs]

00:13:26.478 --> 00:13:28.015
[A18 grunts]

00:13:28.048 --> 00:13:30.220
We're never gonna
win like this!

00:13:30.253 --> 00:13:33.794
[GOTEN] I betcha if we turn
Super Saiyan, it'll be a snap!

00:13:33.828 --> 00:13:35.196
Ha! You're a genius!

00:13:35.229 --> 00:13:36.900
As long as we're
wearing this disguise,

00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:39.471
nobody'll know we did it!
All right! You ready?

00:13:39.505 --> 00:13:40.373
[GOTEN]
Yup!

00:13:40.406 --> 00:13:41.943
[A18 grunts]

00:13:45.317 --> 00:13:46.719
Let's do this thing!

00:13:46.753 --> 00:13:47.956
[GOTEN]
Okay!

00:13:47.989 --> 00:13:51.863
[TRUNKS, GOTEN bellow]

00:13:54.768 --> 00:13:56.906
Why is he glowing?
What happened?

00:13:56.939 --> 00:13:58.142
[ROSHI]
Mmm!

00:13:58.175 --> 00:14:02.250
Look-it the mask guy!
He's all yellow!

00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:07.528
Even with going
Super Saiyan,

00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:08.831
it's hard to fight like this.

00:14:08.864 --> 00:14:10.801
I think we'll need
to use an energy blast!

00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:13.707
[GOTEN] Huh? Are you sure
that's a good idea?

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.176
Yeah, it's fine!

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.414
It's not like we're fighting a
regular human being, remember?

00:14:17.447 --> 00:14:19.350
This is Number 18!

00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:24.127
Hm! Now I get what's going on.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.067
Somebody just went Super Saiyan.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.776
If you boys want to play rough,
that's fine by me.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:32.945
[GOTEN]
Make sure you don't hit her

00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:34.783
with everything
you've got, Trunks!

00:14:34.816 --> 00:14:37.086

00:14:56.726 --> 00:14:57.996
I knew it.

00:14:58.029 --> 00:14:59.430
Darn it! I missed her!

00:14:59.464 --> 00:15:02.705
[GOTEN]
We gotta keep attacking her!

00:15:02.738 --> 00:15:04.207
[A18]
You have got to be kidding me!

00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:06.345
That energy blast
was incredibly fast,

00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:08.550
and packed so much
destructive force!

00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:10.487
I didn't know those two boys
were anywhere near

00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:13.225
as strong as this!
If I mean to win this fight,

00:15:13.259 --> 00:15:15.597
I need to take
the initiative now!

00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:18.036
You sure remind me
of two little kids I know

00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:19.471
named Trunks and Goten!

00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:23.012
[TRUNKS, GOTEN] Ooh!
She knows! This isn't good!

00:15:23.045 --> 00:15:25.483

[yells]

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.069
Number 18's attack
tore Mighty Mask in half!

00:15:35.103 --> 00:15:36.906
[grunts]
What were you thinking?

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.443
You were supposed to
go the other way!

00:15:38.476 --> 00:15:40.480
Maybe you should've
gone the way I did!

00:15:40.514 --> 00:15:43.118
Why you little--!
Listen up, Goten!

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.156
You are in so much
trouble, mister!

00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:47.628
Trunks! What in the world
are you doing up there?

00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:48.864
[ROSHI chuckles]

00:15:48.897 --> 00:15:51.469
I knew it was those two
from the beginning.

00:15:51.503 --> 00:15:54.040
So, what do we do
now that they know it's us?

00:15:54.073 --> 00:15:55.142
We go all out!

00:15:55.176 --> 00:15:57.446
We might as well
win if we're busted!

00:15:59.585 --> 00:16:01.455
--Let's get her!
--Yeah!

00:16:08.904 --> 00:16:11.341
Uh. Hey, you kids
fighting as Mighty Mask!

00:16:11.374 --> 00:16:13.847
You're disqualified! Stop it!

00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:16.018
Wait. We're disqualified?

00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:18.355
Uh-oh. Time to go!

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:19.725
[GOTEN]
Yeah.

00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:24.401
You get back here, Goten!
Don't fly away from your mother!

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:27.575
You are grounded!
Do you hear me, buddy?

Oookay.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.917
What an amazing match!
Right, folks?

00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:50.486
But, Mighty Mask
is disqualified

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.758
on the grounds of being
too many people!

00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:55.764
Now, Mr. Satan and Number 18
are the only fighters left

00:16:55.797 --> 00:16:59.906
in our battle royale!
The championship is on the line!
