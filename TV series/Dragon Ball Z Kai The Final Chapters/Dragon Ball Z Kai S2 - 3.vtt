I had this idea you might
be Great Saiyaman,

00:12:44.494 --> 00:12:46.867

to see what you'd do.

Huh. Interesting.

glad they weren't so tough.

Mr. Satan's daughter.

be so mean about it.

00:19:27.735 --> 00:19:28.870
I'm just trying to help.

00:19:28.903 --> 00:19:29.572
I mean--

00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:30.540
Knock it off!

00:19:30.574 --> 00:19:32.010
Will someone take
care of the meddling

00:19:32.043 --> 00:19:33.747
cosmonaut or do I
have to do everything?

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.951
[GANG GUY 3A] Sir!
[GANG GUY 3B] I'm on it!

00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:38.288
[yells, groans]

00:19:39.424 --> 00:19:40.760
You!

00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:45.670
They didn't hurt you
did they, Mr. Mayor?

00:19:45.704 --> 00:19:48.009
Nah. I'm all right.

00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:49.010
Freak!

00:19:49.043 --> 00:19:50.780

[ROCK]
Playtime's over.

00:20:10.352 --> 00:20:14.094
[VIDEL groaning]

00:20:14.127 --> 00:20:15.997
Put her down!

00:20:16.532 --> 00:20:20.305
[groans]

00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:24.749
[GOHAN]
Wow, that's, uh--

00:20:24.782 --> 00:20:27.621
She could really teach her
dad a thing or two, huh?

00:20:27.655 --> 00:20:28.623
[chuckles]

00:20:28.656 --> 00:20:30.493
[OFFICER 3B]
Book 'em, boys.

00:20:30.527 --> 00:20:31.696
[OFFICER 3C]
Watch your head.

00:20:31.729 --> 00:20:33.265
Wouldn't want
you to hurt yourself.

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:34.401
[OFFICER 3A] Hey, did anyone
read them their rights?

00:20:34.434 --> 00:20:35.837
[GOHAN]
Great Saiyaman away!

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.607
[VIDEL] Hang on.
[GOHAN] Huh?

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.612
Thank you.

00:20:39.645 --> 00:20:40.781
Oh. Yeah, sure.

00:20:40.814 --> 00:20:42.483
This doesn't get you
off the hook for being

00:20:42.517 --> 00:20:44.555
all coy about
your secret identity.

00:20:44.589 --> 00:20:47.093
One way or another I'm
gonna find out who you are.

00:20:47.126 --> 00:20:48.429
[laughs]

00:20:48.462 --> 00:20:51.034
Well, best 'o luck. Bye!

00:21:03.893 --> 00:21:05.997
What? He ditched again?

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.734
Uh huh. Slipped
away like a ninja

00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:09.237
while the rest of
us were freaking out

00:21:09.271 --> 00:21:10.540
over the earthquake.

00:21:10.574 --> 00:21:12.745
What's really weird is
that he showed back up

00:21:12.778 --> 00:21:14.046
right before you did.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.684
I knew it!

00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:17.052
Gohan?

00:21:17.955 --> 00:21:19.090
[ERASA]
Where'd he run off to?

00:21:19.123 --> 00:21:20.560
He was just
here a second ago.

00:21:20.593 --> 00:21:23.331
[SHARPNER laughs]
Like a total boss.

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.704
Houdini's got
nothing on him.

00:21:25.737 --> 00:21:27.474
[NARRATOR] Once again,
Great Saiyaman has

00:21:27.508 --> 00:21:30.680
successfully fought crime to
protect the city,

00:21:30.713 --> 00:21:32.449
but can he succeed in protecting

00:21:32.483 --> 00:21:36.525
his secret identity from the
watchful gaze of Videl?

00:21:36.558 --> 00:21:39.565
Find out--

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me--Goku!

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:49.003
Can't believe someone could
be bad enough to take baby

00:22:49.036 --> 00:22:51.040
Chibi and parade him around
like a carnival act.

00:22:51.074 --> 00:22:53.345
[VIDEL] What's with you
kidnapping a monster?

00:22:53.379 --> 00:22:55.382
Seems kinda left field
of defending justice,

00:22:55.415 --> 00:22:56.384
don't you think?

00:22:56.418 --> 00:22:57.554
[GOHAN]
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:22:57.588 --> 00:22:58.656
This isn't what it
looks like! I swear!

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.159
Please stop throwing
punches at me!

[GOKU] Next time
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:06.471 --> 00:23:08.041
[GOHAN] Listen, you've
got the wrong idea!

00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:09.711
I'm not a kidnapper!
