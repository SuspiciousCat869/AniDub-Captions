[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.628
Gohan took a break
from his training for the

00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:15.498
World Martial Arts Tournament

00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:18.704
to teach Videl how to
"catch some air."

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:23.479
It's your first
day of trying to fly

00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:25.083
and you already
got off the ground!

00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:26.186
That is incredible!

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:27.756
He is such a show-off!

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.058
[GOTEN]
Ah! Look it!

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:30.829
I'm a birdie!

00:00:30.862 --> 00:00:33.534
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Trunks and Vegeta's father-son

00:00:33.568 --> 00:00:36.372
training sessions were
really heating up inside

00:00:36.406 --> 00:00:38.945
the Capsule Corp
gravity chamber!

00:00:38.978 --> 00:00:40.982
Maybe this is too much gravity!

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:42.686
Super Saiyan!
Here goes!

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.355
Haaa!

00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:46.527
You have got to be kidding me!

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.131
He changed into a
legendary Super Saiyan

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:52.170
with the ease of
a seasoned warrior?

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:57.381
[VIDEL]
All right.

00:00:57.414 --> 00:01:00.253
Let's pick up where we
left off yesterday.

00:02:42.358 --> 00:02:44.262
[VIDEL] Hey hey!
Check me out!

00:02:44.295 --> 00:02:46.767
I've gotten to where
I can hover like a pro!

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:48.036
Yeah, that's great, Videl!

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.107
You're a real natural!

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.510
[GOHAN]
Keep practicing like this,

00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:54.683
and soon I'm not gonna
have anything left to teach you.

00:02:55.217 --> 00:03:01.930
[GOTEN hollering cheerfully]

00:03:01.964 --> 00:03:05.671
Wow-ee!
[chuckles]

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:06.940
Woo!

00:03:06.974 --> 00:03:08.376
Um.

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.882
How long you think before I
can fly around like that?

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:12.686
Oh that?

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.790
It's, uh, hard to say.

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:17.829
Yeah, well, we're doing
this every day 'til I can.

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.939
Excuse me for a second.

00:03:22.972 --> 00:03:25.544
Hey, look at me!
Woo-hoo!

00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:37.401
Hey, squirt.

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:39.973
Do me a favor and ease
up when Videl's around, okay?

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:41.577
Wait, why come?

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.448
Because I'm asking you nicely.

00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:46.887
[VIDEL]
Is everything cool?

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.856
Yeah.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.959
Just giving the kid some advice.

00:03:55.972 --> 00:03:57.474
All right, break time.

00:03:57.508 --> 00:04:00.080
While I'm thinking about
it--well, here's the deal.

00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:01.950
All this? Stays secret.

00:04:01.984 --> 00:04:04.756
I want dad out of the loop 'til
the day of the tournament.

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:05.725
So is that cool?

00:04:05.758 --> 00:04:08.096
Ah. I understand.

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.632
It's probably best that way.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.503
Besides, if he found out
I've been hanging out

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:14.510
with some boy after class,
he'd totally blow a gasket.

00:04:14.543 --> 00:04:17.548
The man is like
seriously over-protective.

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:19.385
Don't even think about it!

00:04:19.418 --> 00:04:21.657
Whoever's got eyes
for my little girl had

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.863
better be able to
hold his own with me!

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.833
There's not a lot
of boys out there

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.471
that can stand up
to that kind of pressure.

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:31.810
He is the World
Champion after all.

00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:34.583
Right? I mean, no offense,
but let's face it.

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:37.755
You're strong, but my dad could
still bend you into a pretzel.

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.192
[chuckles]

00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:40.561
Hey, uh.

00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:43.232
Random question: do you
and your old man ever spar?

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:45.270
You're kidding me, right?

00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:47.308
He would turn me into paste!

00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:49.412
Dad hasn't even put
me through drills since--

00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:51.950
I don't even remember
how long exactly.

00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:53.687
I've been doing my own thing.

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:55.157
[GOHAN]
That's what I thought.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.460
She really has no clue.

00:04:57.494 --> 00:05:00.266
She outshined
Mr. Satan ages ago.

00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:04.208
So, um--let's say someone
out there actually

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:07.248
could beat your dad,
just hypothetically.

00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:08.551
What would you say to that?

00:05:08.584 --> 00:05:10.521
I almost wish he would lose!

00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:12.959
All this fame has
totally gone to his head!

00:05:12.993 --> 00:05:15.932
I know Mom's been gone
for a while, but still--

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:18.302
that doesn't mean he
can go flouncing around

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:20.674
with every silly woman
that wants an autograph!

00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:23.079
If he lost his title,
they'd all disappear!

00:05:23.113 --> 00:05:24.448
[GOHAN]
Perfect!

00:05:24.482 --> 00:05:26.052
Good to know she won't take
it personally if I knock

00:05:26.085 --> 00:05:28.256
Mr. Satan out of the tournament!

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.963
[VIDEL] Anyway...
Break time's over.

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.205
Mind if I ask who
taught you to be

00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:38.677
such a boss in
the martial arts arena?

00:05:40.047 --> 00:05:41.482
Oh.

00:05:41.517 --> 00:05:44.255
Y'know, an old friend of mine,
and of course my dad, too.

00:05:44.288 --> 00:05:45.558
Right, that makes sense.

00:05:45.591 --> 00:05:47.161
So when do I
actually get to meet

00:05:47.194 --> 00:05:48.964
this ex-champ father of yours?

00:05:48.997 --> 00:05:50.133
Well, he's not really with us.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:51.870
But he's gonna
be back real soon!

00:05:51.904 --> 00:05:54.108
The old lady's bringing
him back from the dead

00:05:54.141 --> 00:05:55.310
for a day so he can play

00:05:55.344 --> 00:05:56.514
at the big
tournament again!

00:05:56.547 --> 00:05:59.252
Uh. I'm not sure I'm
following you there.

00:05:59.285 --> 00:06:01.256
"Back from the dead"?

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.526
You mean, as in like--

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:03.994
Great!
Way to go, squirt!

00:06:04.028 --> 00:06:07.602
I thought we agreed not
to talk about that, huh?

00:06:07.636 --> 00:06:09.539
Oh! Wait, I get it.

00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:11.710
Your mom and dad
are divorced now.

00:06:11.744 --> 00:06:13.914
But your dad's gone off
and gotten remarried,

00:06:13.948 --> 00:06:16.118
and you don't want your mom
to know his new "old lady's"

00:06:16.152 --> 00:06:18.991
bringing him to the
tournament for the prize money!

00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:20.694
Obviously!

00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:22.665
Mhm!

00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:25.270
Parents can be a real pain
sometimes, can't they?

00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:27.007
Uh, sure.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.382
Well, forget about them,
we've got more training to do!

00:06:31.415 --> 00:06:34.856
[NARRATOR]
And so, the days pass.

00:06:37.427 --> 00:06:39.198
[GOTEN]
Wee! Haha--oh!

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:40.300

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.705
Sorry, comin' through!

00:06:44.274 --> 00:06:46.212
[GOHAN]
Wow. Look at her go.

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:48.216
That girl's something else.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.523
Ten days and she's
soaring like a bird.

00:06:53.492 --> 00:06:55.564
You've come a long way, Videl.

00:06:55.597 --> 00:06:57.536
There's really nothing
else that I can show you.

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.338
You've been a great teacher.

00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:01.041
So, I guess this means
I can get back to

00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:03.514
prepping for the World
Martial Arts Tournament.

00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:04.983
Yeah. Me, too.

00:07:05.017 --> 00:07:05.851
[VIDEL]
Oh right.

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:08.155
Well, I should be
getting home.

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:09.358
Oh, wait!

00:07:09.391 --> 00:07:10.294
You know what?

00:07:10.327 --> 00:07:11.864
I'm gonna use my new skills!

00:07:11.897 --> 00:07:13.266
Good.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.738

at the tournament!

00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:16.606
Later!

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.274
Bye!

00:07:17.307 --> 00:07:18.844
Take it easy!

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.219
[GOTEN] So, does that mean she's
not coming back tomorrow?

00:07:23.252 --> 00:07:24.756
[GOHAN]
Yep.

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:25.691
So then.

00:07:25.724 --> 00:07:27.728
Whaddya say we
get back to business?

00:07:27.762 --> 00:07:29.966

lost time to make up.

performance anxiety.

She's awesome!

You couldn't pay me enough to
try and take her on now, bro.

Yes ma'am.

Ugh, seriously?

00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:05.925
Watch it, young lady.

00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.429
Do you think you might
want to hit the dojo a little?

00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:10.433
Oh don't you
worry 'bout me.

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:12.872
My body's in peak
physical shape.

00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:14.842
You can take
that to the bank.

00:09:14.876 --> 00:09:16.946
[chuckles]

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:52.918
I give up.

00:09:52.952 --> 00:09:55.456
You're so much stronger
than me it's not even funny.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:56.860
Don't be like that.

00:09:56.893 --> 00:09:59.533
I've been at this a whole
lot longer than you have.

00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:03.339
It's not like you aren't
amazing in your own way.

00:10:04.274 --> 00:10:05.511
It's really true, right?

00:10:05.545 --> 00:10:08.015
Dad's gonna be there
at the tournament?

00:10:08.049 --> 00:10:11.321
You excited about getting to
meet him for the first time?

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.760
I would be.

00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:16.331
Yeah.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.774
So just where is
he off to now, eh?

00:10:20.808 --> 00:10:24.415
Big shot's going to miss his
window if he's not careful.

00:10:24.448 --> 00:10:26.553
[KING KAI]
Don't worry, m'dear.

00:10:26.587 --> 00:10:28.523
He's just having
some "me time"

00:10:28.557 --> 00:10:30.628
to clear his head
before the big day.

00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:32.731
You know how it is.

00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:52.304
So, you really think Goku'll
make it back in time?

00:10:52.337 --> 00:10:53.372
Don't you worry.

00:10:53.405 --> 00:10:54.241
He'll be there!

00:10:54.275 --> 00:10:55.409
[chuckles]

00:10:55.443 --> 00:10:58.015
Man, we haven't had the
whole gang together in ages!

00:10:58.048 --> 00:11:00.453
It'll be just like old times!

00:11:01.355 --> 00:11:05.096
Oh man, the look on his
face when he sees all of us!

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:07.234
Can't wait!

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:10.273
I'm surprised that you're
not entering, too, Yamcha.

00:11:10.307 --> 00:11:12.477
[YAMCHA] With Goku and
this bunch in the mix?

00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:14.549
What'd be the point?
[chuckles]

00:11:14.582 --> 00:11:16.184
Let's hope Dad
remembers your voice,

00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.622
'cause he won't
be able to pick you

00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:18.891
out of a crowd with that hair.

00:11:18.924 --> 00:11:20.093
[laughs]

00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:21.830
I know, right?

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.167
By the way Vegeta,
that reminds me.

00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:26.773
Listen up, 'cause this
goes for you guys, too.

00:11:26.807 --> 00:11:29.010
I think it'd be a good idea
for all of us to agree

00:11:29.044 --> 00:11:31.717
not to go Super Saiyan
during the tournament.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.652
Why's that?

00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:34.321
Ugh. You have to ask?

00:11:34.354 --> 00:11:36.559
If you don't keep a low
profile, people are bound

00:11:36.593 --> 00:11:38.163
to remember you
from the Cell Games.

00:11:38.196 --> 00:11:39.733
It's not as though
you went to the trouble

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.703
of disguising
yourselves back then.

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:43.507
You start going Super
Saiyan and everyone

00:11:43.541 --> 00:11:46.145
in the stadium is
gonna be like "Whoa!

00:11:46.179 --> 00:11:48.884
Look, it's the blonde
weirdos we saw on T.V.!"

00:11:48.918 --> 00:11:50.621
Yeah! And, trust me,

00:11:50.654 --> 00:11:52.758
the last thing any of us
want is publicity.

00:11:52.792 --> 00:11:54.261
We'll never live it down.

00:11:54.295 --> 00:11:57.868
[VEGETA] Let those paparazzi
worms try to corner me.

00:11:57.902 --> 00:12:00.842
[GOHAN] You can't just
unleash on 'em, Vegeta.

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:02.745
Fine. Have it your way.

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:03.981
As if I need to rely on my

00:12:04.014 --> 00:12:06.686
Super Saiyan form to
secure the victory.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.890
Ha! Either way
I'll dominate!

00:12:08.924 --> 00:12:10.661
Me and Goten won't change!

00:12:10.694 --> 00:12:11.529
Nope!

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:12.565
Excellent.

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.034
So, it's settled, then.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.172
We're talking
level playing field now.

00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:18.644
Maybe us Joe Schmoes
will finally have a shot!

00:12:18.677 --> 00:12:20.212
[laughs]

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:23.052
Ah!

00:12:23.086 --> 00:12:24.722
We're almost there, guys!

00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:26.125
Time to look alive!

00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:29.264
World Martial Arts Tournament
grounds straight ahead!

00:12:32.004 --> 00:12:33.807
Oh, this is gonna be good.

00:12:33.841 --> 00:12:34.809
Okay then.

00:12:34.842 --> 00:12:37.046
Now for the finishing touch.

00:12:39.786 --> 00:12:41.254
Uh. Gohan?

00:12:41.288 --> 00:12:44.061
Is that the outfit you plan
on competing in, or--?

00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:45.063
Yeah.

00:12:45.096 --> 00:12:46.432
A hero's gotta
protect his true identity.

00:12:47.635 --> 00:12:49.606
But hey, at least
I get to look cool.

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:52.043
Yeah. Right.

00:13:12.885 --> 00:13:17.360
[indistinctive chattering]

00:13:17.393 --> 00:13:20.232
Man, look at this place; I've
never seen so many people here.

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:23.005
Must be a gazillion of 'em;
what a pain in the neck.

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:25.811
Huh. Wonder if
Goku's here yet.

00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:27.147
[CROWD cheers]

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.717
[BOY A] It's him!
It's really him!

00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:30.320
[BOY B] Mr. Satan!
Can I have your autograph!

00:13:30.353 --> 00:13:31.288
Well, look who it is.

00:13:31.322 --> 00:13:32.792
--[BOY C] Awesome!
--[KRILLIN] Oh man!

00:13:32.825 --> 00:13:34.060
None other than Mister

00:13:34.094 --> 00:13:36.065
"I Single-Handedly Saved
the Planet," himself.

00:13:36.098 --> 00:13:38.269
People go nuts for this creep.

00:13:38.302 --> 00:13:39.538
I don't get it.

00:13:39.572 --> 00:13:41.408
Well, remember, none of 'em
know what really went down.

00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:43.613
[GOHAN] He certainly knows
how to make an entrance.

00:13:43.646 --> 00:13:49.759
[CROWD cheering]

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:51.262
[MR. SATAN]
Yeah!

00:13:51.295 --> 00:13:56.305
[CROWD chanting]
Mister Satan! Mister Satan!

00:13:56.339 --> 00:13:58.978
To all my fans who've
waited, give yourselves

00:13:59.011 --> 00:14:01.315
a big pat on the back!

00:14:01.349 --> 00:14:02.651
Sir, please tell us,

00:14:02.685 --> 00:14:05.591
just how good are the odds that
you'll be World Champion again?

00:14:05.624 --> 00:14:07.026
[laughs]

00:14:07.059 --> 00:14:09.732
Sweetheart, put your life
savings on me for the win--

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:11.636
'cause I got this
wrapped up in a bow!

00:14:11.669 --> 00:14:12.972
I understand
your daughter is

00:14:13.005 --> 00:14:14.975
entering the
competition as well.

00:14:15.009 --> 00:14:18.449
Is the hair cut a gesture of
your extreme enthusiasm?

00:14:18.482 --> 00:14:19.852
Yeah, it would be.

00:14:19.885 --> 00:14:21.088
If I was lame.

00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:22.658
[laughs]

00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:25.497
This tournament belongs to me!

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:28.670
Yep. The guy still
eats up all the attention.

00:14:28.703 --> 00:14:30.373
Aw, let the man have his moment.

00:14:30.406 --> 00:14:33.079
So has anybody seen
Dad around yet or what?

00:14:33.112 --> 00:14:35.984
I was just about
to ask the same thing.

00:14:38.489 --> 00:14:40.026
Hey, look.
Piccolo's here!

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:42.531
Huh. Way to spot 'im.

00:14:43.767 --> 00:14:44.769
[GOHAN]
Hey, Piccolo!

00:14:44.803 --> 00:14:45.972
What's up?

00:14:46.005 --> 00:14:48.242
You have any idea
if Dad's shown up yet?

00:14:48.276 --> 00:14:49.512
Oh, hello.

00:14:49.546 --> 00:14:51.950
Uh. No sign of him.

00:14:51.983 --> 00:14:55.356
Back up a second.
You plan on competing in that?

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.959
Cool, huh?

00:14:57.962 --> 00:14:59.130
This doesn't make sense.

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:00.734
He should be here by now.

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:01.937
Maybe he beat us.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.305
Has anybody checked
the changing rooms?

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:05.443
No. But I can
go and have a look.

00:15:05.476 --> 00:15:07.180
Yeah. Me, too.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:09.952
Ta-da!

00:15:09.986 --> 00:15:10.955
Hey, guys!

00:15:10.988 --> 00:15:12.725
Hey, you made it!

00:15:12.758 --> 00:15:14.562
Goku.

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:15.964
Awesome!

00:15:15.998 --> 00:15:18.937
Wow, it's been so long
I hardly recognize you!

00:15:18.971 --> 00:15:20.941
So, uh...

00:15:20.975 --> 00:15:23.212
How're things goin'?

00:15:29.024 --> 00:15:32.598
Go--Goku!

00:15:34.969 --> 00:15:37.875
I-I just can't
believe my eyes!

00:15:37.908 --> 00:15:39.612
Look at you!

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.053
Goku!

00:15:50.534 --> 00:15:51.869
[ALL]
Goku!

00:15:51.903 --> 00:15:53.072
I don't believe it!

00:15:53.106 --> 00:15:55.042
I've been waiting so long!

00:15:55.075 --> 00:15:57.313
I really have missed you, too.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.055
Honey!
That's your father.

00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:03.125
Aaah! That's so weird!

00:16:03.158 --> 00:16:06.666
I was just about to say how much
the little guy looked like me!

00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:11.842
You're my dad?

00:16:11.876 --> 00:16:13.580
[GOKU]
Mhmm.

00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:17.019
[chuckles]

00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:26.238
You're my dad!

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.075
Oh, man.

00:16:28.109 --> 00:16:29.612
Feels like your mom's
been feeding you rocks!

00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:32.651
[BOTH laughing]

00:16:32.684 --> 00:16:35.089
[GOKU] Bet you'll be
stronger than me in no time!

00:16:35.122 --> 00:16:38.296
[laughing]
Weee! Wo-ho-ho!

00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:39.130
Ahaaa!

00:16:39.163 --> 00:16:40.834
[BOTH laughing]

00:16:40.868 --> 00:16:42.437
[BABA clears throat]

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.174
Um. Excuse me.

00:16:44.207 --> 00:16:47.748
You've got twenty-four hours.
No more, no less.

00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:48.984
Are we clear?

00:16:49.017 --> 00:16:51.221
Mhm. Yeah. Twenty-four.

00:16:51.255 --> 00:16:53.091
[BABA]
All right. Good luck.

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:54.962
[GOKU] Thanks, Baba.
You're the best!

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:56.064
Hey.

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:58.135
Unless the idea
is to be spectators,

00:16:58.169 --> 00:17:01.041
I suggest we get
in line to sign up.

00:17:01.074 --> 00:17:03.680
[CLERK]
Uh. I'm sorry. Great what?

00:17:03.714 --> 00:17:05.684
[GOHAN]
Great Saiyaman, please.

00:17:05.717 --> 00:17:07.588
Ah. Quite a name.

00:17:07.622 --> 00:17:08.824
That's me.

00:17:08.857 --> 00:17:10.694
Huh? Are you serious?

00:17:10.728 --> 00:17:13.700
[GOHAN] Yeah, it, uh--
goes with the costume.

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:15.971
Oh. That's kind of cool.

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:18.475
[chuckles]

00:17:18.509 --> 00:17:20.045
Next, please.

00:17:20.548 --> 00:17:22.183
Ah. Good.

00:17:22.217 --> 00:17:24.555
The Junior Division
needs a few more.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.358
Uh. 'Scuse me, what?

00:17:26.392 --> 00:17:27.595
Son, you're under fifteen.

00:17:27.628 --> 00:17:30.200
Where else are
we supposed to put you?

00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:32.337
Oh, that's just great!
You believe this?

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.274
They're saying
we're not old enough!

00:17:34.307 --> 00:17:35.744
Whaaa?!

00:17:35.777 --> 00:17:38.482
Since when has this thing
had a Junior Division?

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:40.119
I guess we've been
out of the loop.

00:17:40.152 --> 00:17:41.656
We're not going in the play pen!

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.994
What's it gonna take for us
to get bumped up man?

00:17:44.027 --> 00:17:45.764
Absolutely out of the question!

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:47.635
No! Nu-uh.

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:48.970
You jerks are no fun!

00:17:49.004 --> 00:17:50.541
[chuckles nervously]

00:17:50.574 --> 00:17:51.976
Attention, please.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:56.953
We need all contestants to make
their way to the changing area.

00:17:56.986 --> 00:17:58.188
Okay, go time!

00:17:58.222 --> 00:17:59.558
Be safe; be strong.

00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:02.063
And, uh-- If you could
make us a boatload of cash,

00:18:02.096 --> 00:18:03.299
that'd be terrific, too.

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:04.569
Right!

00:18:04.602 --> 00:18:06.038
This'll be the
first time I've let it

00:18:06.071 --> 00:18:08.276
all hang out since forever.

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:09.545
[GOHAN]
Here we go--

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:11.916
I can't wait to show Dad
how strong I've gotten.

00:18:11.949 --> 00:18:13.820
Go big or go home!

00:18:13.853 --> 00:18:16.024
Yeah! Go big!

00:18:16.424 --> 00:18:17.862
Now, Daddy will be
thinking of you

00:18:17.895 --> 00:18:19.532
while he's out there, okay?

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:21.001
[MARRON]
Yay!

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:23.038
Wish us luck!

00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:25.476
Go easy on the other guys.

00:18:25.677 --> 00:18:27.547
Good luck, fellas!

00:18:48.288 --> 00:18:50.860
[CROWD gasps]

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.001
[LADY REPORTER]
Pardon me, coming through!

00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:56.137
[yells]

00:18:56.171 --> 00:18:58.142
[chuckles]

00:18:58.176 --> 00:19:00.446
Sir! Can you tell us
where you're from?

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.183
Ha! Funny you should ask.

00:19:02.216 --> 00:19:03.586
Satan City, born and bred--

00:19:03.619 --> 00:19:06.324
I trained with the
big man himself.

00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:09.732
[VIDEL]
No sign of him.

00:19:10.433 --> 00:19:11.769
Huh?

00:19:16.646 --> 00:19:18.549
[TRUNKS] You and your old
man look so much alike you could

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:21.088
be the same person from,
like, different times.

00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:22.524
You think so?

00:19:22.558 --> 00:19:24.595
[TRUNKS] He was s'posed
to be amazing, right?

00:19:24.629 --> 00:19:25.531
[GOTEN]
Yeah.

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:27.701
Eh, if you say so.
I'm not seein' it.

00:19:27.735 --> 00:19:30.540
No offense, but I don't
think he could beat my dad.

00:19:30.573 --> 00:19:32.410
But my brother says our dad's

00:19:32.443 --> 00:19:35.449
the strongest man
in the entire universe.

00:19:36.586 --> 00:19:39.324
See, I always thought
you were bald.

00:19:39.357 --> 00:19:41.896
No, I just used
to shave it back then.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.000
I've told you that before.

00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:46.004
Don't get me wrong,
the new do's fine.

00:19:46.038 --> 00:19:49.410
I just think the whole cue
ball look is more your style.

00:19:49.443 --> 00:19:52.416
Yeah, well.
This isn't for you.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.387
Ah! Hold on a sec,
that's 18!

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.357
The Android girl!

00:19:57.093 --> 00:20:00.132
You just now noticed? Wow.

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:02.137
Um, okay--someone's
gonna have to explain

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:03.607
to me what she's doing here.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.078
We have an arrangement
with Master Roshi.

00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:07.581
He lets us live at his place.

00:20:07.615 --> 00:20:08.884
Huh?

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.119
No way!

00:20:10.152 --> 00:20:12.390
You're telling me you're
some kind of couple?

00:20:12.858 --> 00:20:14.427
We have a little girl, too.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.633
You saw her back
there with the others.

00:20:16.666 --> 00:20:18.302
[yells]

00:20:18.335 --> 00:20:19.805
That's crazy!

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:21.407
Seriously?

00:20:22.611 --> 00:20:25.282
How'd you have a kid
with her if she's a robot?

00:20:25.315 --> 00:20:26.652
Lay off, man!

00:20:26.686 --> 00:20:29.457
Ah. She's not a robot--she's
a retooled human being

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.461
who also happens to be my wife!

00:20:31.494 --> 00:20:33.499
[GOHAN] Oh. Well in that
case, good for you?

00:20:33.533 --> 00:20:35.537
[KRILLIN]
Yeah, thanks.

00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:37.874
[VIDEL]
There you are.

00:20:38.976 --> 00:20:40.012
How'd you know?

00:20:40.046 --> 00:20:41.281
Whatever.

00:20:41.315 --> 00:20:43.687
C'mon. Who's supposed to
be fooled by that look?

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.489
Shh...!

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:49.364
[GOHAN] This is Great Saiyaman's
tournament wardrobe.

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:51.702
[VIDEL] Right. Guess
that kinda makes sense.

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:52.838
So, how's it going?

00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:55.176
Have you been keeping up
with your flying practice?

00:20:55.209 --> 00:20:57.681
You bet I have. Watch.

00:21:19.592 --> 00:21:22.163
Great Saiyaman
has finally met his match.

00:21:22.196 --> 00:21:24.000
We'll see about that!

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:26.739
[NARRATOR] The spirit of
competition is in the air!

00:21:26.773 --> 00:21:30.714
With Goku back, the Dragon Team
is now fully assembled and ready

00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:33.452
to take on the World
Martial Arts Tournament!

00:21:33.485 --> 00:21:35.456
Will it be like
the good old days?

00:21:35.489 --> 00:21:39.430
Find out,
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:45.710
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:47.333
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:49.738
All right, almost time
for the first round!

00:22:49.771 --> 00:22:50.640
Everybody ready?

00:22:50.674 --> 00:22:52.744
The competition
looks pretty fierce.

00:22:52.777 --> 00:22:55.249
[VEGETA] You call this
competition? Please.

00:22:55.283 --> 00:22:57.053
[GOHAN] Some things
never change, huh?

00:22:57.086 --> 00:22:58.221
Hey! Look sharp!

00:22:58.255 --> 00:23:00.259
The Junior Division
is about to start!

00:23:00.292 --> 00:23:02.931
[GOKU] Next time
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:23:06.405 --> 00:23:07.641
[VEGETA]
Enough of this nonsense.

00:23:07.674 --> 00:23:09.578
Let's get on with it!
