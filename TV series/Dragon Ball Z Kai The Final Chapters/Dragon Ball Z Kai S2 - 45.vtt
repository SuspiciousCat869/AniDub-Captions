Majin Buu trusts and to whom
he lets his guard down.

No matter how violent

He may not be able

Wait, a second.

If Piccolo's taking Majin Buu
to fight Goten and Trunks,

00:18:42.978 --> 00:18:44.214
does that mean
he's letting him into

let Buu in there.

Piccolo must see it
as an insurance policy,

in case something goes wrong

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.657
and Goten and Trunks
lose the battle.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.528
He'll destroy the portal
to the Chamber,

00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:09.832
trapping them inside while
we use the Dragon Balls

00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:11.636
to bring back Buu's victims.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.740
Since the Chamber exists
in a different dimension

00:19:13.774 --> 00:19:16.144
from ours, Buu will never
be able to return.

If Piccolo destroys the door,

they've died anyway,
