It doesn't make sense.

00:15:38.877 --> 00:15:40.681
I mean, the way
Majin Buu's energy vanished

a little while ago.

[gasps] You're right,
he's gone!

What? What does
that mean? Is he dead?

00:15:48.162 --> 00:15:53.205
I... don't know. I've stopped
sensing the boys' energy, too.

00:15:53.238 --> 00:15:55.176
But it didn't feel like a fight.

suddenly they were just gone.

Yes, you're right.

They're gone to an alternate
dimension of time and space.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.328
[GOHAN]
What? A different dimension?

00:16:04.361 --> 00:16:06.298
A world where time
flows differently.

Isn't that ringing any bells?

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:10.440
Yeah, the Hyperbolic
Time Chamber!

00:16:10.473 --> 00:16:12.477
But why would they
want to fight in there;

00:16:12.511 --> 00:16:13.513
it doesn't make sense.

Unless the boys were
training in the Chamber,

00:16:15.249 --> 00:16:16.920
and Buu just barged in.

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:19.257
No, it wasn't an invasion,
I can tell you that.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.796
The Namekian led him
through the portal himself.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.867
I'm not sure
why he did that, though.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.806
Wow. I wonder how
he knows that.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.543
He's powerful, huh?

00:16:28.576 --> 00:16:31.950
And he's unlocking Gohan's
potential at the same time.

00:16:31.983 --> 00:16:33.820
Don't worry, Supreme Kai,
maybe you'll be

00:16:33.854 --> 00:16:35.857

when you're old, too.

Ha-ha! I hope that
wasn't bad sportsmanship.

It's hard not to showboat

to congratulate yourself!

Majin Buu can still regenerate!

00:17:00.073 --> 00:17:01.643
You have to destroy
every piece of him

to regroup! I'll help you!

under control.

been awesome--

we have to annihilate
every last particle!

used the time to run.

Hyperbolic Time Chamber

and destroyed the portal
before he regenerated,
