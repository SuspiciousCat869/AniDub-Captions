[VIDEL] Hello, Gohan.
Lovely morning.

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:22.278
We can stop pretending, right?

00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:24.517
No point since
the cat's out of the bag.

You're Great Saiyaman!

[GOHAN]
Oh no!

00:00:27.487 --> 00:00:29.358
I can't believe I spilled
the beans after going

through all that trouble
to hide my identity!

Videl threatened to reveal it
to the world unless Gohan agreed

to enter the upcoming
World Martial Arts Tournament.

00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:44.488
However, tournament
rules would require

a few modifications
to his disguise.

day pass to Earth.

Pretty neat, huh?

a good time to use it.

Krillin stopped shaving his head

Hey, do me a favor and don't
tell Piccolo about the tourney.

If he's in, my chances of

I've never been
that much of a warrior,

of my element there.

00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:02.538

What's the story behind
that outlandish costume?

so I can't tell him.

And I'm pretty sure Bulma's
gonna give Yamcha

Mom back at home.

00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.293
Seriously!

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.079
[yells]

00:09:58.564 --> 00:09:59.766
[bellows]

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.402
[GOTEN] Look, Gohan!
You're gonna miss it!

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:03.239
What? What am I
gonna miss, Goten?

00:10:03.273 --> 00:10:04.643
Aah!

00:10:04.676 --> 00:10:06.379
You know how I caught that
lizard a little while ago?

00:10:06.412 --> 00:10:09.018
I found a bigger one!

00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:11.488
[laughs]

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:16.900
[DINOSAUR growling]

00:10:16.933 --> 00:10:18.269
Whoa!

00:10:24.047 --> 00:10:26.385
That was close,
are you all right?

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:27.622
[GOTEN]
Maybe he was too big.

00:10:27.655 --> 00:10:29.592
What's the big idea,
messing with that thing?

00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:31.062
You could've gotten hurt!

00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:33.466
Just sit right there
and stay out of trouble.

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:34.936
Do you think
you can handle that?

00:10:34.969 --> 00:10:37.642
Yeah, if that's what you want.

00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:42.885
[GOHAN grunting]

00:11:01.823 --> 00:11:02.992
[GOHAN]
Hey, Goten!

00:11:03.026 --> 00:11:03.893
Huh?

00:11:03.927 --> 00:11:04.963
I have a super-important
job for you,

00:11:04.996 --> 00:11:06.398
if you still wanna help out.

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:08.503
Cool!
[chuckles]

00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:10.473
[GOHAN]
There--that's plenty.

00:11:10.507 --> 00:11:11.710
How come you
wanted me to bring

00:11:11.743 --> 00:11:13.514
all these rocks
over here, anyway?

00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:14.983
We're going to use
them to get my intuition

00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:16.485
back to where it should be.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.722
--Huh?
--Okay?

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:19.625
[GOTEN] I don't even
know what intuition is!

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:21.630
You're about to find out.

00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:22.932
All right, listen up.

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:24.669
I want you to stand
at this line and toss

00:11:24.702 --> 00:11:26.673
these rocks at me
like you mean business.

00:11:26.706 --> 00:11:28.309
Think you can do that for me?

00:11:28.343 --> 00:11:30.246
Mhm! Piece of cake!

00:11:30.814 --> 00:11:32.652
All right!
Take your best shot!

00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:33.854
Let 'er rip!

00:11:33.887 --> 00:11:36.291
[GOTEN] But you're
standing so close to me.

00:11:36.325 --> 00:11:38.797
Actually, you should be even
closer when you do it.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.668
But this seems like
a good starting point.

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:42.505
I dunno, Gohan.

00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:43.741
Won't you get hurt?

00:11:43.774 --> 00:11:45.076
I'll be just fine.

00:11:45.109 --> 00:11:48.282
Now throw those rocks
at me as hard as you can.

00:11:49.151 --> 00:11:51.188
'Kay, but I don't think
you're gonna like it.

00:11:51.221 --> 00:11:52.558
Yeah? Bring it!

00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:56.231
[GOTEN]
Ready! Set! Go!

00:11:58.035 --> 00:12:00.373
[GOTEN]
Wow! You dodged it!

00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:01.843
Amazing!

00:12:01.877 --> 00:12:05.417
I thought the rock was
gonna hit you for sure!

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.354
Here comes the rest of 'em!

00:12:07.387 --> 00:12:09.091
Aah! Not so fast, Goten!

00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:10.761
I'm calling a quick time-out!

00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:12.932
Maybe you should
throw from way back here.

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:15.537
Y'know, so you don't
get bored or anything.

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:17.841
[GOTEN] Oh!
Good thinking, Gohan!

00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:27.761
[GOHAN] Now I'm
getting the hang of it!

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:30.934
You can throw 'em from
closer, if you want to!

00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:34.509
Move up, Goten!
Don't be shy!

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:36.278
Hey, is something bugging you?

00:12:36.312 --> 00:12:39.886
Um, is it okay if I become all
super strong like you are?

00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:42.858
[GOHAN] Huh? Sure, but
"all strong like me" how?

00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:44.796
I wanna do that
"Super Saiyan" thing

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:46.600
that makes your hair
look funny.

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:49.071
Huh? Uh.

00:12:49.104 --> 00:12:52.177
[laughs]

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.913
You can go Super Saiyan
if you want to,

00:12:53.947 --> 00:12:56.218
but I think you'll need to
wait 'til you're a bit older.

00:12:56.252 --> 00:12:58.991
Going Super Saiyan takes
a lot of intensive training.

00:12:59.024 --> 00:13:00.326
It could take some time.

00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:02.331
It's not the sort of thing
you just wake up one day

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:05.538
and decide you're
going to do--sorry, bro.

00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:07.240
Whaaa?!

00:13:44.414 --> 00:13:47.688
How on earth did you learn
to become Super Saiyan?

00:13:47.721 --> 00:13:49.424
When's the first
time you did that?

00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:50.961
[GOTEN]
Hmmm...

00:13:50.994 --> 00:13:52.497
I don't remember!

00:13:52.532 --> 00:13:54.067
That is so amazing!

00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:56.973
Dad and I had to work really
hard to become Super Saiyan,

00:13:57.006 --> 00:13:59.912
and here you just figured
it out all on your own!

00:13:59.945 --> 00:14:01.348
[GOTEN]
Hmm.

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:03.954
Wow, so, in that case,
why don't we skip ahead

00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:06.124
and try out some sparring?

00:14:06.158 --> 00:14:07.828
You know what
that is, don't you?

00:14:07.862 --> 00:14:10.233
It's like fighting but
you're just practicing!

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:12.772
Mom showed me how to do it while
you were studying at school.

00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:14.274
Wait, our mom?

00:14:14.308 --> 00:14:15.977
Cool, huh?

00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:19.853
[GOHAN] I hadn't
realize just how much Mom

00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:22.324
has changed in
the years since Dad died.

00:14:22.357 --> 00:14:25.230
But then again, I guess letting
me skip school to train

00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:28.168
for the tournament
should've been a clue.

00:14:28.937 --> 00:14:30.406
Tell me something.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.112
Going Super Saiyan is great
and all, don't get me wrong,

00:14:33.145 --> 00:14:35.116
but does Mom know you can do it?

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.485
Mhm.

00:14:40.628 --> 00:14:43.066
[CHI-CHI yells, grunts]

00:14:43.099 --> 00:14:44.602
You call that sparring?

00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:46.238
I bet your dearly
departed father

00:14:46.272 --> 00:14:49.077
is rolling in
his grave right now!

00:14:50.614 --> 00:14:53.252
What?!

00:14:55.824 --> 00:14:57.026
[GOTEN]
Are you okay?

00:14:57.059 --> 00:14:58.362
I'm sorry, Mom!

00:14:58.395 --> 00:15:01.637
Go--Go--Go--

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.372
Goten.

00:15:03.405 --> 00:15:04.743
I'm really sorry.

00:15:04.776 --> 00:15:06.345
[wails]

00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:09.685
My little baby's turned
into a delinquent.

00:15:09.719 --> 00:15:13.425
[sobbing]

00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:19.004
Mom got really sad
the first time it happened.

00:15:19.037 --> 00:15:23.312
She said I looked like a
delinquent, whatever that is.

00:15:23.346 --> 00:15:27.353
Yeah, Mom loses her mind every
time one of us goes blond!

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.838
[GOHAN] All right, Goten!
Show me what you've got!

00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:40.012
[yells]

00:15:57.046 --> 00:15:59.585
Aw!
Flying away's no fair!

00:15:59.618 --> 00:16:00.554
You're no fun!

00:16:00.588 --> 00:16:02.791
Stop cheating and
come back down here!

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:04.460
What? How's it
cheating to fly?

00:16:04.494 --> 00:16:07.535
'Cause I can't fly, so how'm
I supposed to keep fighting?

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:10.272
Huh? Please, tell me
that you're kidding!

00:16:10.306 --> 00:16:12.945
You randomly figured out
how to go Super Saiyan

00:16:12.978 --> 00:16:15.651
but you can't fly,
not even a little?

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:17.187
Stop making fun!

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.393
Ha! Kids these days,
doing it all backwards.

00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:21.395
Cut it out!

00:16:21.428 --> 00:16:23.332
You flying around
when I can't is no fair,

00:16:23.365 --> 00:16:25.737
so either teach me
how or get down here!

00:16:25.771 --> 00:16:27.107
Whoa!
All right, all right!

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.877
Don't blow a gasket, Goten!

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.949
I'll get you zipping around
with me in no time, I promise!

00:16:31.983 --> 00:16:33.653
Yeah? You really mean it?

00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:34.822
[GOHAN]
Sure do!

00:16:34.856 --> 00:16:36.927
[GOTEN] Ha-ha! Yeah!
Thank you, Gohan!

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.195
[BOTH laugh]

00:16:38.229 --> 00:16:40.968
[GOTEN]
I'm gonna learn how to fly!

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:42.972
So cool!

00:16:43.005 --> 00:16:47.080
[aircraft sound]

00:16:47.113 --> 00:16:48.583
Wait, is that?

00:16:48.616 --> 00:16:50.419
Don't tell me.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.064
[GOHAN]
Videl's here!

00:16:58.135 --> 00:16:59.505
How'd I forget?

00:16:59.538 --> 00:17:01.342
I was so desperate for her to
keep my Saiyaman secret,

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:03.947
I said I'd teach
Videl how to fly, too!

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:05.149
[GOTEN]
Why do you look scared?

00:17:05.182 --> 00:17:06.519
[GOHAN]
Uh, it's nothing, really.

00:17:06.552 --> 00:17:08.022
Just looks like
you'll have some company

00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:09.526
for your flying lesson.

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:11.763
Someone else is coming?

00:17:11.796 --> 00:17:13.065
Here's the game-plan.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:14.334
There's a girl from
my school who's

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:15.771
going to be joining us soon,

00:17:15.804 --> 00:17:18.309
because she roped me into
showing her how to fly, okay?

00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:20.180
But I don't want her
seeing how strong you are--

00:17:20.213 --> 00:17:21.616
you understand, Goten?

00:17:21.649 --> 00:17:23.385
And you definitely
can't go Super Saiyan

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.025
around her, even if
you really want to, got it?

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:27.393
Of course I can't!

00:17:27.427 --> 00:17:30.099
'Cause then she's gonna
think I'm a delinquent!

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:33.941
Yeah, that's exactly why, Goten.

00:17:33.974 --> 00:17:35.075
C'mon!
I'll race ya home!

00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:36.679
[GOTEN]
Okay!

00:17:51.375 --> 00:17:53.813
[GOTEN] You're pretty amazing,
Gohan, you know that?

00:17:53.846 --> 00:17:55.183
I didn't hit you
with a single one

00:17:55.216 --> 00:17:56.485
of those rocks that I threw!

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:58.422
I'm gonna have to train
a bunch from now on!

00:17:58.456 --> 00:18:00.092
Don't sell yourself
short, Goten!

00:18:00.126 --> 00:18:01.462
You did really well today!

00:18:01.495 --> 00:18:03.498
I had no idea you
could fight like that!

00:18:03.533 --> 00:18:05.403
Practicing with
Mom really paid off!

00:18:05.436 --> 00:18:07.707
Y'know, if you really put your
nose to the grindstone,

00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:10.547
maybe you can enter the World
Martial Arts Tournament, too!

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.750
You think so?

00:18:11.783 --> 00:18:13.485
Maybe Trunks should be in
the tournament, too, then!

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:16.058
We pretend fight and he's
way stronger than I am!

00:18:16.091 --> 00:18:17.528
He gets to train with Vegeta,

00:18:17.561 --> 00:18:19.699
and Vegeta is so
much tougher than Mom!

00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:21.234
Eh! Hold on a second!

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:23.239
You and Trunks spar
when you hang out,

00:18:23.272 --> 00:18:24.842
and he's even better than you?

00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:27.246
Uh-huh!
He always wins!

00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:30.219
[GOHAN] Man. If I don't
keep up with my training,

00:18:30.253 --> 00:18:31.656
these little guys
are going to give me

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.358
a run for my money!

00:18:38.169 --> 00:18:39.170
[CHI-CHI]
Listen here!

00:18:39.203 --> 00:18:41.108
I know what you're up to, missy!

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:42.711
You dropped by
hoping to snare my

00:18:42.745 --> 00:18:44.615
innocent boy with
your feminine wiles!

00:18:44.649 --> 00:18:46.986
Nothing could be further
from the truth, ma'am!

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.957
Ugh! Huh?

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.092
[GOHAN]
Hey!

00:18:50.126 --> 00:18:52.130
[GOTEN]
Hi, Mom--did ya miss us?

00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:53.332
Course I did!

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.737
So uh-- how'd you
find me way out here?

00:18:55.771 --> 00:18:58.710
All I had to do was look in
your file at the high school.

00:18:58.743 --> 00:19:00.180
Yeah, I shoulda guessed.

00:19:00.213 --> 00:19:01.750
So, what's the big idea?

00:19:01.783 --> 00:19:03.786
You just drop out of
school without telling me?

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.424
You don't get out of teaching
me how to fly that easily!

00:19:06.458 --> 00:19:09.131
Huh? Why do you think
I'm trying to get out of it?

00:19:09.164 --> 00:19:10.734
[CHI-CHI]
A word, Gohan!

00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:13.338
Is it true that this very
forward girl is entering

00:19:13.372 --> 00:19:15.242
the martial arts
tournament as well?

00:19:15.275 --> 00:19:16.712
[GOHAN]
Far as I know, yeah.

00:19:16.746 --> 00:19:19.519
In fact, it's thanks to
Videl here that I even

00:19:19.552 --> 00:19:21.989
heard about the tournament
in the first place.

00:19:22.022 --> 00:19:24.027
[VIDEL]
Hm!

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.564
Well in that case, fine!

00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:28.603
But don't go showing Gohan
how grateful you are.

00:19:28.636 --> 00:19:31.341
I know how
girls are these days!

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.349
I'm not gonna jump
your son, so just drop it!

00:19:37.253 --> 00:19:38.723
Says you!

00:19:38.756 --> 00:19:41.495
Sure, you act like you're not
chasing him, but for all I know,

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:43.398
the only reason you're entering
the tournament is so you

00:19:43.431 --> 00:19:46.906
can fight Gohan, then marry
him, right then and there!

00:19:46.939 --> 00:19:48.510
Where are
you getting this stuff?

00:19:48.543 --> 00:19:50.547
And what kind of
crazy-woman gets married

00:19:50.581 --> 00:19:52.918
at the World Martial Arts
Tournament anyway?

00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:54.320
My mom got married
to my dad

00:19:54.354 --> 00:19:55.723
at the World Martial
Arts Tournament--

00:19:55.757 --> 00:19:57.995
does that mean
she's a crazy-woman?

00:19:58.028 --> 00:19:59.832
[VIDEL]
Huh?

00:20:02.003 --> 00:20:03.774
Oh, my darling little Goten!

00:20:03.807 --> 00:20:05.142
Why would you say that?

00:20:05.175 --> 00:20:07.380
Are you trying to
make Mommy blush?

00:20:07.413 --> 00:20:09.918
Whoa.
What a weirdo.

00:20:12.423 --> 00:20:14.294
I remember fighting
him at the tournament

00:20:14.327 --> 00:20:16.498
like it was yesterday.

00:20:19.204 --> 00:20:21.942
[CHI-CHI] And, of course,
what came after.

00:20:28.757 --> 00:20:29.858
[sighs]

00:20:29.892 --> 00:20:33.633
Each of those memories
is so precious to me.

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:34.702
That said!

00:20:34.736 --> 00:20:36.438
If you think I'll let
history repeat itself,

00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:37.674
you've got another thing coming!

00:20:37.707 --> 00:20:39.177
I'm not trying
to marry your son!

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.114
I don't even want to
date him, all right?

00:20:41.147 --> 00:20:43.118
It's never gonna
happen, so can it!

00:20:43.152 --> 00:20:43.920
[CHI-CHI]
Why not?

00:20:43.953 --> 00:20:46.726
Hell no!

00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:49.197
Hell no!

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.503
Hell no!

00:20:51.536 --> 00:20:52.971
Hell no!

00:20:53.004 --> 00:20:55.042
[NARRATOR] Less than a month
remains to prepare for the

00:20:55.076 --> 00:20:58.716
World Martial Arts Tournament,
but it seems Gohan's training

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.090
will have to be put on hold
while Videl is on the scene.

00:21:02.123 --> 00:21:04.595
[laughs nervously]

00:21:04.629 --> 00:21:05.864
At least, I don't
have to worry about

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:08.769
being bored for the
next couple of weeks.

00:21:10.607 --> 00:21:13.613
[GOHAN] Little Goten
really surprised me today.

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:16.352
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
witnessing his younger brother's

00:21:16.385 --> 00:21:19.157
amazing talents has
only reminded Gohan

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.129
just how much
work he still needs to do!

00:21:22.163 --> 00:21:24.134
[GOHAN]
Better not slack off.

00:21:24.167 --> 00:21:26.739
I don't want him
showing me up out there!

00:21:27.373 --> 00:21:30.178
--[VIDEL] Hell no!
--[CHI-CHI] Nnngh!

00:21:30.212 --> 00:21:31.816
[VIDEL]
Hell no!

00:21:31.849 --> 00:21:33.351
[NARRATOR] Will Videl
stop arguing with Chi-Chi

00:21:33.385 --> 00:21:36.191
long enough for Gohan
to teach her how to fly?

00:21:36.224 --> 00:21:39.665
Find out,
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.499 --> 00:21:45.677

00:22:45.395 --> 00:22:46.999
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me--Goku!

00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:48.268
That's pretty impressive!

00:22:48.302 --> 00:22:49.572
It's not just anyone
who can learn how

00:22:49.605 --> 00:22:50.940
to fly in a single day!

00:22:50.974 --> 00:22:53.779
I think this Videl girl
means business, Gohan!

00:22:53.813 --> 00:22:54.815
[VIDEL]
Hmph!

00:22:54.848 --> 00:22:56.418
Don't lie to me, Gohan--
your little brother

00:22:56.451 --> 00:22:58.590
is better at flying than
I am, isn't he?

00:22:58.623 --> 00:23:00.527
Guess I'll just have to come
back tomorrow, then!

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.964
[GOKU] Next time
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:06.506 --> 00:23:07.941
[GOHAN] How do
I do my own training

00:23:07.975 --> 00:23:09.711
in the middle of all this?
