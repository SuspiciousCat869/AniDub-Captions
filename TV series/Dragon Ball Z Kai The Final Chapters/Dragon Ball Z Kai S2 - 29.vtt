00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:18.964
Listen, all right.

00:13:18.997 --> 00:13:21.836
Take good care
of your mother, Trunks.

00:13:51.228 --> 00:13:54.969
What do you mean
by that? Dad?

00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:59.979
Why are you telling me
to take care of Mom?

00:14:00.013 --> 00:14:03.987
You two, go find somewhere
to take shelter far from here.

00:14:05.289 --> 00:14:08.630
I have to stop Buu.
And I'm doing it alone.

00:14:08.663 --> 00:14:11.602
--[TRUNKS gasps]
--[GOTEN] Wait, but why?

00:14:12.872 --> 00:14:14.074
We'll fight with you!

00:14:14.107 --> 00:14:16.045
If you do this alone,
you're gonna end up

00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:17.582
getting yourself killed, Dad!

00:14:17.615 --> 00:14:20.086
But if the three of us team up,
we're sure to beat him!

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:21.923
--Right, Goten?
--Uh-huh!

00:14:21.956 --> 00:14:23.493
We're both, like,
crazy-strong now!

00:14:23.527 --> 00:14:27.935
No way. It doesn't matter
how many of us go at him.

00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:30.339
Not if we fight
the way we normally do.

00:14:30.373 --> 00:14:33.279
Nuh-uh! With us fighting
side-by-side, it'll be easy!

00:14:33.312 --> 00:14:36.418
This isn't like you, Dad.
You seem so discouraged.

00:14:36.451 --> 00:14:37.588
Yeah. He's right!

00:14:37.622 --> 00:14:40.259
Usually you're way more
cocky and full of yourself!

00:14:40.293 --> 00:14:42.363
[TRUNKS]
Yeah, that's for sure!

00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:51.850
[VEGETA] Trunks, from the time
you were a little baby,

00:14:51.883 --> 00:14:53.753
I've never once hugged you,
because I always

00:14:53.786 --> 00:14:56.626
wanted to make
you a tougher man.

00:15:01.636 --> 00:15:03.874
I'll hug you now.

00:15:03.907 --> 00:15:06.378
Wait, Dad, what--

00:15:06.412 --> 00:15:08.015
What are you doing?

00:15:08.048 --> 00:15:12.156
Hey, cut it out.
You're embarrassing me.

00:15:53.907 --> 00:15:56.345
Take care, Trunks. All right?

00:15:56.379 --> 00:15:58.148
Huh?

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:01.856
No! What'd you do to him?

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.695
That's mean!
What's gotten into you?

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:09.104
[GOTEN]
You knocked him out cold!

00:16:09.137 --> 00:16:11.441
Why'd you do that?

00:16:11.475 --> 00:16:14.014
Why? Why would you ever
hit your son like that?

00:16:14.047 --> 00:16:16.819
He was just trying to help!
That was mean!

00:16:16.852 --> 00:16:19.792
You're a mean,
mean man! You are!

00:16:19.826 --> 00:16:22.330
Why'd you do that to him?

00:16:24.334 --> 00:16:26.438

00:17:09.224 --> 00:17:10.627
Take these two
little ones and get them

00:17:10.661 --> 00:17:14.502
as far away from here
as possible. And hurry.

00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:16.404
Yeah, sure.

00:17:23.954 --> 00:17:26.692
Keep them safe, Piccolo.

00:17:31.335 --> 00:17:34.775
That's it?
You plan to die?

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:51.074
[VEGETA] Just tell me
one thing before you go.

00:17:51.107 --> 00:17:53.345
In this Otherworld,
or whatever it's called,

00:17:53.379 --> 00:17:57.320
will I see Kakarot again?

00:17:57.353 --> 00:17:59.792
I couldn't forgive myself
if I gave you a false hope

00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:05.236
at a time like this,
so I'll tell you the truth.

00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:07.641
You won't see him, no.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.217
You've taken the lives of
far too many innocent people.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.689
When you die, your body
will cease to exist,

00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:17.060
and your soul will be
sent to a very different world

00:18:17.093 --> 00:18:19.330
than the one where
Goku's soul will end up.

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:22.236
And once there you will be
cleansed, your memory erased,

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:26.580
and you will be turned
into a new life form.

00:18:26.613 --> 00:18:31.155
I see. That's too bad.

00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:34.127
All right, you'd better
be going. Now.

00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:35.664

--Hold on! Majin Buu!
--Huh?

00:18:44.414 --> 00:18:47.821
[VEGETA] You'll deal with them
only after you've defeated me!

You got that?

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.929

Hurry, Krillin! We have to

00:19:06.224 --> 00:19:08.162
get away from here
as fast as we can!

how to deal with you.

--Just in time.
--Oh!

'Cause based on
what I've seen so far,

00:19:43.198 --> 00:19:47.106
on behalf of someone
other than himself.

00:19:47.139 --> 00:19:50.613
And sadly,
it'll cost him his life.

You a big nobody! Buu make
you chocolate, Buu eat you.

No, Buu feel like some candy.
Buu make you that.

[chuckles]

00:20:17.734 --> 00:20:20.607
The key to defeating you
is to obliterate you

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.749
so completely your regeneration
won't be possible.
