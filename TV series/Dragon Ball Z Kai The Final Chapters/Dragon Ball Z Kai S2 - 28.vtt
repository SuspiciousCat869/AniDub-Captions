00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:09.786
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:11.991
Majin Buu's near-limitless power

00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:14.596
continued to overwhelm
all who faced it,

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.671
with Gohan and Supreme Kai
becoming his latest casualties.

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:21.076
Just think. This Majin Buu,
there's something

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.112
wrong with him,
something in his nature.

00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:26.285
He'll never be the
loyal servant you wanted.

00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:33.133
You hurt Buu.
Now Buu eat you.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.402
[NARRATOR]
Delivering on his threat,

00:00:34.436 --> 00:00:37.141
Majin Buu magically
transformed Dabura

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:41.550
into a shortbread cookie
and ate him in one bite.

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:47.361
[SUPREME KAI groans]
[BUU laughs]

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:51.203
Buu wonder what food
to turn you into.

00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:53.641
A chocolate? Or maybe jelly?

00:00:53.674 --> 00:00:54.876
[laughs]

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.551
The smug ruler of us all!
Turned into children's candy!

00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:01.556
[laughs]

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:09.806
What? Ah! My ship!

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:14.983
[BABIDI yells]

00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:16.352
[SUPREME KAI groans]

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:18.557
[NARRATOR] Babidi finds out
who's behind the blast

00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:21.564
that destroyed his ship,
and who distracted Majin Buu

00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:24.870
from turning Supreme Kai
into a sugary snack,

00:01:24.904 --> 00:01:27.742
now on Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:01:28.243 --> 00:01:33.453

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.572
Aah! My-- My ship!
My ship is destroyed!

00:03:22.605 --> 00:03:25.477
No! Not fair!

00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:30.888
Curses! Curses! Curses!
I did not need this!

00:03:30.921 --> 00:03:32.559
Hey! Majin Buu.

00:03:32.592 --> 00:03:36.533
You didn't happen to see who
blew up my ship, did you?

00:03:43.914 --> 00:03:46.520
What? Is someone coming?

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.634
You! You did this!

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:54.769
Hm. Yep.

00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:57.040
--[TRUNKS] Dad!
--[KRILLIN] Vegeta?

00:03:57.073 --> 00:03:59.011
[PICCOLO grunts]

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:08.664
You traitor! After all
the power I gave you!

00:04:08.698 --> 00:04:10.835
[chuckles]

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:14.175
[SUPREME KAI groans]

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:17.982
Is... that Vegeta?

00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:23.126
What were you thinking?

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.863
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:26.299
[VEGETA]
Overkill, I know.

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:27.935
But smashing through
your ship's portals

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.471
was the fastest way here.

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:30.742
[BABIDI]
How could you do this?

00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:32.746
You're supposed to be
under my control!

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:36.452
I never ordered you to turn my
spaceship into a pile of rubble!

00:04:36.486 --> 00:04:37.522
Heh.

00:04:37.556 --> 00:04:39.760
I don't understand how
you continue to defy me!

00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:42.832
I've never met a more disloyal,
insubordinate servant!

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:46.840
[VEGETA] So, is that pink blob
with the cape Majin Buu?

00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:50.113
Aah!

00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:53.988
Well then. You're the
cruel monster who killed Gohan!

00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:58.864
[gasps]

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:02.071
Piccolo, what's wrong?
What did my dad say?

00:05:02.104 --> 00:05:03.439
Piccolo!

00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:05.711
[PICCOLO]
Gohan.

00:05:11.122 --> 00:05:15.565
"Monster"? What's that?
This man talking about Buu?

00:05:15.598 --> 00:05:17.669
What? It just means you're big.

00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:19.640
Oh, and your face
is scary-looking.

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:21.075
Oh...

00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:24.215

[BABIDI]
Buu, watch it.

00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:38.476
Majin Buu!

00:05:41.016 --> 00:05:44.388

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:52.538
He's a real piece of work.

00:05:53.941 --> 00:05:59.117
You make Buu mad!
Now Buu gonna kill you!

00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:01.388
[chuckles]

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:04.796
You chose poorly coming here.

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:06.633
I won't stand
for any more of this.

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:09.304
Let him have it, Majin Buu.
He's useless to me now!

00:06:09.338 --> 00:06:11.610
[hollers]

00:06:11.644 --> 00:06:12.946
[KRILLIN]
Not smart, Vegeta.

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.417
That creature's ramping up
his energy even more.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.321
That's one scary dude.

00:06:17.354 --> 00:06:18.422
All right, Dad!

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:21.129
Wipe the floor
with that guy! Yeah!

00:06:21.162 --> 00:06:22.932
Vegeta.

[BABIDI panting]

00:06:41.737 --> 00:06:45.043
Kill him, Buu! Kill Vegeta
with all your power!

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:46.847
Don't hold back!

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.652
[BUU chuckles]

00:06:59.338 --> 00:07:02.344
[VEGETA] Kakarot,
I never could stand you.

00:07:02.377 --> 00:07:04.816
I've hated you
since the moment we met.

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.487
Hated you with all that I am.

00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:18.476
[VEGETA] You've been a cruel
joke played on me by fate.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.480
No matter how strong I became,

00:07:20.514 --> 00:07:24.021
you somehow managed
to keep one step ahead.

00:07:24.054 --> 00:07:27.929
I had to suffer the indignity
of you saving my life.

00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:29.599
And then you had to die.

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:32.204
But today I will be the hero.

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:34.174
So sleep now, Kakarot.

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:36.379
Sleep as long as you want.

00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:39.018
When you wake,
this will all be over.

00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:42.157
Majin Buu's story
will be finished.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.194
And so will mine.

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:48.202
[yells]

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:50.808
I'm not going
to hell by myself!

00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:54.014
I'm taking you
all along for the ride!

00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:59.224
Oh, no. It sounds like
he has a death wish.

[TRUNKS]
You got him, Dad!

00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:53.065
[KRILLIN] I'm starting
to get hopeful here.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:55.537
Maybe your dad
does have a chance!

00:08:55.571 --> 00:08:58.577
So much power on display.

00:08:58.611 --> 00:09:08.830
[bellows]

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:29.071
Oh, no. Buu.
He's down. Get up!

00:09:29.104 --> 00:09:32.611
You're doing great, Dad!
Don't let up on the attack now!

00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:35.584
[BUU]
Mmmm-mm!

00:09:38.455 --> 00:09:41.629
[VEGETA grunts]

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:55.056
Ve-ge-ta.

00:10:29.893 --> 00:10:31.964
What? What's going on?

00:10:31.997 --> 00:10:36.205
How could he do this?
Destroy him, Buu!

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:44.922
Oh, wow. Vegeta is even
stronger than I thought!

00:10:44.956 --> 00:10:46.024
[chuckles]

00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:48.196
[TRUNKS] Go Dad, go!
Come on, Dad!

00:10:48.229 --> 00:10:49.865
You got this! All right!

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.569
You're the strongest
fighter ever!

00:10:51.603 --> 00:10:54.909
Let him have it, Dad!
Come on, you can do it!

00:10:54.942 --> 00:10:57.080
[PICCOLO] Vegeta's gone
beyond Super Saiyan.

00:10:57.113 --> 00:11:00.319
I've never seen him
at a level like this.

00:11:17.287 --> 00:11:19.224
[PICCOLO]
Vegeta's power's incredible!

00:11:19.257 --> 00:11:22.130
It's as strong as Gohan's
was when he fought Cell.

00:11:22.163 --> 00:11:23.265
Maybe stronger!

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:26.204
But not enough to
save Gohan from Majin Buu.

00:11:26.238 --> 00:11:28.544
I just wish we knew
where Goku was.

00:11:28.577 --> 00:11:30.848
If Vegeta can't handle
Majin Buu alone,

00:11:30.881 --> 00:11:32.785
there may not be
anyone left in this world

00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:35.156
who's ready to bring this
monster to his knees.

00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:38.462
The fate of our planet--no,
the fate of our entire universe

00:11:38.496 --> 00:11:40.867
may depend on Vegeta now.

No, that can't be!
It's impossible!

There's no way that Vegeta can
defeat Majin Buu in battle!

Hey, Goten? Did you see
my dad just now? Ooo-ah!

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:47.635
Yeah. He's really amazing!

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:49.004
Duh, of course!

00:12:49.037 --> 00:12:52.545
My dad always comes
through in a big battle.

No, he can't be dead!

You left this world too soon!

[BUU]
Buu!

00:16:32.149 --> 00:16:36.092
You hurt Buu only a little bit.

What are you? Immortal?

Majin Buu is back!
I never doubted you!

Hey! Buu, careful!

00:18:04.635 --> 00:18:07.607
Buu really...

00:18:14.956 --> 00:18:24.608
...does not like you!

00:18:26.445 --> 00:18:28.716
Ah! Barrier!

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.388
Go! Get outta here!

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:57.708
[explosion]

00:19:14.074 --> 00:19:17.781
Hey! You coulda killed me!

00:19:39.123 --> 00:19:41.929
Hey! Where are you guys?
You okay?

00:19:43.867 --> 00:19:45.336
[exhales]

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.306
Oh, man. Too close.

00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:50.112
[TRUNKS grunts]

00:19:50.145 --> 00:19:53.118
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow.

00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:55.723
Did you guys see
where Goten went?

00:19:59.966 --> 00:20:01.969
Hmm.

00:20:04.107 --> 00:20:05.844
[yelps]

00:20:07.013 --> 00:20:08.984
[laughs]

00:20:09.017 --> 00:20:10.486
[GOTEN, TRUNKS laugh]

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.591
Don't scare me like that, Goten!

00:20:12.624 --> 00:20:16.431
Here. Stay out
of trouble, Mr. Lizard.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.243
Wait, the Supreme Kai is gone!

00:20:34.569 --> 00:20:36.471
Dad!

00:20:37.006 --> 00:20:42.718
[VEGETA groans]

00:20:42.751 --> 00:20:45.255
[grunts]

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:50.634
[BUU] Buu-Buu-Buu!
Buu-Buu-Buu! Buu-Buu-Buu!

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:53.004
[laughs]

00:20:57.279 --> 00:20:59.985
Wow, I can't believe
Vegeta's in one piece,

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:01.388
and still standing.

00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:03.526
It's too bad he's such
a disobedient fool,

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.164
otherwise he'd make
a fine servant.

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:10.139
So much wasted potential.

00:21:10.172 --> 00:21:12.744
Damn. He's too strong.

00:21:12.778 --> 00:21:15.818
And if he's capable of
regenerating from any wound,

00:21:15.851 --> 00:21:19.157
then defeating him in battle
may be impossible.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.960
If that's true...

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.008
[NARRATOR] The effort to stop
a monster has turned into

00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:30.914
a fight for Vegeta's life.
But the fierce Saiyan

00:21:30.947 --> 00:21:34.755
claims he intends to
stop Majin Buu at all cost.

00:21:34.788 --> 00:21:37.494
Now his brave words
will be put to the test

00:21:37.528 --> 00:21:39.932
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:45.577
â™ª Closing Song â™ª

00:22:45.462 --> 00:22:46.899
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:49.403
Vegeta's in trouble,
as his strongest attacks

00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:51.374
didn't leave a mark
on Majin Buu.

00:22:51.408 --> 00:22:53.980
[VEGETA] Take good care
of your mother, Trunks.

00:22:54.013 --> 00:22:55.415
Well, Majin Buu.

00:22:55.449 --> 00:22:58.222
I finally figured out
how to deal with you.

00:22:58.255 --> 00:23:00.793
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:05.903
[GOHAN]
For the first time in his life,

00:23:05.937 --> 00:23:09.443
Vegeta's fighting for
someone other than himself!
