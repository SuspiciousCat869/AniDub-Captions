Hmm.

Here. Stay out
of trouble, Mr. Lizard.

Wow, I can't believe
Vegeta's in one piece,

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:01.388
and still standing.

00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:03.526
It's too bad he's such
a disobedient fool,

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.164
otherwise he'd make
a fine servant.

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:10.139
So much wasted potential.

Damn. He's too strong.

And if he's capable of
regenerating from any wound,

00:21:15.851 --> 00:21:19.157
then defeating him in battle
may be impossible.

[NARRATOR] The effort to stop
a monster has turned into

a fight for Vegeta's life.
But the fierce Saiyan

claims he intends to
stop Majin Buu at all cost.

Hey! It's me, Goku!

Vegeta's in trouble,
as his strongest attacks

didn't leave a mark
on Majin Buu.

of your mother, Trunks.

Well, Majin Buu.

how to deal with you.
