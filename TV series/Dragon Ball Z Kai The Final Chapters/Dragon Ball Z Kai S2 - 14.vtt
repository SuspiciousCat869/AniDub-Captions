00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:21.750
what we're
really here to do.

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.220
Just win the damn match.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.826
[SPOPOVITCH]
'Kay.

00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:34.140
Uh. We have...
a ring-out.

00:12:34.174 --> 00:12:37.280
The third match
goes to Spopovitch.

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:46.431
[GOHAN]
Oh, Videl.

00:12:47.902 --> 00:12:51.007
Uh. We should probably
call for a stretcher.

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:54.180
No. It's all right.
I'll carry her.

00:12:57.487 --> 00:12:59.157
[GOHAN]
Spopovitch!

00:13:04.803 --> 00:13:09.110
This is not over!
I promise you that!

00:13:09.144 --> 00:13:10.947
I owe you!

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:13.853
[chuckles softly]

00:13:21.703 --> 00:13:22.738
Hey, guys.

00:13:22.772 --> 00:13:24.542
Do you have any
senzu beans on you?

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:26.011
[KRILLIN]
Sorry. This was all

00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:28.116
supposed to be
for fun, so--

00:13:28.149 --> 00:13:29.819
Too bad.

00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:31.823
Fine. I'll be back
in a second;

00:13:31.856 --> 00:13:34.127
I'm gonna pop in
on Korin and get some.

00:13:37.802 --> 00:13:39.237
She's gonna
make it, don't worry.

00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:41.976
Your dad's going to be back
soon with some senzu beans.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.649
Seriously?
Just what we need!

00:13:44.683 --> 00:13:46.451
That's a great idea!

00:13:58.911 --> 00:14:01.081
[MR. SATAN] Are you
outta your mind?

00:14:01.114 --> 00:14:04.187
Why is my little
girl in the infirmary?

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.690
No! Impossible!

00:14:05.724 --> 00:14:08.730
We're talkin' about Videl!
Next to me she's the strongest

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:11.201
person in the whole
world, you asshat!

00:14:11.235 --> 00:14:12.137
I knew it!

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.843
I told her not to
skimp on practice!

00:14:14.876 --> 00:14:18.082
Princess!
Daddy's coming!

00:14:21.288 --> 00:14:24.529
[MR. SATAN]
Videl! Videl!

00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:26.264
Vide--!

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:31.809
Oh. This is horrible!

00:14:31.843 --> 00:14:33.145
She's gonna be fine.

00:14:33.178 --> 00:14:35.517
The doctor says that
it's not as bad as it looks.

00:14:35.551 --> 00:14:37.087
Hold up! Who're you?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.092
Are you the piece of garbage who
did this to my pride and joy?

00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:42.029
[MONK DOCTOR]
No, sir; he's not.

00:14:42.063 --> 00:14:43.332
This nice young man
is the one who

00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:46.071
carried her
here for treatment.

00:14:46.104 --> 00:14:47.675
Oh. That's right.

00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:48.944
You can't be the guy.

00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:51.616
They had her up
against that Spopovitch.

00:14:51.649 --> 00:14:52.885
Well done, kid.

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:54.989
I'll sign an autograph
for you or somethin'.

00:14:55.022 --> 00:14:58.295
Uhhh...
Thank you. I guess.

00:14:58.329 --> 00:15:01.703
Right... Now'd be a good
time for you to scram.

00:15:01.737 --> 00:15:03.573
[GOHAN]
Um, sure.

00:15:04.909 --> 00:15:11.789
Wait, no.
Go--Gohan, I--

00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:16.900
I want-- I want
you... to beat him.

00:15:16.933 --> 00:15:19.806
Heh. I'll be facing
him in the next round.

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:22.477
And I promise you
he doesn't have prayer.

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:26.586
[MR. SATAN]
Huh?

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:34.602
Uh, what was
all that about?

00:15:34.636 --> 00:15:37.541
That kid's a coat rack;
Spops'll go to town on him.

00:15:37.575 --> 00:15:40.948
Nobody's puttin' that nutcase
in his place but me.

00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:42.518
That's right. Rest up.

00:15:42.551 --> 00:15:45.156
Your old man's got this.

00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:54.007
Waaah!

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.644
Nuh-uh! No way!

00:15:55.677 --> 00:15:58.650
Don't tell me you're
actually sweet on that kid?

00:15:58.683 --> 00:15:59.786
He's a toothpick!

00:15:59.819 --> 00:16:01.288
At least have
the self-respect to date

00:16:01.321 --> 00:16:03.226
someone with a little
meat on their bones!

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:05.363
You're the daughter
of a World Champion!

00:16:05.396 --> 00:16:07.835
Daughters of World
Champions don't go out with

00:16:07.868 --> 00:16:09.538
ninety-pound weaklings
who dress like...

00:16:09.572 --> 00:16:12.176
[MONK DOCTOR] Kindly
keep your voice down, please.

00:16:25.102 --> 00:16:27.406
[GOHAN]
Come on, Dad.

00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:37.828
[GOHAN] What's
taking him so long?

00:16:37.862 --> 00:16:39.999
Dunno. With his
instant transmission

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.769
you'd think
he'd be back by now.

00:16:41.802 --> 00:16:45.009
Hate to say it, but maybe
Korin's out of beans.

00:16:45.042 --> 00:16:46.813
Yeah? Kinda not
what I wanna hear.

00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:49.518
You know what, nevermind;
I'm gonna go check on Videl.

00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:52.023
When Dad gets back
send him to the infirmary.

00:16:52.056 --> 00:16:54.996
Love struck.

00:16:55.029 --> 00:16:58.069
Look, Gohan. I wasn't
born yesterday, you know.

00:16:58.102 --> 00:17:01.274
You've got a thing
for this girl, right?

00:17:02.577 --> 00:17:07.187
[VIDEL whimpers]

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.426
Put me back out there.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.065
I can't believe
he did this to her.

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:17.340
Spopovitch is a nobody.
Always has been.

00:17:18.676 --> 00:17:21.783
[CROWD]
Mister! Satan!

00:17:21.817 --> 00:17:25.356
[MR. SATAN]
Oh yeah!!

00:17:25.389 --> 00:17:34.107
[CROWD] Satan!
Mister! Satan! Mister!

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.344
Tough break, Spops,
havin' to go one-on-one

00:17:36.378 --> 00:17:39.050
with me in your first
match of the tournament.

00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:42.257
You must've racked up
some bad karma. Ha-ha!

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.495
Or maybe I just racked
up some good karma

00:17:44.529 --> 00:17:46.464
getting paired up
with a stiff like you.

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:49.137
Oh yeah?
We'll see 'bout that!

00:18:00.293 --> 00:18:03.533
Heh. Aw.
You tuckered out?

00:18:04.835 --> 00:18:07.207
[SPOPOVITCH] I'll make you
wish you were never born--

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.148
[SPOPOVITCH yells]

00:18:11.181 --> 00:18:14.120
[ANNOUNCER] And the
victory goes to Mr. Satan!

00:18:14.154 --> 00:18:16.258
Videl. I don't understand.

00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:18.261
Spopvitch is such a pushover!

00:18:18.295 --> 00:18:19.965
This all just
goes to show you

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:21.870
how important it
is to stay sharp!

00:18:21.903 --> 00:18:23.773
You let your guard down!

00:18:23.806 --> 00:18:25.511
Hm! Too much time boy-chasing

00:18:25.544 --> 00:18:28.349
and not enough time
in the dojo fine-tuning.

00:18:28.382 --> 00:18:31.622
Well, we'll have no
more of that, young lady.

00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:32.925
[VIDEL]
Gohan.

00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.494
What?!

00:18:35.363 --> 00:18:39.471
[VIDEL groans, gasps]

00:18:39.505 --> 00:18:41.642
Videl! Pumpkin!

00:18:41.675 --> 00:18:44.782
Hey, Quack, I thought this
wasn't as bad as it looked.

00:18:44.815 --> 00:18:46.251
Quite so, sir.

00:18:46.285 --> 00:18:48.488
I said that she'd be fine and
I stand by that prognosis--

00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:49.959
[MR. SATAN] You'll be
standing on your head

00:18:49.992 --> 00:18:51.162
if anything happens to her!

00:18:51.195 --> 00:18:52.598
Ya read me, college boy?

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:55.103
[LADY REPORTER 7A]
Mr. Satan! Mr. Satan!

00:18:55.136 --> 00:18:56.472
Just a moment of your time!

00:18:56.506 --> 00:18:58.943
Can you give us an
update on Videl's condition?

00:18:58.976 --> 00:19:01.281
The public has
the right to know!

00:19:01.314 --> 00:19:04.855
Is she expected
to make a full recovery?

00:19:04.888 --> 00:19:06.491
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:11.502
[ALL]
Aaah!

00:19:13.238 --> 00:19:15.577
We just wanna
know how Videl is.

00:19:15.611 --> 00:19:17.480
You wanna
know how Videl is?

00:19:17.514 --> 00:19:19.484
Ask yourselves
a simple question:

00:19:19.518 --> 00:19:22.757
Is she or is she not
the daughter of Mr. Satan?

00:19:22.791 --> 00:19:25.396
Now why don't you all buzz
off and let her get some rest.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.832
No more autographs today.

00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:29.772
Please, sir. Any words
for the man responsible

00:19:29.805 --> 00:19:31.107
for putting her here?

00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:32.978
You tell that freak
I just declared

00:19:33.011 --> 00:19:34.882
open season
on psychopaths!

00:19:34.916 --> 00:19:38.188
Spopovitch! For every
second Videl's in recovery,

00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:41.763
I'm gonna break something
you didn't know you had!

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.869
[REPORTERS]
Uh, sir? Champ! Champ!

00:19:44.902 --> 00:19:46.471
Please, Champ! Please!

00:19:46.506 --> 00:19:47.675
Paparazzi.

00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:51.381
They sure like to swarm
when they smell a story, huh?

00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:58.495
All right,
Gohan is up next.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.734
His opponent's
name is Kibito.

00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:03.139
Might as well be "Pinky
Toe" for all the trouble

00:20:03.172 --> 00:20:05.143
my boy's gonna have
snapping him in two.

00:20:05.176 --> 00:20:06.445
No kidding, right?

00:20:06.478 --> 00:20:08.215
Everybody knows
Gohan's the frontrunner

00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:10.052
for the championship round.

00:20:10.086 --> 00:20:12.090
Yep. Both him
and his old man.

00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:14.996
Come on, guys,
Momma needs new shoes.

00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:18.168
Gohan!
Show no mercy!

00:20:18.202 --> 00:20:19.404
Chi-Chi! You know he's not

00:20:19.437 --> 00:20:21.141
wearing that silly
getup 'cause he thinks

00:20:21.175 --> 00:20:23.178
it's intimidating, right?

00:20:23.212 --> 00:20:26.552
[CHICHI] Oh no!
Do you think anyone heard me?

00:20:27.286 --> 00:20:28.455
Now, Spopovitch.

00:20:28.488 --> 00:20:30.661
This next round
might be the one.

00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:31.829
Stay alert.

00:20:31.862 --> 00:20:35.737
Just relax. When this thing
says jump, we jump.

00:20:35.771 --> 00:20:36.739
It's easy.

00:20:36.773 --> 00:20:39.244
I'd like to get this
over with quickly.

00:20:39.277 --> 00:20:40.513
[SPOPOVITCH]
Yeah.

00:20:40.547 --> 00:20:43.151
All right, Kibito,
you know what to do.

00:20:43.185 --> 00:20:44.822
Hm!

00:20:46.992 --> 00:20:49.398
Where's Dad?
Still not back?

00:20:49.431 --> 00:20:52.637
Yeah. What could be
takin' him so long?

00:20:57.113 --> 00:20:59.451
[KORIN] Here we are:
fresh senzu beans.

00:20:59.484 --> 00:21:01.288
[GOKU]
Thanks, Korin.

00:21:01.321 --> 00:21:04.260
Incidentally,
it would be wise for you

00:21:04.293 --> 00:21:07.701
to stay on your
guard, my friend.

00:21:07.735 --> 00:21:09.839
I've got a feeling
there's more trouble

00:21:09.872 --> 00:21:11.075
headed our way.

00:21:11.108 --> 00:21:12.644
Yeah.

00:21:13.747 --> 00:21:15.416
Me, too.

00:21:15.449 --> 00:21:17.420
[NARRATOR] An ominous
cloud hangs over

00:21:17.453 --> 00:21:19.390
the World Martial
Arts Tournament,

00:21:19.424 --> 00:21:21.830
large enough that
Korin has sensed it

00:21:21.863 --> 00:21:23.566
from high atop his tower

00:21:23.599 --> 00:21:25.903
on the far side of the world.

00:21:25.937 --> 00:21:30.312
Clearly, some sinister force
is at work behind the scenes,

00:21:30.345 --> 00:21:32.717
waiting for the
chance to strike.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:37.027
And when it does, Goku and his
friends will have to be ready!
