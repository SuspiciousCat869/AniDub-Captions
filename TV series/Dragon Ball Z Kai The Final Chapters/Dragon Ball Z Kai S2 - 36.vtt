Don't give up now!

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.687
[PICCOLO]
Tough it out, Goku.

00:10:47.394 --> 00:10:48.664
[BULMA]
Please stop him.

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:55.611
[BUU hollers cheerfully]

00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:56.913
[laughs]

00:10:57.013 --> 00:10:58.650
This guy's good.
After all this

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.890
I've still underestimated
the depth of his power.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:07.334
[TRUNKS wails]
No...!

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:09.471
It's not over here!

00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:14.080
It's not over there!
It's not anywhere!

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.711
Oh, now I remember.

00:11:28.811 --> 00:11:29.912
You remember what?

00:11:30.012 --> 00:11:31.448
Where the Dragon Radar is

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.721
and I'm afraid Trunks is never
gonna find it on his own.

00:11:33.821 --> 00:11:35.658
Yeah. Pretty sure
I must've left it

00:11:35.758 --> 00:11:37.494
somewhere on the airplane
we were in earlier,

00:11:37.595 --> 00:11:40.066
you know, when we were hunting
for the Dragon Balls?

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.335
[ALL gasp]

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:42.739
[KRILLIN] Is there any chance
Trunks might look there?

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:44.174
I highly doubt it.

00:11:44.274 --> 00:11:45.911
So you mean he's been
searching for the darn thing

00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:48.048
in all the wrong places
the whole time?

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:50.286
No wonder it's
taking him so long.

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:52.023
We have to get in touch
with Trunks at once

00:11:52.123 --> 00:11:53.359
and let him know where it is!

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:55.731
Krillin, fetch a phone
so we can call the boy!

00:11:55.831 --> 00:11:57.701
Uh, I'd love to,
but look around.

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:00.073
There is a definite lack
of phones in this place.

00:12:00.173 --> 00:12:02.845
[VIDEL] Oh, well, you guys
could always use mine.

00:12:02.945 --> 00:12:04.281
Whoa, really?

00:12:04.381 --> 00:12:06.720
As a volunteer crime-fighter
and champion of justice,

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.591
I keep my phone
on me at all times

00:12:08.691 --> 00:12:10.527
in case there's
an emergency. Here you go.

00:12:10.627 --> 00:12:11.930
Awesome!
This is an emergency

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.834
if ever there was one, right?

00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:17.307
Oh! That's a real
game-changer with a capital "G"!

00:12:17.407 --> 00:12:22.250
[ROSHI groans]

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.258
[phone ringing]

00:12:26.358 --> 00:12:27.460
Oh, hello, Bulma.

00:12:27.561 --> 00:12:30.366
So nice to hear from you.
How's everything going?

00:12:30.466 --> 00:12:33.306
Just fine, Mom. Can you
please put Trunks on for me?

00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:35.945
You wanna speak to Trunks?
Just a minute, dear.

00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:37.648
Trunks, sweetie, telephone.

00:12:37.748 --> 00:12:40.521
[TRUNKS] I don't have time for
that! Tell 'em to call back!

00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:43.259
He says he doesn't have time
to come to the phone presently.

00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:45.163
Well, guess what? I don't
have time to waste either!

00:12:45.263 --> 00:12:47.568
Now hurry up and
put him on the phone!

00:12:50.675 --> 00:12:51.743
[BUU]
Bye-bye!

00:12:51.843 --> 00:12:54.882
You really got him that time!

00:12:58.389 --> 00:13:00.059
[GOKU yells]

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:02.497
Goku, please.
Enough of these stall tactics!

00:13:02.598 --> 00:13:04.970
You have to bring this fight
to a conclusion soon!

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.572
For goodness sake,
if you use up any more

00:13:06.672 --> 00:13:08.810
of your energy, you're going
to completely run out

00:13:08.911 --> 00:13:10.648
of the time
you have left on Earth!

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:17.260
[BUU hollers cheerfully]

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.500
Ha-ha-haaa!
Buu ready! Go again!

00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:22.705
[GOKU grunts]

00:13:22.805 --> 00:13:26.111
[BUU grunts]

00:13:32.725 --> 00:13:36.365
[chuckles, grunts]

00:13:37.434 --> 00:13:40.005
[yells]

00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:45.016
[BABIDI yells]
What the heck was that?

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:47.788
Where'd that come from?
How did he do that?

00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:50.393
[TRUNKS]
Huh? Inside the airplane?

00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:52.130
Okay, lemme go check!

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.666
Of course,
it's in the airplane!

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:57.809
Wait! Does our house have an
airport I don't know about?

00:13:57.909 --> 00:14:00.346
A plane. A plane?

00:14:00.446 --> 00:14:03.953
Oh, the plane?
That what your lookin' for?

00:14:06.693 --> 00:14:08.530
The plane's right in here.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.604
[GOKU panting]

00:14:14.976 --> 00:14:18.884
[BABIDI gasping]

00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:23.993
Are you all right?
Say something, Buu!

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.500
--[BUU chuckles]
--[GOKU] Hm?

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.884
[BABIDI laughs]

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:38.523
Majin Buu!
You're alive, you're alive!

00:14:38.623 --> 00:14:40.460
Thank goodness, you're alive!

00:14:40.561 --> 00:14:44.735
[BUU chuckles]

00:14:44.835 --> 00:14:45.971
[GOKU]
Can't be!

00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:48.943
A Kamehame-Ha?

00:14:50.413 --> 00:14:52.785
[BUU yells]

00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:54.588
[GOKU grunts]

00:14:56.358 --> 00:14:58.295
[screams]

00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:01.936
[yells]

00:15:02.037 --> 00:15:04.207
[GOKU]
Damn it.

00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:16.967
[ROSHI] If it's shakin'
this bad up here,

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:20.206
I don't even wanna imagine
what it's like down there!

00:15:20.306 --> 00:15:23.747
[GOHAN] Amazing.
That is some epic battle.

00:15:23.847 --> 00:15:25.350
As far removed as I am,

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.255
I can still feel
everything that's happening.

00:15:28.355 --> 00:15:31.295
Listen. You should know
it's extremely unlikely

00:15:31.395 --> 00:15:33.667
that Goku will win this fight.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:36.338
Unfortunately, that's how
strong Majin Buu is.

00:15:36.438 --> 00:15:39.077
Our best hope of defeating
this formidable threat

00:15:39.177 --> 00:15:41.348
literally rests
in your hands, Gohan.

00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:42.685
Which is why
we're counting on you

00:15:42.785 --> 00:15:45.423
to master
the legendary Z Sword.

00:15:45.524 --> 00:15:47.694
I understand.

00:15:48.863 --> 00:15:52.270
[grunts, gasps]

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.076
[chuckles]

00:15:55.176 --> 00:15:57.347
Not exactly the easiest
thing to lift, is it?

00:15:57.447 --> 00:15:59.151
Are you sure about this, sir?

00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:01.288
For generations,
not even the Supreme Kais

00:16:01.388 --> 00:16:05.496
have been capable of wielding
this hallowed blade.

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:11.375
[GOHAN grunting]

00:16:11.475 --> 00:16:17.688
[BUU laughs]

00:16:20.528 --> 00:16:22.931
Hey, be a little more
careful next time!

00:16:23.031 --> 00:16:24.936
That ball of energy
you swatted my way

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:26.606
just missed me, you imbecile!

00:16:26.706 --> 00:16:29.377
[laughs] Though I can't
stay too mad at you,

00:16:29.477 --> 00:16:31.916
seeing as how that blast
probably decimated about

00:16:32.017 --> 00:16:33.720
ten percent of the earth
in one shot!

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.228
Some big hero you are,
letting that happen! Haa!

00:16:38.328 --> 00:16:42.203
Buu. I gotta hand it to you.
You caught me off guard.

00:16:42.304 --> 00:16:44.943
You may look, talk, and even
act like a simple creature,

00:16:45.043 --> 00:16:46.345
but you're really a genius.

00:16:46.445 --> 00:16:48.248
Just by watching
your opponents' attacks,

00:16:48.348 --> 00:16:50.621
you can master them
almost instantly.

00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:52.658
Who, me?

00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:54.562
[BRIEFS] Not to worry.
The plane is stored

00:16:54.662 --> 00:16:58.101
safely inside
this little capsule here.

00:17:00.641 --> 00:17:02.711
[electric motor hums]

00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:04.247
[BRIEFS]
Beats building a hangar.

00:17:04.347 --> 00:17:07.788
[TRUNKS]
Okay. Uuuh...

00:17:10.426 --> 00:17:12.063
Hey, Mom was right--I found it!

00:17:12.163 --> 00:17:14.067
Oh, how wonderful!
Good for you, sweetie.

00:17:14.167 --> 00:17:16.505
You must be starving
after that. Come have a nosh.

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:18.075
How many ways
do I have to say it?

00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:20.479
There's no time!
I gotta run! Bye!

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.185
Aww. What's the point of
having the cute grandkids

00:17:23.285 --> 00:17:26.291
if you can't even
spoil 'em rotten?

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:31.602
[GOKU grunts]

00:17:31.702 --> 00:17:33.740
[GOKU] Trunks' energy
is on the move again.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.078
He's leaving West City,
which means he must've

00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:38.049
finally found the Radar.

00:17:38.149 --> 00:17:40.086
And that means
my work here is done.

00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:42.557
Time to end this show.

00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:48.870
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:17:48.971 --> 00:17:50.841
Hey! Why you
turn back normal now?

00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:53.145
Buu like you.
You fun to fight with.

00:17:53.245 --> 00:17:54.582
We fight more now!

00:17:54.682 --> 00:17:56.920
I'm honored
to hear you say that, Buu.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.257
But sadly, I don't have
a lotta time left.

00:17:59.357 --> 00:18:00.961
As much as I'd like
to keep fighting,

00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:03.298
we need a way
to stop you for good.

00:18:03.399 --> 00:18:05.069
And that means
that I've gotta go.

00:18:05.169 --> 00:18:07.040
[laughs]

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.178
You stupid fool!
Do you honestly think

00:18:09.278 --> 00:18:11.248
you're going to
make it out of here alive?

00:18:11.348 --> 00:18:14.822
Majin Buu, please show our
friend just how wrong he is!

00:18:14.922 --> 00:18:15.991
[BUU]
Buu!

00:18:16.091 --> 00:18:18.429
[hollers cheerfully]

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.232
After you get this
obnoxious busybody

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:22.370
out of the way, we'll head
straight for West City

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.975
and wipe that
stinking town off the map!

00:18:25.075 --> 00:18:26.245
We'll kill everyone!

00:18:26.345 --> 00:18:27.748
And then those punks
will have no choice

00:18:27.848 --> 00:18:30.688
but to come forward
and face us like men.

00:18:30.788 --> 00:18:32.290
Listen to me, Babidi.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.428
All of those guys
that you're looking for--

00:18:34.529 --> 00:18:36.532
Piccolo, Trunks, and Goten--

00:18:36.632 --> 00:18:39.271
they'll show themselves,
in three--no, in two days.

00:18:39.371 --> 00:18:41.041
They'll be ready in two days.

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:42.644
[BUU]
Huh?

00:18:42.744 --> 00:18:45.149
[GOKU] But until then, I need
you to lay off the destruction.

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:47.320
No more killing
innocent people, okay?

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.825
Just two days.
That's all I'm asking.

00:18:49.925 --> 00:18:51.094
Can you gimme that?

00:18:51.195 --> 00:18:52.765
[BUU]
Uuuh...

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:54.735
They be more strong like you?

00:18:54.835 --> 00:18:55.970
Much stronger.

00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:58.009
[BUU]
Hm-hmmm!

00:18:58.109 --> 00:18:59.579
[laughs]

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:02.651
What makes you think I'd have
any interest in negotiating?

00:19:02.751 --> 00:19:04.989
In fact, I think we'll go
and kill even more people

00:19:05.089 --> 00:19:06.693
just to spite you!

00:19:06.793 --> 00:19:08.028
Well, that's too bad.

00:19:08.129 --> 00:19:10.233
I bet an epic battle with three
top-of-their-game fighters

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.470
would've been a lot
of fun for Majin Buu.

00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:14.208
Oh, and by the way, Babidi...

00:19:14.308 --> 00:19:16.044
When you get to hell--
which, believe me,

00:19:16.145 --> 00:19:17.815
is gonna be
sooner than you think--

00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:19.719
King Yemma will make you suffer.

00:19:19.819 --> 00:19:21.723
Goodbye.

00:19:21.823 --> 00:19:23.960
[BABIDI]
Aah!

00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:30.206
He just--He just vanished!

00:19:30.306 --> 00:19:31.408
[BUU]
Huh.

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:33.412
What? What was that guy?

00:19:33.513 --> 00:19:36.418
And what exactly was he doing
here in the first place?

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:38.189
This is all your fault, Buu!

00:19:38.289 --> 00:19:39.692
You let him get away!

00:19:39.792 --> 00:19:42.096
Because you were too busy
dawdling around to kill him!

00:19:42.196 --> 00:19:45.369
You inept ignoramus!

00:19:45.469 --> 00:19:48.141
He can't have gotten too far.
He must be around here!

00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:49.746
So, don't just sit there
like a lump;

00:19:49.846 --> 00:19:51.649
go out and look for him!

00:19:51.749 --> 00:19:54.020
Hey, did you hear
what I said, bozo?

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.189
Come on, now!

00:19:55.289 --> 00:19:58.095
Go on, get moving
already, fatty!

00:19:58.195 --> 00:20:05.944
[BUU grunts]

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.850
Aaah!

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.286
Guess what, Babidi?

00:20:10.386 --> 00:20:12.156
What? What is it?

00:20:12.256 --> 00:20:14.595
Buu have a good idea just now.

00:20:14.695 --> 00:20:17.367
Really, a goofball
like you has a good idea?

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:19.403
Somehow I seriously doubt that.

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:24.313
But hurry up and tell it to me
anyway so we can move on.

00:20:25.115 --> 00:20:27.487
All right now.
Listen real close.

00:20:27.588 --> 00:20:29.625
Come on, spit it out!
The sooner you do,

00:20:29.725 --> 00:20:32.598
the sooner you can
hunt down that trickster!

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:34.167
[BUU chuckles]

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:35.804
[BABIDI gasps]

00:20:35.904 --> 00:20:36.907
[chuckles]

00:20:37.007 --> 00:20:40.881
[BABIDI groans, gasps]

00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:44.287
Hmmm. Babidi no can speak now.

00:20:44.387 --> 00:20:46.391
So no can say
magic spell to seal Buu

00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:49.064
in big icky ball again, can he?

00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:54.274
[BABIDI gasping for air]

00:20:54.374 --> 00:20:57.146
Buu learn lots and lots
from you, Babidi.

00:20:57.246 --> 00:20:59.585
But now, Buu no
need you no more.

00:20:59.685 --> 00:21:01.989
Buu done with mean old wizard.

00:21:02.089 --> 00:21:04.862
[BABIDI panting]

00:21:04.962 --> 00:21:07.366
[BUU chuckles]

00:21:07.466 --> 00:21:09.839
[BABIDI panting]

00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:12.143
You die, dummy!

00:21:12.243 --> 00:21:19.257
[BABIDI screams, mufffled]

00:21:19.357 --> 00:21:21.529
[BABIDI groans]

00:21:24.635 --> 00:21:27.507
[NARRATOR] At last, Majin Buu
has turned against Babidi

00:21:27.607 --> 00:21:30.614
and is out from under
the wizard's gnarled thumb.

00:21:30.714 --> 00:21:33.485
What will Buu do
with his newfound freedom?

00:21:33.586 --> 00:21:37.260
The possibilities are
endless and terrifying--

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.098
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:45.643
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.999
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:49.204
I don't know how, but Majin
Buu's even more out of control

00:22:49.304 --> 00:22:51.743
now than he was before.
Goten! Trunks!

00:22:51.843 --> 00:22:53.847
I'm about to teach you
the Fusion Pose,

00:22:53.947 --> 00:22:55.149
so pay close attention!

00:22:55.249 --> 00:22:57.721
[TRUNKS] We have to do that?
Looks pretty embarrassing.

00:22:57.821 --> 00:23:00.426
I don't wanna do something
that'll make me look silly!

00:23:00.527 --> 00:23:02.897
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:05.637 --> 00:23:06.939
[GOHAN]
If those two fuse together,

00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:09.443
I can't even imagine
what that's gonna look like.
