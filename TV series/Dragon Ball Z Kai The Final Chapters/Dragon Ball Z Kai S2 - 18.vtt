on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:11.757
a sudden attack
from the Demon King Dabura

them to normal,

no choice but to follow

the Demon King into
the depths of Babidi's ship.

this is the first stage;

the designation fool you.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.809
[NARRATOR] Can our heroes
survive the dangers below

and reach Babidi and Dabura in
the heart of the wizard's lair?

comes in Stage One!

I assure you, when we

they should succeed,

Of course. Hm!
My only concern is that

00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:23.774

Even if he's not
at full power,

the results would still
be disastrous!

Hmph. You've exaggerated
every threat we've faced

00:09:39.057 --> 00:09:41.830
since we got here,
starting with that "Dabura."

00:09:41.863 --> 00:09:44.101
So, why should this one
be any different?

00:09:44.134 --> 00:09:47.407
What? You've already
witnessed Dabura's power.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.544
What about Kibito!

00:09:48.577 --> 00:09:50.413
Yes, I saw plenty.

00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:52.685
And I find this
so-called "Demon King"

00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:55.289
you fear so much unimpressive.

00:09:55.323 --> 00:09:58.195
Judging by the way he moved
and the level of his attacks,

00:09:58.229 --> 00:10:00.801
as long as we can avoid
his dangerous loogies,

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:02.706
he's nothing we can't handle.

00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:05.912

was careless, that's all.

Yeah. I guess I'd put Dabura
on the same level as Cell.

00:10:13.393 --> 00:10:16.666
He was that evil android that
we fought seven years ago.

He was tough, but we still
managed to defeat him,

00:10:19.204 --> 00:10:22.410
and we're all a lot
stronger now, y'know?

00:10:22.444 --> 00:10:24.114
[SUPREME KAI]
Unbelievable.

Is it possible that these
Saiyans really are that strong?

his Super Saiyan form.

Could it be that wasn't
even his full power?

00:10:38.811 --> 00:10:41.650
Hey! What's taking so long?

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.722
Let's go! Are you
coming out or not?

00:10:45.223 --> 00:10:46.759
[electric motor hums]

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:49.264
[GOKU] Huh?
[electric motor hums]

00:10:49.297 --> 00:10:51.202
[YAKON growls]

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:52.771
[GOKU]
Ooh.

00:10:56.345 --> 00:10:57.916
[YAKON growls]

00:10:57.949 --> 00:11:00.988
Aah! What the heck is that?

00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:05.764
[growls]

00:11:05.797 --> 00:11:07.936
No, it can't be!

00:11:07.969 --> 00:11:09.071
[growls]

00:11:09.104 --> 00:11:11.676
You see?
Didn't I tell you, Yakon?

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.148
Now feast away--
finish them off!

00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:16.018
[laughs]

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.283
[YAKON growns]

00:11:37.494 --> 00:11:38.764
[gasps]

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:42.003
Wow. Looks like
you drew a real ugly one.

00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:43.072
[chuckles]

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:47.347
Let us begin.
Who's ready to be eaten?

00:11:47.381 --> 00:11:49.050
Can I pick a new opponent?

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:52.490
You're big n'all, but you seem
like you're awfully slow.

00:11:52.525 --> 00:11:53.794
[YAKON]
Mmm?!

00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:55.698
Your father should
not treat this so casually.

00:11:55.731 --> 00:11:57.500
I know this creature!

00:11:57.535 --> 00:11:58.904
Oh yeah? Who is he?

00:11:58.937 --> 00:12:01.141
Yakon, the legendary
space beast,

00:12:01.174 --> 00:12:03.814
one of the most feared
monsters in the universe!

00:12:03.847 --> 00:12:06.151
This will not be an easy fight.

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:07.020
[VEGETA huffs]

00:12:07.053 --> 00:12:09.224
[BABIDI laughs]
That's it, Yakon!

00:12:09.257 --> 00:12:12.097
Now steal their energy--
every last bit!

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.772
Mmm, yes. Majin Buu
will be revived in no time!

00:12:15.805 --> 00:12:17.975
[DABURA, BABIDI laugh]

00:12:18.743 --> 00:12:24.522
[YAKON laughs]

00:12:26.258 --> 00:12:27.962
[GOKU chuckles]

00:12:30.801 --> 00:12:32.337
[YAKON grunts]

00:12:43.459 --> 00:12:46.298
Huh? Aah!

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:48.002
That was close!

00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:51.008
[laughs]

00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:54.615
Wow. He's a lot faster
than he looks.

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.486
I warned you
about this, didn't I?

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.989
Goku is far outmatched!

00:12:58.022 --> 00:12:59.224
Huh? No.

00:12:59.257 --> 00:13:01.730
Dad's fine; he's totally got
this thing under control.

00:13:01.763 --> 00:13:03.199
Just wait, you'll see.

00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:04.769
Wait and see?

00:13:04.802 --> 00:13:07.340
[YAKON chuckles]
Lucky dodge!

00:13:07.373 --> 00:13:10.948
But... your luck
won't save you for long.

00:13:10.981 --> 00:13:13.185
Whoa. I wasn't
expecting those claws.

00:13:13.219 --> 00:13:15.625
I guess I'll have to be
a little more careful.

00:13:15.658 --> 00:13:17.493
[laughs]

00:13:17.528 --> 00:13:20.166
Look at him! He's afraid!

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:23.840
Let's see if we can graduate
him to full-blown terror!

00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:25.911
Listen to me, Yakon!

00:13:25.944 --> 00:13:28.282
You're performing beautifully!

00:13:28.315 --> 00:13:30.654
Leave the Supreme Kai
alone for now,

00:13:30.687 --> 00:13:32.323
but you may devour
the other three!

00:13:32.357 --> 00:13:35.798
Just be sure to chew slowly.
To grind every last bit

00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:38.236
of energy out of them
for Majin Buu!

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:40.207
And since I know
how you love the dark,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.611
I'll even transport you
to Planet Ankoku,

00:13:42.645 --> 00:13:46.351
so that you can enjoy your meal
without all these pesky lights.

00:13:46.384 --> 00:13:47.020
[YAKON chuckles]

00:13:47.053 --> 00:13:48.355
Very devious, Master,

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:50.928
but I doubt Yakon
requires such an advantage

00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:52.965
in order to defeat
these Earthlings.

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:56.672
No. But I think it's best
to err on the side of caution.

00:13:56.706 --> 00:13:58.376
Plus, if they start
playing rough,

00:13:58.409 --> 00:13:59.979
we don't want them
rattling the ship

00:14:00.012 --> 00:14:02.484
and waking Majin Buu
prematurely, now do we?

00:14:02.518 --> 00:14:04.689
After we've all this trouble,
it would be a shame

00:14:04.722 --> 00:14:07.060
if he emerged
at less than full power.

00:14:07.094 --> 00:14:10.066
[chuckles]
Indeed.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:12.572
So then, off they go!

00:14:12.605 --> 00:14:16.379
[yells]

00:14:16.412 --> 00:14:20.052
Papparapapa!

00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:22.224
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:23.693
[BOTH gasp]

00:14:23.726 --> 00:14:28.269
[YAKON laughs]

00:14:28.303 --> 00:14:30.473
[GOKU] Did Babidi
just move us again?

00:14:30.508 --> 00:14:33.847
Man. It's totally pitch black.
I can't see a thing!

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.422
[YAKON grunts]

00:14:40.527 --> 00:14:42.230
[laughs]

00:14:42.263 --> 00:14:45.704
Planet Ankoku!
The world of darkness!

00:14:45.737 --> 00:14:48.208
You can't see me,
but I can see you!

00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:50.881
You're scratching your head
right now, aren't you?

00:14:50.914 --> 00:14:52.183
What the--?

00:14:52.216 --> 00:14:53.920
[GOHAN]
Planet Ankoku?

00:14:53.953 --> 00:14:55.390
[SUPREME KAI]
Yakon's homeworld.

00:14:55.423 --> 00:14:57.326
It lies at the distant edge
of the universe,

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.467
where no light can reach it,
thus "the world of darkness."

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.469
Aaah...

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:05.075
[YAKON] Enough waiting!
It is time to eat!

00:15:10.587 --> 00:15:12.123
[YAKON growls]

00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.962
Where'd you go?

00:15:17.935 --> 00:15:19.471
Eat this!

00:15:27.086 --> 00:15:29.291
[YAKON grunts]

00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:31.729
[groans]

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:35.938
Can either of you tell me
what's going on out there?

00:15:35.971 --> 00:15:38.275
Why? Can you not?

00:15:38.308 --> 00:15:40.346
[YAKON yells]

00:15:50.534 --> 00:15:55.878
[YAKON groans]

00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:58.182
Impossible. You can see?

00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:01.388
No, but then again,
I don't really need to.

00:16:01.422 --> 00:16:03.292
It's not all that hard
to sense your movements

00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:05.931
from the vibrations in the air.

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:08.504
And it's definitely
not hard to smell you.

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:09.706
[gasps]

00:16:09.739 --> 00:16:13.580
[GOKU] Of course, if I
really did want to see you...

00:16:13.613 --> 00:16:15.149
...that's easy.

00:16:17.353 --> 00:16:20.961
[yells]

00:16:20.995 --> 00:16:22.999
[YAKON]
Uhh...

00:16:23.032 --> 00:16:25.537
[BABIDI] What is this?
What's he doing?

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.844
He's changing!
His hair--everything!

00:16:28.877 --> 00:16:32.384
So he glows. It's merely
a worthless trick.

00:16:32.417 --> 00:16:35.289
You! Go now and fetch me
an energy meter!

00:16:35.322 --> 00:16:37.661
The biggest one
you can find! Quickly!

00:16:37.695 --> 00:16:39.230
Sir!

00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:45.544
Hm!

00:16:50.921 --> 00:16:53.392
There he goes.
Pretty impressive, huh?

00:16:53.425 --> 00:16:55.998
Sorry, but dark
doesn't scare me.

00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:59.705
I bring my own light
with me, wherever I go.

00:17:01.008 --> 00:17:03.211
[chuckles]
That's good!

00:17:03.245 --> 00:17:06.553
I always enjoy eating a
light snack before my meal!

00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:10.860
'Kay. That's not the
reaction I was expecting.

00:17:10.894 --> 00:17:12.564
[UNDERLING 18C]
Master Babidi!

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.476
[BABIDI] Huh?!
Three thousand kilis?

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:23.319
How can any Earthling
generate 3,000 kilis of energy?

00:17:23.352 --> 00:17:26.559
It can't be.
With 300 kilis it's possible

00:17:26.593 --> 00:17:29.297
to destroy a planet.
Three thousand?

00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:31.869
I'm telling you a human
with that kind of power

00:17:31.902 --> 00:17:33.106
does not exist.

00:17:33.139 --> 00:17:35.076
[BABIDI] The meter
must be broken, right?

00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:37.915
But what if it's actually
functioning properly?

00:17:37.949 --> 00:17:41.021
What then?
Yakon only rates 800 kilis.

00:17:41.054 --> 00:17:44.360
He won't stand
a chance against 3,000!

00:17:46.197 --> 00:17:49.337
[YAKON laughs]

00:17:49.371 --> 00:17:51.441
Delicious.

00:17:55.984 --> 00:18:02.364
[growls]

00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:05.402
Is he--? No way. Impossible!

00:18:05.436 --> 00:18:11.181
[bellows]

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:19.130
[YAKON continues]

00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:28.115
Uh! What the--? Huh.

00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:29.318
What happened?

00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:31.321
Dad changed back
from being a Super Saiyan?

00:18:31.355 --> 00:18:35.530
Yes. Though it seems
the choice wasn't entirely his.

00:18:38.736 --> 00:18:40.840
Yummy! Thank you!

00:18:40.874 --> 00:18:44.649
That was the most brilliant
meal I've ever eaten!

00:18:44.682 --> 00:18:45.817
Eaten?

00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:48.857
If Yakon is a creature
that feeds on light energy,

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.027
then Goku's Super Saiyan aura--

00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:55.236
he would likely find that
a most nourishing meal, indeed!

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:56.505
Hey, listen! Dad!

00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:58.744
Don't go Super Saiyan
again, okay?

00:18:58.777 --> 00:18:59.746
This thing eats light.

00:18:59.779 --> 00:19:02.518
You're only going
to make him stronger!

00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:03.587
[GOKU]
Huh?

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.756
[laughs]

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:08.295
Oh, don't mind them.
Go on, light yourself up!

00:19:08.328 --> 00:19:12.136
I could feast on that delicious
golden energy all day long!

00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:16.244
Really? He's that hungry, huh?

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:21.722
[burps]

00:19:21.756 --> 00:19:23.258
Huh.

00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:25.931
All right! Just remember,
you asked for it!

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:27.534
What?

00:19:27.568 --> 00:19:28.537
Here goes!

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.574
What in the blazes
is Kakarot up to now?

00:19:30.607 --> 00:19:33.345
Dad! Seriously,
don't go Super Saiyan again!

00:19:33.378 --> 00:19:36.151
Let's fight him together
so we don't have to transform!

00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:40.628
No, son. You guys stand clear.
This fight's mine.

00:19:40.661 --> 00:19:42.497
[grunts]

00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:45.002
[chuckles]
Perfect! Don't hold back!

00:19:45.035 --> 00:19:48.308
I want it all!
Everything you've got!

00:19:48.341 --> 00:19:50.279
No! Now he's just
being foolish!

00:19:50.312 --> 00:19:52.116
Why transform again
when he knows the light

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:54.221
will only make Yakon stronger?

00:19:54.254 --> 00:19:56.425
We have to put a stop
to this at once!

00:19:56.458 --> 00:19:58.395
I'd like to see you try.

00:19:58.429 --> 00:20:01.434
Kakarot is a lot of things,
but he is not a fool.

00:20:01.468 --> 00:20:03.439
He knows what he's doing.

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:05.242
[growls]

00:20:07.113 --> 00:20:10.821
[YAKON bellows]

00:20:10.854 --> 00:20:12.157
[GOKU]
No!

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:16.097
[YAKON continues]

Bah! Yakon, you dolt!

00:20:18.536 --> 00:20:20.406
What good does it do us
if you suck up

00:20:20.439 --> 00:20:22.376
all of the energy for yourself!

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.582
If you don't inflict
any actual damage,

00:20:24.615 --> 00:20:26.920
we can't send
the energy to Majin Buu!

00:20:26.953 --> 00:20:28.656
This is a total waste!

Hey! It's me, Goku!

I sure hope they're all right.
