All those guys
that you're looking for--

00:17:15.436 --> 00:17:18.643
they'll show themselves
in three--no, in two days.

00:17:18.676 --> 00:17:21.348
But until then, I need you
to lay off the destruction.

00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:23.987
No more killing
innocent people, okay?

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.991
[BUU]
They be more strong like you?

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:28.062
Just two days.
That's all I'm asking.

00:17:28.095 --> 00:17:29.698
Can you give me that?

00:17:35.142 --> 00:17:38.181
[BOTH snoring]

00:17:40.854 --> 00:17:43.359
[chuckles]

00:17:43.392 --> 00:17:47.133
--Produce.
--Wait, hear me out!

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:49.371
Two of them are here, Buu--
you're right.

00:17:49.404 --> 00:17:52.043
But, they can't fight;
they're sleeping.

00:17:52.077 --> 00:17:53.847
Then you go wake them up.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.283
[PICCOLO]
No. You don't understand;

00:17:55.316 --> 00:17:56.586
they're not ready to fight yet,

00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:59.190
they need to sleep
to recover. It's true!

00:17:59.224 --> 00:18:00.293
[SUPER BUU]
Mmm.

00:18:00.326 --> 00:18:02.497
Buu. Please! Think about it!

00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:04.502
If you fight them now
they won't be at full strength,

00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:08.209
and you won't have
the challenge you want!

00:18:08.242 --> 00:18:10.446
[SUPER BUU]
Hmmmm.

00:18:11.649 --> 00:18:13.385
[neck cracks]

00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:18.261
No, I cannot do this.
I hate waiting. No good!

00:18:18.295 --> 00:18:20.868
But the promise was for
two days, isn't that right?

00:18:20.901 --> 00:18:22.203
We still have one day left!

00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:24.407
--My mind changed.
--[neck cracks]

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.480
--Thinking differently now.
--[neck cracks]

00:18:27.514 --> 00:18:29.283
Produce!

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.361
So that's Buu. He wants
to fight Trunks and Goten--

00:18:34.394 --> 00:18:36.833
that's why he's here.

00:18:36.867 --> 00:18:40.440
Like hell he's fighting my son!
My family's been through enough!

00:18:40.473 --> 00:18:43.178
I'll drive him off!
No one messes with my boy!

00:18:43.212 --> 00:18:45.316
Stop it, Chichi,
you'll just get yourself killed!

00:18:45.349 --> 00:18:48.957
You know what kind of monster
he is. It's no use!

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.627
[CHICHI]
Let go of me, Dad. Let me go!

00:18:50.661 --> 00:18:52.998
I have to protect
my family! Get off!

00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:58.510
He's already taken one son!
I won't let him take Goten, too!

00:18:58.543 --> 00:18:59.846
[neck cracks]

00:18:59.879 --> 00:19:02.350
You produce them, no delay!

00:19:06.325 --> 00:19:09.464
[PICCOLO] No. If they fight now
they won't stand a chance.

00:19:09.497 --> 00:19:12.170
I have to buy time--at any cost!

00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:14.341
Produce--last warning.

00:19:14.374 --> 00:19:16.211
Please! Just give us
more time!

00:19:16.244 --> 00:19:20.119
I won't ask for a full day
but give us something!

00:19:20.153 --> 00:19:21.488
You're bored, right?

00:19:21.523 --> 00:19:23.259
But weren't you planning
to kill everyone on Earth--

00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:25.029
weren't you doing <i>that</i> for fun?

00:19:25.063 --> 00:19:26.365
[SUPER BUU]
Hm?!

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:27.935
Well, there are still
quite a few humans down there

00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:29.104
you haven't killed yet.

00:19:29.137 --> 00:19:30.641
You can wipe them all out
while you wait.

00:19:30.674 --> 00:19:34.014
--[KRILLIN] Eeh!
--[DENDE] What? Piccolo, no!

00:19:34.815 --> 00:19:36.653
[PICCOLO] Forgive me,
but we can bring you all back

00:19:36.686 --> 00:19:40.192
with the Dragon Balls.
I promise we will.

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:43.265
Heh.

00:19:51.716 --> 00:19:53.886
Uh, what's he doing?

00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:22.343
[PICCOLO] That's it!
He's using the Lookout to find

00:20:22.377 --> 00:20:24.247
the rest of the survivors.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.255
He's going to fly down
and kill them all, one by one.

00:20:28.289 --> 00:20:30.159
Well, it's our only play.

00:20:30.192 --> 00:20:32.931
At least it buys us
a little bit of time.

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:37.173
What's the guy doing,
a victory lap?

00:20:37.206 --> 00:20:39.611
He's acting like
he owns the place.

00:20:39.645 --> 00:20:42.551
[PICCOLO] Krillin. Wake up
Trunks and Goten.

00:20:42.584 --> 00:20:45.657
Take them into the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:48.563
They'll keep training in there.
Now's the time to use it.

00:20:48.597 --> 00:20:51.602
We have to maximize every minute
this distraction gives us.

00:20:51.635 --> 00:20:54.241
Why? It's been enough time--
can't they fuse now?

00:20:54.274 --> 00:20:57.479
Can't you sense his power?
He's far too strong.

00:20:57.514 --> 00:20:58.950
I don't care
how perfectly they fuse,

00:20:58.983 --> 00:21:02.023
there's no way they can
beat this new version of Buu.

00:21:02.056 --> 00:21:03.994
Give the boys this message:

00:21:04.027 --> 00:21:07.066
"Unless they want to die as
children and let the world end,

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:11.809
they better train as hard
as they can in that chamber."

00:21:11.843 --> 00:21:13.078
Go.

00:21:13.112 --> 00:21:14.882
[KRILLIN]
Okay.

00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:18.489
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu
has changed into a new form;

00:21:18.523 --> 00:21:22.564
a manifestation of hatred
and his darkest impulses.

00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:25.435
And he has found
the Lookout at last.

00:21:25.469 --> 00:21:27.841
Gohan's training
remains incomplete,

00:21:27.874 --> 00:21:30.614
while Goku and the Kais
can only wait.

00:21:30.647 --> 00:21:33.319
The boys must push Fusion
to a new level,

00:21:33.352 --> 00:21:36.058
or every life on Earth
will be lost.

00:21:36.091 --> 00:21:38.930
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai.

♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:47.200
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:49.037
And this is making me sick!

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.809
The boys don't have a chance
of beating Buu's new form!

00:22:51.843 --> 00:22:53.412
[SUPER BUU]
I've killed them all!

00:22:53.445 --> 00:22:56.652
Now produce the challengers
or you die as well.

00:22:56.686 --> 00:22:59.424
[PICCOLO] If we had one more
hour it might be enough!

00:22:59.457 --> 00:23:01.662
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:05.671 --> 00:23:07.574
[GOHAN] Can they really
get Majin Buu to wait?

00:23:07.608 --> 00:23:09.443
He's not exactly patient.
