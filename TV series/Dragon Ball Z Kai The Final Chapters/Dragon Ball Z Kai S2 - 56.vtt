You imbecile! I said
to finish him quickly,

00:12:39.285 --> 00:12:42.891
but did you listen to me?
No, of course not!

This is what happens
when you get cocky!

And now Buu's got you in
the palm of his hand! Literally!

I'm gonna enjoy chewing
you up in one big bite!

00:12:57.521 --> 00:12:59.626
Or maybe I'll just let you
dissolve in my mouth

00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:01.462
and make it last longer!

But, don't you worry.
I'll give you a fitting end.

00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:42.176
Slowly. Little by little, I'll
dissolve you inside my mouth,

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.914
and then when there's
barely anything left of you,

00:13:43.947 --> 00:13:46.786
I'll chomp down,
and chew you to bits!

Sorry to burst your bubble, Buu,

00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:01.883
but you can't
get rid of me that easily.

00:14:01.916 --> 00:14:03.954
No, this can't be possible!

Yeah, I'm shocked, too.

my strength is the same.

hasn't been limited either.

Now if I only had limbs,
I'd be as agile as ever!

00:14:20.755 --> 00:14:21.990

00:14:22.024 --> 00:14:24.127

even though your opponent

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.766
is the strongest candy
in the world?

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.471
Shut up! So what
if you can float around?

00:14:29.505 --> 00:14:30.841
You're just candy!

What are you gonna do,
give me a cavity?

00:14:32.611 --> 00:14:34.649
[VEGETTO] Sure you wanna find
out what I can do?

00:14:34.682 --> 00:14:36.620
Besides, if my
current size puts anyone

00:14:36.653 --> 00:14:38.022
at a disadvantage, it's you.

00:14:38.055 --> 00:14:40.928
Good luck landing a punch
on me, as small as I am.

"Landing a punch"?

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.499
Who said anything
about punching you?

00:14:43.533 --> 00:14:45.236
Why would I do that
when all I have to do

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:47.373
is catch you and
pop you into my mouth?

00:14:47.407 --> 00:14:49.377
And then devour you!

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.714
[VEGETTO]
Oh, well in that case,

00:14:50.747 --> 00:14:53.319

00:15:19.338 --> 00:15:22.376
Wait, what happened to your
plan to catch me and eat me?

Oh, well.

[screams]

00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:03.526
[VEGETTO] Sorry about that.
You just seemed so desperate

to eat me, I thought I'd help
by landing right in your mouth.

Guess that's why they
call 'em jawbreakers, huh?

You wanna keep going?

You've pulled
every trick in the book.

look like anything's
