Yeah. Down there.

00:16:20.326 --> 00:16:23.600
I want water. Cool, clean,
refreshing water.

00:16:23.633 --> 00:16:26.973
Or beer. Beer's better.
Why didn't I drink that beer?

00:16:27.006 --> 00:16:29.645
Dang explosion. Ruined my beer.

00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:32.284
What?! Mr. Satan?

00:16:32.317 --> 00:16:34.789
How is he the only person
still left on Earth?

00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:36.191
Eh, he is the world champ--

00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:37.728
I'm sure he'll be fine
on his own.

00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:41.167
No. The humane thing
to do is bring him with us.

00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:44.007
He's an arrogant goofball
but deep down he's a good man.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.513
Plus, he did try to stop
Majin Buu, in his own way.

00:16:46.546 --> 00:16:49.184
Tea would be good, too.
Tea with lemon. Lemonade.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.624
A bathtub full of ice-cold
lemonade to drink from.

00:16:52.658 --> 00:16:54.060
[groaning]

00:16:56.666 --> 00:17:00.607
[MR. SATAN, BEE screaming]

00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:06.184
[hollering]

00:17:09.725 --> 00:17:12.732
Hey, that looks... like Gohan?

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.736
Hello there, sir!

00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:16.471
[MR. SATAN]
Hello...

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:23.987
So, how was Dende
able to escape

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.458
Buu destroying the Lookout?

00:17:26.492 --> 00:17:29.364
Buu had hours
while we were in the chamber.

00:17:29.397 --> 00:17:31.903
More than enough time to
hunt down Dende and kill him.

00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:35.443
Huh? My dad told me you and
Gotenks were fighting Buu

00:17:35.476 --> 00:17:37.313
in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:39.652
but then he escaped
back to Earth. Is that right?

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:41.823
[PICCOLO] Right. Buu ripped
a hole between dimensions.

00:17:41.856 --> 00:17:44.160
Yeah, I know. And it wasn't
long before you made

00:17:44.193 --> 00:17:46.465
your own portal and
followed him to the Lookout.

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:48.670
But aren't you forgetting
time distortion, Piccolo?

00:17:48.704 --> 00:17:50.741
A day out here equals
a year in the chamber.

00:17:50.774 --> 00:17:53.045
So even if it had taken you
hours to follow him,

00:17:53.078 --> 00:17:55.083
on Earth that
would've been nothing!

00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.753
[PICCOLO]
You're right!

00:17:56.787 --> 00:17:57.988
[MR. SATAN]
Ooh!

00:17:58.021 --> 00:18:00.159
I got mixed up!
Lost track of the time lines

00:18:00.192 --> 00:18:02.264
in the heat of battle.
I had it backwards,

00:18:02.297 --> 00:18:04.635
like Buu had more time
than us, not less!

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:07.508
It took us a little more than
an hour to make our portal.

00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:10.914
So only about ten seconds would
have passed out here on Earth!

00:18:10.947 --> 00:18:14.989
Ha! Not even Buu's fast enough
to find Dende that quickly!

00:18:15.022 --> 00:18:19.130
[screaming]

00:18:19.163 --> 00:18:21.603
Guess Piccolo forgot
he had to hold you, too.

00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:24.273
Eeh. Thanks. I owe ya.

00:18:26.612 --> 00:18:28.550
Hey! I see Dende!

00:18:28.583 --> 00:18:30.788
[screaming]

00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:32.892
Hey!
[chuckles]

00:18:32.925 --> 00:18:34.528
[GOHAN, PICCOLO chuckle]

00:18:37.233 --> 00:18:40.005
That must have been some
quick thinking to get out alive.

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:41.642
I'm so proud of you.

00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:43.378
[MR. SATAN groaning]

00:18:43.412 --> 00:18:46.184
Thanks! But Mr. Popo
deserves the credit for this.

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:47.955
He's the one who saved me!

00:18:47.988 --> 00:18:49.291
When Majin Buu appeared,

00:18:49.324 --> 00:18:51.261
he started turning us
to chocolate.

00:18:51.294 --> 00:18:54.868
Mr. Popo didn't hesitate.
He threw me from the tower!

00:18:58.844 --> 00:19:00.914
Maybe some chocolate!

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.756
Dende, it's essential
you survive!

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:09.231
[DENDE screaming]

00:19:09.264 --> 00:19:11.602
Hm. Good thing he did.
If you were killed,

00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:14.274
the Dragon Balls would
become nothing but stones.

00:19:14.307 --> 00:19:17.346
And we'd never be able
to restore humanity.

00:19:17.379 --> 00:19:19.451
We're all in
Mr. Popo's debt now.

00:19:19.484 --> 00:19:21.321
His clear-thinking
saved the world.

00:19:21.355 --> 00:19:22.691
[GOTEN]
Ha-ha!

00:19:22.724 --> 00:19:23.860
Hey, uh, kid.

00:19:23.894 --> 00:19:26.331
Who is that little bald,
green-headed Martian fella?

00:19:26.364 --> 00:19:28.069
Are you sure he's on our side?

00:19:28.102 --> 00:19:30.206
Martian? Dende is
the Guardian of Earth.

00:19:30.239 --> 00:19:32.778
Show him some respect, you goof!

00:19:32.811 --> 00:19:34.481
That guy? You serious?

00:19:34.515 --> 00:19:36.251
Gohan, I'm glad you're back!

00:19:36.284 --> 00:19:38.790
Hey, I'm glad <i>you're</i> back!

00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:47.073
[GOKU] All right!
It's all coming together!

00:19:47.106 --> 00:19:48.643
Whew!

00:19:48.676 --> 00:19:51.281
Goku. These Dragon Balls--
I can't believe I wasn't

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:54.454
aware of them. So,
how do they work, exactly?

00:19:54.487 --> 00:19:58.930
Hmmm. The real question is,
"what's Majin Buu's next play"?

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:00.432
He's not gonna win,

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:03.439
but he could still cause
an awful lot of trouble!

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:06.579
[MR. SATAN]
No. No! Nooo!

00:20:06.613 --> 00:20:10.987
B-B-Buu gobbled up
my little girl, too?

[BEE]
Hrrrm...

00:20:13.593 --> 00:20:17.901
How could he do that to her?!
She's so young! My girl!

00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:21.609
Come back to daddy!

00:20:21.643 --> 00:20:23.580
Hey, hot shot.
If you're so strong,

00:20:23.613 --> 00:20:25.415
how could you
let this happen to her?

00:20:25.449 --> 00:20:27.955
In fact, what were you doing
when he was attacking?

00:20:27.988 --> 00:20:29.357
I'm sorry, sir.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.261
Don't get so
bent out of shape.

00:20:31.294 --> 00:20:33.031
We're gonna bring her
back to life.

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.167

Huh?

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.637
You're gonna bring her
back to life?

Are you serious? You better
not be joking with me, son!

00:20:37.641 --> 00:20:40.412
I'm not joking around!
I'm serious! I promise!

00:20:40.445 --> 00:20:41.917
I swear, if you're
joking around,

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.119
I'll give you a time-out

00:20:43.152 --> 00:20:45.557

timed-out before!

What? Like, right this minute?

00:20:56.545 --> 00:20:58.850
Yeah, it's strange.
I didn't think he would

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:00.654
try to fight again so soon.

00:21:00.687 --> 00:21:02.156
He's only been hiding an hour--

what kind of advantage
could that give him?

Don't worry. I'm going to
finish him off for good.

Everyone else,
make sure you don't get

00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:17.453
caught in the crossfire!

00:21:25.469 --> 00:21:29.110
[GOHAN] All right, Buu. Let's
see how much you've changed.

00:21:30.045 --> 00:21:32.651
[NARRATOR] Buu has returned
to resume the fight,

Buu says he's come back
to fight Gotenks again!

Careful, boys. Buu must have
something up his sleeve!

[SUPER BUU] Are the little
ones afraid to fight me?
