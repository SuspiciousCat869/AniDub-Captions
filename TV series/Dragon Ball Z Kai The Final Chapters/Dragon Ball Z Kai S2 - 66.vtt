I--I've dreamed it, but I--

00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:25.884
I never thought it would
actually come true!

00:20:25.917 --> 00:20:28.288
[GOKU] Easy now, you're
getting my shirt all wet.

00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:33.298

You're buck naked!
We've got company!

00:21:24.735 --> 00:21:28.676
[NARRATOR] With the earth saved
and the dark days behind them,

life is finally
getting back to normal.

At least as normal as we get.
Even Buu's fitting in!
