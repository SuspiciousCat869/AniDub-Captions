Majin Buu has become
too powerful for me,

it's as simple as that.

You're the only one

[VEGETA]
You've always been like this.

Ever since the day
I first met you,

00:15:52.905 --> 00:15:56.145
when my conquering of frontier
worlds brought me to Earth.

00:15:56.178 --> 00:15:58.349
You were always ready
to meet a challenge,

00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:01.087
even when it was
bigger than you were.

00:16:04.361 --> 00:16:06.699
[VEGETA]
Nice of you to drop by.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.043
Still, I'm a little embarrassed
for you, I have to admit.

00:16:12.076 --> 00:16:14.616
I mean I sincerely hope you
didn't come all this way--

00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:16.853
back from the dead even--
believing you stood

00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:20.025
any chance against us.

00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:39.765
[VEGETA]
I refuse to believe this!

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:45.176
It's not possible for Kakarot's
power level to exceed my own!

00:16:45.209 --> 00:16:47.080
I belong to the upper
echelon of the most

00:16:47.113 --> 00:16:49.919
elite warrior class
the universe has ever seen!

00:16:49.953 --> 00:16:52.724
I will not be bested!
Certainly not by some

00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:54.495
low-born amateur like you!

00:16:54.529 --> 00:16:58.235
I am the greatest
warrior who has ever lived!

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.173
[VEGETA] On that day,
I committed my life

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:05.115
to surpassing you, having no
idea just how far you would go.

00:17:07.353 --> 00:17:08.790
[VEGETA] According to
all the old legends,

00:17:08.824 --> 00:17:11.696
it's been over a thousand years
since one appeared.

00:17:11.729 --> 00:17:14.401
A Super Saiyan. A warrior
who was able to break free

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:16.038
of his normal
limitations to achieve

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:18.075
an unprecedented level of power!

00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:19.812
But those were
just old stories--

00:17:19.845 --> 00:17:21.181
I never actually believed them.

00:17:21.215 --> 00:17:22.784
And even if they are true,

00:17:22.818 --> 00:17:25.223
only an elite warrior like
myself would have the potential

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:26.827
to ascend to those heights.

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.863
Not some fool like Kakarot!

00:17:28.896 --> 00:17:30.567
[VEGETA gasps]

00:17:34.775 --> 00:17:36.980
[VEGETA] There's no question
that Kakarot has surpassed

00:17:37.013 --> 00:17:39.117
the normal limitations
of a Saiyan warrior.

00:17:39.151 --> 00:17:41.823
But how? Some sort
of special training?

00:17:41.856 --> 00:17:44.061
Could the legend really be true?

00:17:44.094 --> 00:17:48.302
Has Kakarot become...
a Super Saiyan?

00:17:50.975 --> 00:17:52.678
Then at last it happened.

00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:56.017
Fueled by my self-loathing,
I too transformed.

00:17:56.051 --> 00:17:57.721
After living every moment
of every day

00:17:57.755 --> 00:18:00.393
for the singular purpose
of reigning over you,

00:18:00.426 --> 00:18:03.298
I finally became
a Super Saiyan myself.

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:05.169
The prince had
reclaimed his throne

00:18:05.203 --> 00:18:07.607
and fulfilled his destiny.

00:18:16.424 --> 00:18:18.730
[VEGETA] But no matter
how strong I became,

00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:21.268
your power still exceeded mine.

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:23.239
At first I thought
it was your loved ones.

00:18:23.272 --> 00:18:24.709
That it was your instinct
to protect them

00:18:24.742 --> 00:18:28.215
that spurred you on, and
pushed you beyond your limits.

00:18:28.249 --> 00:18:30.419
And certainly
that was part of it.

00:18:30.453 --> 00:18:32.223
I've seen enough
of that clown smile

00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:34.260
to know how much
they mean to you.

00:18:34.293 --> 00:18:36.566
But over these years,
I realized there was more.

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:39.605
I made a family of my own,
and still it wasn't the key.

00:18:39.638 --> 00:18:42.778
It's something else in the way
you approach a battle.

00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:44.982
I used to fight for
the sheer pleasure of it,

00:18:45.015 --> 00:18:46.485
sparing no one.

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:50.192
I killed for dominance,
and to feed my insatiable pride.

00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:52.831
But you never fought to kill,
or even to win.

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:54.367
Only to test your limits,

00:18:54.401 --> 00:18:56.840
and become the strongest
you could possibly be.

00:18:56.873 --> 00:19:00.246
You showed mercy to everyone,
even your fiercest enemies--

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:02.918
even me. As if you knew
I would one day

00:19:02.952 --> 00:19:06.157
possess this
tiny sliver of a soul.

00:19:07.493 --> 00:19:09.497
How can a Saiyan
fight with such power,

00:19:09.532 --> 00:19:11.703
and at the same time
be so gentle?

00:19:11.736 --> 00:19:14.374
It makes me angry
just thinking about it.

00:19:14.407 --> 00:19:16.078
But perhaps it's my anger
that's made me

00:19:16.111 --> 00:19:18.583
blind to the truth for so long.

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:22.156
I see it now. I fought
to push down others.

00:19:22.189 --> 00:19:24.662
You only fight to push yourself.
