it's time to wrap this up.

had one more card to play.

Gohan, and Gotenks,

It seemed Vegetto
had dropped his guard.

it was part of a plan.

Take a look

Up to now, every time
Majin Buu's absorbed a warrior,

[ELDER KAI]
I'm not sure. It's just a guess.

Great work! That knocked
Buu's energy down

00:12:06.887 --> 00:12:09.491
quite a few notches.
I can sense it.

00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:14.001
Crazy how much power he was
drawing from our boys.

00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:15.871
In a weird way I feel proud.

00:12:15.905 --> 00:12:19.178
All right. Let's blast a hole
and get out of this filth.

00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:20.981
Yeah.

I'm not sure we're ready.

Even if Buu's gone
back to the way he was

before he absorbed our sons,

00:12:28.062 --> 00:12:29.799
that would still
make him stronger

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:32.403

on our own.

Well, we <i>had</i> a solution before

the rest of your life

why's this Buu cocooned here
with the others?

00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:48.624
How could Majin Buu
absorb himself?

00:13:48.657 --> 00:13:50.927

It's got to
make him weaker, right?

[VEGETA] I saw that
from Otherworld, too.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:29.337
A skinnier Majin Buu
emerged from this fat one.

00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:32.477
He turned the fat Buu
into chocolate and ate him.

00:14:33.847 --> 00:14:37.120

into chocolate!

so much more power.

Of course we are! That's why

If we had gotten outside
and merged again,

we could have won easily,
but now that's not an option!

challenger is no more?
