00:14:56.793 --> 00:14:59.130
Here it goes! Hmm!

00:15:05.711 --> 00:15:07.882
[VEGETA]
It's opening!

00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:11.021
[GOKU]
Ha!

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:18.670
[GOKU]
Aah! All right!

00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:23.245
[SUPER BUU]

00:15:25.283 --> 00:15:27.353
[laughing]

00:15:27.386 --> 00:15:28.723
[GOKU]
Huh?

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.299
[ELDER KAI]
They made it!

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:35.303
Their rescue plan
actually worked!

00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:36.906
They went into
the belly of the beast

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.510
and came out alive!

00:15:38.544 --> 00:15:40.146
[BOTH]
Yeah!

00:15:42.785 --> 00:15:47.126
I can't believe it! Everyone's
all back to normal, look!

00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:52.605
[DENDE]
Amazing!

00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:56.211
[gasps] They've saved the other
fighters Majin Buu absorbed,

00:15:56.244 --> 00:15:59.317
so now he can't leech off
of their powers anymore!

00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:05.296
First let's find somewhere
safe we can hide them.

00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:07.768
I don't think Buu's
noticed we're out yet.

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:09.304
[GOKU]
Right.

00:16:12.545 --> 00:16:20.392
[SUPER BUU screaming]

00:16:20.426 --> 00:16:21.929
[VEGETA]
No...

00:16:21.963 --> 00:16:31.181
[SUPER BUU groaning]

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:40.366
[GOKU]
Are you sensing that, too?

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.736
He should be a lot weaker now,

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.441
but it feels like his energy's
actually increasing.

00:16:44.475 --> 00:16:46.679
How? That can't be!

00:16:46.713 --> 00:16:51.990
[SUPER BUU groaning]

00:16:52.023 --> 00:16:55.897
[screaming]

00:16:55.931 --> 00:17:05.149
[groaning]

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:18.009
[screams]

00:17:18.042 --> 00:17:20.246
Oh dear.

00:17:21.515 --> 00:17:23.218
What's wrong?

00:17:23.252 --> 00:17:25.390
[KIBITO KAI]
No!

00:17:25.423 --> 00:17:30.534
[SUPER BUU]

00:17:30.567 --> 00:17:31.969
Wow, look at him.

00:17:32.003 --> 00:17:35.409
I guess he's going for
muscles with this form.

00:17:35.443 --> 00:17:37.380
No. Wait.

00:17:37.414 --> 00:17:39.819
[screams]

00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:41.021
[BOTH gasp]

00:17:41.054 --> 00:17:46.699
[screaming]

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.739
See? He's not done transforming.

00:17:49.772 --> 00:17:59.257
[screaming, grunting]

00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:01.829
I sure wish
he'd make up his mind.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.781
[KIBITO KAI]
This can't happen. It can't!

00:18:10.814 --> 00:18:13.920
He's... turning back!

00:18:13.954 --> 00:18:17.694
Uh. Turning back
to what exactly?

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:26.712
[panting]

00:18:43.245 --> 00:18:45.918
[VEGETA laughing]

00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:47.655
And to think I was worried.

00:18:47.688 --> 00:18:51.028
Look at him. He's a fraction
of his old self.

00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:53.332
Ha! We really
pulled it off, Vegeta.

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:56.539
We may not need
any fancy tricks after all.

00:19:10.466 --> 00:19:14.508
[MR. SATAN] That's the new Buu?
He looks like nothing but a kid!

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:18.583
Okay! Mr. Satan time!
I can handle this brat!

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:19.885
No, you're wrong!

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:20.988
[MR. SATAN]
Huh?

00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:22.290
Don't be fooled by his size.

00:19:22.323 --> 00:19:23.693
[MR. SATAN]
Oooh...

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:28.603
I-I can't explain it,
but his energy is terrifying.

00:19:56.325 --> 00:20:00.700
Hey. Can you hear me?
Come on, Gohan, wake up.

00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:04.675
Vegeta, I think
they're all right.

00:20:04.709 --> 00:20:07.814
They may be a little weak,
but they're alive.

00:20:13.058 --> 00:20:14.327
[GOKU]
Mmm.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.599
Looks like Buu's on the move.

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:42.150
[chuckles]

00:20:42.183 --> 00:20:51.401
[screaming]

00:20:58.816 --> 00:20:59.719
What is that?

00:20:59.752 --> 00:21:02.123
He's shaking the world
with his scream!

00:21:02.156 --> 00:21:05.797
[screaming]

00:21:09.171 --> 00:21:11.776
[KIBITO KAI]
It's true.

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:13.780
[ELDER KAI] What do you mean
he's turned back?

00:21:13.813 --> 00:21:17.119
Turned into what?
Explain yourself, boy!

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:19.825
[NARRATOR] Goku and Vegeta
have escaped from the prison

00:21:19.858 --> 00:21:23.766
of Buu's body and
saved their captured friends.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.941
But the rescue has caused
a strange new transformation--

00:21:27.974 --> 00:21:32.449
a Majin Buu unlike any
this planet has ever seen.

00:21:32.483 --> 00:21:36.559
The battle for Earth is about
to reach its fever pitch.

00:21:36.592 --> 00:21:39.063
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai.

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:45.643
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:45.295 --> 00:22:46.732
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:49.003
Supreme Kai, we have
to know what's going on!

00:22:49.036 --> 00:22:51.876
Are you saying you've seen
this version of Buu before?

00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:53.847
[KIBITO KAI]
I could never forget that face.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.285
That's the Majin Buu
from centuries ago!

00:22:56.318 --> 00:22:58.723
Before he absorbed
the two Supreme Kais!

00:22:58.756 --> 00:23:01.595
[GOKU]
Next time, on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:05.537 --> 00:23:08.976
[GOHAN] Our whole planet
is gone? Just like that?
