[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:12.826
Piccolo and Krillin safely
evacuated Trunks and Goten,

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:15.063
Earth's last remaining
beacons of hope,

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:17.603
and brought them to the Lookout.

00:00:17.703 --> 00:00:19.739
You felt that, too, huh?

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:22.145
Hey.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:23.848
[NARRATOR]
Upon arriving at the Lookout,

00:00:23.948 --> 00:00:25.685
Goku informed Piccolo
and the others

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:30.194
of a technique that might just
allow them to defeat Majin Buu.

00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:32.364
No, I mean
we could use Fusion.

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.204
Are you serious?
A real Fusion?

00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:37.040
Basically, it's a
combination technique

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.178
where two fighters
in similar size and power

00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:40.749
can merge their bodies together.

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:42.050
Okay, you just lost me.

00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:43.554
Once the two
fighters are combined,

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:45.559
they become
a new person entirely,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.695
and with control over
incredible powers.

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.033
Powers they could never
even dream of possessing

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.604
if they remained separate.

00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:53.073
[KRILLIN] We've got a shot!
Heck, we've got a great chance

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:55.411
with those kids!
They could easily do it!

00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:58.249
We finally have
a reason to be hopeful.

You should be dead!

00:12:02.243 --> 00:12:04.481
[KIBITO] Yes, sir. It's a
mystery to me, as well,

00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:06.385
how I managed to survive.

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:08.556
[gasps]
I almost forgot.

00:12:08.657 --> 00:12:12.798
Hurry, Kibito!
Gohan is in danger!

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:16.305

can we allow Gohan to die!

Get off of my cape,
you ill-mannered wench!

If anyone's ill-mannered,
it's you, creep!

[grunts] You did not
just call me that!

You're paying for

Until you do,
I'm not letting you go!

Miss, it seems you are
woefully ignorant

00:14:50.548 --> 00:14:52.685
as to who exactly I am.

00:14:52.785 --> 00:14:54.054
Got that right.

00:14:54.154 --> 00:14:55.389
You and the rest of
your planet will find out

00:14:55.489 --> 00:14:58.062
soon enough, but I'll
introduce myself anyway.

00:14:58.162 --> 00:15:00.300
You see, whether or not
this miserable world

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.805
that you so pointlessly
inhabit is allowed to continue

00:15:02.905 --> 00:15:04.975
depends entirely on my whim.

For I am the great and
all-powerful Wizard Babidi!

I don't care if you're
a wizard, a lizard,

00:15:10.086 --> 00:15:11.221
or a chicken gizzard.

00:15:11.321 --> 00:15:13.292
You're still gonna
have to pay up, pal.

We have you surrounded.

There's no point
trying to resist.

00:15:34.736 --> 00:15:36.105
Come out with your hands up.

00:15:36.205 --> 00:15:39.077
Majin Buu, is your
appetite not sated yet?

00:15:39.177 --> 00:15:41.717
[muffled] Cake super yummy,
but it no fill Buu up.

00:15:41.817 --> 00:15:43.219
More Buu eat, more Buu want.

00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:44.822

are going to give you a cavity.

00:15:51.234 --> 00:15:53.005
Hm.

[POLICEMEN yell]

Cake. Buu need more cake.

There'll be
time for that later.

00:16:33.252 --> 00:16:35.389
For now, we're about to
make that green fool

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.959
and those two
little runts suffer

00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:39.331
for challenging us
back there in the desert.

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:40.934
[laughs]

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:43.338
Keep watching, folks. Oh, yes.

00:16:43.439 --> 00:16:47.446
You're gonna be seeing a real
spectacle here soon enough!

00:16:49.652 --> 00:16:51.221
Kibito. You sense that?

00:16:51.322 --> 00:16:54.795
It must be the colossal amount
of power Majin Buu is exuding.

00:16:54.895 --> 00:16:56.298
Yes, of course.

00:16:56.398 --> 00:16:59.004
Frankly, it fills me with
an immense feeling of dread.

00:16:59.104 --> 00:17:01.107
If he continues
his rampage of terror,

00:17:01.207 --> 00:17:03.212
gone will be the days
of peace and tranquility

00:17:03.312 --> 00:17:05.550
for all living creatures
in the universe.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.955
The worst-case scenario
that we've long feared

00:17:08.055 --> 00:17:10.159
is finally becoming
a gruesome reality.

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:12.765
It's not necessarily
as hopeless as all that.

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.969
I'm beginning to sense
the smallest ray of light

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.237
off in the distance.

00:17:16.338 --> 00:17:18.510
Huh. I see.
And does your optimism

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.648
have something to do
with Gohan, by chance?

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:23.219
It does. His power
is already far greater

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.289
than we imagined,
and it has the potential

00:17:25.389 --> 00:17:27.728
to transform into something
more extraordinary,

00:17:27.828 --> 00:17:29.732
even surpassing Majin Buu's.

00:17:29.832 --> 00:17:31.368
[KIBITO]
Stronger than Buu?

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:33.406
Surely you can't
be serious, sir.

00:17:33.507 --> 00:17:35.443
[SUPREME KAI] I understand
it's difficult to fathom.

00:17:35.544 --> 00:17:38.382
You didn't see how amazing
those three Saiyans were.

00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:39.685
Huh?

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:41.088
We've gotta find him soon!

00:17:41.188 --> 00:17:43.459
Gohan's energy is growing
weaker by the minute,

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.732
but I can sense it
coming from those woods.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.947
It's emanating from
somewhere close.

00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:56.552
There he is, over there!

00:18:04.301 --> 00:18:06.337
He's holding on. Barely.

00:18:06.438 --> 00:18:09.846
But his condition's as critical
as yours was earlier, sir.

00:18:09.946 --> 00:18:12.517
[sighs]
Then there's hope.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.595
Not yet. Hold off
on restoring Gohan's power

00:18:17.695 --> 00:18:20.567
until after we've arrived
on the World of the Kais.

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:23.405
Sir, you mean--
You honestly intend to allow

00:18:23.506 --> 00:18:27.080
a mere mortal to set foot inside
the hallowed World of the Kais?

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.017
That revered sanctuary
which not even

00:18:29.117 --> 00:18:31.288
the Grand Kai himself
is permitted to enter?

00:18:31.388 --> 00:18:33.025
Yes, that's correct.

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:34.862
Now, let's get going!

00:18:34.962 --> 00:18:35.864
[KIBITO]
Yes, sir!

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:37.768
[SUPREME KAI]
Kai-Kai!

00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:45.517
[KRILLIN] Hey, wait. Bulma,
where's your mom and dad?

00:18:45.617 --> 00:18:47.120
[BULMA] They said
they couldn't bear to leave

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.190
their animals behind,
and then casually pointed out

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.027
that if they are killed,
we could just wish them

00:18:51.128 --> 00:18:52.565
back to life
with the Dragon Balls.

00:18:52.665 --> 00:18:54.668
That sounds like
your parents, all right.

00:18:54.768 --> 00:18:55.938
Well, I suppose.

00:18:56.038 --> 00:18:57.173
It's too bad we don't
have any idea

00:18:57.273 --> 00:18:58.509
where Tien and Chiaotzu are

00:18:58.609 --> 00:19:00.346
or we could've gotten
those guys here, too.

00:19:00.446 --> 00:19:01.949
Oh, forget about them.

00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:03.920
Why aren't
Gohan and Goten here?

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.089
[shrieks]

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.926
And what about Trunks?
And Vegeta?

[shrieks]

00:19:10.868 --> 00:19:13.840
Hey. What's going on?

There's no
easy way to put this,

00:19:34.848 --> 00:19:37.320
so I'll just come right out
and say it, all right?

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.358
[CHICHI, BULMA]
Huh?

00:19:39.458 --> 00:19:42.898
Goten and Trunks are safe
inside the Lookout,

00:19:42.998 --> 00:19:45.571
but Gohan and Vegeta are dead.

00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:48.509
[gasps]

00:19:52.584 --> 00:19:55.757
They were taken
from us by Majin Buu.

00:19:57.093 --> 00:20:00.634
[CHICHI]
Not Gohan.

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:02.003
No! Chichi!

Gohan. He can't
be dead. He can't be!

00:20:09.619 --> 00:20:12.123
Oh, Vegeta.

00:20:12.224 --> 00:20:14.528
[wails]
Oh, why?

00:20:14.629 --> 00:20:16.833

for you. Okay?

I can't accept that.

Goku, this is a fine mess we
find ourselves in, isn't it?

Korin, you're here!

I couldn't just
sit around doing nothing

at a time like this.

is beyond anything

you've ever fought before,

00:20:52.805 --> 00:20:54.641
and that's including
Frieza and Cell.

00:20:54.742 --> 00:20:59.317
We're dealing with pure evil.
Destruction is his only goal.

00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:01.889
It's time.
The Fusion can't wait.

00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:03.158
Yeah, you're right.

00:21:03.259 --> 00:21:04.995
[BABIDI]
Greetings, people of Earth.

00:21:05.095 --> 00:21:08.269
You should all be hearing my
voice now, loud and clear.

00:21:08.369 --> 00:21:10.306
Stop what you're doing,
if you don't mind.

00:21:10.406 --> 00:21:11.910
It's time we had a chat.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.478
[laughs]

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.485
Oh, you can look around all
you want; you won't find me.

00:21:16.586 --> 00:21:20.125
I'm speaking directly into each
and every one of your brains.

00:21:20.226 --> 00:21:22.330
Using the power
of magic, of course.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.467
[NARRATOR]
Babidi is bent on retaliation.

00:21:24.568 --> 00:21:27.807
And it seems he wants the
entire world to bear witness.

00:21:27.908 --> 00:21:30.514
What terror will
he visit upon Earth?

00:21:30.614 --> 00:21:32.684
Goku believes
the only way to stop him

00:21:32.785 --> 00:21:35.489
lies with these two
sleeping boys.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:39.665
His last hope awakens,
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.366 --> 00:21:45.543

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.899
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:48.369
I'd better hurry up
and start teaching

00:22:48.469 --> 00:22:50.105
those boys about Fusion.

00:22:50.205 --> 00:22:51.810
Huh? You hear that voice?

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.445
[BABIDI] People of Earth,
I'm looking for

00:22:53.546 --> 00:22:55.482
a particular pack of pests
who've made things

00:22:55.583 --> 00:22:57.253
rather unpleasant for me.

00:22:57.353 --> 00:22:58.690
And if they refuse
to come forward,

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.627
it will spell big trouble
for the rest of you.

00:23:00.727 --> 00:23:02.964
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:03.064 --> 00:23:06.471
"Find the Nuisances.
Babidi's Retaliation Begins!"

00:23:06.572 --> 00:23:09.477
[GOHAN] Babidi. I'll make
sure you pay for this!
