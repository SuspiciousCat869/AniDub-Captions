your power the right way.

Once I'm finished training you,

00:20:04.274 --> 00:20:05.644
and you've reached
your full potential,

00:20:05.677 --> 00:20:07.480
promise me we can
have an all-out match,

00:20:07.515 --> 00:20:09.251
and you won't hold
anything back, okay?

00:20:09.284 --> 00:20:10.587
Yeah, sure.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.490
In all honesty,
that's the main reason

00:20:12.524 --> 00:20:15.563
I wanted to train
you in the first place!

00:20:15.597 --> 00:20:17.901
It's really exciting.
Right, Uub?

00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:20.406
Meeting somebody who can
give you a good fight?

00:20:20.439 --> 00:20:23.411
--Yes, sir!
--I can barely wait!

00:20:28.188 --> 00:20:35.369
["Cha-La Head Cha-La" plays]

00:20:59.117 --> 00:21:02.624
Okay! Now let's get
even stronger!

00:21:02.658 --> 00:21:04.094
Yes, sir!

00:21:04.127 --> 00:21:05.630
Lose the "sir," it's too stiff.

00:21:05.663 --> 00:21:07.935
We're having fun,
just say "yeah!"

00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:09.103
Yeah!

00:21:09.136 --> 00:21:10.205
One more time.

00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:13.012
Now let's go
and get even stronger!

00:21:13.045 --> 00:21:14.715
Yeah!

00:21:14.748 --> 00:21:16.886
[GOKU]
Mmm?

00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:18.088
[BOTH laughing]

00:21:18.121 --> 00:21:19.558
[NARRATOR]
Time and time again,

00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:22.296
Goku has pushed
himself to the known limits

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.334
of power and beyond,

00:21:24.368 --> 00:21:26.839
protecting the earth
and the universe.

00:21:26.873 --> 00:21:31.047
Now he sets off again on one
search that will never end.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.624
The pursuit of ultimate
strength. Farewell, Goku!

00:21:35.657 --> 00:21:40.365
We'll be looking to the skies,
waiting for your return!

00:21:40.767 --> 00:21:45.743
