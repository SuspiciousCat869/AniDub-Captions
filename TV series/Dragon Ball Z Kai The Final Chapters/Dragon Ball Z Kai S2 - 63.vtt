[chuckles]
Oh. Thank goodness!

00:11:27.742 --> 00:11:30.714
That's using your head, Buu!
Now hang in there!

00:11:30.748 --> 00:11:34.555
And let the other guy
really have it! Yeah!

00:11:34.588 --> 00:11:38.095
What Buu do?
Buu no can win this.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:42.672
Well, it looks as though
this has just turned into

00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:45.042
the worst-case scenario.

Why-- You idiot!

00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:32.738
Not only have you
failed miserably

00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:34.776
at increasing your energy level,

00:12:34.809 --> 00:12:37.514
but now you've turned back
to normal, too?

00:12:38.751 --> 00:12:40.888
I'm sorry I let you down.

00:12:40.921 --> 00:12:42.725
Ugh! Damn it all!

00:12:42.758 --> 00:12:44.763
This thing was a total
piece of cake for me

00:12:44.796 --> 00:12:46.466
back when I was dead.

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:48.035

...maintaining Super Saiyan 3
in a living body

00:12:50.172 --> 00:12:51.843
burns through energy
a lot faster

00:12:51.876 --> 00:12:53.647
than when you're just a spirit.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.555
Hm! I'm tapped out.
So much for that plan.

Hey, Supreme Kais and Dende!
Do you hear me?

I know you're watching
everything that's happening

00:14:29.104 --> 00:14:31.341

Yeah. We hear ya loud and clear.

00:14:39.457 --> 00:14:42.130
That's good! Now go
to the restored Planet Namek

00:14:42.163 --> 00:14:44.401
and gather together
all their Dragon Balls!

00:14:44.434 --> 00:14:46.238
And be quick about it!

are you planning to--

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.364
[DENDE] He wouldn't ask
if there were another way.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.870
Please, Supreme Kai,
take me there.

[ELDER KAI grunts]

00:15:02.938 --> 00:15:05.209
Yeah, but...
I hate those things.

00:15:05.243 --> 00:15:07.715
This is no time to get picky
about which tools we use

00:15:07.748 --> 00:15:08.950
to save the universe!

00:15:08.983 --> 00:15:10.855
What's the point of
maintaining natural laws

00:15:10.888 --> 00:15:12.156
if there's nothing left?

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:16.232
All right. Fine,
cool your jets! Ugh!

All aboard for Planet Namek.

00:15:24.849 --> 00:15:27.922
Nice. It sounds like
they're on their way.

00:15:27.955 --> 00:15:30.594
Hey. Vegeta, what are you up to?

00:15:31.996 --> 00:15:34.201
I know what you're thinking,
but Buu could just

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:36.906
wipe out everyone
all over again.

00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:38.442
Look, Kakarot--

00:15:38.476 --> 00:15:41.381
Tell me, how many times have you
saved the earth, do you think?

00:15:41.415 --> 00:15:44.388
Huh? Uh, why are you
asking me that?

00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:47.127
[VEGETA] Just answer me!
How many times?

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.202
Uh. Well, I'm not sure,
but I guess a lot.

00:15:51.235 --> 00:15:53.305
[VEGETA] So then, why don't you
let the people of Earth

00:15:53.338 --> 00:15:55.945
shoulder the burden for once?

00:15:55.978 --> 00:15:57.581
[GOKU gasps]

00:16:12.912 --> 00:16:15.116
So this is Planet Namek?

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:18.389
Uh. Yeah, I guess.
At least it should be.

00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:22.631
Oh, it's Planet Namek!
There's no doubt about it!

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.203
And what's more, it's how--

00:16:25.236 --> 00:16:27.240
[ELDER MOORI]
Are you surprised, Dende,

00:16:27.274 --> 00:16:32.116
to see our world restored back
to the way it originally was?

00:16:32.149 --> 00:16:34.020

[DENDE]
You're all here!

00:16:40.868 --> 00:16:43.438
It's been too long!
Oh, Elder Moori.

00:16:43.472 --> 00:16:45.276
I'm glad to see you
looking so well!

00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:47.515
You appear to be
doing well yourself, Dende.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:50.520
You're looking quite
Kami-like if I may say so.

00:16:50.554 --> 00:16:52.224
Oh. You're too kind!

00:16:52.257 --> 00:16:54.094
I'm still so inexperienced.

00:16:54.127 --> 00:16:55.764
And there's so much left
for me to learn

00:16:55.798 --> 00:16:57.835
before I could ever
live up to that!

00:16:57.868 --> 00:16:59.037
[ELDER KAI]
Ahem!

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.841
Sorry to break up
this touching reunion,

00:17:00.874 --> 00:17:02.043
but can't it wait till after

00:17:02.077 --> 00:17:03.947
we save the universe
from destruction?

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:05.884
Yes. Course, you're right.

00:17:05.917 --> 00:17:08.524
Elder! I have a favor
to ask of you.

00:17:08.557 --> 00:17:09.659
I'm afraid it's urgent.

00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:12.097
Please, could you gather
the Dragon Balls?

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.667
We're in desperate need
of Porunga's help

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.004
and the fate of
the universe is at stake!

00:17:16.037 --> 00:17:19.043
Dragon Balls you say? Really?

00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:22.584
[ELDER MOORI sighs]

00:17:22.618 --> 00:17:25.356

to the Dragon Balls?

--[ELDER MOORI grunts]

[DENDE laughs]

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:48.335
No need to worry, Elder Kai.

00:17:48.368 --> 00:17:50.372
We've been monitoring
the situation.

00:17:50.406 --> 00:17:52.477
Now, without further ado.

00:17:52.511 --> 00:17:55.918
Huh? You've already
collected them all?

00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.322
Thank you! You're the best!

00:17:59.925 --> 00:18:02.798
[DENDE] Vegeta,
can you hear me? Vegeta!

00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:06.171
We have all seven of
the Namekian Dragon Balls!

00:18:06.204 --> 00:18:09.745
I repeat, we have
the Dragon Balls!

00:18:09.778 --> 00:18:11.381
[VEGETA]
Well, that was fast.

00:18:11.415 --> 00:18:13.620
All right, now I'm going
to need you to go ahead

00:18:13.653 --> 00:18:16.124
and summon Porunga for me!
You got that?

00:18:16.157 --> 00:18:17.327
[GOKU]
Huh?

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.330
There are two wishes
I want him to grant.

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:21.770
First, I want Earth restored
back to the way it was

00:18:21.803 --> 00:18:24.074
before Buu destroyed it.

00:18:24.107 --> 00:18:25.944
And second, I want
everyone who's been killed,

00:18:25.977 --> 00:18:28.282
starting from the day of the
World Martial Arts Tournament

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:30.286
on, to be brought back to life.

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:33.259
You know, except for any
really bad people, obviously.

00:18:33.292 --> 00:18:34.628
Think you can do that?

00:18:34.662 --> 00:18:38.904
Uh. So, you want those
wishes now? You're sure?

00:18:38.937 --> 00:18:41.107
[VEGETA]
Yes! Do it now!

00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:43.011
[DENDE]
But, if we do, then...

00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:44.915
--[VEGETA grunts]
--Dende, it's okay.

00:18:44.948 --> 00:18:46.218
I don't know what it is exactly,

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:47.921
but Vegeta's got
some kind of plan,

00:18:47.954 --> 00:18:49.625
so go ahead and do what he says.

00:18:49.659 --> 00:18:52.765
[DENDE] All right, I will.
But what about the third wish?

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.535
What should we ask for?

00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.305
I only care about the first two.

00:18:56.338 --> 00:18:58.009
Do with the third what you want.

00:18:58.042 --> 00:18:59.545
[GOKU] Hey Vegeta,
for that second wish,

00:18:59.579 --> 00:19:00.981
wouldn't it be
a whole lot simpler

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:02.985
if you just asked to have
everybody who's been killed

00:19:03.018 --> 00:19:04.454
by Buu brought back to life?

00:19:04.488 --> 00:19:06.560
I mean, why make it
so confusing?

00:19:06.593 --> 00:19:09.598
Hm! You fool!
If we phrase it like that,

00:19:09.632 --> 00:19:11.268
the Dragon would be
forced to revive

00:19:11.301 --> 00:19:13.574
bastards like
Babidi and Dabura, too!

00:19:13.607 --> 00:19:15.175
And besides, it would
fail to bring back

00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:17.514
all of those innocent
spectators that I myself

00:19:17.547 --> 00:19:19.585
slaughtered during
the tournament.

00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:22.892
Wow. You've really thought
this whole thing through now,

00:19:22.925 --> 00:19:24.093
haven't you?

00:19:24.127 --> 00:19:26.331
Ah! Aaaah!

00:19:26.364 --> 00:19:27.968
No, I just realized something!

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:29.872
It-It won't work!

00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:33.713
Porunga is only able to
resurrect one person at a time!

00:19:33.746 --> 00:19:35.517
No, that can't be!

00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:38.757
Oh, no! Now that you mention it,
I think that's true!

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.459
[VEGETA grunts]
