the Namekians to make them

00:22:51.441 --> 00:22:53.579
Now it's in danger
of being blown up, too!

00:22:53.613 --> 00:22:56.218
[VEGETA] Kakarot! Raise your
energy along with mine!

00:22:56.251 --> 00:22:58.489
That should lure Buu

00:22:58.523 --> 00:23:01.060
[GOKU]
Next time, on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.041

want to take on Majin Buu

00:23:08.074 --> 00:23:09.778
without fusing?
