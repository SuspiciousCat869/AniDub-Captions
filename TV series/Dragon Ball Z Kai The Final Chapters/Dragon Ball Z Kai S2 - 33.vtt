00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:13.292
I may be coming to your town
next, and it won't be to chat!

00:10:13.392 --> 00:10:15.898
And don't bother running off
or hiding under some rock.

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:17.902
I can promise you
it won't do any good.

00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:20.139
Like I said, I'll destroy
every single one of you

00:10:20.239 --> 00:10:22.945
in the next five days
if I don't get what I want.

00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:25.383
So you better talk to me soon!

00:10:25.484 --> 00:10:27.153
[BUU]
Hm-hmmm!

00:10:28.022 --> 00:10:30.794
He'll pay! I'll make him pay!

00:10:30.894 --> 00:10:32.297
How could anyone do that?

00:10:32.397 --> 00:10:34.802
This is giving me
quite a terrible headache.

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:37.107
So, that wizard
and his monster,

00:10:37.207 --> 00:10:39.713
they're the ones who
killed Vegeta and Gohan?

00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:43.787
Yeah. Those two don't care
how many people they hurt.

00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:45.423
With those powers
Majin Buu had on display,

00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:48.229
maybe five days is all the time
they would need to do it.

00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:49.899
There's no reason
to let all those people

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:52.738
become victims.
I'll step forward.

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:54.408
What are you
talking about Piccolo,

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:55.711
you're smarter than that!

00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:57.113
[PICCOLO growls]

00:10:57.213 --> 00:10:58.817
[GOKU] If you die, there won't
be anyone to teach

00:10:58.917 --> 00:11:02.224
Goten and Trunks Fusion when
it's time for me to leave.

00:11:02.324 --> 00:11:03.527
[PICCOLO grunts]

00:11:03.627 --> 00:11:04.762
And if they don't learn Fusion,

00:11:04.862 --> 00:11:07.267
how can we possibly
hope to stop Buu?

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:09.137
Babidi is not gonna
quit until everyone

00:11:09.237 --> 00:11:13.012
on this planet is dead.
You know that's true.

00:11:14.414 --> 00:11:16.351
A lot of innocent people
down there are going to

00:11:16.451 --> 00:11:19.191
fall victim to Majin Buu
before Goten and Trunks

00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:20.426
are ready to face him.

00:11:20.527 --> 00:11:22.063
And you're the one who told us
we'd have to suffer

00:11:22.163 --> 00:11:24.835
through all that, aren't you?

00:11:26.271 --> 00:11:27.407
[PICCOLO growls]

00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:29.745
But every life they take
and every city they destroy

00:11:29.845 --> 00:11:32.050
can be wished back to normal
with the Dragon Balls.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.987
Okay? We'll bring them back.

00:11:34.087 --> 00:11:35.725
It's hard to face
but he's right.

00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:39.197
It's true. This is
a time to be patient.

00:11:39.297 --> 00:11:42.505
[PICCOLO grunts]

00:11:42.605 --> 00:11:45.109
So be it.

00:12:03.513 --> 00:12:06.485
[TRUNKS groans]

00:12:06.586 --> 00:12:11.261
Uh! Hey. Where the heck am I?

00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:12.899
Huh.

00:12:12.999 --> 00:12:15.837
Doesn't look familiar.

00:12:17.007 --> 00:12:20.614
I have no idea where
this is or how we got here.

00:12:20.714 --> 00:12:24.822
Hey! Goten! Wake up!
Help me figure this out!

00:12:24.922 --> 00:12:26.626
[GOTEN]
Mmm.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.002
Jeez! What if we're
on some enemy spaceship?

00:12:31.102 --> 00:12:33.039
Oh, I know. Hey Goten!

00:12:33.139 --> 00:12:35.678
Wake up, there's breakfast.

00:12:35.778 --> 00:12:37.715
Huh? What? Breakfast?

00:12:37.815 --> 00:12:38.917
Where? Where?

00:12:39.017 --> 00:12:40.955
I want breakfast!
Give it to me!

00:12:41.055 --> 00:12:43.961
Wow. You really do think
with your stomach, don't you?

00:12:44.061 --> 00:12:46.733
Oh! Why are you
down here? Where are we?

00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:49.304
Ugh! I've never been here.
How should I know?

00:12:49.405 --> 00:12:52.477
[GOTEN] Guess you shouldn't!
I've never been here either!

00:12:52.578 --> 00:12:54.883
Whoa! Those look expensive!

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.218
Who cares about some plates?

00:12:56.319 --> 00:12:59.257
We gotta figure out
where we are.

00:13:00.827 --> 00:13:02.765
[gasps]
Goten, where's my dad?

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.170
Oh yeah.
Didn't he knock us out?

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.405
He did?

00:13:06.507 --> 00:13:08.242
[GOTEN]
Mhmm.

00:13:10.814 --> 00:13:13.386
Take care, Trunks. All right.

00:13:13.486 --> 00:13:14.956
[TRUNKS]
Huh?

00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:16.458
No, what'd you do to him?

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:19.064
Why? Why would you ever
hit your son like that?

00:13:19.164 --> 00:13:21.035
He was just trying to help!

00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:23.973
[groans]

00:13:26.311 --> 00:13:30.119
What happened after that?
You see anything?

00:13:30.219 --> 00:13:34.962
Come on. First off, we gotta
find out where we are.

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:56.873
[door creaks]

00:13:57.808 --> 00:14:00.446
What kinda place is this?

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.429
Seems kinda empty,
doesn't it?

00:14:09.398 --> 00:14:13.338
Honestly.
Where'd those boys go now?

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:27.868
All right, Kibito.

00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:30.206
Your restorative power
should heal him nicely.

00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:32.009
[KIBITO grunts]

00:14:46.773 --> 00:14:48.743
[gasps]

00:14:48.843 --> 00:14:51.582
Hey. Where am I?

00:14:52.852 --> 00:14:54.087
[SUPREME KAI chuckles]

00:14:54.187 --> 00:14:57.695
Hey, Supreme Kai.

00:14:57.795 --> 00:14:59.497
So, where on Earth are we?

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:00.901
We're not on Earth at all.

00:15:01.001 --> 00:15:02.972
This is my home,
the World of the Kais.

00:15:03.072 --> 00:15:05.476
It's your world? Really?

00:15:05.577 --> 00:15:07.380
Wow. That's crazy.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.288
I guess that means I did
die in that battle, huh?

00:15:11.388 --> 00:15:14.695
Mm? But shouldn't I have
a halo, just like my dad?

00:15:14.795 --> 00:15:16.364
No. You didn't die.

00:15:16.464 --> 00:15:19.538
It was a close call but
you managed to pull through.

00:15:19.638 --> 00:15:22.444
But then what am I doing
in a crazy place like this?

00:15:22.545 --> 00:15:24.615
You don't refer
to the World of the Kais

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:25.984
as "a crazy place."

00:15:26.084 --> 00:15:28.156
This is a sanctuary,
that neither lower Kais

00:15:28.256 --> 00:15:30.093
nor Guardians
could ever hope to enter,

00:15:30.193 --> 00:15:33.199
much less a mortal like you.

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:36.071
Hey, wait a minute,
you're supposed to be dead.

00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:37.775
Can you come back
whenever you want?

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:40.781
No. No, I can't.
It's a mystery.

00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:42.985
But something has
brought me back to life.

00:15:43.085 --> 00:15:45.056
There are powers
at work on your planet.

00:15:45.156 --> 00:15:47.094
Far beyond what we realized.

00:15:47.194 --> 00:15:49.164
[GOHAN] Seems like
I slept through a lot.

00:15:49.264 --> 00:15:51.603
So why am I in this--
uh-- sanctuary?

00:15:51.703 --> 00:15:54.074
[KIBITO] I've been wanting
to ask the same thing.

00:15:54.174 --> 00:15:55.409
Why, Supreme Kai?

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.585
Why bring a mere mortal
to these sacred grounds?

00:15:59.685 --> 00:16:03.994
We'll use the Z Sword
to strike down Majin Buu.

00:16:04.094 --> 00:16:06.131
I'm certain Gohan
has the spirit required

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:07.668
to wield its great power.

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:10.339
[gasps]
Not the Z Sword?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.513
But, are you sure you're in
your right mind, Supreme Kai?

00:16:13.613 --> 00:16:15.784
There's no way that a
mortal could lift the Z Sword,

00:16:15.884 --> 00:16:17.120
let alone use it!

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.823
Despite all my efforts
I've never been able

00:16:18.924 --> 00:16:20.994
to make that
legendary weapon budge,

00:16:21.094 --> 00:16:22.865
no more than any of
the other Supreme Kais

00:16:22.965 --> 00:16:24.334
who tried their hand before me!

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:28.175
You were dead, Kibito,
so you didn't get to see him.

00:16:28.275 --> 00:16:30.079
Gohan possesses
a tremendous power

00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:31.882
I never would have
expected either.

00:16:31.983 --> 00:16:33.285
But you need
more than brute strength

00:16:33.385 --> 00:16:34.822
to wield the Z Sword, sir!

00:16:34.922 --> 00:16:37.226
In any event, there's no harm
in letting him try it.

00:16:37.326 --> 00:16:41.468
Please come with me, Gohan.
We'll put you to the test.

00:16:47.447 --> 00:16:50.019
A mortal laying
his hands on the Z Sword?

00:16:50.119 --> 00:16:52.223
What is he thinking?

00:16:54.662 --> 00:16:57.000
[GOTEN] This is some
yummy food, isn't it, Trunks?

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.071
We still haven't
figured out where we are.

00:16:59.171 --> 00:17:00.641
Where do you think
your dad, and Piccolo,

00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:02.143
and everybody else is?

00:17:02.243 --> 00:17:03.980
Beats me. But you know
you're not supposed

00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:06.118
to talk with
your mouth full, right?

00:17:06.218 --> 00:17:08.355
You got some pretty
awful manners, Goten.

00:17:08.455 --> 00:17:11.663
You should be quiet.
That's what my dad says.

00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:13.667
Sorry, Trunks, I forgot.

00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:14.969
It's okay, just work on it.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.939
[MR. POPO]
Ah-ha! There you are!

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.277
I see you have
a healthy appetite.

00:17:19.378 --> 00:17:20.814
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:22.284
We just found this food, okay!

00:17:22.384 --> 00:17:24.221
I'm sorry we ate without asking
but what's the big deal?

00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:27.561
You got plenty to spare,
you stingy weirdo!

00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:31.970
Man! Let go of me, would ya?

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.405
Goten, put that spoon down!

00:17:33.506 --> 00:17:35.410
I'm being held by a
pointy-eared stranger over here!

00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:37.981
Now now, Trunks.
You know it's bad manners

00:17:38.082 --> 00:17:40.453
to raise your voice
at the table.

00:17:40.554 --> 00:17:41.656
You!

00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:42.992
[GOTEN] But you're the one
who said we're supposed

00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:44.360
to be quiet when we eat.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.666
I'm trying to work on
my manners, remember?

00:17:46.766 --> 00:17:48.269
I should've known
I couldn't rely on you

00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:51.074
for help when there's food!

00:17:52.177 --> 00:17:53.947
Incredible power!
He's even stronger

00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:55.283
than Goku when he was a boy!

00:17:55.383 --> 00:17:57.153
Goten, let's get out of here!

00:17:57.254 --> 00:17:58.556
[GOTEN]
Yeah!

00:17:58.656 --> 00:17:59.926
[MR. POPO]
Wait!

00:18:00.026 --> 00:18:02.230
Okay, let him have it.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.402
[MR. POPO hollers]

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:09.477
Now's your chance,
Goten! Run!

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:11.214
[GOTEN]
Okay!

00:18:11.582 --> 00:18:13.218
[TRUNKS]
Huh?

00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:22.070
--[GOTEN yells]
--[MR. POPO hollers]

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.406
Nice work. Got him!

00:18:23.507 --> 00:18:26.144
[GOKU] All right boys,
that's enough.

00:18:27.915 --> 00:18:29.150
It's my dad!

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.253
He's here?

00:18:30.353 --> 00:18:31.556
[MR. POPO]
I'm impressed, Goku!

00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:33.893
These two have
quite the fighting spirit!

00:18:33.993 --> 00:18:35.162
Yeah! And they're
gonna have to

00:18:35.262 --> 00:18:36.799
put it to good use really quick!

00:18:36.899 --> 00:18:39.572
Teaching them Fusion
really could be the answer.

00:18:39.672 --> 00:18:41.474
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:18:43.546 --> 00:18:45.584
The landscape here
really is beautiful.

00:18:45.684 --> 00:18:47.119
It reminds me a lot
of the countryside

[KIBITO]
Mmm.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.234
Those tattered rags
you call clothing

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:56.606
are an insult
to this sacred place.

00:18:56.706 --> 00:18:58.308
[gasps]

You look good
dressed as a Kai, Gohan.

00:19:09.097 --> 00:19:10.667
[GOHAN]
Huh?

00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:12.738
You really think so?

00:19:14.207 --> 00:19:17.246
Up ahead, Gohan.
That's its home.

[SUPREME KAI] This is the
Z Sword, the weapon of legend.

See if you can
draw it from the rock.

00:19:38.623 --> 00:19:40.861
If what I'm told is true,
no one has been able

00:19:40.961 --> 00:19:43.966
to do so in all of its history.

00:19:44.066 --> 00:19:46.640
[GOHAN]
A sword in stone, huh?

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.277
Heh. Funny, there's also
an old story about

00:19:49.377 --> 00:19:52.551
something like this on my world.

00:19:56.357 --> 00:19:59.932
[TRUNKS] No! That can't
be true! My dad isn't dead!

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.505
You're lying! You're lying!

[wails] No one
can kill my brother! No!

Stop crying! Right now
there's no time to be sad!

00:20:09.484 --> 00:20:11.055
The only way
to honor their sacrifice

00:20:11.155 --> 00:20:13.392
is to learn this technique
and avenge them.

00:20:13.492 --> 00:20:15.296
You understand me?

[TRUNKS, GOTEN sniffle]

00:20:19.403 --> 00:20:21.408
[GOKU] I know it seems harsh,
but Babidi could

00:20:21.509 --> 00:20:23.078
find out about this place
any moment.

00:20:23.178 --> 00:20:25.784
Your training has to start now.

00:20:25.884 --> 00:20:28.288
Aren't we gonna use
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber?

00:20:28.388 --> 00:20:30.527
No. No one can use
the chamber for more than

00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:32.363
two days in their life, right?

00:20:32.463 --> 00:20:33.733
There could be a time
down the road

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:35.771
when they'll
need to use it more.

But they'll be okay.

These boys can soak
things up like a sponge,

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:43.085
and they should be able to learn
Fusion faster than you think.

00:20:43.185 --> 00:20:44.789
Now, let's get started.

00:20:44.889 --> 00:20:47.060
[BOTH sniffle]

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.966
I'll need you to learn
this technique, too, Piccolo.

[PICCOLO]
Mmm.

00:20:54.708 --> 00:20:59.518
All right, boys.
Good luck. It's up to you now.

00:21:00.185 --> 00:21:01.288
What did I say?

00:21:01.388 --> 00:21:03.693
You need to stop crying
and be strong.

00:21:03.793 --> 00:21:07.834
The world is depending on you
to defeat Majin Buu!

00:21:12.944 --> 00:21:14.948
[NARRATOR] Trunks and Goten
will attempt to learn

00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:18.790
the powerful Fusion technique,
while unbeknownst to them,

Gohan is alive and well
on the World of the Kais,

and is about to begin
a trial of his own.

00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:27.608
Supreme Kai believes
the legendary Z Sword

00:21:27.708 --> 00:21:30.480
could be the answer
for stopping Majin Buu.

00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:33.185
But only time will tell
if either strategy

00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:37.627
can save the world--

Hey! It's me, Goku!

Sure is a relief that Gohan
made it out in one piece,

but I've got my hands full
training the boys!

00:22:51.943 --> 00:22:53.713
[SUPREME KAI] Gohan,
you need to use the sword

00:22:53.813 --> 00:22:55.383
from the World of the Kais!

00:22:55.483 --> 00:22:57.688
You can save the

I just hope I don't accidentally
cut myself with it.
