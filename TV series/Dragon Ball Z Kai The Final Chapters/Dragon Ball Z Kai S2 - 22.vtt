00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.184
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:11.557
the title match of the World
Martial Arts Tournament

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:15.330
kicked off between a coolly
unstoppable Number 18

00:00:15.364 --> 00:00:17.569
and a terrified Mr. Satan.

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:20.006
Things looked grim
for the defending champ

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.877
when out of the blue,
his opponent offered to

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:25.785
let him keep his crown in
exchange for a sizeable payoff.

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:29.024
Relieved to be spared of
the humiliation of defeat,

00:00:29.058 --> 00:00:31.196
Mr. Satan accepted,
and the tournament

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.567
drew to a crowd-pleasing close.

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.872
Meanwhile, a heated
battle is underway

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:37.709
on the third stage
of Babidi's ship,

00:00:37.742 --> 00:00:40.916
where the Demon King Dabura
stands between our heroes

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.253
and their quest
to prevent the evil wizard

00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:45.558
from reviving Majin Buu.

00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:48.196
Like his father,
and Vegeta before him,

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.404
Gohan has opted to fight alone--
but even at his full power,

00:00:52.437 --> 00:00:54.475
the young Saiyan
is finding victory

00:00:54.509 --> 00:01:00.054
far more difficult to secure.
Has Gohan met his match?

00:01:00.087 --> 00:01:02.391
[GOHAN]
Oh no. Aaah!

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:05.798
[DABURA]
There you are!

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.401
[GOHAN yells]

00:01:08.236 --> 00:01:11.743
Is that really the best
you can do all powered-up?

00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:15.084
[GOHAN]
Don't you worry!

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:17.188
I may have let my guard
down for a minute,

00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:20.995
but it's not happening
again. Trust me.

00:01:21.028 --> 00:01:22.732
[DABURA]
Mmm.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:28.376
♪ Opening Song ♪

00:02:59.057 --> 00:03:00.227
[GOKU] I've got to
hand it to him;

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.164
Dabura's a lot stronger
than we thought.

00:03:02.197 --> 00:03:05.404
Ha! Maybe so
but not invincible.

00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:06.907
Your boy's a disgrace.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.947
Look at him; he fought better
when he was a toddler!

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.883
Get with it, Gohan! Ugh.

00:03:11.917 --> 00:03:14.823
Bet you'll be hittin'
the gym after this, huh?

00:03:14.857 --> 00:03:17.461
Tch. If he survives.

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:23.206
C'mon, vary it up more.

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.444
His pattern's getting
way too obvious.

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:27.481
He's telegraphing all his moves.

00:03:27.515 --> 00:03:30.387
[VEGETA] Augh!
Pathetic. Just look at him.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.326
Like he's never fought
a day in his life.

00:03:47.088 --> 00:03:49.424
[chuckles]

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.667
Oh yeah?

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:57.642
[GOHAN]
You got it!

00:03:57.675 --> 00:04:00.614
Look out! Don't let
his spit touch your skin!

00:04:04.322 --> 00:04:06.292
[GOHAN]
Nice try!

00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:12.204
Heh.

00:04:12.237 --> 00:04:16.346
Whoa. That was
a pretty close shave.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:19.251
[BABIDI] Confound it, Dabura!
What are you playing at?

00:04:19.284 --> 00:04:21.422
Stop fooling around
and end it!

00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:23.594
Inflict some damage!

00:04:23.628 --> 00:04:28.837
Yes, serve them all up on a
silver platter to Majin Buu!

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:35.751
[GOHAN yells]
[DABURA groans]

00:04:35.784 --> 00:04:38.422
[GOHAN bellows]

00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:41.830
[DABURA]
Goodbye!

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.065
Aah!

00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:50.480
[DABURA chuckles]

00:04:52.752 --> 00:04:55.758
Now that's what
I'm talking about!

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:01.269
[chuckles]

00:05:01.302 --> 00:05:02.805
[grunts]

00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:07.448
[VEGETA grunts]

00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:10.721
This is utterly ridiculous.

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:13.961
[yells]

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.730
[yells]

00:05:31.763 --> 00:05:33.700
[yells]

00:05:44.354 --> 00:05:50.968
[DABURA grunts]

00:06:01.088 --> 00:06:04.862
[DABURA grunts]

00:06:11.208 --> 00:06:15.316
[GOHAN yells]

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.454
[DABURA]
What?

00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:32.418
[VEGETA grunts]

00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:34.756
How long am I expected
to watch this?

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.962
All right, it's time I put
an end to this mockery!

00:06:37.996 --> 00:06:39.431
Now hold on just a second.

00:06:39.464 --> 00:06:41.603
It's not like Gohan's
already lost or anything,

00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:43.373
so that means
it's still his turn!

00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:46.078
I don't care!
I'm not here for this!

00:06:46.112 --> 00:06:47.447
[DABURA]
Hmmm.

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.519
[VEGETA] That's right; these
fools don't interest me.

00:06:49.552 --> 00:06:51.956
You're what I'm
in this for, Kakarot!

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.565
You think I signed up for the
tournament to win a prize?

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:57.869
This nonsense has
dragged on long enough!

00:06:57.902 --> 00:07:00.473
Like it or not,
Gohan's had his chance!

00:07:00.508 --> 00:07:02.010
[chuckles]

00:07:02.043 --> 00:07:03.714
[GOHAN gasps]

00:07:03.747 --> 00:07:05.951
[DABURA] Master, please;
you must return us

00:07:05.985 --> 00:07:10.528
to the ship at once.
I've learned something useful.

00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:11.997
And that would be what?

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.869
Something to make
him revive faster.

00:07:14.903 --> 00:07:18.376
Is that so? You're
absolutely certain of it?

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.679
[DABURA]
Almost.

00:07:19.712 --> 00:07:21.249
[BABIDI]
Eh. Good enough.

00:07:21.282 --> 00:07:24.454
--[DABURA] Sir.
--[BABIDI] Papparapapa!

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.027
[DABURA chuckles]

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.062
[GOHAN]
Aah!

00:07:28.095 --> 00:07:29.231
[VEGETA]
What? Where are we--

00:07:29.264 --> 00:07:31.636
[GOKU]
Whoa. We're back on the ship.

00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:35.110
[GOHAN]
Hey! Where are you going?

00:07:35.143 --> 00:07:36.245
[DABURA chuckles]

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:38.951
Oh, don't worry.
You're not done yet.

00:07:38.984 --> 00:07:41.355
There's simply no need
for me to fight.

00:07:41.388 --> 00:07:44.562
Not when there's
a far better contender.

00:07:44.595 --> 00:07:46.834
[VEGETA huffs]

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:49.004
[laughs]

00:07:49.037 --> 00:07:50.808
Wait! Hold on!

00:07:50.842 --> 00:07:52.344
[SUPREME KAI]
I don't believe it!

00:07:52.377 --> 00:07:54.381
Dabura, king of the Demon World,

00:07:54.414 --> 00:07:56.886
walking away from a challenge.

00:08:00.628 --> 00:08:02.264
[SUPREME KAI]
And what does he mean,

00:08:02.297 --> 00:08:04.769
"there's a
far better contender"?

00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:09.779
So, then. This news.

00:08:09.813 --> 00:08:13.687
I trust it's worth
halting things for?

00:08:13.721 --> 00:08:14.856
Yes.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.127
[BABIDI] And I trust you
weren't simply grasping for

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.498
a convenient excuse
to get out of being

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:21.971
pummeled by our guests.

00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:23.974
Hmph! Fear not, Master.

00:08:24.008 --> 00:08:28.049
The boy was nowhere near
getting the drop on me.

00:08:28.082 --> 00:08:29.719
Yes, never mind.

00:08:29.752 --> 00:08:33.594
Now, tell me this "useful" news
you had me pull you back for.

00:08:33.627 --> 00:08:35.597
You'll be pleased to know
that one of the three

00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:37.868
has a heart pumping
with pure evil.

00:08:37.902 --> 00:08:39.772
Evil enough, in fact,
that turning him over

00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:41.843
to our side
should be child's play.

00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:44.816
Delicious! We wouldn't even
have to bother about them;

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.056
just set him on his former
friends and relax.

00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:49.559
Then in no time--

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:51.730
Majin Buu will walk among us.

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:53.433
[BABIDI laughs intensely]

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:56.607
Bravo, Dabura!
Well done! Well done!

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.547
[BABIDI, DABURA laugh]

00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:06.125
[GOKU]
Huh?

00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:08.630
[grunts]

00:09:08.663 --> 00:09:11.669
Yeah, something's not
right about this. I dunno.

00:09:11.703 --> 00:09:15.042
[VEGETA]
Nothing is right about this!

00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:22.959
What were you doing out there?
You should've had him!

00:09:22.992 --> 00:09:24.863
Every time you
throw down the gauntlet,

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:26.833
you represent the
Saiyan race; which means

00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:29.973
when you fight badly,
we all look like fools!

00:09:30.006 --> 00:09:32.010
You go too easy
on your opponents!

00:09:32.044 --> 00:09:35.384
Always opting for mercy
when you should be vicious!

00:09:35.417 --> 00:09:36.953
That is no way to win!

00:09:36.987 --> 00:09:39.091
Power is for those
who can be ruthless.

00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:42.164
Not bleeding hearts who shrink
from dealing the final blow.

00:09:42.197 --> 00:09:44.669
Survival of the fittest!
Plain and simple!

00:09:44.702 --> 00:09:46.640
Take a good look at yourself.

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:49.780
Two of your friends' lives
were in the balance.

00:09:49.813 --> 00:09:52.151
Agh! And you crumbled!

00:09:52.184 --> 00:09:53.453
[gasps]

00:09:53.486 --> 00:09:56.894
[GOHAN] He's right.
Piccolo and Krillin.

00:09:56.927 --> 00:09:59.098
If I'd defeated Dabura,
they could've been

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:01.101
turned back to normal.

00:10:03.707 --> 00:10:06.445
All right, that's enough.
Cut him some slack, Vegeta.

00:10:06.478 --> 00:10:09.351
The fight was just starting;
he hadn't found his stride, yet.

00:10:09.384 --> 00:10:11.723
I'll deal with you momentarily.

00:10:11.757 --> 00:10:14.095
It's high time we put
this nonsense to bed.

00:10:14.128 --> 00:10:17.234
I want to settle the score
between us for good!

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:20.808
Ugh! I can't believe
I let it go on for so long.

00:10:20.842 --> 00:10:22.979
Babidi, Dabura, Majin Buu:

00:10:23.012 --> 00:10:25.617
I'll roast them all,
along with this ship!

00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:27.087
Everyone brace yourselves!

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.657
[SUPREME KAI]
No, Vegeta! Don't!

00:10:28.691 --> 00:10:30.762
You have no idea what
you're about to unleash

00:10:30.795 --> 00:10:32.865
on the world by doing this!

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:36.238
Majin Buu is devastation
and destruction personified!

00:10:36.272 --> 00:10:38.810
A creature of the purest
dark magic against whom

00:10:38.844 --> 00:10:41.014
not even the four Kai
could stand!

00:10:41.048 --> 00:10:42.050
Who cares?

00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:44.321
If you reawaken him,
nothing will survive!

00:10:44.354 --> 00:10:45.991
Do you understand me? Nothing!

00:10:46.024 --> 00:10:48.764
Earth will be transformed
into a barren wasteland!

00:10:48.797 --> 00:10:51.202
Every single living creature
will be wiped out!

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:52.872
So what?

00:10:52.905 --> 00:10:54.208
[gasps]

00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:56.713
You think the earth's
fate weighs on me?

00:10:56.746 --> 00:11:00.487
Let it die for all I care!
It's never been my home!

00:11:00.521 --> 00:11:02.858
How can you say such a thing?

00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:06.365
I believe the Kai
told you to knock it off.

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.269
Unhand me!

00:11:14.414 --> 00:11:15.718
[sighs]

00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:17.956
I can't help but feel like
this is all a set up.

00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:20.728
Yes. Without a doubt
its a ploy to hasten

00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:24.602
