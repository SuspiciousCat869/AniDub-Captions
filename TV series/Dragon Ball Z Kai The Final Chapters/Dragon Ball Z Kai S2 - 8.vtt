Oh, man.

Feels like your mom's
been feeding you rocks!

has to be my birthday!

One of those 16 spots is
earmarked for Mr. Satan,

since he is the
tournament's reigning champ.

00:07:04.414 --> 00:07:06.418

delay, let's get down to

choosing the
other 15 contestants!

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.093
What's this all about?

00:07:10.127 --> 00:07:12.464
[ATTENDANT] As usual, we'll use
a punch machine to ensure

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:14.536
everyone's strength
is scored fairly.

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:16.841
Those with the 15 highest
scores on the punch machine

00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:19.278
will move on from
the preliminary round!

00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:21.248
What's a punch machine?

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.185
Nope, I got nothing.

[ATTENDANT]
All right!

00:07:25.456 --> 00:07:26.927
In order to show you
how the machine works,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.733
and let you see what you're in
for if you ever reach the arena,

himself, Mr. Satan!

[MR. SATAN]
Yeah!

00:07:43.627 --> 00:07:47.134
If you want it, you're gonna
have to take it from me!

[CROWD cheering]

00:07:53.747 --> 00:07:54.982
Yeah!

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:57.822
Everyone I came here with
could take that belt from him.

00:07:57.855 --> 00:07:58.557
Easily.

00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:00.027
C'mon! Don't be shy!

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.996
Show me those cameras!

00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:08.744
[PICCOLO] I've seen about
all of this I can stand.

00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:13.787
[REPORTER A] I think his
muscles busted our cameras!

00:08:14.454 --> 00:08:15.724
What was that for?

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:17.494
I took the liberty
of breaking all the

00:08:17.528 --> 00:08:19.632
cameras in the
spectator seats, as well.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.937
If your disguise fails you,
the students at your school

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.743
won't have the chance
to figure out who you are.

00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:26.579
You can focus on the tournament.

00:08:26.613 --> 00:08:28.584
Thanks a lot!
That's a relief!

00:08:28.617 --> 00:08:31.355
What the heck just happened
to all those cameras, huh?

00:08:31.389 --> 00:08:32.324
Oh, well.

00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:34.762
Guess I just flexed too hard.

00:08:45.082 --> 00:08:47.588
