[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:12.525
Babidi and Majin Buu set
their sights on West City,

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:14.997
but Goku stalled them
with the awesome powers

Okay! Uuuh...

is on the move again.

He's leaving West City,
which means he must've

00:00:38.778 --> 00:00:40.347
finally found the Radar.

00:00:40.447 --> 00:00:42.285

my work here is done.

turn back normal now?

dawdling around to kill him!

This could be a good thing;

not having anyone in Buu's ear
ordering him around.

There's a chance without

It'll be okay.
I'm confident he won't

destroy the earth,
at least not just yet.

00:09:39.024 --> 00:09:40.661

two days because

someone strong enough
was coming along to fight him

is we have two days

my time in this world.

00:12:08.724 --> 00:12:10.093
It's unbelievable.

00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:12.063
No Supreme Kai
has been able to handle

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:14.034
the Z Sword properly
for centuries

00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:17.340
and here comes Gohan, mastering
it after a couple of hours!

00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:20.180
You shouldn't have doubted me
when I said he was the one.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.087
And knowing his heart, I like
his chances versus Buu.

00:12:25.657 --> 00:12:27.327
[GOHAN grunts]

00:12:27.427 --> 00:12:33.540
[panting]

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.843
You're doing great, Gohan,

00:12:34.943 --> 00:12:36.478
but it sounds like
you could use a break.

00:12:36.579 --> 00:12:39.586
In fact, you're already ahead of
where I thought you'd be by now.

00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:42.023
No! There's no time for a break!

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:46.933
[BOTH gasp]

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:49.237
[GOHAN] When Dad went to
Otherworld, he kept training

00:12:49.338 --> 00:12:51.075
harder than
he ever did on Earth.

00:12:51.175 --> 00:12:53.981
I have to do the same.
I can't ever catch up to him,

00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:57.020
but I owe it to the world
to at least try.

00:12:57.822 --> 00:13:01.963
After all, Majin Buu
is still out there.

00:13:06.539 --> 00:13:13.018
[GOTEN, KRILLIN grunting]

00:13:13.118 --> 00:13:15.123
Hey, Goku, before you
leave there's a question

00:13:15.223 --> 00:13:17.260
I've been meaning to ask you.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.830
Sure. What is it?

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.135
Earlier, you were
Super Saiyan Three.

00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:23.005
I suspect that
had you gone all out,

00:13:23.105 --> 00:13:25.276
you could have defeated
Majin Buu right then and there

00:13:25.377 --> 00:13:28.115
on your own.
Am I wrong about that?

00:13:28.216 --> 00:13:31.288
Well, it's possible. But with
Buu's strength and powers,

00:13:31.388 --> 00:13:33.225
it's hard to say
one way or the other.

00:13:33.325 --> 00:13:36.966
Heh. I think me beating him
wasn't in the cards.

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:40.406
"Think"? You always
know what you're capable of.

00:13:40.507 --> 00:13:42.945
In this battle, you just
didn't see it through.

00:13:43.045 --> 00:13:45.584
Were you concerned because
your energy levels were low?

00:13:45.684 --> 00:13:48.489
No.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:49.792
[PICCOLO]
Hm?

00:13:49.892 --> 00:13:51.461
I'm someone who's
not even supposed to

00:13:51.562 --> 00:13:54.435
be in this world anymore.

00:13:54.536 --> 00:13:56.739
Buu's not my battle to win.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.475
We have to teach
this next generation

00:13:58.576 --> 00:14:00.079
to beat Buu on their own.

00:14:00.179 --> 00:14:02.016
Because you know once he's gone,

00:14:02.116 --> 00:14:04.722
there's always gonna be
some other destructive power

00:14:04.823 --> 00:14:06.660
determined to
take over the world.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.230
Sure, Fusion's a gamble,

00:14:09.331 --> 00:14:12.037
but after seeing how strong
Goten and Trunks have become,

00:14:12.137 --> 00:14:14.509
I believe my faith
in them is justified.

00:14:14.609 --> 00:14:16.077
[PICCOLO] But you're
putting the earth's fate

00:14:16.178 --> 00:14:18.149
entirely in the hands
of children.

00:14:18.249 --> 00:14:22.090
[GOKU] Yeah, well, it won't be
the first time, will it?

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:26.431
Your confidence never fails
to impress me, Goku.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.135
[GOKU]
Hmph!

00:14:31.375 --> 00:14:35.116
I'm sorry about
Gohan by the way.

00:14:35.216 --> 00:14:36.653
When you get back
to Otherworld,

00:14:36.753 --> 00:14:38.824
please tell him
how proud I am of him.

00:14:38.924 --> 00:14:40.326
Sure thing. If I know my son,

00:14:40.426 --> 00:14:42.063
what he'll regret most
about losing to Buu

00:14:42.163 --> 00:14:44.736
is not being able
to see you anymore.

00:14:44.836 --> 00:14:47.106
You know, Gohan always
looked up to you.

00:14:47.206 --> 00:14:49.612
Thought the world of you.

00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:53.385
[TRUNKS sighs]

00:14:53.485 --> 00:14:55.924
Hey, guys! Trunks is back
from getting the Radar!

00:14:56.726 --> 00:14:59.431
I'm so proud of you, Trunks.
I knew you'd do it.

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:02.103
Yeah! I did it!

00:15:02.203 --> 00:15:04.609
I present to you
the Dragon Radar:

00:15:04.709 --> 00:15:05.878
safe and in one piece!

00:15:05.978 --> 00:15:08.115
Awesome!

00:15:10.887 --> 00:15:12.291
All right!
Now that we've got this,

00:15:12.391 --> 00:15:14.094
we can finally track down
the Dragon Balls

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:16.465
and wish things back
to how they were before.

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:18.904
I never realized
how strong you were, Goku!

00:15:19.004 --> 00:15:21.008
You might be even
stronger than my dad!

00:15:21.108 --> 00:15:23.479
Thanks, but I'm not so sure.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.617
Your dad was more than
a match for anyone.

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:28.089
I'm sorry we called you weak.
We were just upset

00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:30.192
you were knocked out
while Buu whooped us.

00:15:30.292 --> 00:15:32.932
[GOKU]
Huh? You called me weak?

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:38.543
[GOTEN, GOKU, TRUNKS laughing]

00:15:38.877 --> 00:15:40.179
[GOKU]
All right, boys.

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:42.083
We gotta jump right back
into your Fusion training.

00:15:42.183 --> 00:15:43.319
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
'Kay!

00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:44.989
[GOKU] I've only got
a few minutes left

00:15:45.089 --> 00:15:46.893
before I go back to Otherworld.
So you need to really

00:15:46.993 --> 00:15:48.897
buckle down and finish
your training strong,

00:15:48.997 --> 00:15:50.868
otherwise Earth
is toast! Got it?

00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:52.170
[BOTH]
Yes sir, sensei!

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.009
Wow, when did they
get so obedient?

00:15:55.109 --> 00:15:57.147
I think your Super Saiyan Three
technique earned you

00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:59.985
a new level of respect.

00:16:00.688 --> 00:16:02.123
Let's begin!

00:16:02.224 --> 00:16:04.929
Match your energy levels like
you were doing before I left.

00:16:05.029 --> 00:16:06.632
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Yes, sir!

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:10.272
Buu!

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:13.680

South-by-southwest bearing at
moderate rate of speed.

Flying humans! Yay!

00:16:30.947 --> 00:16:33.854

I think we lost him.

Mmmwah!

[BUU laughs]
Hey! That tickles Buu!

00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:53.994
Buu!

--[PILOT 37A] Help!

[BUU chuckles, hollers]

00:17:06.352 --> 00:17:09.223
Buu thought
that would be more fun.

[TRUNKS, GOTEN yell]

00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:17.374
Wow! I can't believe it!

00:17:17.474 --> 00:17:18.910
I never thought
in a million years I'd see

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.850
boys this young
raise their energy so high!

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:24.321
[TRUNKS, GOTEN continue yelling]

00:17:24.421 --> 00:17:27.093
Trunks, you're doing awesome!

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:33.606
Nice. But after I'm gone,
I want you to practice

00:17:33.706 --> 00:17:35.978
matching energy levels
so often that it becomes

00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:37.548
as easy as breathing.

00:17:37.648 --> 00:17:38.683
How you feeling, Goku?

00:17:38.783 --> 00:17:40.887
I'm worried you're
running your tank too low.

00:17:40.987 --> 00:17:42.457
I'm good, I'm good.

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:44.361
I got enough strength left
to work with the boys

00:17:44.461 --> 00:17:46.264
for another few
minutes here, at least.

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:48.736
[PICCOLO] I don't think I've
ever seen Goku so exhausted.

00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:51.375
Going Super Saiyan Three
on Earth depleted his energy

00:17:51.475 --> 00:17:53.914
in ways no other villain has.

00:17:54.014 --> 00:17:55.449
All right. Listen up.

00:17:55.551 --> 00:17:57.186
You're doing well so far,
but now I'm going to teach you

00:17:57.287 --> 00:17:59.926
the single hardest part about
successfully doing Fusion.

00:18:00.026 --> 00:18:01.195
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Ready!

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:02.765
After you've matched
your energy levels,

00:18:02.865 --> 00:18:05.302
then you both need to perform a
special pose at the same time

00:18:05.402 --> 00:18:10.012
exactly the same way.
Only then will you fuse.

00:18:10.112 --> 00:18:11.916
Now watch.
I'll demonstrate the pose

00:18:12.016 --> 00:18:14.622
and you guys try
to memorize it, okay?

00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:15.724
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Got it!

00:18:15.824 --> 00:18:17.595
First, step three paces
back from each other

00:18:17.695 --> 00:18:20.166
so your arms can swing
free and clear.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:21.503
Then, put your arms out,

00:18:21.603 --> 00:18:24.509
same direction,
parallel to the ground.

00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:25.578
Fuuu...

00:18:25.678 --> 00:18:27.179
Swing your arms
in the opposite direction,

00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:29.350
while moving back toward
each other three paces

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.355
so you're standing
really close again.

00:18:31.455 --> 00:18:34.194
...sion! Make fists
and pay close attention

00:18:34.294 --> 00:18:36.198
to your leg angles. Ha!

00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:38.904
Then, touch your index fingers
and bend like I'm doing.

00:18:39.004 --> 00:18:41.610
But remember to keep this angle
going with your legs.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.782
The key is stretching
your outside leg.

00:18:45.618 --> 00:18:48.790
Is he joking?
This looks so weird.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.595
Now. I want you two
to try it before I leave!

00:18:51.696 --> 00:18:52.698
[BOTH]
'Kay!

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.835
It's not that hard.
Just re-create that pose

00:18:54.935 --> 00:18:57.107
I showed you, but make it
perfectly symmetrical

00:18:57.207 --> 00:18:59.712
with each other.
C'mon. Clock's ticking.

00:18:59.813 --> 00:19:01.215
[BOTH]
Uh...

00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:03.586
Hm? What's wrong?

00:19:03.687 --> 00:19:05.423
[TRUNKS]
Uh...

00:19:05.524 --> 00:19:08.262
What does "symmetrical"
mean? Sir?

00:19:08.362 --> 00:19:11.301
Huh? Well, it's, uh--It's like--

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:13.406
It's hard to define, actually.

00:19:13.507 --> 00:19:15.275
Hmmm.

00:19:18.349 --> 00:19:20.754
Ah! I know,
Piccolo and I will do it

00:19:20.854 --> 00:19:22.057
and you can copy us!

00:19:22.157 --> 00:19:24.127
--What?
--[chuckles]

00:19:24.227 --> 00:19:26.464
Wait, why me?

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:34.180
[GOKU] Ready, Piccolo?
Watch closely, kids.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.285
The key is moving
as exact opposites,

00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:39.157
like you're watching yourself
reflected in a mirror.

00:19:39.257 --> 00:19:41.896
Fuu...

00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:43.733
...sion!

00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:46.237
Ha!

00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:54.454
[KRILLIN]
Uh, what the heck is this?

00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:57.494
This isn't training.
It's more like they're dancing.

00:19:57.595 --> 00:19:59.532
Well, maybe if they
go at Majin Buu like this

00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:01.635
he could laugh himself to death.

00:20:01.736 --> 00:20:03.539
[ROSHI]
Hmmm...

00:20:05.777 --> 00:20:08.382
All right! Trunks, Goten,
let's see some Fusion!

00:20:08.482 --> 00:20:10.052
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Right!

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.526
Goku. Earlier, you said
you regretted never having

00:20:13.626 --> 00:20:16.665
the chance to try out
the Fusion move with Vegeta.

00:20:16.766 --> 00:20:18.435
But even if he were
alive and well,

00:20:18.537 --> 00:20:21.509
knowing his personality there's
no way he'd agree to this.

00:20:21.609 --> 00:20:24.014
What? You think? Why not?

00:20:24.114 --> 00:20:28.088
Mm. Uh... Never mind.

00:20:28.188 --> 00:20:29.925
--[GOKU] Hmmm.
--[TRUNKS] Goku!

00:20:30.025 --> 00:20:32.296
--[GOKU] Mhmmm! That's right.
--[TRUNKS] Eh?

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:34.134
Hey, Goten,
the angle of your arms

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:35.771
is a little too low, buddy.

00:20:35.871 --> 00:20:38.275
Raise them a bit higher
like Trunks'.

00:20:38.375 --> 00:20:40.780
Now, take three steps sideways.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.086
[BOTH]
Fu...sion!

00:20:44.187 --> 00:20:46.224
[GOTEN]
Oops!

00:20:46.324 --> 00:20:47.293
[BOTH]
Ha!

00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:48.462
[TRUNKS]
Hey, what are you doing?

00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:49.999
[GOTEN]
You were way too fast.

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:51.769
Aw, boy.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.372
[GOKU claps]
All right, all right!

00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:56.244
Enough bickering. Let's do
it again. From the top!

00:20:56.344 --> 00:20:57.848
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Right!

00:20:57.948 --> 00:20:59.852
[BUU chuckles]

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.297
[explosion]

00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:14.681
[BUU laughs]

00:21:14.782 --> 00:21:17.420
[NARRATOR] Babidi is gone,
leaving the childlike monster

00:21:17.521 --> 00:21:20.293
to continue his rampage
on impulse alone!

00:21:20.393 --> 00:21:21.996
And with mere minutes left
before he must

00:21:22.096 --> 00:21:25.469
return to Otherworld,
Goku struggles to pass down

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.808
the potentially Earth-saving
secret of Fusion

00:21:27.908 --> 00:21:31.615
to Goten and Trunks. The stakes
have never been higher!

00:21:31.715 --> 00:21:33.318
The margin never tighter!

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:36.492
The world never closer
to total destruction!

00:21:36.593 --> 00:21:39.865
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.233 --> 00:21:45.409
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.266
[GOKU]
Hey, guys! It's me, Goku!

00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:49.070
Well, I used all
the energy I had left

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.573
going Super Saiyan Three.

00:22:50.673 --> 00:22:53.580
So it's all up to Trunks and
Goten to defeat Majin Buu!

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.750
Practice Fusion
as hard as you can, boys!

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.721
[BABA]
Goku, your time's up here.

00:22:57.822 --> 00:22:59.959
You have to go back
to Otherworld.

00:23:00.059 --> 00:23:02.162
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:02.262 --> 00:23:05.637
"Bye-Bye, Everyone! Goku Returns
to the Next World!"

00:23:05.737 --> 00:23:07.273
[GOHAN] With my dad gone,
we're all gonna

00:23:07.373 --> 00:23:09.010
have to work twice as hard.
