[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:14.261
the monstrous Majin Buu
had already wiped out

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:18.069
nearly 80 percent
of the earth's population.

00:00:18.103 --> 00:00:21.175

get scared and run.

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:25.886

Are you scared?

[barks]

00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:32.431
[BUU] Buu fixed creature.
He should run in fear.

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.070
He won't run now!
He likes you, Buu!

00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:37.141
He's sure glad you healed him!

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:39.947
Majin Buu got his first pet.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.218
Buu think
this creature likes Buu.

00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:44.856
That's what I was saying!
See his tail wagging?

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.128
That means he wants
to play with you!

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:51.202
Oh. He just like you then.
You like Buu, too, right?

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:52.873
Uh.
[chuckles]

00:00:52.906 --> 00:00:55.211
Yeah, you're the best!

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:58.149
Ah! That make Buu happy!

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:00.922
What's your reason
for killing so many people

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:02.959
and destroying
all our cities and homes?

00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:04.195
'Cause it's fun!

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:05.899
You know, it's not right
to destroy cities

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.636
full of innocent people.

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:09.506
Ah! Unless that's
what makes you happy.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.078
Then by all means,
destroy whatever you want!

00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:14.750
You think Buu should
stop hurting Earth people?

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:17.021
Uh, a little. Yeah.

00:01:17.054 --> 00:01:19.258
Then Buu stop!

00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:21.630
[MR. SATAN] You're really
gonna stop terrorizing?

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:22.633
[BUU]
Mhmm.

And stop blowing up cities?

[BUU]
Mm.

00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:27.107
[MR. SATAN]
I did it! I really did it!

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.443
[NARRATOR] But just
as Buu was experiencing

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:29.746
a monumental change of heart,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.152

own nature intervened.

[VAN ZANT laughs]
You're next, Buu!

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.981
[NARRATOR] A bullet fired
by a foolish young man

00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:49.185
may have put a stop
to Buu's softening,

00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:51.858
and threatened the
whole world once again.

00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:54.829
Buu fights back, now!

just hanging out
with Majin Buu anyway?

Hm! Makes no difference to me.
