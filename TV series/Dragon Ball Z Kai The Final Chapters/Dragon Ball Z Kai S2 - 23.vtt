00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:41.461
[laughs]

00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:45.737
[laughs]

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.510
[CHICHI] What is going on
inside Vegeta's head today?

00:14:48.543 --> 00:14:51.181
First he blasts part of
the arena to smithereens,

00:14:51.215 --> 00:14:53.185
and then he just
vanishes like that?

00:14:53.219 --> 00:14:55.724
If my Goten is buried
under all this rubble,

00:14:55.758 --> 00:14:58.696
I'm giving that man
a talking-to!

00:15:04.776 --> 00:15:08.917
Oh, Vegeta.
What has happened to you?

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:15.831
[GOTEN] I wonder
what this Buu guy is like.

00:15:15.864 --> 00:15:16.999
D'you think he's strong?

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:18.737
I just hope our dads
don't defeat him

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.439
while we're still
flying over there.

00:15:20.473 --> 00:15:22.410
Huh? Don't say that!

00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:23.647
Don't freak out.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.450
I'm not saying it happened--
I'm just saying it could.

00:15:25.483 --> 00:15:27.655
Between my dad
and your dad and Gohan,

00:15:27.688 --> 00:15:29.859
maybe they already
wiped the floor with this guy.

00:15:29.892 --> 00:15:32.197
Aw, no fair, Trunks!
That's no fun at all!

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.267
I really wanna see Majin Buu!

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.037
All right!
If that's how you feel,

00:15:36.071 --> 00:15:38.041
then what're we
waiting for? C'mon!

00:15:38.075 --> 00:15:39.712
[GOTEN]
Right!

00:15:49.197 --> 00:15:52.204
This is more
to your liking, I trust?

00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:53.106
Yeah.

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:54.775
Dad, you can't do this!

00:15:54.809 --> 00:15:57.180
[SUPREME KAI]
Leave them be.

00:15:57.213 --> 00:15:59.752
There's nothing we can do
to prevent this fight.

00:15:59.785 --> 00:16:03.593
Go ahead and grant Vegeta
the rematch he so longs for.

00:16:03.626 --> 00:16:06.298
Gohan and I will smash our
way back into the ship,

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.135
fight until we've reached
the control room,

00:16:08.168 --> 00:16:10.406
and take on Babidi and Dabura.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.145
At this point, I'm assuming
that Majin Buu's revival

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:15.149
is a foregone conclusion.

00:16:15.183 --> 00:16:16.485
Given the choices at hand,

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:18.823
it's better we deal
with Majin Buu like this

00:16:18.857 --> 00:16:20.694
before he absorbs
your fighting energy

00:16:20.728 --> 00:16:22.463
and hits full power.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.472
If luck is on our side,
we can dispatch the wizard

00:16:26.506 --> 00:16:29.078
before Majin Buu revives
in the first place.

00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:31.683
Oh, really?
[laughs]

00:16:31.716 --> 00:16:33.485
Your luck's about to run out!

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:35.924
Hey, Vegeta!
This is your master.

00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.866
Kill the two of them
for me! Do it now!

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:44.875
[groans]

00:16:44.909 --> 00:16:46.946
Vegeta.
What're you waiting for?

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.986
Kill those meddlers!
That's an order!

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:53.660
[groans]

00:16:53.693 --> 00:16:55.965
[yells]

00:16:55.998 --> 00:17:00.073
[groans]

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:02.444
Babidi's magic at work!

00:17:02.477 --> 00:17:04.582
[gasps]

00:17:04.615 --> 00:17:08.557
[BABIDI]
Yes! Do it now! Kill them all!

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:14.400
[yells]

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:18.408
[BABIDI] Stop writhing
on the ground and do it!

00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:25.891
Hell no!

00:17:25.925 --> 00:17:27.060
--[BABIDI] What?
--[DABURA] Huh?

00:17:27.093 --> 00:17:28.563
Those two can do what they want.

00:17:28.597 --> 00:17:31.067
As long as they don't
interfere with my fight.

00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:33.840
[BABIDI] I am only going to
say this one more time!

00:17:33.873 --> 00:17:39.017
Vegeta, take care of the Supreme
Kai for me; that's an order!

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:43.125
[grunts]

00:17:43.159 --> 00:17:46.298
That's it! Good boy!

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:49.271
[VEGETA] And I'm going to
say <i>this</i> one more time!

00:17:49.304 --> 00:17:52.410
Fighting Kakarot's
all I care about!

00:17:52.444 --> 00:17:55.651
I am not some weakling
to be ordered around!

00:17:55.684 --> 00:17:57.219
I am a Saiyan!

00:17:57.253 --> 00:18:00.359
Don't mistake me for another
one of your servants!

00:18:00.393 --> 00:18:03.466
There is a part of me
that you will never control!

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:10.446
I carry within me
the pride of a prince!

00:18:13.118 --> 00:18:15.757
[yells]

00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:25.611
I--I've never had one
disobey before!

00:18:25.644 --> 00:18:28.650
Can you imagine the fullness
of his ego, Dabura?

00:18:28.683 --> 00:18:31.288
Hmmm. It makes little
difference, Master.

00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:35.129
He is a tool. So long as he
provokes the energy out of them,

00:18:35.162 --> 00:18:37.768
let him cling to his
petty sense of pride.

00:18:37.802 --> 00:18:41.141
Allow the Supreme Kai
attempt to confront you.

00:18:41.175 --> 00:18:44.615
When he arrives,
I will be here to destroy him.

00:18:44.649 --> 00:18:47.086
This is what
you wanted, was it not?

00:18:47.119 --> 00:18:49.926
To watch him die
before your very eyes?

00:18:49.959 --> 00:18:51.763
This is unbelievable!

00:18:51.796 --> 00:18:54.101
To think that one of Babidi's
thralls could possess

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.438
enough willpower
to be able to resist him!

00:18:56.471 --> 00:18:58.142
If you fought that off,
you must wanna

00:18:58.175 --> 00:19:01.683
settle the score
pretty badly. Right, Vegeta?

00:19:01.716 --> 00:19:03.520
[VEGETA]
Hm!

00:19:03.553 --> 00:19:06.759
[DABURA] Master, would it not be
better for us to open the door

00:19:06.792 --> 00:19:09.497
and let the Supreme Kai
come straight to us?

00:19:09.532 --> 00:19:12.571
If he were to force his way in,
the power he expends

00:19:12.604 --> 00:19:15.577
could revive Majin Buu
before he's at full strength,

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.218
and that would be a tragic waste
of the creature's potential.

00:19:19.251 --> 00:19:23.893
Good thinking.
Very well. Let him inside.

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.634
[GOHAN]
Wait, he opened the hatch?

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:30.139
[SUPREME KAI] I guess he didn't
want us wrecking his spaceship.

00:19:30.173 --> 00:19:32.745
All right then, Dad.
We're heading in.

00:19:32.778 --> 00:19:35.149
Hm! Show 'em who's boss.

00:19:35.182 --> 00:19:37.988
Oh, before I forget.
I have two senzu beans left.

00:19:38.021 --> 00:19:41.194
They're from that batch we got
to patch up your girlfriend.

00:19:41.228 --> 00:19:42.664
Eat one before you leave.

00:19:42.698 --> 00:19:46.371
You used up a lot of energy
fighting Dabura, didn't you?

00:19:48.408 --> 00:19:51.248
Thanks a lot, Dad.

00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:52.751
Listen to me, son.

00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:55.122
When you make it to Babidi,
I want you to remember

00:19:55.156 --> 00:19:56.526
your fight with Cell
and be sure to get

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:59.163
just as angry
as you were that day.

00:19:59.197 --> 00:20:00.533
Get angry?

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:02.504
When you're mad, there's
no one in the whole universe

00:20:02.538 --> 00:20:06.478
who's stronger than you.
I know you can do this.

00:20:06.513 --> 00:20:10.486
Right. And that's great an' all,
but I'm really sorry

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.457
that you're having
to spend your one day

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.295
back on Earth like this, Dad.

00:20:17.033 --> 00:20:18.569
[GOHAN]
Let's do this.

00:20:21.977 --> 00:20:23.613
Sorry for the delay.

00:20:23.646 --> 00:20:26.752
It's quite all right, Kakarot.

00:20:26.786 --> 00:20:31.662
I've waited so long. But now
the moment has arrived!

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:36.806
I don't want any damage
I take from you

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:39.679
to help Majin Buu
awaken again. Got it?

00:20:39.712 --> 00:20:42.050
So I'm gonna hit you hard
right from the start

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:43.418
and get this over with.

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:46.826
Fine by me. Let's see
the results of your training

00:20:46.859 --> 00:20:49.531
in Otherworld, Kakarot.

00:20:49.565 --> 00:20:51.334
[bellows]

00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:54.608
Impressive.

00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:58.181
You're stronger than
Gohan was against Cell.

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.887
[bellows]

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.914
So maybe this fight
isn't going to be

00:21:13.947 --> 00:21:15.551
quite as easy as I thought.

00:21:15.584 --> 00:21:19.524
I'm ready! And this time,
you're going to die!

00:21:19.558 --> 00:21:23.232
[NARRATOR] Goku's resolve has
overwhelmed the Supreme Kai.

00:21:23.265 --> 00:21:26.437
Vegeta's pride has deflected
Babidi's commands.

00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:29.912
Clearly, there's no keeping
a Saiyan from a good fight!

00:21:29.945 --> 00:21:33.419
Now, Goku and Vegeta
are headed into a showdown

00:21:33.452 --> 00:21:37.060
no force on Earth
is powerful enough to stop!

00:21:37.093 --> 00:21:39.565
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:45.597 --> 00:22:47.066
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:49.672
We're settling this
right here and now, Vegeta!

00:22:49.705 --> 00:22:51.609
Gohan, you and
the Supreme Kai need to

00:22:51.643 --> 00:22:54.080
get to where Babidi's waiting,
no matter what!

00:22:54.113 --> 00:22:55.751
[BABIDI laughs]

00:22:55.784 --> 00:22:59.959
Majin Buu will return!
It's only a matter of time now!

00:22:59.992 --> 00:23:02.396
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:06.171 --> 00:23:08.976
[GOHAN] Don't worry, Dad.
Let me take it from here!
