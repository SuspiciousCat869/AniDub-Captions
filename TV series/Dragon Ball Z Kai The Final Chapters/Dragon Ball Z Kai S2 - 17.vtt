00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:31.229
[DABURA]
Hmmmm.

00:10:31.262 --> 00:10:32.831
He-heh!

00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:35.336
Look out!

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.608
Oh no!
His saliva's tainted!

00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:38.577
[PICCOLO]
What?

00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:40.046
[DABURA]
Hm-hm-hmm.

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.716
You degenerate!

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.286
[GOKU]
Wait!

00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:45.558
[PICCOLO]
Ugh!

00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:47.695
[gasps]

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:56.980
[KRILLIN screams]

00:10:57.013 --> 00:10:58.449
Krillin, no!

00:10:58.482 --> 00:11:01.255
[KRILLIN groans]

00:11:12.043 --> 00:11:17.254
[groans]

00:11:17.287 --> 00:11:19.190
[GOKU]
Krillin! Piccolo!

00:11:21.763 --> 00:11:23.834
[GOKU]
Piccolo!

00:11:23.867 --> 00:11:25.436
What's he done to my friends?

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.207
They--They're stone.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.142
Huh?!

00:11:28.175 --> 00:11:30.113
This is one of
Dabura's vile powers.

00:11:30.146 --> 00:11:32.417
Those upon whom
he spits become statues!

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.155
[GOKU]
That's unbelievable!

00:11:34.188 --> 00:11:35.223
Hold on!

00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:37.427
[SUPREME KAI] No, Goku!
You mustn't touch him!

00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:38.931
[GOKU]
Why not?

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:41.168
Break them and they can never
be restored to their true form.

00:11:41.202 --> 00:11:44.643
Leave them as they are for the
time being, I implore you!

00:11:44.676 --> 00:11:46.411
Oh, man.

00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:50.319
[DABURA laughs]

00:11:51.388 --> 00:11:52.659
[GOKU grunts]

00:11:52.692 --> 00:11:53.861
[laughs]

00:11:53.894 --> 00:11:56.098
Now run along, children.

00:11:56.131 --> 00:12:00.073
None of you has the strength
to defy my master.

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:02.511
[laughs]

00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:06.953
[VEGETA grunts]

00:12:24.856 --> 00:12:26.491
[GOKU gasps]

00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:32.470
This is bad.
They're not moving.

00:12:32.504 --> 00:12:34.676
[VEGETA grunts]

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:36.078
Hey, Supreme Kai.

00:12:36.111 --> 00:12:37.682
If we break 'em,
they can't go back

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:39.484
to their original form, right?

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:41.790
Does that mean there's a way
to bring 'em out of this

00:12:41.823 --> 00:12:44.696
if we keep them in one piece?

00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:47.635
There is. But I'm afraid
that it requires

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:50.273
Dabura being defeated.

00:12:50.306 --> 00:12:51.576
That works for me.

00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:53.379
A problem with
a simple solution.

00:12:53.412 --> 00:12:55.249
Just how I like it. Heh.

00:12:55.283 --> 00:12:56.285
[SUPREME KAI gasps]

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:58.957
What are we waiting for?
Our friends need us.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.563
Either way, we didn't come here
to play hide and seek.

00:13:01.596 --> 00:13:03.933
Good point, Gohan! Come on!

00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:09.310
Don't do it! You're playing
right into Babidi's hands!

00:13:10.313 --> 00:13:12.483
Following Dabura
into that ship is exactly

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:13.954
what he expects you to do!

00:13:13.987 --> 00:13:16.660
Far wiser to await further
developments and lay low!

00:13:16.693 --> 00:13:18.162
[GOKU]
My buddies are garden gnomes!

00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:20.801
I can't sit around and let birds
start building nests on 'em!

00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:21.703
[GOHAN]
Me neither!

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:24.240
[SUPREME KAI]
Wait!

00:13:24.274 --> 00:13:25.143
[VEGETA]
Sorry.

00:13:25.176 --> 00:13:26.680
Patience has
never been something

00:13:26.713 --> 00:13:29.351
we're particularly good at.

00:13:33.092 --> 00:13:35.397
[gasps]

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.537
[sighs]

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.373
You impulsive--!

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.065
Hmm.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.948
[VEGETA gasps]

00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:02.551
Okay. Let's go.

00:14:02.585 --> 00:14:04.120
All right.

00:14:17.548 --> 00:14:21.422
[BABIDI laughs]

00:14:21.455 --> 00:14:22.558
Here they come!

00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:25.396
Simpletons. This is going
to be a piece of cake.

00:14:25.429 --> 00:14:27.400
[BOTH chuckle]

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.026
What's up with this place?

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:42.230
For a spaceship,
it sure is plain.

00:14:42.263 --> 00:14:44.502
Looks like there's
really only one door.

00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:46.807
Whaddya say we bust it down
and have a peek?

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.375
Right.

00:14:51.449 --> 00:14:54.555
Ha! Cool! Nice of you
to join us, Supreme Kai.

00:14:54.588 --> 00:14:56.024
What made you change your mind?

00:14:56.058 --> 00:15:00.333
I don't dare leave the three
of you to your own devices.

00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:01.702
Huh?

00:15:02.671 --> 00:15:04.909
[SUPREME KAI] Doing so thus far
is why we're not likely

00:15:04.942 --> 00:15:07.179
to see the light of day again.

00:15:07.213 --> 00:15:10.152
We'll have to subdue Babidi
if we want to leave the ship.

00:15:10.186 --> 00:15:14.596
Huh. Well, least we know
what we gotta do, right?

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:16.298
That's somethin'.

00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:19.639
Hm! If it comes to it,
I'll tear this rat hole apart

00:15:19.673 --> 00:15:20.874
with my bare hands.

00:15:20.907 --> 00:15:22.210
You will not!

00:15:22.243 --> 00:15:24.114
A strong enough jolt to
the structure of this ship

00:15:24.147 --> 00:15:26.085
might awaken Majin Buu!

00:15:26.118 --> 00:15:27.788
Believe me when
I tell you this threat

00:15:27.821 --> 00:15:29.859
cannot be taken too seriously!

00:15:29.893 --> 00:15:33.499
If our foe should rise with only
a fraction of his power intact--

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:35.838
only a fraction
please bear in mind--

00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:38.109
it will be more than
sufficient to reduce us

00:15:38.142 --> 00:15:40.313
and this entire planet to dust!

00:15:40.346 --> 00:15:42.016
[VEGETA huffs]

00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:48.363
My, what an astounding
bit of fortune, Supreme Kai.

00:15:48.396 --> 00:15:49.431
[laughs]

00:15:49.465 --> 00:15:53.105
Rather unassuming place
for a wizard, isn't it?

00:15:55.777 --> 00:15:57.347
[PUIPUI chuckles]

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.119
I'm ready, Master!
Please say it's time!

00:16:00.153 --> 00:16:01.923
[BABIDI]
Heh. Eager, aren't we?

00:16:01.956 --> 00:16:04.929
Heh. Yes. Eager to
do you quite proud, sir!

00:16:04.962 --> 00:16:07.869
Aw. Well, you've been
very patient.

00:16:07.902 --> 00:16:09.271
Go on then, I suppose.

00:16:09.304 --> 00:16:11.743
Collect their energy
like a good little boy.

00:16:11.776 --> 00:16:14.682
Right! Just leave it to me!

00:16:14.715 --> 00:16:16.519
[neck cracks]

00:16:18.624 --> 00:16:19.525
[exhales]

00:16:19.558 --> 00:16:21.729
Good heavens.
Where's my mind gone?

00:16:21.763 --> 00:16:26.004
Here I am, idling away while
precious energy grows cold.

00:16:31.048 --> 00:16:32.483
Come along, Dabura.

00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:35.423
We needn't watch the battle
to know how it will turn out.

00:16:35.456 --> 00:16:37.426
No. We don't.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:47.781
[electric motor hums]

00:16:48.816 --> 00:16:50.987
[chuckles]
Good of you all to come.

00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:53.059
Welcome to Stage One,
my friends.

00:16:53.092 --> 00:16:54.896
Uh, what's he talking about?

00:16:54.929 --> 00:16:56.465
Yeah. What do you mean?

00:16:56.498 --> 00:16:58.235
[PUIPUI] Between you
and the bottom floor

00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:00.206
where Babidi's waiting
are a number of stages

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:01.442
you'll have to pass through.

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:03.446
Each one more harrowing
than the one above.

00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:05.450
Naturally enough,
this is the first stage;

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:07.822
but don't let
the designation fool you.

00:17:08.389 --> 00:17:10.126
If you expect
to pass this stage,

00:17:10.159 --> 00:17:11.663
you'll have to get through me.

00:17:11.696 --> 00:17:13.498
And I promise it won't be easy.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:16.840
So, say hello to the guy who's
gonna wipe the floor with you!

00:17:16.873 --> 00:17:20.647
[laughs intensely]

00:17:21.683 --> 00:17:23.218
Uh. Yeah.

00:17:23.252 --> 00:17:25.389
I think you might be in
for a little surprise there.

00:17:25.423 --> 00:17:27.728
[PUIPUI] Wha--?
[BABIDI] Hmmm.

00:17:34.107 --> 00:17:37.246
[BABIDI laughs]

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.605
Ah? Wha--? How the--?

00:17:49.639 --> 00:17:52.310
Just one injection and
the meter goes haywire?

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:55.550
Can we already have
half the energy that we need?

00:17:55.584 --> 00:17:57.153
Is something wrong?

00:17:57.186 --> 00:17:58.924
[BABIDI]
Mmm.

00:17:58.957 --> 00:18:00.727
I'm simply questioning
whether I may have

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.067
underestimated Spopovitch
and Yamu's work ethic.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.107
Well. They did
get the job done, sir.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.745
Ugh. If they could
gather this much energy

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:13.385
in such a short time, clearly it
was hasty of me to dismiss them.

00:18:13.418 --> 00:18:15.991
Really ought to have
thought that through.

00:18:16.025 --> 00:18:17.226
[chuckles]

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.532
Bah. I wouldn't
worry too much.

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:21.434
Something tells me
the three onboard

00:18:21.468 --> 00:18:23.506
will turn out to be
quite a windfall.

00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:25.109
Once leeched
of their life-force,

00:18:25.142 --> 00:18:26.613
we'll be just shy of our goal.

00:18:26.646 --> 00:18:29.117
In fact, it wouldn't
surprise me to see Majin Buu

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.690
fully restored
by this time tomorrow.

00:18:31.723 --> 00:18:32.858
[laughs]

00:18:32.892 --> 00:18:36.198
Genius of me to have
the trio ensnared, wasn't it?

00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:38.737
Indeed. Shall we look in
on our valued guests

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:42.243
and see if PuiPui has made short
work of their confidence yet?

00:18:42.277 --> 00:18:45.684
Come, Dabura.
Let's have a gander.

00:18:45.717 --> 00:18:49.290
[GOHAN, GOKU, VEGETA]
And, go! And, go! And, go!

00:18:49.324 --> 00:18:51.262
[BABIDI]
What? What is this nonsense?

00:18:51.295 --> 00:18:52.464
They should be fighting!

00:18:52.497 --> 00:18:54.802
[GOHAN, GOKU, VEGETA]
And, go! And, go!

00:18:54.836 --> 00:18:58.510
And, go! And, go! And, go!

00:18:58.543 --> 00:19:03.586
And, go! And, go!
And, go! And, go!

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:08.128
Aah. Wha--? What do these
dolts think they're playing at?

00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:10.266
[GOHAN, GOKU, VEGETA]
And, go! And, go! And, go!

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.972
And, go! And, go! And, go!

00:19:13.005 --> 00:19:15.176
[chuckles]
Guess it's me.

00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:17.280
Well. You beat us
fair and square.

00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:20.252
Yes. This clown
will rue the day.

00:19:20.286 --> 00:19:22.357
[SUPREME KAI] Excuse me.
Surely you don't mean

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.695
to take him one-on-one, do you?

00:19:24.728 --> 00:19:28.604
Of course I do.
This isn't a battle royale.

00:19:28.637 --> 00:19:29.906
[gasps]

00:19:29.939 --> 00:19:32.143
[laughs]

00:19:32.176 --> 00:19:33.613
Hard to believe on
the way up here

00:19:33.647 --> 00:19:35.617
I was starting to get a bit
worried that the three of you

00:19:35.651 --> 00:19:38.690
just might give me
a run for my money.

00:19:38.723 --> 00:19:41.328
This'll be so easy
I'm liable to get bored!

00:19:41.362 --> 00:19:44.000
Your master was a fool
to send you here alone.

00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:47.575
Then again, I suppose I can't
blame him for his ignorance.

00:19:47.608 --> 00:19:50.112
How could he know the strongest
warrior in the universe

00:19:50.145 --> 00:19:52.150
could come calling
at his doorstep?

00:19:52.183 --> 00:19:54.822
You? The strongest
in the universe?

00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:56.926
[laughs]

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.468
It's gonna take a lot more
than that to psych me out!

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:05.443
You see! One cannot
underestimate a wizard!

00:20:05.476 --> 00:20:07.480
Babidi's taste
in henchmen is impeccable;

00:20:07.514 --> 00:20:09.350
he gathers only
the strongest warriors

00:20:09.383 --> 00:20:11.154
and bends their will
to his own!

00:20:11.187 --> 00:20:12.624
Aw, don't worry.

00:20:12.658 --> 00:20:15.697
Vegeta's handled worse than this
plenty of times, trust me.

00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:18.469
Are you sure?

00:20:18.503 --> 00:20:21.542
Abandon all hope
of escape, my friends. Ha!

00:20:21.575 --> 00:20:23.412
Every single one
of my attacks that hits home

00:20:23.445 --> 00:20:26.753
will siphon your energy into
the walls of this chamber.

00:20:26.786 --> 00:20:28.355
Where it will be
channeled straight into

00:20:28.388 --> 00:20:30.594
the hermetic sphere
of Majin Buu's slumber!

00:20:30.627 --> 00:20:32.665
And what if none of
your attacks hit home?

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:35.303
'Cause what I'm hearing you say
is if I take no damage,

00:20:35.336 --> 00:20:37.139
you get no energy.
That right?

00:20:37.173 --> 00:20:38.877
[PUIPUI]
Oh, you'll take damage.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.947
I don't know the kind of trash
you're used to fighting,

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.021
but I can guarantee you've
never gone toe-to-toe

00:20:44.054 --> 00:20:45.658
with someone like me!

00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:46.726
[laughs]

00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:49.497
The more you talk,
the less I hear.

00:20:51.702 --> 00:20:54.107
Stop yammering
and just throw a punch.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.211
I'm in a hurry
to get this over with.

This Vegeta has
no idea what he's in for.

[BOTH chuckle]

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.894
Oh dear.

[NARRATOR] Within Babidi's
tightly sealed lair,

00:21:31.849 --> 00:21:34.988
the battle for Stage One
is about to begin!

00:21:35.022 --> 00:21:36.759
Is Vegeta up to the task?

00:21:36.792 --> 00:21:39.831

Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:47.668 --> 00:22:50.472
Man, I can't believe Vegeta
gets to be the first one up.

00:22:50.507 --> 00:22:52.678
I've been itching
for a fight all day!

I sincerely wish you people

00:22:54.515 --> 00:22:56.853
wouldn't take
our dilemma so lightly.

[GOKU] Next time
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:23:04.534 --> 00:23:06.606
[GOHAN] Wow. I don't think
I'll ever get used to seeing

00:23:06.639 --> 00:23:09.511
how powerful Dad and Vegeta are.
