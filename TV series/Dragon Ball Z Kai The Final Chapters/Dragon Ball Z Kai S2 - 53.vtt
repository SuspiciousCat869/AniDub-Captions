than Fusion, too!

00:12:51.142 --> 00:12:53.747
This nifty little maneuver
has long been a secret weapon

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.483
for all us Supreme Kais.

00:12:55.517 --> 00:12:57.387
It has? I didn't know that.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.990
[ELDER KAI] Sheesh,
do they teach you youngsters

00:12:59.024 --> 00:13:00.426
anything these days?

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.730
No wonder you're
such a weakling,

00:13:01.763 --> 00:13:03.465
despite being a Supreme Kai!

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:05.570
[SUPREME KAI] Kibito,
did you know about this?

00:13:05.604 --> 00:13:06.840
[KIBITO]
No, sir.

00:13:06.874 --> 00:13:08.142
See for yourselves.

00:13:08.175 --> 00:13:09.979
Give it a try using
your own Potara earrings.

00:13:10.013 --> 00:13:11.649
[SUPREME KAI] Okay, Kibito,
let's give it a shot.

00:13:11.683 --> 00:13:14.187
You take off your left earring
and I'll remove my right one.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.526
--Understand?
--Yes, sir.

00:13:24.676 --> 00:13:28.048
[ELDER KAI chuckles]

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:36.198
[KIBITO KAI gasping]

00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:41.609
[laughing]
Amazing! So much power!

00:13:41.642 --> 00:13:44.147
Whoa! No way!

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.387
This is great! Now I can fight
side-by-side with you, Goku!

00:13:47.421 --> 00:13:49.559
Let's go to Earth and
show Buu what we've got!

00:13:49.592 --> 00:13:51.361
Hold on, don't get
too cocky now.

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:53.132
You may be twice
as strong as before,

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:55.169
but you weren't
all that much to begin with!

00:13:55.202 --> 00:13:57.174
If you go, you'll just
get absorbed by Buu.

00:13:57.207 --> 00:13:59.278
So might as well chill here.

00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:00.648
Okay.

00:14:00.681 --> 00:14:03.385
Wow, these are really
gonna come in handy, old-timer!

00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:07.327
So, once Gohan and I merge
together, how long will it last?

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.495
[ELDER KAI laughs]

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.734
The Potara don't have
that particular limitation.

00:14:10.768 --> 00:14:12.404
The merger lasts forever.

00:14:12.437 --> 00:14:15.142
There's no going back
to the way you were.

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:17.615
Did you say no going back?

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.017
Well, that's
something different.

00:14:19.051 --> 00:14:21.823
You mean, Gohan and I
will be fused forever?

00:14:21.857 --> 00:14:23.292
[ELDER KAI] If it were
possible to separate,

00:14:23.325 --> 00:14:25.531
don't you think
I'd have done it by now?

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:27.869
Wait. Are you saying
you merged with someone

00:14:27.902 --> 00:14:29.137
using the Potara?

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.576
[ELDER KAI]
It was a long, long time ago.

00:14:31.609 --> 00:14:34.381
You see, back then, I was
a handsome young thing.

00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:36.753
That is, until a
meddlesome witch snuck up

00:14:36.786 --> 00:14:39.091
and snatched one of
my Potara earrings.

00:14:39.124 --> 00:14:42.397
Well, what's this?
A boy wearing jewelry?

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.067
No, that's not right.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.204
Aah. It would look
so much better

00:14:46.238 --> 00:14:48.376
on a pretty girl like me.

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:49.579
[gasps]

00:14:49.612 --> 00:14:51.348
[BOTH holler]

00:14:53.085 --> 00:14:55.156
[ELDER KAI] And that's how
I wound up looking like this.

00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:57.360
Of course, it's also
why I can perform magic,

00:14:57.393 --> 00:14:59.899
like the kind you witnessed
earlier with Gohan.

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:02.170
If it's our only hope...

00:15:02.204 --> 00:15:03.907
Oh no, I just
realized something.

00:15:03.941 --> 00:15:05.911
After we get rid of Buu
and return Earth to normal,

00:15:05.944 --> 00:15:08.115
am I gonna have to
go to Gohan's school?

00:15:09.986 --> 00:15:19.538
[thudding]

00:15:32.096 --> 00:15:35.202
Hi there.
Are you ready to give up?

00:15:35.236 --> 00:15:37.875
[laughing]

00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:39.344
[GOHAN]
Damn you.

00:15:39.378 --> 00:15:41.315
[MR. SATAN] Hey, what's going on
down there? I can't tell.

00:15:41.348 --> 00:15:44.221
I'm not really sure.
But I think that Gohan's

00:15:44.254 --> 00:15:47.326
getting beaten up
pretty badly.

00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:52.971
[yells]

00:15:57.982 --> 00:16:00.754
[SUPER BUU yells]

00:16:16.318 --> 00:16:17.655
Gohan!

00:16:17.688 --> 00:16:20.093
[yelling, groans]

00:16:20.126 --> 00:16:23.232
Don't worry. I'll heal you!

00:16:26.839 --> 00:16:28.109
[SUPER BUU laughs]

00:16:28.142 --> 00:16:30.514
He's a real mess and
I'm starting to get bored.

00:16:30.547 --> 00:16:33.520
I think it's about time
I finish this.

00:16:33.553 --> 00:16:36.592
Huh? What's he doing?

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:41.201
You're all right!

00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:43.974
Thanks, Dende. I needed that!

00:16:44.007 --> 00:16:46.546
Can't be! He's regained
all of his strength.

00:16:46.579 --> 00:16:49.217
Who's the little pipsqueak
that helped him?

00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:51.856
Huh, his energy seems
unchanged from before.

00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:53.325
No power boost.

00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:54.227
[chuckles]

00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:56.032
Which means
he's just stretching out

00:16:56.065 --> 00:16:58.435
the time he'll suffer.

00:16:59.872 --> 00:17:03.145
[yells]

00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:09.223
Oh yeah. Can't forget
the little pipsqueak!

00:17:10.927 --> 00:17:12.831
Hey, look out!

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:16.639
Not to fear, I'll blast that
thing into a million pieces!

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:29.097
[SUPER BUU]
Huh?

00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:30.701
[MR. SATAN laughs]
How'd you like that?

00:17:30.734 --> 00:17:34.909
Oughta give you a taste of what
my hand canon is capable of!

00:17:34.942 --> 00:17:36.712
What's that?

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.014
Whoa, Tien!
Am I glad to see you!

00:17:54.047 --> 00:17:56.318
Gohan, it's you. I thought so.

00:17:56.351 --> 00:18:00.192
You've gotten much stronger.
Incredible. I'm impressed.

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:02.764
And I'm just as shocked
by how much Buu's changed.

00:18:02.798 --> 00:18:06.472
Ha! It seems there's another
meddling pest to deal with.

00:18:06.506 --> 00:18:09.745
Oh well, at least
pests are easy to kill!

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:20.834
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:37.701
Tri-Beam!
[yells]

00:18:46.953 --> 00:18:49.892
[SUPER BUU laughing]

00:18:49.926 --> 00:18:52.163
Nice try, but I
didn't feel a thing!

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:55.035
As I feared. We're on
completely different levels.

00:18:55.068 --> 00:18:57.642
I'm not gonna be
of any help here.

00:18:57.675 --> 00:19:00.981
Let's bring this
to an exciting conclusion.

00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:08.195
[laughing]

00:19:08.228 --> 00:19:10.332
This next blast
will wipe you out pest,

00:19:10.366 --> 00:19:11.569
and the whole Earth!

00:19:11.602 --> 00:19:14.374
Go ahead and try
to dodge it if you can!

00:19:14.407 --> 00:19:15.476
[gasps]

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.345
[gasps]

00:19:16.378 --> 00:19:18.850
Please forgive me, Majin Buu.

00:19:18.883 --> 00:19:20.854
I have to do this!

00:19:25.295 --> 00:19:28.435
Hey, wait. Do you think that
I should turn Super Saiyan

00:19:28.469 --> 00:19:31.509
before I use this Potara thingy
to merge with Gohan?

00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:34.248
No, best not to
strain yourself too much.

00:19:34.281 --> 00:19:36.018
When you merge with
the Potara earrings,

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:38.021
you'll remain in
that state permanently.

00:19:38.055 --> 00:19:41.529
That Super Saiyan thing you do
does a real number on your body.

00:19:41.563 --> 00:19:42.932
If you're stuck
like that for good,

00:19:42.965 --> 00:19:45.737
then you'll wind up shortening
your life significantly.

00:19:45.771 --> 00:19:46.706
[GOKU]
Gotcha.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.242
So, if you are gonna
turn Super Saiyan,

00:19:48.275 --> 00:19:51.081
just make sure you do it
after you meld with Gohan.

00:19:51.114 --> 00:19:52.918
Although, the power
of the Potara on its own

00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:55.557
should be more than enough
without resorting to gimmicks.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.961
Wow! I can't wait to try it!

00:19:57.995 --> 00:19:59.264
[ELDER KAI]
Oh yeah, one more thing.

00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:01.535
You can only use the Potara
once in your life.

00:20:01.569 --> 00:20:03.973
You can't use it over
and over again. Got it?

00:20:04.006 --> 00:20:05.109
[GOKU]
Hmm!

00:20:05.142 --> 00:20:06.646
You have to hurry, Goku!
This looks bad!

00:20:06.679 --> 00:20:09.184

destroy the planet!

you're right! I better go!

Huh?

Buu's body's been torn apart!

00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:11.474
And it's all because of me!
I'm so sorry, Buu!

00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:13.980
But you didn't
leave me any choice!

Ah, Buu! Please forgive me!
