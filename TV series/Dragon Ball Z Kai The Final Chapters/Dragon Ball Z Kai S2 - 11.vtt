most about this world is
the totally awesome food.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.390
So how come
you didn't eat?

You on a diet or somethin'?

00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:57.995
They should
be just a couple of

Hey. Is it just me,
or is that guy hovering?

00:10:34.635 --> 00:10:35.938
Good day to you.

00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.710
Do I have the pleasure
of addressing Goku?

00:10:38.744 --> 00:10:41.115
Uh. Yeah, but how do
you even know me?

00:10:41.148 --> 00:10:43.954
Oh, your reputation
proceeds you, I'd say.

00:10:43.987 --> 00:10:46.292
Many stories circulate
about your prowess

00:10:46.325 --> 00:10:48.463
both in and out of the ring.

00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:52.805
I've actually come here
to satisfy my curiosity.

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:54.976
I've passed the
preliminaries, like yourself,

00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:58.315
and hope the lineup will give
us the chance to compete.

00:10:58.717 --> 00:11:00.453
Don't worry,
I'm not foolish enough

00:11:00.486 --> 00:11:02.324
to think I could
defeat you.

00:11:02.357 --> 00:11:06.733
I only wish to know if all the
legends about you are true.

Come now.
Let us shake hands.

Excellent.

00:11:30.814 --> 00:11:34.220
Clearly you possess
a spirit worthy of legend.

00:11:36.025 --> 00:11:38.028
Good day.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:52.023
Who in the world
was that?

No clue.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.070
But y'know, meeting
someone like that has

00:11:59.104 --> 00:12:00.507
a funny way of
making me think that

00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:03.981
maybe this tournament
isn't a sure win after all.

I dunno, he doesn't
look all that tough to me.

Just some creep-a-zoid

around big words.

No.

[PICCOLO]
Well, whoever they are,

00:12:54.849 --> 00:12:56.251
why travel to
an out-of-the-way

cosmic outpost like this for
a friendly sparring match?

00:12:59.926 --> 00:13:01.796
Gohan. Help me out here.

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:04.034
What's with
all the sci-fi talk?

00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:06.539
Oh, it's just him.
Don't worry.

with a full deck.

I hear ya.

00:13:10.981 --> 00:13:13.921
No need to ask why he
paints himself green, then.

00:13:13.954 --> 00:13:16.058
Okay, so we can
all agree that was weird.

00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:17.393
But whatever,
let's get to the drawing

00:13:17.427 --> 00:13:19.197

us to the bottom.

Not a bad number.

writing home about, though.

[MONK 11E] Actually,
Mr. Satan's feeling

a little bit under the weather.

[GOLU]
Cool!

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:29.605
[GOKU] No partner
yet, though, huh?

00:19:29.639 --> 00:19:31.008
Wonder who it'll be.

00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:32.678
Videl, come on up!

00:19:32.711 --> 00:19:34.180
Here!

00:19:38.188 --> 00:19:39.926
Shouldn't Dad
be in charge of this?

00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:41.763
Oh, your father's
having a bit

00:19:41.796 --> 00:19:44.233
of a lie-down at the moment.

00:19:46.104 --> 00:19:46.973
Number five.

00:19:47.006 --> 00:19:47.974
Gohan!

00:19:48.008 --> 00:19:49.177
I totally didn't
know that was

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.682
Mr. Satan's daughter
over there!

00:19:52.283 --> 00:19:53.987
Oh yeah, that's right.

00:19:54.021 --> 00:19:55.422
Huh.

00:19:55.455 --> 00:19:57.226
Doesn't look very much like
her old man, now does she?

00:19:57.259 --> 00:19:59.197
That explains the way
you've been acting.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.402
Well, she's--
she's kinda cute.

00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:03.372
Dude, let me work my
magic and I guarantee you

00:20:03.405 --> 00:20:05.476
love birds will be on your
honeymoon in no time!

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.313
Whoa! What are
you talking about?

00:20:07.346 --> 00:20:09.417
It's not like that!
We're not even going out!

00:20:09.451 --> 00:20:11.355
[KRILLIN] Whatever.
Take it easy.

00:20:11.388 --> 00:20:13.993
Pintar.
Number Two.

00:20:15.564 --> 00:20:16.566
Oh yeah!

00:20:16.599 --> 00:20:18.703
Let's have a look at
the sap I'm gonna fight!

00:20:23.846 --> 00:20:25.082
[PINTAR chuckles]

00:20:25.115 --> 00:20:27.153
You the man
they call Krillin?

00:20:27.186 --> 00:20:28.523
Yep. That's me.

00:20:28.557 --> 00:20:29.992
Just a fair warning, chum:

00:20:30.025 --> 00:20:31.696
I don't take mercy
on pipsqueaks.

00:20:31.729 --> 00:20:35.203
You'll rue the day you ever
stepped into the ring with me!

00:20:35.236 --> 00:20:37.173
Meh. You're all talk.

00:20:37.206 --> 00:20:38.843
I've tangled with my
share of Chatty Kathies

00:20:38.876 --> 00:20:41.282
and they all go down
like a ton of bricks.

00:20:41.315 --> 00:20:43.185
This is gonna be easy.

00:20:43.218 --> 00:20:44.221
Whew.

00:20:44.254 --> 00:20:45.223
Why you!

00:20:45.256 --> 00:20:46.559
Watch yourself, short stuff!

00:20:46.592 --> 00:20:49.331
Nobody talks trash to
Pintar and gets away with it!

00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:51.603
Best write up your
last will and testament,

00:20:51.636 --> 00:20:53.840
'cause you'll wish you had!

00:20:54.173 --> 00:20:56.377
[ANNOUNCER]
Next up, Vegeta.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.365
Looks like you're
number twelve.

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:08.503
You gotta
be kidding me.

00:21:08.703 --> 00:21:11.108
[MONK 11C]
Number 12, Vegeta.

00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:12.209
Uh-oh!

00:21:12.243 --> 00:21:14.380
Things are about
to get really ugly.

00:21:14.414 --> 00:21:15.516
[VEGETA]
Perfect.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.491
Me and Kakarot,
exactly as I wanted.

00:21:19.525 --> 00:21:22.797
Oh, I've been waiting for this.

00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:25.035
Vegeta.

00:21:25.937 --> 00:21:28.375
[NARRATOR] Goku and Vegeta
are slated to meet in the

00:21:28.409 --> 00:21:31.281
first round of the World
Martial Arts Tournament!

00:21:31.315 --> 00:21:34.487
Will the arena still be
standing for round two?

00:21:34.521 --> 00:21:38.763
The competition commences,
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.366 --> 00:21:45.543
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:45.395 --> 00:22:46.733
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.766 --> 00:22:49.137
Awesome! My first
opponent's Vegeta!

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.544
I'm really gonna have to bring
my A-game for this one, huh?

00:22:52.577 --> 00:22:54.581
Hey, what's wrong
with you, Piccolo?

00:22:54.615 --> 00:22:55.984
[PICCOLO] Watch
yourself out there.

00:22:56.017 --> 00:22:58.823
Something about this Shin
character makes me uneasy.

00:22:58.856 --> 00:23:01.629
[GOKU] Next time
on Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:23:05.737 --> 00:23:09.511
[GOHAN] I've never
seen Piccolo so helpless.
