enter the tournament.

of the current champion

versus the child of the
previous champion?

wouldn't be exciting!

00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:33.185
And it's not like you
can't hold your own.

00:16:33.219 --> 00:16:35.389

monster unconscious.

who Great Saiyaman is.

it through the hall!

it out and no one

it's really you.

You're not giving me
much of a choice here.

00:16:58.637 --> 00:17:00.073
Okay! Then it's settled.

00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:02.009
I guess I'll be
seeing you in the ring!

00:17:02.043 --> 00:17:03.613
It'll be a blast, promise.

I want you to
teach me how to fly.

Can't be all that hard, right?

00:17:11.762 --> 00:17:14.033
Kinda bugs me that you
can do something I can't.

00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:15.336
Um. Okay?

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.572
Cool!

00:17:16.605 --> 00:17:18.008
You have no idea how much
I'm looking forward to this!

00:17:20.145 --> 00:17:23.118
All righty, then.
That went well.

Really...?

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:31.469
Interesting.

00:17:31.503 --> 00:17:32.905
Yeah.

00:17:32.939 --> 00:17:34.241
Well, um.

00:17:34.274 --> 00:17:36.044
Seems a little out of left
field coming from you.

00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:36.846
[GOHAN]
I know.

00:17:36.879 --> 00:17:37.948
Long story.

00:17:37.982 --> 00:17:39.485
I won't go into details,
but I sorta

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:41.522
promised Mr. Satan's
daughter I'd enter.

00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:43.893
Oh, wow. There's a
blast from the past.

00:17:43.927 --> 00:17:46.566
You mean that fool that showed
up during the Cell Games?

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:48.703
Pranced around like
a circus performer?

00:17:48.736 --> 00:17:51.441
I'm rather surprised to
hear the man had children.

00:17:51.474 --> 00:17:53.814
Huh. So I assume
that his daughter

00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:55.016
goes to school with you?

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:56.451
Sure, yeah.

00:17:56.484 --> 00:17:58.724
Though she's nothing like her
dad as far as I can tell.

00:17:58.757 --> 00:18:00.126
She can really fight!

00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:02.330
I've seen her take down
guys more than twice her size.

00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:05.704
But she only uses her powers
for good, so it's totally okay.

00:18:05.737 --> 00:18:07.508
We're a lot alike, actually.

00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:10.146
Anyway, the point is that she
found out who I am and

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.749
is threatening to
broadcast it unless

00:18:11.782 --> 00:18:13.920
I battle her in the tournament.

00:18:14.487 --> 00:18:17.127
[BULMA] Heard
you talk, didn't she?

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.430
It was bound to happen.

00:18:23.774 --> 00:18:26.646
Look, hon. As far as kids go,
you're pretty level headed,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.883
but you're still a chip
off your father's block.

00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:31.388
So we'll retool the helmet,
add a voice modulator,

00:18:31.421 --> 00:18:33.594
and voila: you're good to go.

00:18:33.627 --> 00:18:36.465
Well, except... there's
a rule about gear.

00:18:36.498 --> 00:18:38.670
Apparently they won't
let participants wear anything

00:18:38.703 --> 00:18:41.643
that could be used as padding,
so helmets are a big no-no.

00:18:41.676 --> 00:18:43.278
I was hoping we
could figure out some

00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:45.517
other way for me
to disguise myself.

00:18:45.551 --> 00:18:46.720
Any ideas?

00:18:46.753 --> 00:18:47.922
Ah...

00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:50.761
So, nothing that people might
assume is extra defense,

00:18:50.794 --> 00:18:53.933
but we still need to
hide that it's you.

00:18:58.209 --> 00:18:59.512
Actually, you know what?

00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:01.214
We don't even have to
go high-tech for this one;

00:19:01.247 --> 00:19:03.553
all we need is a
bit of camouflage.

00:19:04.087 --> 00:19:05.757
[GOHAN]
Aha!

00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:06.893
Of course!

00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:09.397
We could go for the "super
exotic stranger" vibe!

Trunks. What do ya think?

00:19:11.134 --> 00:19:12.904
Pretty cool, huh?

Leave me out of this.

00:19:15.476 --> 00:19:16.879
Close enough.
Still, though,

00:19:16.912 --> 00:19:19.384
can't be much fun for you,
taking part in some huge

know you're gonna win.

I've bridged the gap between us.

can't find a job.

them allergic to work.
