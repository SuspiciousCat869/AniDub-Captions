this hesitation

them into hard candy.

That's my Trunks.
He is Vegeta's son, after all.

As talented as they are,
maybe those children

they'd gotten this strong.

going all out, right?

Yep!

Well, I think.

[GOKU] Trunks, you seem to have
a little more energy than Goten.

[TRUNKS chuckles]

00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:56.579
But to do Fusion correctly,
you gotta align

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:59.384
your energy levels to
the exact same intensity.

00:15:59.484 --> 00:16:01.890
Trunks, I need you to bring
down your energy a hair

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.727
so it matches with Goten's.

00:16:03.827 --> 00:16:06.064
What? You want it weaker?

00:16:06.164 --> 00:16:08.970

See, this morning,
my boys were running fevers.

00:20:19.972 --> 00:20:23.379
I told them to stay in bed, but
they're so brave and strong.

00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:25.249
Unfortunately,
Trunks took advantage

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:26.719
of their handicaps
and beat them!

00:20:26.819 --> 00:20:28.790
Otherwise, there's no way
in heck they'd have lost!

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.996
Shut up! I appreciate
the info, but if I hear

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:33.700
another word
in your grating voice,

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.205
I will personally fly on over
to your living room

00:20:36.305 --> 00:20:37.842
and pulverize you.

00:20:37.942 --> 00:20:39.444
[screams]
That's not fair!

00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:41.850
After I told you where
he lives and everything!

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.052
[yells]

00:20:43.152 --> 00:20:45.757
It's driving me crazy!

00:20:46.425 --> 00:20:48.395
Next, both of you
raise your energy levels

00:20:48.496 --> 00:20:50.934
as high as they'll go while
staying in your normal forms.

00:20:51.034 --> 00:20:53.172
I worry that attempting
Fusion as Super Saiyans

00:20:53.272 --> 00:20:55.309
right out of the gate
will be too risky.

00:20:55.409 --> 00:20:56.679
[BABIDI]
People of Earth!

00:20:56.779 --> 00:20:58.750
[ALL gasp]

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.121
[BABIDI] I've received a
critical piece of information

00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:03.492
about one of those
cowards-at-large.

00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:05.463
Of the three hooligans
I'm looking for,

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:07.400
it seems the boy fighter
known as Trunks

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.739
lives in a building with
the rather unique name

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:13.411
of "Capsule Corporation"
in West City.

00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:15.718
I think we'll stop by.

00:21:15.818 --> 00:21:18.155
Consider this my call
letting you know.

00:21:18.255 --> 00:21:19.958
Buu and I hope to
see you there, Trunks.

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:23.599
If you're not, West City will be
the next one Buu chews up.

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:24.735
Literally!

00:21:24.835 --> 00:21:26.706
[NARRATOR] As if Babidi
and Majin Buu's attacks

00:21:26.806 --> 00:21:29.043
weren't bad enough,
the villains now know

00:21:29.143 --> 00:21:30.947
Trunks lives in West City!

00:21:31.047 --> 00:21:33.352
Trunks and Goten
must continue their training

00:21:33.452 --> 00:21:37.260
to master Fusion, as time
runs out to save Earth!

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.765
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.233 --> 00:21:45.409
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:45.262 --> 00:22:46.464
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:48.435
Things have gone
from bad to worse,

00:22:48.537 --> 00:22:50.239
with Babidi finding out
the location

00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:51.542
of the Capsule Corporation.

00:22:51.642 --> 00:22:53.445
[BULMA] Goku, we have
no margin for error!

00:22:53.546 --> 00:22:55.884
If the Dragon Radar gets
destroyed, we won't be able

00:22:55.984 --> 00:22:58.389
to bring all the people
Buu killed back to life!

00:22:58.489 --> 00:23:00.794
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:23:00.894 --> 00:23:04.401
"Hold Majin Buu in Check!
Limit! Super Saiyan 3!"

00:23:04.502 --> 00:23:05.837
[GOHAN] We need to do
whatever it takes

00:23:05.937 --> 00:23:08.809
to slow down Buu while
they find the Dragon Radar.
