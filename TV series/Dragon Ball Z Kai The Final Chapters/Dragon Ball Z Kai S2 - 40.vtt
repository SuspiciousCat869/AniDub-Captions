00:09:43.415 --> 00:09:45.255
--[GOKU] Uuuh...
--[ELDER KAI hollers]

00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:50.703
[ELDER KAI continues]

00:10:04.177 --> 00:10:06.618
[GOKU]
Uh, hey. So, uh... Listen.

00:10:06.718 --> 00:10:09.326
How long you think
this is gonna take?

00:10:09.426 --> 00:10:10.964
Five hours for this part,

00:10:11.064 --> 00:10:13.906
then it'll take another
20 hours for the power-up.

00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:15.043
[GOHAN shrieks]

00:10:15.144 --> 00:10:16.815
[GOKU chuckles nervously]

00:10:16.915 --> 00:10:20.158
Well, in that case, I think
I might as well go take a nap.

00:10:20.259 --> 00:10:22.332
Hang in there, son!
You got this!

00:10:22.432 --> 00:10:24.705
Wish I could nap.

00:10:27.915 --> 00:10:32.930
[hollers]

00:10:37.778 --> 00:10:41.289
So, it would look bad
if we didn't stay awake

00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:43.261
for this whole ceremony, right?

00:10:43.361 --> 00:10:45.902
Yes, sir. Probably would.

00:10:46.002 --> 00:10:48.109
This... sucks.

00:10:48.644 --> 00:10:52.087
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Fu...sion! Ha!

00:10:52.188 --> 00:10:55.364
Fu...sion! Ha!

00:10:55.464 --> 00:10:57.237
All right. That was good.

00:10:57.337 --> 00:10:59.042
I think you've got it,
more or less.

00:10:59.142 --> 00:11:00.580
[BOTH groan]

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.817
It's time for a trial run

00:11:01.917 --> 00:11:03.789
to see if you can
do this for real.

00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:07.635
Now, both of you make
your energy exactly the same.

00:11:07.735 --> 00:11:09.507
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
'Kay!

00:11:09.607 --> 00:11:11.445
[TRUNKS] After all this,
am I really gonna be able

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.020
to merge with Goten?
I kinda doubt it.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.929
I mean, the whole thing
seems pretty far-fetched.

00:11:17.029 --> 00:11:19.369
Okay. Let's gooo!

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.640
[BOTH]
Yeah!

00:11:31.472 --> 00:11:33.512
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]

--[OOLONG grunting]
--[YAMCHA] Hey!

00:11:43.074 --> 00:11:44.176
[YAMCHA]
Guess what.

00:11:44.278 --> 00:11:45.649
Looks like the boys
are about ready

00:11:45.749 --> 00:11:47.688
to actually give
this Fusion thing a try.

00:11:47.788 --> 00:11:49.694
You mean they're
finally done training?

00:11:49.794 --> 00:11:52.736
[KRILLIN chuckles]
Let's go check it out!

00:11:55.745 --> 00:11:58.419
[OOLONG grunts]
Dang it!

00:11:58.521 --> 00:11:59.891
[YAMCHA]
They're gonna do it outside.

00:11:59.991 --> 00:12:01.462
Can't have 'em blowing up
the palace if they release

00:12:01.563 --> 00:12:03.836
some big mega-burst
of energy when they fuse.

00:12:03.936 --> 00:12:05.809
If they manage to merge,
they'll supposedly form

00:12:05.909 --> 00:12:08.283
some kind of ridiculously
powerful super-warrior,

00:12:08.383 --> 00:12:10.923
but I can't imagine what they'll
look like mixed up together.

00:12:11.024 --> 00:12:13.599
Eh, those two lads already
look pretty much the same to me,

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.307
so they probably won't look
all that different combined.

00:12:16.407 --> 00:12:17.578
[laughs]
What if they come out

00:12:17.678 --> 00:12:19.684
all muscle-y like
a bulked-up macho man?

00:12:19.784 --> 00:12:21.154
What about their name?

00:12:21.255 --> 00:12:23.596
What are we gonna call 'em
after they fuse together?

00:12:23.696 --> 00:12:26.671
They're Goten and Trunks,
so would it be "Gotenks"?

00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:29.647
Or maybe it would be
"Trunten"? Oh my.

00:12:29.747 --> 00:12:32.389
Either way, it's gonna be
quite a jumbled-up mouthful.

00:12:32.489 --> 00:12:33.826
What are you worrying about?

00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:35.565
Once they merge,
they're only supposed to

00:12:35.665 --> 00:12:37.068
stay like that for 30 minutes.

00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:39.175
So, does it really even matter
what their name is?

00:12:39.276 --> 00:12:42.217
Yeah, but... how 'bout
when we call them for dinner?

00:12:45.962 --> 00:12:48.168
Oh. They're getting started now!

00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:08.329
Now, Trunks,
restrain your energy a little.

00:13:08.429 --> 00:13:11.606
This is pretty tough, huh?

00:13:11.706 --> 00:13:13.612
All right. That's better now.

00:13:13.712 --> 00:13:15.652
You've got your
energies lined up.

00:13:15.752 --> 00:13:18.760
Now, it's time.
Begin the Fusion!

00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:26.082
It's happening!

00:13:30.227 --> 00:13:33.070
[GOTEN]
Hm!

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.480

[BOTH gasp]

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.123
[KRILLIN]
Uuh?!

00:14:08.877 --> 00:14:11.317
[PICCOLO]
Eeh! Ugheh!

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.492
Uh... So..?

00:14:13.593 --> 00:14:15.497
[YAMCHA]
Is that it?

00:14:15.598 --> 00:14:20.780
So, are we sure they can
change back to normal again?

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.020
Even a mother
couldn't love that face.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.292
Is that the hero
Goku promised would be

00:14:25.393 --> 00:14:29.439
our last hope to defeat
Majin Buu and save the world?

00:14:31.513 --> 00:14:35.424
[KRILLIN] 'Cause I gotta say,
he doesn't really look like it.

00:14:35.525 --> 00:14:36.961
But he must be, right?

00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:39.703
A-ha! I get it now!

00:14:39.804 --> 00:14:42.946
[laughs]
Goku, you crazy rascal, you!

00:14:43.046 --> 00:14:45.822
Who better to
beat a blob like Buu?

00:14:45.922 --> 00:14:48.830
What do you think
he's about to do?

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.343
[yells, grunts]

00:14:53.444 --> 00:14:55.518
[YAMCHA]
I think he's starting to run.

00:15:04.678 --> 00:15:06.450
[panting]

00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:08.691
[ALL]
Aah!

00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:12.603
[ROSHI] A-ha. Well,
this was a total bust.

00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:13.739
[PICCOLO]
I figured.

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:16.815
--Kids, pay attention.
--Huh?!

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:19.021
This happened 'cause
when you said "--sion,"

00:15:19.121 --> 00:15:20.727
Trunks had
his fingers sticking out.

00:15:20.827 --> 00:15:24.572
But at that part, both of you
are supposed to be making fists.

00:15:24.672 --> 00:15:27.514
Hm. See?

00:15:27.614 --> 00:15:29.654
Okay? Got it?

00:15:30.421 --> 00:15:33.363
[PICCOLO] All right.
Let's try this again.

00:15:35.203 --> 00:15:37.644
Well? Go on and change back!

00:15:37.744 --> 00:15:40.485
[grunts]
So how do I do that?

00:15:40.586 --> 00:15:42.525
Ah!

00:15:44.062 --> 00:15:47.540
[grunts]
We've got no choice.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.180
We'll just have to wait
for 30 minutes to pass.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.526
[KRILLIN] This is crazy!
You're not Trunks or Goten!

00:15:53.626 --> 00:15:54.862
What gives?

00:15:54.962 --> 00:15:57.269
[ROSHI] How'd you get
that strange new outfit?

00:15:57.369 --> 00:16:00.244
[VIDEL] So, what happened
to Goten and Trunks?

00:16:00.344 --> 00:16:02.886
[GOTENKS]
Uh. Ah. Uhh...

00:16:02.987 --> 00:16:04.423
[YAMCHA]
Do you have a name, big guy?

00:16:04.525 --> 00:16:05.962
Yeah, Gotenks.

00:16:06.062 --> 00:16:10.407
Aah! You see?
So it is Gotenks after all!

00:16:12.816 --> 00:16:14.152

Thirty minutes has passed.

00:16:14.252 --> 00:16:16.392

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.137
I don't know.

00:16:31.237 --> 00:16:32.909
Oh, come on guys;
what'd it feel like?

00:16:33.009 --> 00:16:34.648
When you two merged?

00:16:34.748 --> 00:16:37.355
So you can't remember,
is that what you're saying?

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:38.627
Uh-huh.

Right now,
every little second counts.

He hasn't even
done anything yet

00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:33.558
and already he looks exhausted.

00:17:33.658 --> 00:17:35.530
[PICCOLO] Ugh! This time,
at "Ha!" your fingers

00:17:35.632 --> 00:17:37.937
weren't lined up
correctly. Go again!

Well, in 30 minutes, of course.

00:17:52.749 --> 00:17:54.554
Okay. It's time!

00:17:54.655 --> 00:17:56.660

of the warrior who will
defeat Majin Buu!

Whoa! That was
some energy blast!

00:18:40.391 --> 00:18:42.296
And it worked!
It actually worked!

I can't believe it!

Incredible!

I'm no expert,
but it does seem like

00:18:46.745 --> 00:18:48.817
the boys did a pretty good
job this time.

00:18:48.917 --> 00:18:51.390
Well, judging by his appearance,
he does look stronger.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.163
Yeah, he does! Even I can tell

00:18:53.263 --> 00:18:55.302
he's rocking some
out-of-this-world power!

at him; he's amazing!

[PICCOLO]
Ha! You finally got it right.

00:19:00.585 --> 00:19:02.256
Now we just have
to wait 30 minutes

00:19:02.356 --> 00:19:04.932
so you can do it again,
this time at Super Saiyan.

Uh, uh, uh!

my awesomeness!

now to wipe the floor

with that Buu guy!

You fool! What are you saying?

00:19:14.459 --> 00:19:16.399
You don't know the first
thing about Majin Buu.

00:19:16.499 --> 00:19:17.937
Or how fierce he can be!

I don't care how much
stronger you've grown,

you're still no match
for that beast!

00:19:21.682 --> 00:19:25.594
Trust me. You're simply
not ready to face him yet!

Fine. Doubt me.
I'll just have to show you.

00:19:32.648 --> 00:19:34.922
Show you Buu's
dead body, that is!

00:19:35.022 --> 00:19:36.559

Almost Piccolo; it's Gotenks.

Aha! Buu's over there.

00:19:46.656 --> 00:19:48.227
And close enough
for me to whoop his butt

00:19:48.327 --> 00:19:50.000
and still make it
back to the Lookout

Wow! He's so fast!

[PICCOLO] That arrogant punk!
If he gets himself killed,

all our hopes for survival
will die with him!

00:20:03.942 --> 00:20:05.982
Well, this combo kid
may be a little bit cocky,

00:20:06.082 --> 00:20:07.720
but Goku was sure
he'd be strong enough,

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.793
so maybe this isn't
a total disaster.

00:20:09.893 --> 00:20:11.597
That's right.
Seemed pretty certain.

00:20:11.698 --> 00:20:14.606

something we don't.

You have a nice

Hey, Supreme Kai, how goes it?

00:20:46.771 --> 00:20:49.378
Hm? Where's Gohan at?
Is he all powered-up

00:20:49.478 --> 00:20:52.453
and finished with
that silly ceremony yet?

You weren't out long.
It's only been two hours.

00:21:03.989 --> 00:21:05.292
So, we've got at
least another three

You're so not helping.

The boys' Fusion was a success.

However, only time
will tell if Gohan can also

power up using the supernatural
gift of the Supreme Kai

The good news is, you've got
Fusion down perfectly.

The bad news is, it may have
