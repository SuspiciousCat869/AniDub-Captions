[NARRATOR] The seven
magic Dragon Balls--

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:10.420
when brought together,

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:13.427
they hold the power
to grant any wish.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.332
Goku, a Saiyan
exile raised on Earth,

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.804
has prevented the
Dragon Balls from falling

00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:21.576
into evil hands
time and time again.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.219
Pitting himself against a host
of increasingly powerful foes.

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:28.423
But it was only
when he faced the

00:00:28.456 --> 00:00:32.699
seemingly invincible
galactic tyrant, Frieza...

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:36.038

beyond the edge of his limits,

a legendary Super Saiyan!

[NARRATOR] After a
hard-fought battle,

00:01:12.144 --> 00:01:14.516
Goku defeated Frieza at last,

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.321
preserving peace
for his adopted home.

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:20.360
However, it was only
a matter of time before a

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:23.901
new crisis cast its
shadow over the earth.

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:24.903
[FRIEZA]
Huh?

00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:27.575
[TRUNKS yells]

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.590
Dr. Gero's Androids
were awakened to wreak

00:01:34.623 --> 00:01:37.028
their creator's revenge
on the planet.

00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:38.964
The mightiest of them, Cell,

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.035
evolved to the
point of perfection,

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.339
and challenged the
earth's strongest warriors

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:47.180
to a contest to decide
the fate of humanity.

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:49.854

[NARRATOR]
Goku put up a fierce fight,

00:02:09.993 --> 00:02:12.866
but in the end,
it wasn't enough.

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.805
Time for you
to take over, Gohan.

00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:20.815
[NARRATOR] Turning his
gaze to the future,

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:24.723
Goku entrusted the battle
to his young son, Gohan.

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:30.400
However, for a time, it seemed
Goku's trust was misplaced.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.138
[CELL]
What are you waiting for, huh?

00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:34.041
Come on. Surprise me.

Stop wasting my time
with this pitiful act.

00:02:36.747 --> 00:02:37.683

Gohan.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.215
There are some foes
who cannot be reasoned with.

00:02:54.248 --> 00:02:57.890
You are allowed to
fight on the side of justice.

00:02:57.923 --> 00:02:59.693
Seize upon your anger.

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:00.995
Wield it like a weapon.

00:03:01.028 --> 00:03:05.805
I understand your reluctance
but holding it in is pointless.

00:03:09.378 --> 00:03:13.286
It's time to can it,

[GOHAN bellows]

a being who
had reached out to him

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.873
in friendship, something
in Gohan gave way.

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:43.146
His anger erupted,
unleashing a hidden power

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.183
he used to overwhelm Cell.

00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:47.221
Realizing he
could no longer win,

00:03:47.254 --> 00:03:49.157
Cell planned to blow himself up,

00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:51.162
taking out the earth
in the process.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:52.999
But Goku intervened,

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:56.205
at the cost of his own life.

00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:58.610
Goodbye, Gohan.

Wha-- What is wrong with you?

You can't bring that guy here!

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:10.735
Sorry, King Kai.

00:04:10.768 --> 00:04:11.603
I had no choice.

00:04:11.636 --> 00:04:13.608
I'm kind of short on options.

Gohan tapped into
his hidden power

and destroyed every last speck

of the resurrected Cell,
defeating him once and for all.

00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:23.212
With Cell gone, the threat of

been eliminated.

Seven years have passed
since the fight with Cell.

After his fiendish plans were
thwarted by Goku and Gohan,

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:24.722
the people of Earth have enjoyed
a return to peaceful life,

blissfully unaware of
who it was that actually

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:29.699
saved them from
the Android menace.

00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:32.671
However, with peace
comes complacency,

00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:34.676
and once the people
are complacent,

it's never too long
before the criminal element

from a child of nine
into a young man of 16.

00:08:21.736 --> 00:08:24.843
Though he's been studying at
home via correspondence courses,

00:08:24.877 --> 00:08:26.981
his mother Chi-Chi
is concerned that it

won't be enough
education in the long run.

00:08:29.752 --> 00:08:32.758
And so, from this day forward,
it's been decided that

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:37.033
Gohan will attend
high school in Satan City.

00:08:38.537 --> 00:08:39.772

the one who saved
the planet from Cell.

'Cause of that, he's a bigger
deal now than ever before.

00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:08.764
They even changed the name
of the town to "Satan City"

00:09:08.797 --> 00:09:12.103
in his honor, since
this is where he lives.

make a break for it!

Hey, Sharpner.

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:03.279
If you're the Golden Warrior,
you should just confess already.

00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:04.915
Sorry, I'm not your guy.

00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:08.322
Besides, I spend my mornings
in the gym, working out.

I don't have time to go
playing hero all over town.

Whoa, wait a sec.

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:15.537
what if this guy is
stronger than your dad?

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.940
Don't be dumb!

00:12:16.973 --> 00:12:19.746
Mr. Satan saved the planet
from that alien years ago!

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.248

stronger than him,

Good morning, class.

00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:32.838
We have a transfer student
joining us, and today is

00:12:32.872 --> 00:12:35.878
his very first day at
Orange Star High School.

00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:37.982
Don't be shy, son.

00:12:39.552 --> 00:12:41.155
Uh, that'd be me.

00:12:41.188 --> 00:12:42.156
So, uh.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.393
I'm Gohan.

00:12:43.426 --> 00:12:44.596
Pleasure to meet you.

Ah! This new
kid's pretty hot.

I sure hope he
likes blondes!

What kind of a name is Gohan?

00:12:53.312 --> 00:12:56.218
Seems like I've
seen this guy before.

be the mayor.

00:13:09.612 --> 00:13:10.815
everything, basically.

That's quite enough!

00:13:13.352 --> 00:13:16.292
I hope he'll inspire some of
you to try harder for a change.

00:13:16.325 --> 00:13:18.597
Now, just go ahead
and take a seat Gohan.

Hi, I'm Gohan.

00:13:56.338 --> 00:13:58.977
Nice to meetcha, Gohan.
I'm Erasa.

00:13:59.011 --> 00:14:00.748
And the sourpuss
behind me is Videl.

00:14:02.317 --> 00:14:03.119
Y'know what?

00:14:03.152 --> 00:14:04.856
Videl's kind of a celebrity!

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:06.960
Her dad is a really big deal!

00:14:06.993 --> 00:14:08.930
Would you believe
she's Mr. Satan's kid?

00:14:08.963 --> 00:14:12.705
What? Like
"Satan City" Mr. Satan?

00:14:12.738 --> 00:14:14.374
Uh-huh!
Isn't that crazy?

00:14:14.408 --> 00:14:16.044
Hey, is she pulling
my leg, Videl?

00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:18.249
'Cause if he really is your
dad, that's pretty amazing.

Aw, c'mon Gohan,
I'm telling you the truth!

00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:22.625
If it weren't for her
old man, none of us

00:14:22.658 --> 00:14:24.194
would even be around right now!

00:14:24.227 --> 00:14:25.463
He's a hero!

00:14:25.496 --> 00:14:27.267
You were the guy, huh?!

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.004
You're the guy I saw
at the bank when they

00:14:29.037 --> 00:14:31.375
caught those robbers
this morning, aren't you?

00:14:31.408 --> 00:14:32.343
Uh... I guess.

00:14:32.377 --> 00:14:33.814
Wow! You didn't see
the Golden Warrior

00:14:33.847 --> 00:14:35.149
anywhere, didja?

00:14:35.182 --> 00:14:37.187
Hold on.
The Golden who now?

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.191
That someone I
should have heard of?

00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:41.763
Right, guess you wouldn'tve,
being the new kid.

00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:43.199
See, the Golden Warrior is some

00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:44.467
new crime fighter
who's shown up,

00:14:44.502 --> 00:14:46.906
like, three times now
over the last ten days

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.777
to put a few baddies
in their place.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.346
He's strong as an ox,
and they say he has

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.319
spiky golden blond hair, which
is where he gets the nickname.

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:54.856
[GOHAN] That's me
they're talking about!

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:56.158
The other two times were when I

00:14:56.191 --> 00:14:59.031
came into town
to register for school!

00:14:59.364 --> 00:15:01.368

Hmm.

I talked to one
of the witnesses.

00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:11.856
According to what he told me,
the Golden Warrior

00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:14.161
was wearing a badge
from this high school.

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:19.103
A white shirt with a black vest,
and brown slacks.

00:15:21.074 --> 00:15:23.145
[VIDEL] And you're wearing
the exact same stuff!

00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:24.616
--Huh?
--Yeah! What're the odds!

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:26.552
It's just a coincidence!

00:15:27.754 --> 00:15:29.424
Of course it's a coincidence!

What's he gonna do, hit
the criminals with his brain?

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:34.434
You heard the teacher--
he aced all his tests.

00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:37.474
New guy's a bookworm,
not some fearless hero-type.

00:15:37.508 --> 00:15:39.812
Plus he doesn't have
the right color hair.

00:15:39.845 --> 00:15:41.248
Yeah, I guess.

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:44.121
Gohan doesn't seem
like the fighting kind.

00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:45.891
[GOHAN] You don't know
the half of it!

00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:47.595
[laughs nervously]

00:15:47.628 --> 00:15:49.364
[VIDEL] He's too much
of a goofball to be

00:15:49.397 --> 00:15:52.137
the Golden Warrior, of
course, but I do remember

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.642
seeing those guys on Dad's old
video of the fight with Cell

00:15:54.675 --> 00:15:57.648
whose hair changed from
dark to blond all at once.

00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:00.153
Dad just said it was
some kinda trick, though.

00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:01.822
[ERASA] So, tell me
more about yourself!

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.259
Are you staying
in town for school,

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:05.430
or are you gonna go
back and forth every day?

00:16:05.463 --> 00:16:06.365
Yeah.

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:07.802
I'll be commuting
in every morning.

00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:09.271
How far out do you live, anyway?

00:16:09.304 --> 00:16:12.611
Well, have you ever heard
of Section 439 East?

00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:13.747
That's where I'm at.

00:16:13.781 --> 00:16:15.249
Huh?

00:16:15.282 --> 00:16:17.353
How are you coming here all
the way from Section 439 East?

00:16:17.387 --> 00:16:19.659

What time did you
leave home this morning?

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:28.175
Even if you took a jet-flyer,
that's, like, five hours away!

00:16:28.208 --> 00:16:29.444
Really, that long?

00:16:29.478 --> 00:16:31.616
Maybe I was so excited
to be transferring in,

00:16:31.649 --> 00:16:33.052
I just didn't notice!

00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:35.055

gonna play some more baseball.

Hey. You a
baseball genius, too?

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:50.588
Well, I've never actually
played it, so probably not.

00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:51.856
You're kidding, right?

00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:54.327
Course you haven't.

If they can't teach
it in a book,

first thing about it.

Have fun getting the
new kid up to speed, Videl.

So what if he doesn't
know how to play?

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.316
He's so smart, he'll
probably come up with

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:07.889
some real good
strategies we can use!

00:17:08.156 --> 00:17:10.861
In that case, fine.

00:17:10.894 --> 00:17:12.297
You take right field.

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:13.934
You do know which way is right?

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:14.769
Nope.

00:17:14.802 --> 00:17:16.371

sign on for this.

if people find out the
truth about me,

it's gonna ruin any chance
I have of fitting in here.

actually touching the base.

If I throw the ball
to the third baseman,

she'll be out, right?

down there as gently as I can!

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:46.084
Which one of you is up to bat?

00:18:46.117 --> 00:18:47.788
I think it's your turn
to go up there.

00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:48.923
You're number eight, right?

00:18:48.957 --> 00:18:50.527
Oh! On my
way, Coach!

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.430
Sorry for the delay, you guys!

00:18:52.463 --> 00:18:55.169
So, d'you think his batting's
as good as his fielding?

00:18:55.202 --> 00:18:57.541
Looks like
we're gonna find out!

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:01.649
Of course.

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:03.185
I should have guessed you'd
be a left-handed hitter.

00:19:03.218 --> 00:19:04.321
[GOHAN]
Is that not allowed?

00:19:04.354 --> 00:19:06.325
If that's what you like,
go right ahead.

00:19:06.358 --> 00:19:08.128
But you're holding it backwards.

00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:09.230
Backwards how?

00:19:09.264 --> 00:19:11.001
Y'know, I'm just
gonna stop yammering

00:19:11.034 --> 00:19:12.571
and see what ya can do.

00:19:12.605 --> 00:19:15.577
You've got some nerve,
Gohan, stealing my home run.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.382
I think I'm going to
teach you a little respect.

00:19:18.415 --> 00:19:20.621
[GOHAN] I can't do anything
else out of the ordinary!

00:19:20.654 --> 00:19:22.825
Don't hit the ball.
Don't hit the ball.

00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:24.260
[SHARPNER chuckles]

00:19:24.294 --> 00:19:25.664
Here comes, hotshot!

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:28.603
Better hit the deck
if you value your life!

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:32.511
Look out!

00:19:32.544 --> 00:19:34.682
[STUDENTS gasp]

00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:35.917
Ah! Ya dummy!

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.890
When the ball's coming at
your head, get outta the way!

00:19:44.768 --> 00:19:46.706
Uh, when the batter's
hit by a pitch,

00:19:46.739 --> 00:19:48.610
you get a "walk,"
isn't that right?

00:19:48.643 --> 00:19:49.979
Sure.

00:19:50.312 --> 00:19:51.516
[GOHAN]
How lucky am I?

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:53.386
Didn't have to hit it,
I get to first base,

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:55.423
and I blended right in!

00:19:55.456 --> 00:19:58.529
I'm starting to think he's more
than just a bookworm!

00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:02.336
What's your deal?

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.846
[school bell chimes]

00:20:06.879 --> 00:20:08.181
Hey. New guy.

00:20:08.215 --> 00:20:09.619
Have you picked
a club yet or what?

00:20:09.652 --> 00:20:11.790
Well, I haven't
really thought about it.

00:20:11.823 --> 00:20:14.328
If you haven't picked one,
how 'bout the boxing club?

00:20:14.361 --> 00:20:16.098
I think you'd do
pretty well for yourself,

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:17.568
and we already know
you can take a hit.

00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:18.770
Yeah, but I don't think I'll be

00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:21.007
joining any of the
afterschool clubs.

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:22.009
See, uh--

00:20:22.043 --> 00:20:23.111
Don't forget,
Gohan's house is

00:20:23.144 --> 00:20:24.648
in a village hours
away from here.

00:20:24.682 --> 00:20:26.952
How's he supposed to
find time for club activities

00:20:26.986 --> 00:20:28.189
with a commute like that?

00:20:28.222 --> 00:20:29.558
Yeah--sorry about that.

00:20:29.591 --> 00:20:30.627
[ERASA]
Speaking of houses,

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.363
how about you
do a girl a favor

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:34.067
and drop me off
at mine on the way?

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.438
Uh. I'd love to but my ride,

00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:38.543
I suppose you could
call it a one-seater.

00:20:38.576 --> 00:20:41.215
You should move closer to
school--then, problem solved.

00:20:41.248 --> 00:20:43.686
I don't think my
mom would go for that.

00:20:47.027 --> 00:20:48.696
What is up with this guy?

00:20:48.729 --> 00:20:51.234
First he tells us he lives
a bajillion miles away,

00:20:51.267 --> 00:20:54.474
and then he acts like
he's just gonna walk home!

00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:03.893
[gasps]

00:21:03.927 --> 00:21:06.297
Wha--? Where did he--? Uh!

00:21:12.142 --> 00:21:13.713
[GOHAN sighs]

00:21:17.186 --> 00:21:19.525
School was tougher
than I thought!

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:22.463
And I'd better fix the
Golden Warrior thing.

00:21:22.496 --> 00:21:26.371
My not having blond hair isn't
going to fool them forever.

00:21:26.404 --> 00:21:28.910
Maybe Bulma can help me out.

00:21:28.943 --> 00:21:31.181
[NARRATOR] And so,
Gohan's first day of school

00:21:31.214 --> 00:21:32.685
finally comes to an end.

00:21:32.718 --> 00:21:36.626
How will he juggle his classes
and his superhero alter-ego?

00:21:36.659 --> 00:21:40.399
Find out next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:45.610
â™ª Closing Song â™ª

00:22:45.395 --> 00:22:47.333
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me--Goku!

00:22:47.668 --> 00:22:49.303
Whoa! That's a
pretty crazy outfit

00:22:49.337 --> 00:22:51.475
you're wearing, Gohan.
What's that all about?

00:22:51.509 --> 00:22:53.111
[GOHAN] You think it's
crazy-looking?

00:22:53.144 --> 00:22:54.915
Aw, I thought it
looked cool, Dad!

00:22:54.949 --> 00:22:58.355
Oh, maybe you'll like it more
when I do my superhero pose!

00:22:58.388 --> 00:23:00.927
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.342
You look upon
a champion of justice!"

00:23:08.375 --> 00:23:10.145
I nailed it!
