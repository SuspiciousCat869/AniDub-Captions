Hey, Sharpner.

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:03.279
If you're the Golden Warrior,
you should just confess already.

00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:04.915
Sorry, I'm not your guy.

00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:08.322
Besides, I spend my mornings
in the gym, working out.

I don't have time to go
playing hero all over town.

Whoa, wait a sec.

00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:13.734

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:15.537
what if this guy is
stronger than your dad?

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.940
Don't be dumb!

00:12:16.973 --> 00:12:19.746
Mr. Satan saved the planet
from that alien years ago!

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.248

stronger than him,

Good morning, class.

00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:32.838
We have a transfer student
joining us, and today is

00:12:32.872 --> 00:12:35.878
his very first day at
Orange Star High School.

00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:37.982
Don't be shy, son.

00:12:39.552 --> 00:12:41.155
Uh, that'd be me.

00:12:41.188 --> 00:12:42.156
So, uh.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.393
I'm Gohan.

00:12:43.426 --> 00:12:44.596
Pleasure to meet you.

00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:46.766
Ah! This new
kid's pretty hot.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.369
I sure hope he
likes blondes!

What kind of a name is Gohan?

00:12:53.312 --> 00:12:56.218
Seems like I've
seen this guy before.

were a place,

this dude would
be the mayor.

00:13:09.612 --> 00:13:10.815
everything, basically.

That's quite enough!

00:13:13.352 --> 00:13:16.292
I hope he'll inspire some of
you to try harder for a change.

00:13:16.325 --> 00:13:18.597
Now, just go ahead
and take a seat Gohan.

Hi, I'm Gohan.

00:13:56.338 --> 00:13:58.977
Nice to meetcha, Gohan.
I'm Erasa.

00:13:59.011 --> 00:14:00.748
And the sourpuss
behind me is Videl.

[gasps]

00:14:02.317 --> 00:14:03.119
Y'know what?

00:14:03.152 --> 00:14:04.856
Videl's kind of a celebrity!

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:06.960
Her dad is a really big deal!

00:14:06.993 --> 00:14:08.930
Would you believe
she's Mr. Satan's kid?

00:14:08.963 --> 00:14:12.705
What? Like
"Satan City" Mr. Satan?

00:14:12.738 --> 00:14:14.374
Uh-huh!
Isn't that crazy?

00:14:14.408 --> 00:14:16.044
Hey, is she pulling
my leg, Videl?

00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:18.249
'Cause if he really is your
dad, that's pretty amazing.

Aw, c'mon Gohan,
I'm telling you the truth!

00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:22.625
If it weren't for her
old man, none of us

00:14:22.658 --> 00:14:24.194
would even be around right now!

00:14:24.227 --> 00:14:25.463
He's a hero!

00:14:25.496 --> 00:14:27.267
You were the guy, huh?!

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.004
You're the guy I saw
at the bank when they

00:14:29.037 --> 00:14:31.375
caught those robbers
this morning, aren't you?

00:14:31.408 --> 00:14:32.343
Uh... I guess.

00:14:32.377 --> 00:14:33.814
Wow! You didn't see
the Golden Warrior

00:14:33.847 --> 00:14:35.149
anywhere, didja?

00:14:35.182 --> 00:14:37.187
Hold on.
The Golden who now?

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.191
That someone I
should have heard of?

00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:41.763
Right, guess you wouldn'tve,
being the new kid.

00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:43.199
See, the Golden Warrior is some

00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:44.467
new crime fighter
who's shown up,

00:14:44.502 --> 00:14:46.906
like, three times now
over the last ten days

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.777
to put a few baddies
in their place.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.346
He's strong as an ox,
and they say he has

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.319
spiky golden blond hair, which
is where he gets the nickname.

00:14:53.352 --> 00:14:54.856
[GOHAN] That's me
they're talking about!

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:56.158
The other two times were when I

00:14:56.191 --> 00:14:59.031
came into town
to register for school!

00:14:59.364 --> 00:15:01.368

Hmm.

I talked to one
of the witnesses.

00:15:09.618 --> 00:15:11.856
According to what he told me,
the Golden Warrior

00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:14.161
was wearing a badge
from this high school.

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:19.103
A white shirt with a black vest,
and brown slacks.

00:15:21.074 --> 00:15:23.145
[VIDEL] And you're wearing
the exact same stuff!

00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:24.616
--Huh?
--Yeah! What're the odds!

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:26.552
It's just a coincidence!

00:15:27.754 --> 00:15:29.424
Of course it's a coincidence!

What's he gonna do, hit
the criminals with his brain?

00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:34.434
You heard the teacher--
he aced all his tests.

00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:37.474
New guy's a bookworm,
not some fearless hero-type.

00:15:37.508 --> 00:15:39.812
Plus he doesn't have
the right color hair.

00:15:39.845 --> 00:15:41.248
Yeah, I guess.

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:44.121
Gohan doesn't seem
like the fighting kind.

00:15:44.154 --> 00:15:45.891
[GOHAN] You don't know
the half of it!

00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:47.595
[laughs nervously]

00:15:47.628 --> 00:15:49.364
[VIDEL] He's too much
of a goofball to be

00:15:49.397 --> 00:15:52.137
the Golden Warrior, of
course, but I do remember

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.642
seeing those guys on Dad's old
video of the fight with Cell

00:15:54.675 --> 00:15:57.648
whose hair changed from
dark to blond all at once.

00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:00.153
Dad just said it was
some kinda trick, though.

00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:01.822
[ERASA] So, tell me
more about yourself!

00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:03.259
Are you staying
in town for school,

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:05.430
or are you gonna go
back and forth every day?

00:16:05.463 --> 00:16:06.365
Yeah.

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:07.802
I'll be commuting
in every morning.

00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:09.271
How far out do you live, anyway?

00:16:09.304 --> 00:16:12.611
Well, have you ever heard
of Section 439 East?

00:16:12.645 --> 00:16:13.747
That's where I'm at.

00:16:13.781 --> 00:16:15.249
Huh?

00:16:15.282 --> 00:16:17.353
How are you coming here all
the way from Section 439 East?

00:16:17.387 --> 00:16:19.659

600 miles away!

00:16:23.332 --> 00:16:25.235
What time did you
leave home this morning?

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:28.175
Even if you took a jet-flyer,
that's, like, five hours away!

00:16:28.208 --> 00:16:29.444
Really, that long?

00:16:29.478 --> 00:16:31.616
Maybe I was so excited
to be transferring in,

00:16:31.649 --> 00:16:33.052
I just didn't notice!

00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:35.055

gonna play some more baseball.

Hey. You a
baseball genius, too?

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:50.588
Well, I've never actually
played it, so probably not.

00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:51.856
You're kidding, right?

00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:54.327
Course you haven't.

If they can't teach
it in a book,

you don't know the
first thing about it.

Have fun getting the
new kid up to speed, Videl.

00:16:59.505 --> 00:17:00.140
He's all yours.

So what if he doesn't
know how to play?

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.316
He's so smart, he'll
probably come up with

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:07.889
some real good
strategies we can use!

00:17:08.156 --> 00:17:10.861
In that case, fine.

00:17:10.894 --> 00:17:12.297
You take right field.

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:13.934
You do know which way is right?

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:14.769
Nope.

00:17:14.802 --> 00:17:16.371
But I'll figure it out!

00:17:17.273 --> 00:17:20.614

sign on for this.

if people find out the
truth about me,

00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:35.511
it's gonna ruin any chance
I have of fitting in here.

try and not to stand out.

actually touching the base.

If I throw the ball
to the third baseman,

she'll be out, right?

down there as gently as I can!

I think it's your turn
to go up there.

go right ahead.

Have you picked
a club yet or what?

Well, I haven't

If you haven't picked one,
how 'bout the boxing club?

I think you'd do
pretty well for yourself,

you can take a hit.

away from here.

call it a one-seater.

You should move closer to

First he tells us he lives
