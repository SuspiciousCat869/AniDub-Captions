Okay, time to
teach you guys how to fly.

I know you're both
anxious to get started,

So, uh, let's see.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.841
The key to Flying Technique is
energy control, which, y'know,

00:03:23.874 --> 00:03:26.847
isn't all that tough once
you get the hang of it.

But if you want to
zip around really fast,

that's the kind of maneuvering
you have to work your way up to.

00:10:36.138 --> 00:10:38.811
[laughs]

00:10:38.844 --> 00:10:40.179
Well said, young man!

00:10:40.213 --> 00:10:42.317
Nobody can handle
that kind of weight!

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.191
And you, North Kai,
was that your idea of a joke?

00:10:47.427 --> 00:10:48.630
[PAPOI emits a
slow-witted laugh]

00:10:48.664 --> 00:10:49.999
Goku! I forgot to mention,

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:51.870
you can go
Super Saiyan now.

00:10:51.903 --> 00:10:54.943
If I go Super Saiyan, then
ten tons each'll be a cinch!

00:10:54.976 --> 00:10:55.611
What?

00:10:55.645 --> 00:10:57.047
Great! Let 'er rip!

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.449
Go ahead and
change his weights

00:10:58.482 --> 00:11:00.453
to ten tons apiece, South Kai!

00:11:00.487 --> 00:11:02.224
That's like 40 tons!

00:11:02.257 --> 00:11:04.495
If you're bluffing, you'd
better say something now,

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:06.132
because I'm really gonna do it!

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.267
No kidding!

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.303
Uh, yup!

00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:10.339
Eh...

00:11:10.373 --> 00:11:12.311
Hm?

00:11:12.344 --> 00:11:13.614
[laughs]

00:11:13.647 --> 00:11:15.283
Forty tons, man!
Do the math!

00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:16.418
Do it already!

00:11:16.451 --> 00:11:19.559
If you snap like a twig
it's not my fault, got it?

00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:21.462
[grunts]

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:24.267
Forty tons!

[bellows]

00:11:38.563 --> 00:11:41.903
Ah. Well done.

00:11:47.549 --> 00:11:49.018
That martial arts
tourney I mentioned

00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:51.121
starts up in 28 Earth
days from now.

00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:55.196
As strong as he is, I'm sure
Papoi is eager to enter!

00:11:56.131 --> 00:11:58.069
Actually, I think we're
going to have to miss it.

00:11:58.102 --> 00:12:00.974
Papoi feels that
tournaments are a real yawn!

00:12:01.008 --> 00:12:02.443
It's not like
you're missing out.

00:12:02.477 --> 00:12:04.882
I mean, really--who goes to
the trouble of entering some

00:12:04.915 --> 00:12:08.322
podunk little competition
on Earth of all places?

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:12.998
[KING KAI chuckles]

00:12:25.557 --> 00:12:27.661
Okay then, flying lesson one!

00:12:27.695 --> 00:12:29.765
The most important part--

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:33.205
is maintaining steady
control of your energy.

00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:37.413
[GOTEN grunting]

00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:42.858
Uh...

00:12:42.892 --> 00:12:46.566
Non-stop hopping isn't
really what it's all about.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.171
Just try your best to focus.

00:12:49.205 --> 00:12:50.540
Oh!

00:13:07.407 --> 00:13:09.377
I'm flying!

00:13:10.212 --> 00:13:13.118
Wow! Way to go!
Keep it up!

00:13:13.152 --> 00:13:14.220
That's it!

00:13:14.254 --> 00:13:17.662
I can fly now,
just like Gohan!

00:13:17.695 --> 00:13:19.097
[laughs]

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.734
--Yeah!
--Hey! You're doing great!

00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:22.504
I mean it!

00:13:23.707 --> 00:13:25.310
[GOTEN]
Wheeee!

00:13:25.343 --> 00:13:26.713
Easy! Don't overdo it!

00:13:26.747 --> 00:13:29.084
C'mon! I could
do this all day!

00:13:29.117 --> 00:13:30.654
[yells]

[GOHAN]
Goten!

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:34.795
I know that
crash-landing's no fun,

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:36.064
but don't worry about it--

00:13:36.098 --> 00:13:38.102
you'll be zipping around
like a pro in no time!

00:13:38.136 --> 00:13:40.239
You believe me, don't you?

00:13:40.941 --> 00:13:43.412
Are we gonna train now
that I can fly like you?

00:13:43.446 --> 00:13:44.448
Sh!

00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:46.787
We will, as soon as
Videl's out of our hair.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.324
Once she goes home,
we'll train all you want.

00:13:49.358 --> 00:13:51.461
--Cool?
--Cool!

00:13:59.612 --> 00:14:00.681
I'm still here!

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:02.785
And I still can't fly, Saiyaman!

00:14:02.819 --> 00:14:03.954
[GOHAN]
Uh! Sorry about that.

00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:05.892
I'm coming back over, see?

00:14:05.925 --> 00:14:07.594
But gosh, just look
at the time, Videl!

00:14:07.628 --> 00:14:08.697
I'm sure your father
must be worried

00:14:08.731 --> 00:14:10.099
sick about you right now!

00:14:10.133 --> 00:14:11.670
[VIDEL]
I'm a big girl, Gohan.

00:14:11.703 --> 00:14:13.773
And flying is more important.

00:14:14.374 --> 00:14:17.281
[GOHAN] In that case,
try to relax your body more,

00:14:17.314 --> 00:14:19.952
but focus your energy
at the same time.

00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:23.593
I know those kinda
sound contradictory.

00:14:41.461 --> 00:14:42.297
Attagirl, Videl!

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.635
Now you're gettin'
the hang of it!

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.191
You did it! Wow!

00:14:56.225 --> 00:14:56.893
[chuckles]

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:58.697
We have liftoff!

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.598
Stop babbling!

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.536
I'm trying to concentrate!

00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:14.160
It's your first day
of trying to fly

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:15.697
and you already
got off the ground!

00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:16.934
That is incredible!

00:15:16.967 --> 00:15:18.169
He is such a show-off!

00:15:18.202 --> 00:15:19.471
[GOTEN]
Look, Gohan!

00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:22.779
I can fly in a figure-eight
thingie like this.

00:15:22.812 --> 00:15:24.181
Aw, lookit!

00:15:24.214 --> 00:15:26.652
Hold on, comparing your
progress is apples and oranges!

00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:29.993
Goten had complete control
of his energy way before today!

00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:31.630
As soon as you get
that part nailed down,

00:15:31.663 --> 00:15:32.865
the rest will be simple!

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.569
You'll be flying as
well as him in no time!

00:15:34.602 --> 00:15:36.304
So we're done, right?

00:15:40.013 --> 00:15:41.816
I'll be back tomorrow.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.787
Do you really think
that's necessary?

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.423
You did so well
just now, I'm sure you

00:15:45.457 --> 00:15:47.260
can figure out the
rest pretty easily.

00:15:47.294 --> 00:15:49.632
I want to learn about
controlling my energy.

00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:52.437
My being here isn't
a problem for you, is it?

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.209
[GOHAN] How could you even
think something like that?

00:15:55.811 --> 00:15:57.848
Fine. Then I'll be back.

00:15:57.881 --> 00:15:59.417

Huh?

00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:02.591

All right, see ya.

00:16:02.625 --> 00:16:05.429
Yeah. Take it easy.

Oh, I almost forgot.

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:08.235
Forgot what?

00:16:08.268 --> 00:16:11.976
Well, it's about how you
wear your hair long.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.981
Maybe you should go short.

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:16.117
Y'know, just a thought.

00:16:19.491 --> 00:16:22.096
Wait, are you
saying that you like

00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:24.000
girls with short hair better?

00:16:24.034 --> 00:16:25.971
Aaah! Hold on a sec!

00:16:26.004 --> 00:16:27.473
It's not about liking stuff!

00:16:27.507 --> 00:16:29.277
When you're out there
competing in that tournament,

00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:31.282
long hair could be
a liability, y'know?

00:16:31.315 --> 00:16:33.319
'Cause it gets in your face,
and your opponents

00:16:33.352 --> 00:16:35.824

Just shut up about
my hair already!

know about style anyway?

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.339
Stop that whining!

00:19:30.373 --> 00:19:32.110
I'll take you
to the stupid park!

00:19:32.143 --> 00:19:33.513
Really?

00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:36.051
But first, tell me this--
which of you is stronger.

00:19:36.084 --> 00:19:37.554
You, or Gohan's brother?

00:19:37.587 --> 00:19:40.192
I'm stronger than Goten,
but only by a little bit!

00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:42.163
He can't fly and he's a
year younger than me,

00:19:42.196 --> 00:19:43.700
so I betcha that's part of it.

00:19:43.733 --> 00:19:45.737
[VEGETA] So Goten
can almost attack

00:19:45.771 --> 00:19:46.939
at that level, too?

00:19:46.972 --> 00:19:49.545
What the hell
is going on here?

00:20:23.145 --> 00:20:26.351
The amount of energy I'm sensing
from Piccolo is truly amazing!

00:20:26.385 --> 00:20:28.389
He's been sitting like
that since yesterday,

00:20:28.422 --> 00:20:30.661
but he just keeps
getting stronger!

00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:32.631
This has to be
thanks to Goku entering

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:35.537
the World Martial
Arts Tournament!

00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:41.315
[GOHAN]
That was great!

00:20:41.348 --> 00:20:42.684
[GOTEN]
Yeah! Thanks, Mom!

00:20:42.718 --> 00:20:44.855
Okay, Goten.
Let's head out there!

00:20:44.889 --> 00:20:46.191
I'm ready!

00:20:46.593 --> 00:20:49.163
[GOHAN] C'mon! Let's get
some special training in

00:20:49.197 --> 00:20:50.667
before we get interrupted!

00:20:50.701 --> 00:20:51.802
All right!

00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:54.942
[helicopter blades whirr]

00:20:54.975 --> 00:20:56.946
[GOTEN yells]

00:20:58.983 --> 00:21:00.620
Aw, too late!

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.777
Hey Gohan,
who's this new lady?

00:21:13.947 --> 00:21:16.686
All right, let's pick up
where we left off yesterday.

00:21:16.719 --> 00:21:18.389
You cut your hair.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.529
I don't understand girls
at all, not even a little bit.

00:21:21.562 --> 00:21:23.766
[NARRATOR] Goten and
Trunks are wowing brother

00:21:23.799 --> 00:21:27.006
and father alike with their
Super Saiyan powers.

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:30.246
Meanwhile, it's the
contents of Videl's heart--

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:32.016
and not the length of her hair--

00:21:32.049 --> 00:21:34.220
that Gohan should
keep an eye on.

00:21:34.253 --> 00:21:36.759
Will he figure it out
or remain clueless?

00:21:36.792 --> 00:21:39.831
Find out,
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me--Goku!

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:47.735
Long time no see!

00:22:47.768 --> 00:22:48.970
It's been seven whole years,

00:22:49.003 --> 00:22:51.141
and I'm sure a lot
of things have changed.

00:22:51.174 --> 00:22:52.409
So, how've you all been?

00:22:52.443 --> 00:22:54.247
[CHI-CHI] Oh, I'm so glad
you're back, Goku!

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.751
Look, Goten!

00:22:55.784 --> 00:22:58.422
Stop being bashful already,
honey--this man is your father!

00:22:58.455 --> 00:22:59.558
[GOTEN]
Dad!

00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:01.996
[GOKU] Next time
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:05.603 --> 00:23:06.806
[GOHAN] We're all
about to enter

00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:09.010
the World Martial Arts
Tournament together!
