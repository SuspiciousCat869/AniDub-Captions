Sensing these events from afar,

the remaining senzu bean,

this new threat alone.

00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:17.981
We'll see about that!

00:14:19.852 --> 00:14:23.660
[BABIDI chuckles]

00:14:23.694 --> 00:14:26.999
[SUPREME KAI groans]

00:14:29.137 --> 00:14:32.210
[BUU chuckles gleefully]

00:14:32.243 --> 00:14:33.412
What?

00:14:33.445 --> 00:14:37.187
Buu eat you! Buu eat you!
Buu eat you! Buu eat you!

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:42.163
Buu eat you! Buu eat you!
Buu eat you! Buu eat you!

00:14:42.196 --> 00:14:44.200
This wasn't the plan,
but so be it.

00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:47.575
Now that Majin Buu is unsealed,
I have no need for Dabura.

00:14:47.608 --> 00:14:48.977
[laughs]

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.947
[BUU]
Buu eat you! Buu eat you!

00:14:50.981 --> 00:14:52.852
Stop that!

00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:55.389
I'll show you!

00:15:02.905 --> 00:15:06.144
[BABIDI]
No! Majin Buu!

00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:09.618
Eat that, Majin.

00:15:19.572 --> 00:15:21.475
[grunts]

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:27.320
Buu!

00:15:27.353 --> 00:15:32.431
[BABIDI] Very good, Majin Buu!
You're extraordinary!

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:38.777
[BUU hollers gleefully]

00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:40.280
Buu can't wait to eat you!

00:15:40.313 --> 00:15:44.421
Buu eat you! Buu eat you!
Buu eat you! Buu eat you!

00:15:44.454 --> 00:15:49.497
Buu eat you! Buu eat you!
Buu eat you! Buu eat you!

00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:57.313
That red guy's energy
is shooting up like crazy!

00:15:57.346 --> 00:16:00.286
Now you'll see my true power.

00:16:01.923 --> 00:16:04.194
Aah...!

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:10.640
[yells]

00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:28.610
[DABURA] Not even a Majin
could survive that.

00:16:28.644 --> 00:16:34.421
No. Not now. We're not
through! It can't be!

00:16:34.454 --> 00:16:36.391
[DABURA chuckles]

00:16:36.425 --> 00:16:41.502
[BABIDI]
You really got him? How?

00:16:41.536 --> 00:16:44.942
[BUU] Buu eat you.
Buu eat you. Buu eat you.

00:16:44.975 --> 00:16:47.380
Huh? What the--?

00:16:47.413 --> 00:16:49.686
[BUU]
Buu eat you. Buu eat you.

00:16:49.719 --> 00:16:54.094
Buu eat you. Buu eat you.
Buu eat you. Buu eat you.

00:16:54.128 --> 00:16:56.232
Buu eat you. Buu eat you.

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:59.705
[laughs]

00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:02.143
My father was more
brilliant than I dreamed!

00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:05.049
Yes! You let him
have it, Majin Buu!

00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:07.821
Buu eat you. Buu eat you.

00:17:10.861 --> 00:17:14.167
Ha-ha! You turn into cookie!

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.741
[DABURA yells]

00:17:19.845 --> 00:17:26.057
[DABURA yells]

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:31.769
Huh?!

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:40.787
[chuckles]

00:17:50.874 --> 00:17:52.443
[BABIDI]
Outstanding, Majin Buu!

00:17:52.476 --> 00:17:54.883
You're even greater
than I dared imagine!

00:17:54.916 --> 00:17:58.255
[laughs]

00:18:00.259 --> 00:18:01.563
[GOTEN]
Am I dreaming?

00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:04.602
He turned him into
a cookie and ate him?

00:18:04.635 --> 00:18:06.806
Uh-huh.

00:18:14.823 --> 00:18:15.791
[KRILLIN]
What?

00:18:15.825 --> 00:18:17.528
Krillin's real now!

00:18:17.562 --> 00:18:21.168
[KRILLIN]
What are you kids doing here?

00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:23.339
I think you've got
some explaining to do.

00:18:23.372 --> 00:18:24.508
We do?

00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:26.713
What? You were made out
of stone ten seconds ago,

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:27.948
explain that!

00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:30.219
[KRILLIN]
Stone? Me?

00:18:30.253 --> 00:18:32.958
That's right! I was attacked
by that guy with the horns--

00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:34.862
I think his name was
Debra, or Dabura--

00:18:34.895 --> 00:18:39.071
he spit on me. I started
changing and blacked out.

00:18:39.104 --> 00:18:40.373
I'm normal now, though.

00:18:40.406 --> 00:18:42.143
Hey, you think he means
that guy who just

00:18:42.177 --> 00:18:43.780
got turned into a cookie?

00:18:43.814 --> 00:18:45.016
Yeah, if he was
using his powers

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:46.686
to trap people in stone,
then maybe they all

00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:49.792
went back to normal
once he was taken out.

00:18:49.825 --> 00:18:53.365
[gasps]

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:56.839
I'm, uh, just gonna
go check on something.

00:18:56.872 --> 00:18:58.275
[KRILLIN]
What's wrong with him?

00:18:58.308 --> 00:19:00.346
I think he's worried 'cause
he broke Piccolo's statue

00:19:00.379 --> 00:19:01.983
into a hundred pieces.

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:03.853
Eeh!

00:19:15.175 --> 00:19:17.247
[GOTEN]
Uh... Is it bad?

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.518
[TRUNKS] You, uh--
You better not go up there.

00:19:19.551 --> 00:19:21.187
Yeah, that doesn't sound good.

00:19:21.221 --> 00:19:24.795
Don't tell my dad. It'll be
our little secret, okay?

00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:26.766
[PICCOLO]
What secret?

00:19:28.803 --> 00:19:30.039
[TRUNKS]
Huh?

00:19:30.072 --> 00:19:31.207
[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
Huh?!

00:19:31.241 --> 00:19:32.778
[chuckles]

00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:36.686
That massive energy.

00:19:36.719 --> 00:19:39.858
I've never sensed
anything like it!

00:19:39.892 --> 00:19:43.365
[gasps]
No. Is that Majin Buu?

00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:46.238
[TRUNKS] Um, Piccolo? Not that
I had anything to do with it,

00:19:46.271 --> 00:19:49.110
but how are you in one piece?

00:19:49.144 --> 00:19:50.614
My body can
regenerate as long as

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:53.920
my head stays intact.
But forget about me,

00:19:53.953 --> 00:19:55.824
what exactly
happened down there?

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:57.360
Where are Goku and the others?

00:19:57.393 --> 00:19:58.963
[TRUNKS]
I was gonna ask you that.

00:19:58.996 --> 00:20:01.301
We only got here
a few minutes ago.

00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:03.573
[KRILLIN]
Guys? Who's the pink weirdo?

00:20:03.607 --> 00:20:06.746
[gasps]
Please don't say Majin Buu.

00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:08.015
That's my guess.

00:20:08.048 --> 00:20:09.852
[KRILLIN]
Oh! Isn't that nice.

00:20:09.885 --> 00:20:12.090
[laughs nervously]

00:20:12.123 --> 00:20:13.960
And I guess it's
his energy that's making me

00:20:13.994 --> 00:20:16.331
wanna head for the hills?

00:20:17.568 --> 00:20:19.805
[BABIDI]
Way to go, Majin Buu!

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:23.513
But don't stop the feast yet!
Come have your second course!

00:20:23.546 --> 00:20:25.149
[laughs]

00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:28.690
[BUU laughs]

00:20:28.723 --> 00:20:31.027
That's the Supreme Kai,
and he's helpless!

00:20:31.061 --> 00:20:34.568
[KRILLIN] Wait, Piccolo, please!
You've gotta think this through!

00:20:34.602 --> 00:20:37.975
I know you want to help him.
So do the rest of us!

00:20:38.008 --> 00:20:39.645
But not even you
can stop that guy,

00:20:39.678 --> 00:20:42.449
you know it as well
as I do. You can feel it.

00:20:42.483 --> 00:20:43.954
I saw him get
tagged with a spear

00:20:43.987 --> 00:20:45.758
and act like it was nothing,
and then he turned

00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:48.730
the other guy into
a cookie and ate him!

00:20:48.763 --> 00:20:50.199
Damn it!

00:20:50.232 --> 00:20:53.472
[SUPREME KAI groans]
[BUU laughs]

00:20:53.507 --> 00:20:57.280
Buu wonder what food
to turn you into.

00:20:57.313 --> 00:20:59.619
A chocolate? Or maybe jelly?

00:20:59.652 --> 00:21:00.854
[laughs]

00:21:00.887 --> 00:21:04.127
The smug ruler of us all!
Turned into children's candy!

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:12.376
[laughs]

00:21:13.445 --> 00:21:17.554
What? Ah! My ship!

00:21:19.658 --> 00:21:22.062
Anybody know what that was?

00:21:27.072 --> 00:21:28.509
[NARRATOR]
With his bizarre powers,

00:21:28.543 --> 00:21:30.981
Majin Buu has easily
defeated Dabura,

00:21:31.014 --> 00:21:33.385
Gohan, and the Supreme Kai.

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:35.423
But one more challenger
still remains

00:21:35.456 --> 00:21:39.966
to test the monster's might--
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:48.903
And I think you're making
a big mistake, Vegeta,

00:22:48.936 --> 00:22:51.240
trying to go up against
this creature on your own.

00:22:51.274 --> 00:22:54.380
Haven't you learned anything
about the dangers of pride?

is only toying with me.
