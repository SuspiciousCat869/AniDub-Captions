[GOKU]
Huh?

00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:14.876
No. It broke?
That's impossible!

00:19:14.976 --> 00:19:16.178
Ah! No!

00:19:16.278 --> 00:19:19.752
He broke what cannot
be broken! All is lost!

00:19:19.852 --> 00:19:21.989
The--The Z-Sword is gone!

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.664
I--uh. Hey.
I hate to point fingers,

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:28.368
but swinging the Z-Sword
at that crazy space cube

00:19:28.468 --> 00:19:29.772
was kinda your idea.

00:19:29.872 --> 00:19:31.742
But, the legend says
whoever successfully

00:19:31.842 --> 00:19:35.049
wields the Z-Sword will hold
the greatest power ever.

00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:37.353
You broke it.
The holiest of all relics

00:19:37.453 --> 00:19:39.859
in this sanctuary of the Kais.

00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:41.128
I don't mean to be rude,

00:19:41.228 --> 00:19:43.866
but I guess your guys'
legend was wrong.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.746
But look on the bright side.

00:19:49.846 --> 00:19:52.016
Thanks to the Z-Sword
being super-heavy,

00:19:52.116 --> 00:19:53.653
I got an awesome
upper-body workout

00:19:53.753 --> 00:19:56.792
just by swinging it around
for a couple hours.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.671
Maybe my newly ripped
biceps and triceps

00:20:02.772 --> 00:20:04.274
are what the legend
is talking about

00:20:04.374 --> 00:20:06.278
when it says whoever
can wield the Z-Sword

00:20:06.378 --> 00:20:08.481
will end up getting
some kind of superpowers.

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:11.856
Yes, that must be correct.
We interpreted the legend wrong.

00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:13.893
If the sword's weight
made you this much stronger

00:20:13.993 --> 00:20:16.197
in your normal state,
imagine how much stronger

00:20:16.297 --> 00:20:18.704
you'll become when
you're Super Saiyan!

00:20:18.804 --> 00:20:20.640
[KIBITO]
Mhmm. Mmmm.

00:20:23.079 --> 00:20:25.149
Well, I'm glad
we're in agreement.

00:20:25.249 --> 00:20:26.686
The Z-Sword's legendary power

00:20:26.786 --> 00:20:29.257
is really just
an upper body workout.

00:20:29.357 --> 00:20:31.361
Yeah, I guess.
But is he really stronger

00:20:31.462 --> 00:20:34.034
than Majin Buu, now?
I'm not so sure.

00:20:34.134 --> 00:20:36.171
But this has to be it, Goku.

00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:37.841
It's the only way
it makes sense.

None of you are anywhere
close to having it right!

00:20:49.932 --> 00:20:53.405
Hey, guys. When did
that old man get here?

00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:58.181
[SUPREME KAI]
Excuse me, sir. Who are you?

00:20:58.281 --> 00:20:59.484
All right.

00:20:59.585 --> 00:21:01.889
You'll be very surprised
to learn that I am--

Oh, I can't wait to tell you.

I-- Oh boy. I'm sorta you.

00:21:07.968 --> 00:21:10.640
Well, the same rank.
I'm also Supreme Kai

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.582
but I'm from 15 generations ago.

00:21:14.682 --> 00:21:18.689
Aaah! Fifteen generations ago?

00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:21.696

Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:49.839
Once the Z-Sword broke,
this crazy old guy appeared!

He says he was the Supreme Kai,
only thousands of years ago!

[ELDER KAI] I may be old,
but the powers I possess

00:22:55.717 --> 00:22:57.587
are capable of
