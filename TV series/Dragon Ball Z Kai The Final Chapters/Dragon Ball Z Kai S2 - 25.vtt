train harder than you ever did,

have still placed you

So, that's why you allowed
Babidi to take control.

Yes. I thought of the fighters
at the tournament;

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:57.388
the evil pair whom
Babidi had taken over

00:07:57.421 --> 00:08:00.093

than ever before.

When I remembered that, Kakarot,
my plan came into being.

00:08:24.074 --> 00:08:26.680
I would submit to Babidi's
control in the hopes of

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:31.488
leveling the playing field
between us once and for all!

00:08:31.523 --> 00:08:35.096
I would say
it worked like a charm.

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:37.935
Although submitting to him
was a blow to my pride.

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:40.808
I don't get it. As proud
as you've always been,

00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:42.779
you were willing to become
Babidi's servant

00:08:42.812 --> 00:08:45.283
just to end up
a little bit stronger?

00:08:50.695 --> 00:08:54.635
to being the person
I was before!

00:08:54.669 --> 00:08:57.274
I wanted to go back to being
the cold-blooded Saiyan

00:08:57.307 --> 00:08:58.543
I had been in the beginning.

00:08:58.577 --> 00:09:00.446

about anything except

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.052
besting you
in one-on-one combat!

00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:04.656
I wasn't happy.

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:07.027
I didn't realize it
at first, but all of you

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.768
had made me too peaceful;
you had domesticated me!

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:15.778
I-- I suddenly had
a family, of all things.

00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:18.918
And it didn't
feel so terrible.

flown off to who knows where,

and Gohan and Goku
were here, then they left,

00:12:16.907 --> 00:12:18.410

and vanished!

[GOTEN] Something weird

of energy over there.

[TRUNKS]
Yeah, I feel it, too.

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:57.822
And not only is it powerful,

anything like it before.

Uh-huh.

[TRUNKS] We can't be
in two places at once.

which direction to go? Huh.

I don't know any more
than you do, Goten.

00:13:21.803 --> 00:13:24.307
Do you think it has
to do with Majin Buu?

00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:26.111

Dabura, he's coming out.
He's finally coming out!

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:27.434
Yes, indeed.

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:30.072
At last, the seal
on the ball has been broken!

00:14:30.106 --> 00:14:33.346
The legendary Majin Buu
is making his return!

00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:36.252
Finally! My father's creation
will fulfill its purpose

00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:39.959

destroying everything!

00:14:39.992 --> 00:14:42.832
Yes, sir.
This day is promising.

[BABIDI] I've dreamt
of this day forever!

Hurry up, Majin Buu!
Don't keep me waiting!

[GOHAN] The energy Dad's been
putting out in his fight!

00:14:52.483 --> 00:14:56.526
It's incredible! It's beyond
even Super Saiyan levels.

[SUPREME KAI hollers]

00:14:58.362 --> 00:15:01.235
But because of it, Majin Buu is
about to be unleashed again!

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:05.109
Gohan! This is hopeless!
We have to run!

00:15:05.143 --> 00:15:08.148
We have to go now!
There's nothing we can do!

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:10.119
Huh? Whaddya mean
there's nothing we can do?

00:15:10.152 --> 00:15:11.389
If we just turn tail and run,

00:15:11.422 --> 00:15:13.326
Majin Buu's gonna
come out of that ball!

00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:16.131
And then we'll be in way worse
shape than we are right now!

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.401
Listen to me, Gohan!

00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:19.739
There is no one on Earth
who can stop him!

00:15:19.772 --> 00:15:22.210
Not you! Not me! Not anybody!

00:15:22.243 --> 00:15:24.916
There is not a person alive
who can defeat Majin Buu,

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:26.586
and if we don't
escape right now,

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.391
he'll destroy us as easily
as swatting a fly!

00:15:29.424 --> 00:15:31.529
But how can we just
give up, Supreme Kai?

00:15:31.562 --> 00:15:34.736
Our only chance at survival
is to flee! Now!

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:36.271
I'm not gonna run!

00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:38.008
You must!

00:15:38.777 --> 00:15:40.347
If he's already
reached full power,

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.352
then there's only
one thing left to do!

[bellows]

Uh, Dabura,
what's all this about?

00:16:10.974 --> 00:16:13.145
I'm not sure.

00:16:13.178 --> 00:16:16.418
I'll fight him
for as long as I can!

[yells]

[yells]

That impudent little--!
Do not worry, Master.

00:17:16.372 --> 00:17:19.612
I will go and destroy
that fool immediately.

00:17:19.646 --> 00:17:21.983
Good! But I'm not worried
in the slightest.

00:17:22.017 --> 00:17:23.987
It would take more than
this to make Majin Buu

00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:26.224
even break a sweat!

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.368

you're blue in the face!

Yes, my master!

[DABURA, BABIDI]
There's... nothing in it.

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:51.228
No. No way. This cannot
be happening to me.

00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:56.739
I open the ball
only to find nothing inside?

Come on out!

00:19:02.284 --> 00:19:04.756
I'm not going to accept
that you're destroyed!

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:06.859
Please, Majin Buu!

00:19:06.893 --> 00:19:12.236
[SUPREME KAI laughs]

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.441

Huh...

00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:18.950
I would hate to be
you right now, Babidi!

00:19:18.983 --> 00:19:20.821
Gohan's attack
reduced Majin Buu

00:19:20.854 --> 00:19:22.256
all the way down to nothing.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.893
He probably
shriveled up while he was

00:19:23.926 --> 00:19:25.496
in the ball for all those years.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.467
No matter how much energy
you pumped into him,

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.740
he was never going to be
as strong as he once was.

00:19:32.443 --> 00:19:36.251
And so your evil plans
have come to an end!

00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:40.860
Please, my master,
do not act like all is lost.

00:19:40.894 --> 00:19:44.502
Even without Majin Buu,
I am still right here.

00:19:44.535 --> 00:19:47.273
And Vegeta is still
a very powerful weapon,

00:19:47.306 --> 00:19:50.312
even if he is not entirely
under your control.

00:19:50.345 --> 00:19:53.085

take the Supreme Kai

Meanwhile, you face off
