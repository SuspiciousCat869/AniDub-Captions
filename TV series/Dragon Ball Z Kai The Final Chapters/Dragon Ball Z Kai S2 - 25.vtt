00:00:07.148 --> 00:00:09.886
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.863
the long-awaited rematch between
Goku and Vegeta raged on!

00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:19.038
Meanwhile, the energy from
each Earth-shattering attack

00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:22.445
went straight to the ball
containing Majin Buu!

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:28.858
Majin Buu is at full power!
His full power!

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:30.528
[gasps]

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.499
[BABIDI]
It's really happening!

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:36.439
Buu is finally
coming back to life!

00:00:36.472 --> 00:00:38.745
[laughs intensely]

00:00:38.778 --> 00:00:40.214
I don't believe this!

00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:43.253
This is the worst-case-scenario
I was trying to avoid!

00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:45.725
How could I have
failed so completely?

00:00:45.758 --> 00:00:48.497
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu's seal
has been released!

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:52.137
Can anything stop this
nightmare from coming to life?

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.174
Find out, now!

00:00:55.477 --> 00:01:00.487
â™ª Opening Song â™ª

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:50.307
Why're you lagging
behind like that?

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.577
If you keep being a slowpoke,

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.815
we're not gonna
get to see Majin Buu!

00:02:53.848 --> 00:02:54.783
Yeah, but--!

00:02:54.817 --> 00:02:55.818
[TRUNKS]
But what?

00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.490
[GOTEN] I really have to
go to the bathroom!

00:02:58.524 --> 00:03:00.427
You're flying slow
'cause you gotta pee?

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.297
Just hold it!
We're in a hurry, y'know?

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.600
I can't hold it!

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.270
I haven't gone
since the tournament

00:03:05.303 --> 00:03:07.709
and if I don't do it soon
I think I'm gonna wet myself!

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:10.514
Well it's your own fault
for waitin' so long!

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.354
All right, you can go there.

00:03:14.388 --> 00:03:16.593
Behind those rocks!
And hurry up!

00:03:16.627 --> 00:03:17.995
[GOTEN]
Okay!

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:26.947
[zip]

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:32.926
Oh! You gottta go, too?

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.166
[chuckles]
I might as well!

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.005
Hey, check it out!
I can pee farther than you!

00:03:39.038 --> 00:03:41.275
[GOTEN]
How about now?

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:42.979
[TRUNKS]
No way!

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:44.181
[GOTEN]
Whatever.

00:03:44.214 --> 00:03:45.651
[TRUNKS]
I told you I could!

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:47.088
[GOTEN]
No.

00:03:47.121 --> 00:03:48.991
[thud]

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.767
[DINOSAUR roars]
[BOTH yell]

00:03:58.143 --> 00:03:59.579
Whew! That was close!

00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:02.083
Yeah, some rest stop.
C'mon, let's get movin'!

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.720
[GOTEN]
Mhmmm.

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.605
Nice try!

00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:24.996
[groans]

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.871
What's wrong, Kakarot?

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:40.795
[VEGETA]
There you are!

00:04:40.828 --> 00:04:43.667
Now die, Kakarot!

00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:46.773
[GOKU]
Not too shabby, Vegeta.

00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:52.518
But I'm getting fired up, too.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.706
[TRUNKS] Hey, Goten! I'm sensing
some crazy strong energy

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:05.711
out there. You think it might
be coming from our dads?

00:05:05.744 --> 00:05:08.115
[GOTEN] No idea, Trunks.
But I felt it coming from

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:09.919
the tournament
a little while back.

00:05:09.953 --> 00:05:12.124
[TRUNKS] How come we're feeling
such powerful energy

00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:13.761
from totally different places?

00:05:13.794 --> 00:05:15.999
You think people are
fighting all over the world

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:17.367
and that's what we feel?

00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:19.072
I don't know any more
about what's happening

00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:20.708
out there than you do.

00:05:20.742 --> 00:05:23.146
Wanna turn around
and go back to the arena?

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.516
We're not turning around!

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:27.253
I'm wanna go see Majin Buu
today no matter what!

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:28.924
[TRUNKS]
Okay, Goten, just chill out!

00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.762
How 'bout we head towards
the biggest energy

00:05:30.795 --> 00:05:32.865
we're sensin'
and see what's there?

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:34.702
[GOTEN]
All right!

00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:50.433
[yells]

00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:52.738
[VEGETA] I haven't been this
worked up in a long time!

00:05:52.772 --> 00:05:55.878
[GOKU] Sorry Vegeta,
but I'm not gonna lose to you!

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.858
Just die already!

00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:20.961
[yells]

00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:36.092
I should have figured
you'd live through that!

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.530
[GOKU] Stop it, Vegeta.
You're just wasting your power.

00:06:38.563 --> 00:06:41.469
This is only the beginning! Aah!

00:06:41.503 --> 00:06:43.072
[GOKU yells]

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.924
Y'know, it's pretty amazing.

00:06:51.957 --> 00:06:54.495
While I've been in Otherworld,
I've done nothing but train,

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.299
and yet here we are now.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.169
You and I are evenly matched,

00:06:58.203 --> 00:06:59.706
which means
as much as I trained,

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:02.210
you must have pushed
yourself even harder.

00:07:02.244 --> 00:07:03.714
What does it matter?

00:07:03.747 --> 00:07:06.418
Sure, I may have bothered to
train harder than you ever did,

00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:08.991
but your inborn talents
have still placed you

00:07:09.024 --> 00:07:10.159
out of my reach!

00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:12.598
Even after all these years,
that remains the same!

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.435
Don't deny it!
I've known the truth

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:16.573
ever since I watched you
fight that monster

00:07:16.607 --> 00:07:19.679
Babidi sent for you
in his spaceship!

00:07:25.457 --> 00:07:27.227
[GOKU yells]

00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:34.141
[VEGETA]
I couldn't believe it!

00:07:34.175 --> 00:07:36.647
How could Vegeta,
the Prince of all Saiyans,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.218
be forever outpaced
by a low-born nobody

00:07:39.252 --> 00:07:40.654
who grew up here on Earth!

00:07:40.688 --> 00:07:43.894
Seeing that,
I knew what I had to do!

00:07:43.928 --> 00:07:45.297
[chuckles]

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.871
What? Vegeta!
That was your reason?

00:07:48.904 --> 00:07:51.576
So, that's why you allowed
Babidi to take control.

00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:54.716
Yes. I thought of the fighters
at the tournament;

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:57.388
the evil pair whom
Babidi had taken over

00:07:57.421 --> 00:08:00.093
in order to do his bidding.

00:08:03.299 --> 00:08:08.644
[SPOPOVITCH yells]
[VIDEL groans]

00:08:08.678 --> 00:08:09.913
When did he get so strong?

00:08:09.946 --> 00:08:12.818
He's like a completely
different guy now!

00:08:14.422 --> 00:08:16.291
Those two fighters
had gone from being

00:08:16.325 --> 00:08:17.862
forgettable weaklings
to something

00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:20.200
far more powerful
than ever before.

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:24.041
When I remembered that, Kakarot,
my plan came into being.

00:08:24.074 --> 00:08:26.680
I would submit to Babidi's
control in the hopes of

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:31.488
leveling the playing field
between us once and for all!

00:08:31.523 --> 00:08:35.096
I would say
it worked like a charm.

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:37.935
Although submitting to him
was a blow to my pride.

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:40.808
I don't get it. As proud
as you've always been,

00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:42.779
you were willing to become
Babidi's servant

00:08:42.812 --> 00:08:45.283
just to end up
a little bit stronger?

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:48.824
[VEGETA]
I-- I just--!

00:08:48.857 --> 00:08:50.661
Aah! I just wanted to go back

00:08:50.695 --> 00:08:54.635
to being the person
I was before!

00:08:54.669 --> 00:08:57.274
I wanted to go back to being
the cold-blooded Saiyan

00:08:57.307 --> 00:08:58.543
I had been in the beginning.

00:08:58.577 --> 00:09:00.446
The one who didn't care
about anything except

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.052
besting you
in one-on-one combat!

00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:04.656
I wasn't happy.

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:07.027
I didn't realize it
at first, but all of you

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.768
had made me too peaceful;
you had domesticated me!

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:15.778
I-- I suddenly had
a family, of all things.

00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:18.918
And it didn't
feel so terrible.

00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:21.089
I started to feel
comfortable living on Earth.

00:09:21.122 --> 00:09:25.698
Living out a life
of peace and serenity.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.502
But surrendering
to Babidi's magic

00:09:27.535 --> 00:09:29.138
was a price I was willing to pay

00:09:29.171 --> 00:09:33.179
if it meant I could
be my old self again!

00:09:33.213 --> 00:09:35.585
[chuckles]

00:09:35.618 --> 00:09:40.695
And as a result,
I've never felt better.

00:09:40.728 --> 00:09:43.433
That isn't true
and you know it, Vegeta.

00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:45.404
[grunts]

00:09:45.437 --> 00:09:47.207
[grunts]

00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:03.640
[DABURA chuckles]

00:10:03.674 --> 00:10:05.678
The moment is almost
at hand, Master.

00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:09.185
Majin Buu will be free
of his prison once again!

00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:11.388
[laughs]

00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:12.758
He's coming out!

00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:16.666
At long last, I'll behold
my father's creation!

00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:18.837
Aah!

00:10:28.422 --> 00:10:31.696
[cries out]

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:39.344
[CROWD screams]

00:10:47.762 --> 00:10:50.568
Why are we shaking?
What the heck is going on?

00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:52.370
Dunno.

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:55.811
Well, Mr. Satan, if you're
gonna tell the crowd

00:10:55.844 --> 00:10:57.982
to remain calm,
now's a good time.

00:10:58.015 --> 00:11:00.454
Yeah, but--

00:11:00.487 --> 00:11:01.857
If you don't say something,

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.295
we're going to have a
full-scale panic on our hands.

00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:08.470
Besides, we haven't even awarded
you the prize money yet.

00:11:08.504 --> 00:11:10.674
Oooh yeah. About that.

00:11:10.707 --> 00:11:11.943
Not that it's at
the top of my list

00:11:11.976 --> 00:11:13.345
of considerations or anything,

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:16.586
but you should gimmie
that cash right away!

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.523
Huh? Without the
awards ceremony?

00:11:18.556 --> 00:11:19.692
Oh, I couldn't!

00:11:19.725 --> 00:11:21.997
Heya folks!
No need to run!

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.934
You have the one-and-only
Mr. Satan right here

00:11:23.968 --> 00:11:25.303
to protect you, don'tcha?

00:11:25.337 --> 00:11:27.642
Even if the world were
coming to an end around ya,

00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:29.077
there's absolutely
nothing to fear,

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.916
'cause Mr. Satan
has got your back!

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.023
[BOTH] Yeah, that's right.
He'll protect us!

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:36.593
[MAN 25B]
Long as we have Mr. Satan,

00:11:36.626 --> 00:11:38.395
there's nothing
to worry about, you guys!

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:41.235
[MAN 25C] The champ is here,
so we're in good hands!

00:11:41.268 --> 00:11:46.311
[CROWD] Satan rocks!
Satan rocks! Satan rocks!

00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:49.619
Satan rocks! Satan rocks!

00:11:49.652 --> 00:11:51.222
[MR. SATAN]
Yeah!

00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:55.430
[laughs]

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:56.599
[MR. SATAN]
Good job, brother!

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:58.770
That little speech
was a ten outta ten!

00:11:58.804 --> 00:12:02.010
Now, to get that cash
and head for the hills!

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.918
Mm. Something's
happening out there.

00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:08.089
It's some kinda threat,
worse than anything

00:12:08.122 --> 00:12:10.627
we've ever had to face before.

00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:12.030
What're we supposed to do?

00:12:12.063 --> 00:12:14.434
My little Goten's
flown off to who knows where,

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:16.873
and Gohan and Goku
were here, then they left,

00:12:16.907 --> 00:12:18.410
then they reappeared
and vanished!

00:12:18.443 --> 00:12:20.614
I can't take it anymore!

00:12:20.648 --> 00:12:22.150
[hollers]

00:12:35.877 --> 00:12:42.290
[air whooshing]

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.569
[GOTEN]
Wait up, Trunks! Come back!

00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:48.937
Huh? What is it, Goten?

00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:51.375
[GOTEN] Something weird
is going on around here.

00:12:51.409 --> 00:12:54.682
I'm also sensing a whole lot
of energy over there.

00:12:54.716 --> 00:12:56.118
[TRUNKS]
Yeah, I feel it, too.

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:57.822
And not only is it powerful,

00:12:57.855 --> 00:12:59.825
I've never felt
anything like it before.

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:01.061
[GOTEN]
Uh-huh.

00:13:01.094 --> 00:13:03.165
[TRUNKS] We can't be
in two places at once.

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:07.541
How'm I supposed to know
which direction to go? Huh.

00:13:07.575 --> 00:13:09.177
Huh?

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:16.258
[BIRDS cawing]

00:13:16.291 --> 00:13:17.528
Look at 'em go!

00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:19.699
How come they're
acting all crazy?

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.770
I don't know any more
than you do, Goten.

00:13:21.803 --> 00:13:24.307
Do you think it has
to do with Majin Buu?

00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:26.111
[GOTEN]
Uh-uh-nuh!

00:13:33.426 --> 00:13:37.166
[SUPREME KAI gasping]

00:13:41.141 --> 00:13:44.414
[laughs]

00:13:46.151 --> 00:13:48.990
[laughs]

00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:22.290
[BABIDI laughs]

00:14:22.324 --> 00:14:25.831
Dabura, he's coming out.
He's finally coming out!

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:27.434
Yes, indeed.

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:30.072
At last, the seal
on the ball has been broken!

00:14:30.106 --> 00:14:33.346
The legendary Majin Buu
is making his return!

00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:36.252
Finally! My father's creation
will fulfill its purpose

00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:39.959
once again by
destroying everything!

00:14:39.992 --> 00:14:42.832
Yes, sir.
This day is promising.

00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:44.936
[BABIDI] I've dreamt
of this day forever!

00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:49.979
Hurry up, Majin Buu!
Don't keep me waiting!

00:14:50.012 --> 00:14:52.450
[GOHAN] The energy Dad's been
putting out in his fight!

00:14:52.483 --> 00:14:56.526
It's incredible! It's beyond
even Super Saiyan levels.

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:58.329
[SUPREME KAI hollers]

00:14:58.362 --> 00:15:01.235
But because of it, Majin Buu is
about to be unleashed again!

00:15:01.268 --> 00:15:05.109
Gohan! This is hopeless!
We have to run!

00:15:05.143 --> 00:15:08.148
We have to go now!
There's nothing we can do!

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:10.119
Huh? Whaddya mean
there's nothing we can do?

00:15:10.152 --> 00:15:11.389
If we just turn tail and run,

00:15:11.422 --> 00:15:13.326
Majin Buu's gonna
come out of that ball!

00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:16.131
And then we'll be in way worse
shape than we are right now!

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:17.401
Listen to me, Gohan!

00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:19.739
There is no one on Earth
who can stop him!

00:15:19.772 --> 00:15:22.210
Not you! Not me! Not anybody!

00:15:22.243 --> 00:15:24.916
There is not a person alive
who can defeat Majin Buu,

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:26.586
and if we don't
escape right now,

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.391
he'll destroy us as easily
as swatting a fly!

00:15:29.424 --> 00:15:31.529
But how can we just
give up, Supreme Kai?

00:15:31.562 --> 00:15:34.736
Our only chance at survival
is to flee! Now!

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:36.271
I'm not gonna run!

00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:38.008
You must!

00:15:38.777 --> 00:15:40.347
If he's already
reached full power,

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.352
then there's only
one thing left to do!

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:58.215
[bellows]

00:15:58.248 --> 00:16:00.452
What do you
think you're doing?

00:16:03.927 --> 00:16:08.803
[bellows]

00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:10.941
Uh, Dabura,
what's all this about?

00:16:10.974 --> 00:16:13.145
I'm not sure.

00:16:13.178 --> 00:16:16.418
I'll fight him
for as long as I can!

00:16:21.495 --> 00:16:24.668
[yells]

00:16:45.911 --> 00:16:49.619
[yells]

00:16:49.652 --> 00:16:51.288
What're you doing?

00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:55.329
[yells]

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:16.338
That impudent little--!
Do not worry, Master.

00:17:16.372 --> 00:17:19.612
I will go and destroy
that fool immediately.

00:17:19.646 --> 00:17:21.983
Good! But I'm not worried
in the slightest.

00:17:22.017 --> 00:17:23.987
It would take more than
this to make Majin Buu

00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:26.224
even break a sweat!

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.368
Ha-ha! Go right ahead!

00:17:31.402 --> 00:17:34.608
You just keep blasting until
you're blue in the face!

00:17:34.642 --> 00:17:36.746
Ha!

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:47.366
Here I go!

00:18:18.062 --> 00:18:19.264
[yells]

00:18:19.297 --> 00:18:23.773
Aah! Here he comes!
Time for Majin Buu!

00:18:23.806 --> 00:18:25.777
Yes, my master!

00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:39.270
[DABURA, BABIDI]
There's... nothing in it.

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:51.228
No. No way. This cannot
be happening to me.

00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:56.739
I open the ball
only to find nothing inside?

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:02.250
Come on out!

00:19:02.284 --> 00:19:04.756
I'm not going to accept
that you're destroyed!

00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:06.859
Please, Majin Buu!

00:19:06.893 --> 00:19:12.236
[SUPREME KAI laughs]

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.441
I can't believe our luck!

00:19:14.474 --> 00:19:16.278
Huh...

00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:18.950
I would hate to be
you right now, Babidi!

00:19:18.983 --> 00:19:20.821
Gohan's attack
reduced Majin Buu

00:19:20.854 --> 00:19:22.256
all the way down to nothing.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.893
He probably
shriveled up while he was

00:19:23.926 --> 00:19:25.496
in the ball for all those years.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.467
No matter how much energy
you pumped into him,

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.740
he was never going to be
as strong as he once was.

00:19:32.443 --> 00:19:36.251
And so your evil plans
have come to an end!

00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:40.860
Please, my master,
do not act like all is lost.

00:19:40.894 --> 00:19:44.502
Even without Majin Buu,
I am still right here.

00:19:44.535 --> 00:19:47.273
And Vegeta is still
a very powerful weapon,

00:19:47.306 --> 00:19:50.312
even if he is not entirely
under your control.

00:19:50.345 --> 00:19:53.085
But he destroyed my Majin Buu!

00:19:53.118 --> 00:19:55.423
My father's greatest creation!

00:19:55.456 --> 00:19:58.597
Look at him! Tearing up
because he didn't get his way!

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.168
[laughs]

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.537
Listen very carefully.

00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:04.875
I want you to
take the Supreme Kai

00:20:04.908 --> 00:20:06.947
and crush him flat as a pancake!

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.649
Gladly.

00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:11.154
[SUPREME KAI]
Here's the plan, Gohan.

00:20:11.187 --> 00:20:13.425
I will take care
of Babidi myself.

00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:16.131
Meanwhile, you face off
against Dabura again.

00:20:16.164 --> 00:20:17.500
Once we've defeated them both,

00:20:17.535 --> 00:20:19.237
this wizard is
going to be a threat

00:20:19.271 --> 00:20:20.874
to the universe no longer!

00:20:20.908 --> 00:20:23.445
Come! Now is the time
for you to get angry,

00:20:23.478 --> 00:20:24.982
as your father instructed you!

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:29.758
So tap into your rage and show
these villains your true power!

00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:30.828
Think of it, Gohan!

00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:33.733
This fight is moments away
from being over!

00:20:33.767 --> 00:20:37.708
No! It's not over!
It's wasn't enough!

00:20:37.741 --> 00:20:38.676
Huh?!

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.714
There's an energy,
a tremendous energy

00:20:40.747 --> 00:20:42.985
building up, even now!

00:20:43.018 --> 00:20:45.289
No, it can't be!

00:20:47.494 --> 00:20:50.332
What? What is this power
you're sensing, Gohan?

00:20:50.366 --> 00:20:52.203
--Talk to me!
--Look above us!

00:20:52.236 --> 00:20:54.141
The smoke that came out
of Majin Buu's ball

00:20:54.174 --> 00:20:56.044
when it opened just now!

00:21:01.354 --> 00:21:04.393
I've never felt
anything like it!

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.868
[gasps]

00:21:10.206 --> 00:21:12.210
Dabura! Look! Up there!

00:21:12.243 --> 00:21:15.048
Master! Could that cloud be--?

00:21:15.751 --> 00:21:17.521
Ah!

00:21:19.692 --> 00:21:22.062
Buu!

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.580
[NARRATOR] At last, Majin Buu
has made his fateful return.

00:21:30.613 --> 00:21:32.082
But is this odd-looking creature

00:21:32.116 --> 00:21:36.458
truly the legendary terror the
Supreme Kai claims him to be?

00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:39.765
Find out,
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:45.610
â™ª Closing Song â™ª

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.899
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:50.306
So, this Majin Buu guy
has finally been revived, huh?

00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:51.742
Be careful out there, Gohan!

00:22:51.775 --> 00:22:54.147
I'm picking up a really
evil vibe from him!

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.416
[SUPREME KAI]
That pudgy pink face!

00:22:55.449 --> 00:22:56.986
It's absolutely terrifying!

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.792
This is the end! There's
no way we can survive this!

00:22:59.825 --> 00:23:02.530
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:06.437 --> 00:23:09.043
[GOHAN] Majin Buu just
became even more powerful!
