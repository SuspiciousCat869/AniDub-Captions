[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.759
openVegeta realized
he had only one hope

00:00:12.793 --> 00:00:15.264
for stopping
the terror of Majin Buu,

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:17.368
but the cost would be high.

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:20.307
Take care, Trunks. All right?

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.252
No, what'd you do to him?
He was just trying to help!

[coughs]

00:00:28.123 --> 00:00:29.827
[NARRATOR]
Knowing how they would react,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.897
Vegeta knocked out
Goten and Trunks,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.035
then prepared to make his stand.

00:00:34.068 --> 00:00:36.306
Keep them safe, Piccolo.

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.578
That's it? You plan to die?

[NARRATOR] After chasing selfish
glory for most of his life,

00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:43.588
the Saiyan prince has chosen

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:47.562
to give up everything
to defeat Majin Buu.

[chuckles]

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:53.741
The key to defeating you
is to obliterate you

00:00:53.774 --> 00:00:57.883
so completely your regeneration
won't be possible.

Are you crazy?

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:36.065
It's too late now.
That's his life burning out.

You can sense that
way better than me.

You knew this
was coming. You told me!

For the first time in his life,
Vegeta fought for somebody else.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.418
That was his sacrifice
and his choice to make!

[CHICHI]
Are you sure, Videl?

00:04:03.554 --> 00:04:05.592
You know Gohan and
Goten both headed off

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:06.960
toward that horrible wizard?

00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:09.265
And you're positive they
didn't have some other plan,

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:11.804
or some place
they could've gone to?

00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:13.440
I am.

00:04:13.473 --> 00:04:15.143
Maybe you couldn't stop Gohan,

00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:18.349
but why wouldn't you keep Goten
and Trunks from following him?

00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:21.088
You should've stopped them!
This is your fault!

[VIDEL]
I'm sorry.

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:24.128
I never thought
the boys would go,

00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:25.798
and then it was just too late.

00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:28.638
Don't worry. Those kids
aren't the listening type.

00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:30.542
Even if you had
stopped them at first,

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:33.112
they would have snuck away
the first chance they got.

00:04:33.145 --> 00:04:34.582
[CHICHI]
Ugh.

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:36.319
[YAMCHA] Besides, they're the
world's strongest fighters.

It's all good!

00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:39.726
Right.

More importantly, are you sure
we're going the right direction?

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:44.503
Yeah. Straight ahead.
There's still a ways to go.

00:04:44.536 --> 00:04:47.575
All right, then let's
speed this baby up.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:56.760
[BULMA] Why, Vegeta? Why would
you do something like this?

00:05:02.437 --> 00:05:06.680
[BULMA] How could you
kill all of those people?

00:05:07.548 --> 00:05:10.353
Hey, it's okay.
Or at least it will be soon.

00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:12.725
That's what the Dragon Balls
are there for, right?

We'll bring all those
spectators back to life.

00:05:14.963 --> 00:05:17.100
It'll be like it never happened!

only thing I'm worried about?

I never thought
I'd see that again.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.678
He appeared to be consumed
with evil and hatred,

00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:41.583
like when he first came to our
planet all those years ago.

00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:44.021
Yeah. He sure seemed odd, huh?

00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:46.426
[BULMA] Could he really go back
to who he was before?

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:49.599
Has it been his nature
this whole time?

[PICCOLO] Krillin. It would be

Tell their family
for me when you see them.

Wait, which family?
Tell 'em what?

00:09:18.917 --> 00:09:22.691
I'm not sure about Goku.
In his state it's hard to tell.

00:09:22.725 --> 00:09:25.798
But it seems that Gohan was
murdered by Majin Buu.

Murdered? What?
No, that can't be!

what could have
caused that explosion?

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:02.705
[YAMCHA] Beats me.
But with shockwaves like that,

00:10:02.738 --> 00:10:05.276

[PICCOLO grunts]

00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:22.845

Vegeta.

00:11:03.894 --> 00:11:07.301
[PICCOLO] That must be why.
He realized Majin Buu could

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:10.172
absorb the damage
from any normal attack.

00:11:10.206 --> 00:11:12.244
Vegeta needed
a blast so enormous

00:11:12.277 --> 00:11:14.983
it would stop
Majin Buu's regeneration.

00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:17.387
And the only way to
release that kind of energy

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.792
was to blow himself to pieces.

00:11:19.826 --> 00:11:21.997
He sacrificed everything.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.503
For the first time
in your life, Vegeta,

00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:26.372
you fought for someone else.

00:11:26.405 --> 00:11:29.578
And you didn't leave one
trace of yourself behind;

00:11:29.612 --> 00:11:32.217

to mar your legacy.

00:15:20.206 --> 00:15:22.812
Do it now!
I command you to obey me!

[BUU]
Buu!

00:15:31.996 --> 00:15:35.437
[BABIDI laughs]
Great work, Majin Buu!

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.139
Ha! Ha!

00:15:37.173 --> 00:15:39.111
Those meddlesome
fighters have to pay

00:15:39.144 --> 00:15:40.915
for what they did to me!

00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:42.919
How dare they
lay their filthy hands

00:15:42.952 --> 00:15:46.025
on the future
ruler of the universe!

00:15:46.058 --> 00:15:48.195
That green one
and those two little brats

00:15:48.229 --> 00:15:50.266
are going to regret
getting involved.

00:15:50.299 --> 00:15:52.571
They'll wish they'd just
given up without a fight.

00:15:52.605 --> 00:15:55.778
I could have you wipe out this
whole planet with one attack.

00:15:55.811 --> 00:15:58.115
But that would be too swift.

00:15:58.148 --> 00:16:00.152
I want them to suffer
the full terror

00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:04.027
of the great Babidi
and Majin Buu.

00:16:15.216 --> 00:16:17.120
The whole world is at risk.

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:19.391
We'll take them to Kami's
Lookout where it's safer.

00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:22.464
Piccolo. What did
you see over there?

00:16:22.497 --> 00:16:25.369
What happened to
Vegeta and Majin Buu?

Oh no.
That's not a good growl.

Majin Buu survived
the explosion.

00:16:33.754 --> 00:16:37.159
No. But how? And Vegeta?

00:16:37.193 --> 00:16:40.199
There wasn't
any trace of him left.

[KRILLIN]
What are you saying?

00:16:41.603 --> 00:16:44.375
That Vegeta's death
was all for nothing?

00:16:44.408 --> 00:16:46.245
Let's just get
these boys to the Lookout,

00:16:46.278 --> 00:16:48.683
we don't have time to dwell.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.194
These two are the only
beacons of hope

00:16:54.227 --> 00:16:58.770
this world has left. And it's
a very slim hope at that.

00:17:09.124 --> 00:17:10.860
Let the suffering begin.

00:17:10.894 --> 00:17:14.401
Turn this world
into a living hell!

00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:17.106
Until those fools
find the courage to show up,

00:17:17.139 --> 00:17:20.647
I want you to blaze a path
of total destruction!

Sure is! Do you
have any senzu beans?

00:18:20.901 --> 00:18:24.040
We already gave some to Goku,
and those were our last three!

00:18:24.074 --> 00:18:25.944
You guys are getting
greedier with age!

00:18:25.977 --> 00:18:28.182
Yeah, and you're getting
even more rude.

00:18:28.216 --> 00:18:30.219
You better step up
your game, Krillin!

I'll be watching and if you
screw things up, I'll know!

Sorry, I don't have
time to argue with

Damn you, Vegeta.
Taking the last senzu bean

00:19:04.354 --> 00:19:06.291
all for yourself.
And knocking me out

00:19:06.324 --> 00:19:08.697
just for the glory of
fighting Buu on your own.

How selfish can you be?

00:19:49.512 --> 00:19:51.414
I can still sense
Majin Buu's energy,

00:19:51.448 --> 00:19:53.352
but I don't feel
Vegeta's at all now.

00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:57.594
I hope he didn't get himself
killed trying to prove himself.

00:19:57.627 --> 00:20:00.433
And I'm not sensing
Gohan's energy either.

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:02.672
But I am picking up
Krillin and Piccolo at least,

00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:05.476
and it feels like
they're back to normal now.

tell me what's going on.
