[GOHAN]
What's wrong with me?

00:16:59.872 --> 00:17:01.509
I shouldn't be
afraid of these guys!

00:17:01.543 --> 00:17:04.716
If I don't do something now,
Majin Buu's gonna hatch!

00:17:04.749 --> 00:17:06.018
What's holding me back?

00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:08.690
[GOKU]
Gohan, you have to get angry.

00:17:08.723 --> 00:17:10.393
[GOHAN]
Dad! What is it?

00:17:10.426 --> 00:17:12.631
Listen to me, son.
When you make it to Babidi,

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:14.434
I want you to remember
your fight with Cell,

00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:17.073
and be sure to get just as angry
as you were that day.

00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:19.210
When you're mad, there's no one
in the whole universe

00:17:19.244 --> 00:17:23.553
who's stronger than you.
I know you can do this.

00:17:25.356 --> 00:17:28.462
[GOHAN] I am trying, Dad.
I'm trying to remember!

00:17:28.495 --> 00:17:33.472
But--But the fight with Cell,
that was so long ago.

00:17:34.174 --> 00:17:42.423
[GOHAN]
Ka-me-ha-me!

00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:45.363
Ha!

00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:49.304
[CELL]
No! This can't be!

00:17:49.337 --> 00:17:53.312
[yells]

00:17:57.453 --> 00:18:06.137
[CELL]
This can't be! I am perfection!

00:18:09.746 --> 00:18:11.481
[GOHAN]
Damn it!

00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:17.027
[GOHAN]
I don't have time for this!

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:21.502
Ready or not,
I have to try. Right now!

00:18:36.833 --> 00:18:39.404
[laughs]

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.549
Good, Kakarot!
Most impressive!

00:19:01.583 --> 00:19:04.254
It seems your training
in Otherworld has paid off!

00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:05.657
I've learned
a few tricks, sure.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.495
But I guess we could say
the same thing about you!

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.865
Heh.

00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:14.307
[VEGETA yells]

00:19:21.455 --> 00:19:23.593
[yells]

00:19:31.074 --> 00:19:33.513
C-Could it be?

00:19:35.316 --> 00:19:39.490
But so soon, I...
don't believe it!

00:19:42.063 --> 00:19:44.568
[yells]

00:19:46.205 --> 00:19:48.676
No! We're too late!

00:19:51.883 --> 00:19:56.424
[gasps]

00:19:56.457 --> 00:19:59.430
Master Babidi,
what is going on?

00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:05.844
It's-- He's full--
He's at full power.

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:14.494
Majin Buu is at full power!
His full power!

00:20:17.635 --> 00:20:19.303
[BABIDI]
It's really happening!

00:20:19.337 --> 00:20:22.210
Buu is finally
coming back to life!

00:20:22.243 --> 00:20:26.953
[laughs intensely]

00:20:26.986 --> 00:20:28.388
It's too soon!

00:20:28.422 --> 00:20:31.294
How can he be full on
Goku's damage energy alone?

00:20:31.327 --> 00:20:32.998
It's impossible!

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.535
[BABIDI laughs]

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:36.305
[GOHAN]
No. It's not!

00:20:36.338 --> 00:20:38.241
This whole time,
Dad has been fighting

00:20:38.275 --> 00:20:41.582
at a level beyond Super Saiyan--
Dad and Vegeta both!

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:43.620
And when two powers
like that collide,

00:20:43.653 --> 00:20:45.455
with as much energy
as they're putting out--

00:20:45.489 --> 00:20:47.761
the damage has
got to be enormous!

00:20:47.795 --> 00:20:48.864
No!

00:20:48.897 --> 00:20:51.702
We did it, Dabura!

00:20:51.735 --> 00:20:54.943
At last, Master.

00:20:54.976 --> 00:20:56.411
I don't believe this!

00:20:56.444 --> 00:20:59.384
This is the worst-case-scenario
I was trying to avoid!

00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:02.691
How could I have failed
so completely?

00:21:18.188 --> 00:21:19.892
[NARRATOR]
Sooner than expected,

00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:23.465
Majin Buu is on
the verge of being freed!

00:21:23.498 --> 00:21:27.508
But with Goku and Vegeta still
locked in their own battle,

00:21:27.541 --> 00:21:29.344
when the monster emerges

00:21:29.377 --> 00:21:32.249
will there be
anyone there to stop him?

00:21:32.283 --> 00:21:37.794
A new terror awakens,
next Dragon Ball Z Kai!

00:21:40.266 --> 00:21:45.442
♪ Opening Song ♪

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.200
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:48.670
This isn't looking too good.

00:22:48.703 --> 00:22:50.674
I've still got my hands
full with Vegeta,

00:22:50.707 --> 00:22:52.042
and thanks to our fighting,

00:22:52.076 --> 00:22:54.715
Majin Buu is already charged
up and ready to hatch!

00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:56.484
[SUPREME KAI] This should
have never happened!

00:22:56.518 --> 00:22:59.959
I miscalculated at every turn!
It's all my fault!

00:22:59.992 --> 00:23:02.931
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:06.606 --> 00:23:09.578
[GOHAN] Right. Nothing left
to do now but go for broke!
