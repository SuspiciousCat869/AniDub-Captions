before I can recover
and do this again!

00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:41.302
[SUPER BUU] I couldn't
have him power down as soon as

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:46.378
I absorbed him. I needed his
full strength to deal with you.

00:11:46.412 --> 00:11:48.617
Luckily, I only had to wait
an hour before he could

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.590
transform into this
"Super Gotenks" again.

00:11:51.623 --> 00:11:54.929
That's why I blew myself up,
to buy him time.

00:11:55.832 --> 00:11:57.802
I should've known
it was all a trick.

00:11:57.835 --> 00:11:59.906
But then, it doesn't
seem like this great plan's

00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:01.375
made you any smarter.

00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:04.114
A wise fighter wouldn't be
telling all this to his enemy.

00:12:04.148 --> 00:12:06.152
And if you really wanted
to become invincible,

00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:07.822
then you should have
used your cowardly little

00:12:07.855 --> 00:12:10.092
sneak attack to
absorb me instead.

00:12:10.126 --> 00:12:14.201
[SUPER BUU laughing]
You really don't get it, do you?

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.072
What's the point
of being the strongest

00:12:16.105 --> 00:12:18.309
if there's no one to fight?

00:12:33.005 --> 00:12:35.443
It's just like the
previous Majin Buu said.

00:12:35.476 --> 00:12:38.917
I'm going to kill you in battle,
no matter what it takes.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.355
Nothing less
will satisfy me now.

00:12:41.388 --> 00:12:43.894
Okay then. You want a fight?

00:12:43.927 --> 00:12:45.998
--Then let's go.
--Let's.

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:48.837
Although it appears I'm going
to have to make this quick.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.576
I can feel that the time limit
on Super Gotenks' power

00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:52.978
is even shorter than I thought,

00:12:53.012 --> 00:12:55.483
and I don't want to take
any chances against you.

00:12:55.517 --> 00:12:58.824
That's some pretty solid
reasoning for a guy like you.

00:12:58.857 --> 00:13:00.761
I guess Piccolo's
intelligence is starting

00:13:00.794 --> 00:13:03.365
to rub off on you, after all.

00:13:14.287 --> 00:13:18.062
This fight ends
in death. I swear.

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:23.940
Don't worry, I'm okay with that.

00:13:23.974 --> 00:13:25.877
I'll make it yours.

00:13:48.022 --> 00:13:50.493

Huh?

[SUPER BUU]
Heh.

00:15:18.468 --> 00:15:21.543
[MR. SATAN] Uh, hey there,
friendly little green fella.

00:15:21.576 --> 00:15:23.145
Uh. Me?

00:15:23.178 --> 00:15:25.884
Did you see all of that?
Uh, with your eyes?

00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:27.253
What, you mean the fight?

00:15:27.286 --> 00:15:29.324
Yes, of course--
aren't you watching it, too?

00:15:29.358 --> 00:15:31.829
So they were fighting--
I mean, I assumed so.

00:15:31.863 --> 00:15:33.199
But if you can
follow all of that,

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:34.602
you're clearly not a human.

00:15:34.636 --> 00:15:37.174
So are you like an alien
observing us, or what?

00:15:37.207 --> 00:15:40.213
Well, yes. That's one way
you could describe my job.

00:15:40.246 --> 00:15:42.183
What? Well, if you
have been watching us

00:15:42.217 --> 00:15:44.187
you've probably heard of me,
'cause I'm the one and only

00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:47.060
martial arts champion
of the world, Mr. Satan.

00:15:47.093 --> 00:15:49.031
Good to know ya.

00:15:49.064 --> 00:15:52.470
Thanks. The pleasure's
mine, I guess.

00:15:58.449 --> 00:16:00.988
[SUPER BUU]
Ha! You're still holding back.

00:16:01.021 --> 00:16:04.628
You know it will
take more to kill me.

00:16:04.662 --> 00:16:07.200
Trying to test my abilities
first before you show

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:10.239
your full hand,
is that what you're up to?

00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:13.814
Piccolo's definitely
helping you out up here, huh?

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:16.084
Now you can see through
all of my tactics.

00:16:16.117 --> 00:16:18.824
Tch! You're making this tricky.

00:16:18.857 --> 00:16:21.028
[SUPER BUU]
Hmph.

00:16:21.061 --> 00:16:24.935
All right, Buu. I guess
it's time to get serious.

00:16:24.969 --> 00:16:26.772
Your move.

That's what he called it, right?

packs a lot more punch.

to you, didn't he?
