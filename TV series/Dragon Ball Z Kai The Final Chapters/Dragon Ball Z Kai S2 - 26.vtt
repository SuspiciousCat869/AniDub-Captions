his rematch with Vegeta

seemed that Gohan had succeeded,

and that the threat
of Majin Buu had evaporated

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:11.711
in a puff of harmless smoke.

But what powers does this
bizarre creature possess?

00:14:11.502 --> 00:14:13.305
or anybody else!

00:14:14.975 --> 00:14:16.111
You're lying!

00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:19.017
You care about 'em a lot!

00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:29.204
No matter
how much you hate it,

00:14:29.237 --> 00:14:32.043
you still have
a soul in there, Vegeta.

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:49.979
All right.
I'll defeat you later.

00:14:50.013 --> 00:14:53.118
You're so distracted by that
Majin Buu at the moment

00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:55.724
beating you now
just seems unfair.

00:14:55.758 --> 00:14:56.993
Now you're talking!

00:14:57.027 --> 00:14:59.464
Hand over one of those
senzu beans, would you?

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:03.206
I mean, we both burned through
a lot of our energy just now.

00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:05.243
Sure.

00:15:05.276 --> 00:15:08.983
If we fight as one, I'm sure
we can take out Majin Buu.

00:15:10.921 --> 00:15:12.625
[GOKU chuckles]
[VEGETA grunts]

00:15:12.658 --> 00:15:16.933
[groans]

00:15:29.424 --> 00:15:30.561
So nalve.

00:15:30.594 --> 00:15:34.300
How could you have possibly
survived this long?

00:15:43.586 --> 00:15:49.164
[VEGETA bellows]

00:15:57.313 --> 00:16:00.486
That creature is out
of his prison because of me.

00:16:00.521 --> 00:16:04.228
I'll take him down.

00:16:04.261 --> 00:16:08.236
And then we'll
pick up where we left off.

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:13.145
Heh. Well, that is,
if I'm in one piece.

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:37.293
[BABIDI] That was just lovely!
Now, you listen to me!

00:16:37.326 --> 00:16:39.565
I give you orders,
you follow 'em!

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.903
I'm your new master
and you're my servant!

00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:43.339
It's as simple as that!

00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:44.843
Blaaah!

00:16:44.876 --> 00:16:47.046
[growls]

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.618
Bla-la-la-la-la-la.

00:16:49.652 --> 00:16:52.658
Say. Are you sure
you want to disrespect me?

00:16:52.691 --> 00:16:54.127
[BUU]
Ah?

00:16:54.161 --> 00:16:57.267
I took a very careful look
through my father's notebook.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.708
I know the incantation
to put you back in that ball.

00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:01.943
Uh oh.

00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:03.379
[BABIDI] You wanna go
back into timeout?

00:17:03.412 --> 00:17:07.955
Does that sound good
to you? Huh? Does it?

00:17:07.989 --> 00:17:09.893
Aah!

00:17:09.926 --> 00:17:11.194
[laughs]

00:17:11.228 --> 00:17:15.469
Yes! I do believe that
we're getting somewhere!

00:17:16.004 --> 00:17:17.474
[GOHAN]
Supreme Kai.

00:17:17.508 --> 00:17:20.547
Watching Majin Buu, he seems
like he's just an overgrown kid.

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:23.052
If we can take out Babidi
before he reacts,

00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:24.989
what're the odds
Buu will just hop around

00:17:25.023 --> 00:17:26.626
on one foot or something?

00:17:26.659 --> 00:17:27.928
No! Don't do it!

00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:30.466
If we take out Babidi, there's
no one left in the universe

00:17:30.499 --> 00:17:34.040
who can seal Buu back in that
spherical prison of his!

00:17:34.073 --> 00:17:35.945
If you look past his
benevolent appearance,

00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:38.617
you'll see Buu for
the monster he truly is!

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.689
Given time, he'll start to
chafe at Babidi's orders,

00:17:41.722 --> 00:17:44.027
at which point the wizard
will have no recourse

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.664
but to seal him away again!

00:17:45.698 --> 00:17:50.574
All we can do is try and
survive until that happens!

00:17:50.608 --> 00:17:52.177
I'm the Supreme Kai,

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.247
but in a moment like this
where people's lives

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.155
are in mortal danger,
I can't do anything!

00:17:58.188 --> 00:18:00.426
It wasn't supposed
to end like this.

00:18:00.459 --> 00:18:02.564
I was confident that
we could defeat Babidi

00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:05.169
and keep Majin Buu
from being revived.

00:18:05.202 --> 00:18:08.442
If only I had known there
were mortals like you--

00:18:08.476 --> 00:18:11.381
mortals whose power eclipsed
my own so completely,

00:18:11.414 --> 00:18:13.285
who laughed off the
warriors I thought to be

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:17.695
well-nigh invincible-- we
could've done this another way!

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:20.232
Wait, so there was a plan B?

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:22.470
Yes. There was.

00:18:22.504 --> 00:18:24.174
But it doesn't
really matter now,

00:18:24.207 --> 00:18:26.178
as it's far too late to try it.

00:18:26.212 --> 00:18:28.783
Honestly? I doubt
we'll survive this.

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:30.285
[GOHAN]
How can you say that?

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:32.991
I'm not throwing in the towel,
and neither are you!

00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:34.929
[BABIDI]
All right!

00:18:34.962 --> 00:18:38.269
Now, my servant!
I have a task for you!

00:18:38.302 --> 00:18:40.574
I want you to kill them dead!

Don't be afraid. There's no
way he's catching up to us!

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.670
Well? What're you
standing around for?

00:18:55.704 --> 00:18:58.877
They're getting away, Buu!

Wa-laaa!
