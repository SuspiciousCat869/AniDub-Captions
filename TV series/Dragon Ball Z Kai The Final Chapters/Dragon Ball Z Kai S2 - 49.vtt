[NARRATOR] With his
seemingly limitless powers,

Majin Buu tore
through dimensions

When your mind wanders

wherever you are!

00:14:36.719 --> 00:14:39.625
Come on, Majin Buu, I know
it'll take more than that

00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:41.997
to take you out
once and for all!

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.466
Let's hurry it up!

00:14:43.499 --> 00:14:46.004
I can only hold this
awesome power level

before I have to change back!

or you'll destroy
the whole planet!

So what if I do?

00:16:26.973 --> 00:16:29.278
There's nobody down there
anymore, remember?

00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:31.081
[PICCOLO] And do you remember
that the Dragon Balls

00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:32.985
are still scattered
across the globe?

00:16:33.018 --> 00:16:34.321
If you destroy even one of them,

we will never be able
to return Earth

Oh. I forgot.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.576
[GOTENKS] Well, at least I've
already done enough damage

00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:46.078
to seriously weaken Buu.

00:16:46.111 --> 00:16:48.115
He should be
a cinch to beat now.

weaken him at all!

No, you're wrong. He is weaker.

been worn down some.
