Seven years have
passed since Cell's defeat.

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:15.230
Now, Gohan has enrolled in a
high school in Satan City,

00:00:15.263 --> 00:00:18.036
intent on living like
any other teenager.

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:20.040
But his extraordinary
abilities are going

00:00:20.073 --> 00:00:23.447
to single him out,
whether he likes it or not!

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.817
Yeah!

[ROBBER 1D groans]

00:00:40.314 --> 00:00:41.650
Ha!

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.163
[VIDEL] Huh?
[GOHAN yells]

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:50.400
I flew all this way for nothing.

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:52.739
Y'know, Miss Videl, it was that

00:00:52.772 --> 00:00:54.743
Golden Warrior, as plain as day.

00:00:54.777 --> 00:00:56.179
The Golden Warrior?

00:00:56.212 --> 00:00:57.849
I know it sounds crazy,
but I think he might

00:00:57.883 --> 00:01:00.755
be one of your classmates
over at Orange Star High School!

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:01.657
Huh?

00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:02.558
He had a school badge on,

00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:04.796
same as the
one you've got there.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.969
[NARRATOR] On Gohan's
first day of school,

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.875
rumors of a "Golden
Warrior" were already

00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:12.613
making their way
through the classroom.

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:13.881
Gohan!

00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:16.587
The Golden Warrior was wearing
a badge from this high school.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.996
A white shirt with a black vest,
and brown slacks.

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:23.668
And you're wearing
the same exact stuff!

00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:26.606
It's just a coincidence!

00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:30.413
What is up with this guy?

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:39.867
[gasps]

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.870
Wha--? Where did he--?

00:01:49.686 --> 00:01:52.157
[GOHAN] School was
tougher than I thought!

00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:55.196
And I had better fix the
Golden Warrior thing, quick!

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.436
My not having blond hair
won't fool them forever.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.440
I wonder if Bulma
can help me out!

00:02:00.473 --> 00:02:04.048
[NARRATOR] Can Bulma really keep
Gohan's alter-ego hidden away?

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:06.218

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.602
So, you want to
keep crime-fighting,

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:56.740
but you don't want the
people to know who you are.

00:03:56.773 --> 00:03:58.844
Uh-huh. I was headin'
home from school

00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:01.082
and I thought I'd stop by and
pick your brain about it--

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.987
what with you being
so smart and all.

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:05.357
Do you
have any ideas for me?

00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:08.764
But of course! I am
a genius you know.

00:04:08.798 --> 00:04:10.869
What if I whip up
a superhero outfit for you

00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:13.072
then break it down
to the molecular level.

00:04:13.106 --> 00:04:14.509
I can put it in
a capsule so you can

00:04:14.543 --> 00:04:15.845
equip it in the
blink of an eye.

00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:16.980
You can really do that?

00:04:17.013 --> 00:04:19.452
Yeah, Bulma! Something
like that would be great!

00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:21.489
You know Gohan,
most high school students

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:22.992
with extra time on their hands

00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:24.763
just joing a club or something.

00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:26.667
Make yourself at home.
Putting together your suit

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.571
shouldn't take more than
a couple of hours.

00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:30.575
Couple of hours is all
it's gonna take you?

00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:32.311
You're doing me
a huge favor with this.

00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:34.281
I really owe you one.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:35.618
You just sit tight, okay.

00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:38.055
Hey, uh. I was thinking,
maybe I could

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:39.626
hang out with Trunks
while I wait.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.830
I already did plenty of
sitting around in class.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:44.503
I'm not sure what he's up to,
but Vegeta's probably putting

00:04:44.536 --> 00:04:46.640
him through his paces over
in the Gravity Room.

00:04:46.673 --> 00:04:48.744
Huh? Vegeta's
training him now?

00:04:48.778 --> 00:04:51.015
Yeah, he said any son of
his is going to know how

00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:52.652
to dominate his foes in a fight,

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:55.257
even if he is surrounded
by us weaklings.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.560
I don't think he'll
let up on him until

00:04:56.593 --> 00:04:58.396
Trunks is even
stronger than you are!

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:00.000
[GOHAN chuckles]

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:01.837
He'll be one strong little kid!

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.410
So, if I were the Gravity Room,
where would I be?

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.114
Aha!

00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:09.318
How's it going, Trunks?

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.423
Whoa! Hey, Gohan!

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:12.558
Have you been here long?

00:05:12.592 --> 00:05:14.696
Only for a couple minutes.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.165
Lemme guess.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.169
Did you and your dad just
finished up a training session?

00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:19.739
[TRUNKS]
Yup!

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.354
[GOHAN] Uh.
Good afternoon, Vegeta.

00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:28.658
I hope I'm not intruding.

00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:29.993
Yeah.

00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:33.366
Look at you.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.070
When was the last
time you trained?

00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:39.278
Just because things are peaceful
now is no excuse to get lazy.

00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:41.015
Yessir.

00:05:42.853 --> 00:05:43.754
Hey!

00:05:43.787 --> 00:05:45.156
You feel like playing
a game with me?

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:47.394
Huh? Yeah, sure!

00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:49.031
[BULMA] Your suit's
all done, Gohan!

00:05:49.064 --> 00:05:50.801
Come and get it!

00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:58.817
So all I have to do to get the
suit is press the red button?

00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.920
Easy, huh?

00:05:59.953 --> 00:06:00.888
That's awesome!

00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:03.760
I want you to make
me one just like it!

00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:11.275
Whoa! This is exactly
what I wanted!

00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:12.679
So you like it?

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:13.714
Like it?

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:14.583
I love it!

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:16.821
This outfit's perfect!

00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:20.093
Y'know Mom,
on second thought, I'm good.

00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:23.066
Thanks again, Bulma!

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:24.468
Good seeing you, Trunks!

00:06:24.502 --> 00:06:26.005
[TRUNKS]
See ya later, Gohan!

00:06:26.038 --> 00:06:29.946
Come back soon so we
can play some more, okay?

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:32.952
It's time to head home,
Flying Nimbus!

00:06:32.986 --> 00:06:36.191
Might as well go full speed,
since it's getting late.

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.469
Now I can fight crime without

00:06:41.503 --> 00:06:43.840
anybody figuring
out that it's me!

00:06:48.082 --> 00:06:49.418
Wait a second!

00:06:49.452 --> 00:06:52.124
Since no one will know
who's in the superhero suit,

00:06:52.157 --> 00:06:53.359
I could even wear it to fly

00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:55.865
to school and back
each day, huh!

00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:57.736
Hey, Flying Nimbus,
you feel like having

00:06:57.769 --> 00:07:00.206
a race to see who
can get home quicker?

00:07:03.146 --> 00:07:04.850
Let's do it!

00:07:05.183 --> 00:07:08.590
Ready, set, go!

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:26.726
C'mon, stop being a slowpoke!

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.999
I'm about to go
even faster, Nimbus!

00:07:38.918 --> 00:07:39.953
[laughs]

00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:43.527

yourself killed?

Did you appear outta
thin air or something?

00:08:27.181 --> 00:08:29.586
Driving at that speed
is far too dangerous!

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:31.723
You could hurt
someone else, or yourself!

Stop making fun of me!

00:09:38.356 --> 00:09:42.130

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:38.042
You remind me so much of
your father at times like this.

00:10:38.811 --> 00:10:41.716
[GOTEN] Hey, Mom!
Look at what I caught!

00:10:41.749 --> 00:10:43.553
Wow, is that you, big brother?

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:45.023
Where'd you get
that awesome outfit?

00:10:45.056 --> 00:10:47.093
Glad to hear you like it, Goten!

00:10:47.127 --> 00:10:50.400

[crickets chirping]

00:11:13.112 --> 00:11:16.452
[GOHAN] I am justice's
unswerving chaperone.

00:11:16.485 --> 00:11:19.057
Great Saiyaman!

00:11:19.926 --> 00:11:21.763
I dunno--it's missing something.

00:11:21.796 --> 00:11:24.535
Maybe I should go with
that one from three tries ago.

00:11:24.569 --> 00:11:25.771
[GOTEN]
Hang in there, Gohan.

00:11:25.804 --> 00:11:27.040
You'll get it.

00:11:27.074 --> 00:11:28.142
Oh, yeah.

00:11:28.176 --> 00:11:30.146
I think I've got
a winner this time.

00:11:30.647 --> 00:11:31.883
The heavens call!

00:11:31.917 --> 00:11:33.085

The crowd roars!

Telling me to
strike down malice!

00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:36.993
Look upon my helmet and

00:11:37.027 --> 00:11:38.931
know that I
will forgive no evil!

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:41.402
Know now that I am invincible!

00:11:41.435 --> 00:11:43.239
The ultimate hero!

00:11:43.607 --> 00:11:46.713
Great Saiyaman!

00:11:46.913 --> 00:11:49.217
Yeah. I nailed it.

00:11:49.719 --> 00:11:50.921
[GOTEN]
Wow, Gohan!

00:11:50.955 --> 00:11:53.225
That one was the
coolest one of all!

[door handle clicks]
[CHICHI] Gohan!

00:11:55.096 --> 00:11:56.767
Time to hit the hay,
don't you think?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.336
The last thing we
need is for you to sleep

00:11:58.369 --> 00:12:00.608
through your alarm on
the second day of school.

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.945
I'm not gonna oversleep, Mom.

00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:07.020
[GOHAN]
Okay, I'm off!

00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:10.093
[GOTEN] Have a
lotta fun at school!

00:12:10.126 --> 00:12:11.362
Oh, and Gohan.

00:12:11.395 --> 00:12:12.899
Be careful while you're flying.

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:14.669
And try to watch out for planes.

00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:16.204
Uh-huh.

00:12:18.475 --> 00:12:20.548
[GOHAN chuckles]

00:12:20.581 --> 00:12:22.017
That suit is the best!

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.889
You look so awesome, Gohan!

00:12:26.191 --> 00:12:27.795
It is pretty cool.

00:12:27.828 --> 00:12:29.665
If you're good, I'll ask
Bulma to make you an

00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:32.771

one of these days!

00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:37.014
[GOHAN] Flying Nimbus
is yours now!

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:38.583
Take good care of 'im!

00:12:38.616 --> 00:12:40.320
Your brother
sure is happy today.

00:12:40.353 --> 00:12:42.925
He transformed over
and over all morning.

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.564
My brother is the coolest!

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:50.073
[NARRATOR] This is Goten,
the younger brother of Gohan,

00:12:50.106 --> 00:12:53.012
and the spitting image
of his father, Goku.

00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:56.385
Born in the months after
Goku's heroic sacrifice

00:12:56.418 --> 00:12:58.990
to win the battle against Cell.

00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:05.537
[GOHAN] At this rate,
I'm gonna make it to school

00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:07.340
in 20 minutes flat!

00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:47.387
This is gonna work out great!

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.426
Guess I'll get to sleep in a
little bit later on school days.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.832
[TEACHER] As I believe
I've mentioned before,

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:56.038
a covalent bond is
formed when an electron

00:13:56.072 --> 00:13:58.811
inhabits the electron shells
of two different atoms.

00:13:58.844 --> 00:14:00.313
Hey! Have you heard yet?

00:14:00.346 --> 00:14:01.749
Word on the streets
is that a brand-new

00:14:01.783 --> 00:14:03.587
superhero popped up
in town yesterday!

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.793
Sure hope the Golden Warrior
likes having competition!

00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:08.429
Guess we'll see, huh?

00:14:08.463 --> 00:14:09.330

00:14:09.364 --> 00:14:10.834
[GOHAN]
He's right behind you, guys!

00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:12.137
His outfit is a
train-wreck,

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.274
but the guy is supposed
to be crazy strong!

00:14:14.308 --> 00:14:17.614
He calls himself Great
Mayo Man, or something.

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:18.884
Hey, no he doesn't!

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.788
His name is Great Saiyaman!

00:14:20.821 --> 00:14:22.524
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

00:14:23.526 --> 00:14:26.766
Uh, how do you know what
a superhero calls himself?

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.304
Uh... well...

00:14:29.337 --> 00:14:33.045
I heard it from a guy who
knows a guy who saw him?

00:14:33.078 --> 00:14:34.749
Mind if I continue
with the miracle

00:14:34.782 --> 00:14:37.955
of covalent bonds
down here, Gohan?

00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:43.700
[watch beeps]
[VIDEL] Huh?

00:14:43.733 --> 00:14:45.403
Videl here.
Go ahead, sir.

00:14:45.436 --> 00:14:47.708
[POLICEMAN 2] Videl.
There's been a bus-jacking!

00:14:47.742 --> 00:14:50.179
Down at the
East District terminal!

00:14:55.857 --> 00:14:57.427
Three armed robbers
stormed their way onto a

00:14:57.461 --> 00:14:59.799
senior citizens' tour bus
and are demanding

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.034
a ransom for their release!

00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:03.239
We need help ASAP--!

00:15:04.307 --> 00:15:06.278
Ya better make quick
with the cash, ya dig?

00:15:06.311 --> 00:15:07.247
Or the blue hairs
are headed for

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.017
the yellow tour bus in the sky!

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.621

You're our only hope, Videl!

Just hold on!

Sorry, Teach! I gotta go!

three for homework!

And be careful!

00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:21.241
So what was that
all about? I don't get it.

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:24.214
In her spare time, Videl
is kind of a superhero.

00:15:24.248 --> 00:15:25.450
Huh?

00:15:25.483 --> 00:15:26.819
That girl's a superhero?

00:15:26.853 --> 00:15:28.055
Well yeah.

00:15:28.088 --> 00:15:29.992
Her dad is Mr. Satan
and he saved the world

00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:31.261
all those years ago.

00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:32.932
I guess the apple didn't
fall far from the tree.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:35.002
'cause the cops always
ask her for help!

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:37.941
So she's...
going to a shootout?

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:39.077

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.314
Don't go underestimating
Videl, new kid.

00:15:41.348 --> 00:15:42.885
I'm strong and all,
but she makes me

00:15:42.918 --> 00:15:44.889
look like a
90-pound weakling.

00:15:44.922 --> 00:15:46.492
They say she's
as strong as her dad,

00:15:46.526 --> 00:15:49.665
and she's only getting stronger
with each passing day.

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:53.338
[GOHAN] They say Videl's
as strong as her dad, huh?

00:16:04.228 --> 00:16:06.900
Only Mr. Satan wasn't
the all-powerful hero

00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:10.272
everybody thinks he is! Hm.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:12.979

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:42.818
I wouldn't've missed
all this for the world!

00:20:42.851 --> 00:20:44.521
So, who are you?

00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:45.524
[chuckles]

00:20:45.557 --> 00:20:49.766
I am the unmitigated
champion of justice!

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:51.602
Who tolerates no evil!

00:20:54.307 --> 00:20:57.515
Great Saiyaman, at your service!

00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:59.985
Uh...

00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:05.029
[GOHAN] I'd say those
two hours of practice

00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:07.199
last night just paid off!

00:21:07.634 --> 00:21:10.005
[VIDEL] Wait.
This is Great Saiyaman?

00:21:10.038 --> 00:21:13.278
But his introduction was
the cheesiest thing ever!

00:21:13.312 --> 00:21:16.752
I'll leave the
rest to you, Videl.

00:21:16.785 --> 00:21:17.955
Be seeing you!

00:21:17.988 --> 00:21:20.392
[VIDEL] Hey, I never told
that guy what my name was!

[NARRATOR] Thanks to Gohan's
desire to help others,

00:21:25.637 --> 00:21:29.377
and Bulma's suit,
Great Saiyaman has been born!

00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:32.350
Trouncing thugs and
catching buses is easy enough,

00:21:32.383 --> 00:21:36.057
but can Gohan keep his
alter-ego a secret from Videl?

Hey! It's me--Goku!

Wow, helping people out sure
is keeping you busy, Gohan!

[GOHAN]
What can I say, Dad?

00:22:51.408 --> 00:22:53.011
Being a superhero
is a full-time job!

00:22:53.044 --> 00:22:55.282
[VIDEL] You may look like you
stumbled through a costume shop,

00:22:55.315 --> 00:22:58.590
Great Saiyaman, but there's
no doubting how strong you are.

00:22:58.623 --> 00:23:00.426
I'm gonna figure out
who's under that helmet,

you just wait!

[GOHAN] Being a
champion of justice

00:23:08.042 --> 00:23:09.678
is tougher than I thought!
