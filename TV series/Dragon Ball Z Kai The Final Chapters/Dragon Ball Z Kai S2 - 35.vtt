[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:12.191
Gohan found the strength
required to pull the Z Sword

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:15.097
from its rock, renewing hope
that the legendary weapon

00:00:15.197 --> 00:00:17.869
could be the answer
for defeating Majin Buu.

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:22.077
Back on Earth, Buu continued to
spread terror across the globe,

00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:25.819
turning whole cities into candy
and devouring them,

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.889
as Babidi hoped
the rampage would force

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.728
Piccolo and the boys
to surrender.

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:33.834
You have to master Fusion.
Do you understand?

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:36.372
[NARRATOR] High above in the
Lookout, Goten and Trunks

00:00:36.472 --> 00:00:39.011
began learning Fusion,
a technique that would

00:00:39.112 --> 00:00:41.382
give them extraordinary
new powers.

00:00:41.483 --> 00:00:44.288
But the stakes
were rising quickly.

00:00:44.388 --> 00:00:46.359
Great. Now we're really
running low on time,

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:48.898

turn Super Saiyan.

[BABIDI]
People of Earth!

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:53.206
I've received a critical
piece of information

00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:55.110

it seems the boy fighter
known as Trunks

00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:02.224
lives in a building with
the rather unique name

00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:05.865
of "Capsule Corporation"
in West City.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:08.270
I think we'll stop by.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.474
Consider this my call
letting you know.

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:13.347
Buu and I hope to see you
there, Trunks. If you're not,

00:01:13.447 --> 00:01:16.887

Don't worry,
we'll bring 'em back.

That's what we're saving the
Dragon Balls for, Bulma.

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:13.688
What about West City?

00:03:13.788 --> 00:03:15.256
They're gonna
burn it to the ground!

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:16.761

Huh?

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.306
The first wish brought
many people back to life,

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:25.511
and it took a heck of
a lot of power to do it.

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.665
Hmmm. Well, if
that's true, we'll say

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:39.272
"Shenron, make everything
the way it was!" He-heh.

00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:40.474
What do you think, guys?

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:42.612
That should pretty much
cover it, right?

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:46.319
It's possible.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.789
Yeah? You think so?

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.960
I wouldn't call it
extremely possible,

00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:53.499
But Goku, even if
that wish does work

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.370
we'll still have to find
the Dragon Balls first.

Fly back to your house as fast
as you can and get that Radar.

You can find it
in your mom's lab, right?

I'll distract Buu so he
doesn't destroy West City

You sure that's a good idea?

What if he gets you
like he did my dad?

You've still got
to teach us, right?

If that Radar's destroyed,
our whole plan could be shot.

talk to you like that?

00:09:04.488 --> 00:09:06.058
I'm the future ruler
of the universe!

00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:08.864

--[BUU grunts]

--Huh?

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:16.547
Don't look at me like that,

sealed up for
another million years!

00:09:18.617 --> 00:09:20.821
Buu no like your
mean old threats at all.

00:09:20.921 --> 00:09:24.094
You seal up Buu, you die!

[BABIDI]
Ungrateful, disobedient slug!

When did he start
thinking for himself?

00:09:30.307 --> 00:09:32.243
That's not acceptable!

00:09:33.647 --> 00:09:36.052
But Buu like fun.
Buu still kill!

00:09:36.152 --> 00:09:39.258

Mmmm...

00:09:45.904 --> 00:09:49.077
Now what way should
Buu make you die?

00:09:50.213 --> 00:09:53.119
Yes! Watch this, Earthlings!
You can learn a lot!

00:09:53.219 --> 00:09:55.023
I'm about to show you
exactly what happens

00:09:55.123 --> 00:09:57.829
when some poor brute
thinks he can defy me!

[bellows]

00:10:06.378 --> 00:10:08.717
That surge of power--
is that Dad's energy?

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:10.153
That's right.

00:10:10.253 --> 00:10:13.159
Your father's incredible
and this is only the start.

00:10:15.263 --> 00:10:16.800
That can't be!

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.574
Goten's dad has about
the same power as my dad did!

00:10:20.674 --> 00:10:22.845
He's amazing!

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:26.185

00:10:26.285 --> 00:10:28.189
Did you think that
would impress us?

00:10:28.289 --> 00:10:32.030
Vegeta tried the golden-hair
trick and it couldn't save him.

[laughs]

00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:35.738
You're right--
I'm sure Vegeta did go

00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:37.742
beyond Super Saiyan
when he fought Buu,

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:40.548
but I'm gonna show you
a level beyond that.

00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:42.317
Okay, do you have
a chart or something?

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:45.457
I'm getting lost and don't know
if I should be nervous.

00:10:45.558 --> 00:10:48.163

[CROWD cheering]

00:11:19.792 --> 00:11:21.996
[MR. SATAN]
People of Earth! I agree!

00:11:22.097 --> 00:11:25.704
I am the only one on this
planet capable of rescuing us!

00:11:25.804 --> 00:11:27.307
The responsibility isn't easy!

00:11:27.407 --> 00:11:29.311
Most would be crushed
by the pressure alone.

00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:32.618
But I've come to accept
that I'm no normal man!

00:11:32.718 --> 00:11:33.987
That's why I'm swearing to you,

00:11:34.087 --> 00:11:36.325
I'll save you from this monster!

00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:38.162
That's the duty of a hero!

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:40.266
We're counting
on you, Mr. Satan!

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.401
Marry me!

00:11:41.502 --> 00:11:43.073
Now ladies and gentlemen,
while I'd love to

00:11:43.173 --> 00:11:45.309
sign autographs
and kiss all your babies,

00:11:45.409 --> 00:11:47.849
I have to go back to my
selflessly intense training

00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:50.186
to defeat this beast!
So bye-bye for now,

00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:52.758

[MR. SATAN] Totally nailed it.
I'm so good, it's scary.

00:12:04.983 --> 00:12:07.655
But what if Buu hears
about my challenge

00:12:07.755 --> 00:12:09.224
and actually shows up here?

00:12:09.324 --> 00:12:11.295
I can't be a target
for that monster!

00:12:11.395 --> 00:12:13.366
Oh, yeah, I'll tell him
I'm training!

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:15.336
You can't interrupt a guy
when he's training.

00:12:15.436 --> 00:12:17.942
That's some kind of warrior
code or something, right?

[CROWD cheering]

00:12:36.646 --> 00:12:38.182
So, you can surpass Vegeta

00:12:38.282 --> 00:12:41.188
who already surpassed
Super-whatever.

00:12:41.288 --> 00:12:44.328
I should wear a wig and
call myself Super Babidi.

00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:45.865
This is all nonsense.

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:47.100
Hurry, Majin Buu.

00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:49.104
It's time to
take care of this joker.

00:12:49.204 --> 00:12:51.776
We've got a whole
city to destroy.

00:12:51.876 --> 00:12:55.851
[BUU] Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Ooh-hoo-hoo!

00:12:55.951 --> 00:12:57.922
[GOKU] To the naked eye,
he looks soft and weak.

00:12:58.022 --> 00:13:00.828
You'd think any of us
could beat him.

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:03.967
But Vegeta gave all he had
and accomplished nothing.

00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:06.171
Somehow, I've got to keep him
distracted long enough

00:13:06.271 --> 00:13:09.077
for Trunks to get that Radar.

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:25.811
I'm so nervous.
You think Trunks

00:13:25.911 --> 00:13:28.449
is at the Capsule
Corporation by now?

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.889
No. He's still on his way.

00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:37.868
[GOKU] Trunks' energy
isn't moving at all.

00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:40.607
Is he just standing still?

00:13:40.708 --> 00:13:42.912
I told him to go
as fast as he could.

00:13:43.012 --> 00:13:44.983
I was hoping I could stall
Buu long enough without

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:47.722
having to power up all the way.

00:13:47.822 --> 00:13:49.424
His energy's massive.

00:13:49.525 --> 00:13:51.630
And he left after I did
but he still got to them

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.165
in a blink of an eye.

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:55.671
How? Is that his
Instant Transmission technique?

00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:57.608
How's it work?

00:14:02.552 --> 00:14:04.522
Can you hear me? Hey!

00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:06.258
You need to get that Radar now!

00:14:06.358 --> 00:14:08.362
Right! Sorry!

Ah? Radar?

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.041
And who exactly
are you talking to?

00:14:14.141 --> 00:14:16.946
What's this Radar for?

00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:22.056
Forget about it.
It's not your concern.

00:14:22.156 --> 00:14:23.961
Is it possible
he's that strong?

00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:27.233
Can he really
be as powerful as Dad?

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.870
I guess there's
no time to find out,

00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:31.074
I've got to get
to that Radar first!

You tricky little buffoon.

00:14:33.913 --> 00:14:36.184

up some kind of scheme.

00:14:36.284 --> 00:14:37.555
Maybe so.

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:42.063
[GOKU] There's no choice. I've
got to hold their attention.

Huh?

00:14:46.372 --> 00:14:48.610
Why you stop power?
You giving up?

00:14:48.711 --> 00:14:52.384
[GOKU] No. I'm gonna give you
a lesson on Super Saiyans.

00:14:52.484 --> 00:14:55.023

you both understand.

00:14:58.596 --> 00:15:00.066
No one asked for a lesson.

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:02.538
We don't care about
your trivial moves.

00:15:02.638 --> 00:15:04.207
We'll see about that.

00:15:04.308 --> 00:15:09.417
First off, there's my normal
state that I'm in right now.

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:11.723
Then there's
my Super Saiyan form.

00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:13.492
Next up...

00:15:13.593 --> 00:15:15.329
This is what it looks like
when I push myself

00:15:15.429 --> 00:15:17.167
beyond the level
of Super Saiyan

00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:18.870
for even greater power.

00:15:18.971 --> 00:15:20.808
See? To make it
easy let's call this

00:15:20.908 --> 00:15:21.976
Super Saiyan Two.

00:15:22.076 --> 00:15:23.179
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:26.151
Ha! Looks like
window dressing to me.

00:15:26.251 --> 00:15:28.122
I'd hardly call you transformed.

Heh. There's more.

00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:32.665
I knew he pushed
beyond Super Saiyan

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:35.269
against Cell, but that was
the limit of his power.

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:36.940
Could there actually be more?

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.375
You're bluffing him,
right buddy?

00:15:38.475 --> 00:15:42.450
You must be. I mean how much
stronger can a guy get?

00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:12.538
I'm not used to making
this transformation yet.

00:19:12.638 --> 00:19:14.708
[BABIDI gasps]

00:19:14.809 --> 00:19:16.879
[BUU]
Oooh.

00:19:24.093 --> 00:19:27.466
Wow. He doesn't even
look like himself.

00:19:31.374 --> 00:19:33.747
[GOHAN gasps]

00:19:33.847 --> 00:19:35.483
That-That energy.

00:19:35.584 --> 00:19:38.757
It feels like it's Dad,
but is that even possible?

00:19:38.857 --> 00:19:40.895
It can't be. No.

00:19:40.995 --> 00:19:42.765
Yes. It's Goku for sure.

00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:44.100
[GOHAN]
Huh?

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.737
His energy's unmistakable.

00:19:45.837 --> 00:19:48.108
I don't understand how
he could have such power,

00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:49.311
but it's him.

00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:52.417
But... how could
it reach us out here?

00:19:52.518 --> 00:19:54.054
How could any power on Earth

00:19:54.154 --> 00:19:56.860
have the magnitude
to reach this sanctuary?

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.663
Dad. What is this?

00:19:58.763 --> 00:20:01.936
I just wish I knew what was
going on down there.

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:09.552
[BUU]
Mmm!

00:20:09.652 --> 00:20:11.956
[BABIDI grunts]

00:20:16.866 --> 00:20:20.406
Your face may have more
scary now, but Buu not afraid!

00:20:20.507 --> 00:20:22.711
I have to agree
with my simple servant.

00:20:22.811 --> 00:20:25.583
You can call yourself
Super-Whatever-You-Want!

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:27.855
You're just
trying to look tough!

00:20:27.955 --> 00:20:29.357
Take care of him, Buu.

00:20:29.457 --> 00:20:31.730
Let him know what we think
of his little show.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.169
Let's do this. I could use
a good battle test.

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:36.773
[laughs]

00:20:36.873 --> 00:20:38.509
Humans all across
the globe will be

00:20:38.609 --> 00:20:40.246
watching this through me.

00:20:40.346 --> 00:20:43.152
Give them a show, Buu!
Put him to shame!

00:20:43.252 --> 00:20:45.289
[laughs]

00:20:45.389 --> 00:20:48.128
[GOKU] Come on, Trunks.
Aren't you done yet?

00:20:48.228 --> 00:20:51.702
Crush him! Crush him now!

00:20:54.307 --> 00:20:55.844
Buu!

00:20:55.944 --> 00:20:58.281
Huh? Augh!

00:21:00.553 --> 00:21:02.825
Thatta boy, Goku!
Show him who's boss!

00:21:02.925 --> 00:21:04.695
Get 'em, Dad!

00:21:09.437 --> 00:21:12.109
[NARRATOR] Others have
pushed beyond Super Saiyan.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.682
But now Goku has
reached even higher

00:21:14.782 --> 00:21:19.691
to a level this world
has never seen.

00:21:19.791 --> 00:21:24.100
And this newfound power
can hardly be believed.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.739
[BUU grunts]

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:28.475
[NARRATOR]
With this transformation,

00:21:28.577 --> 00:21:32.249
perhaps Goku does have the
strength to defeat Majin Buu.

00:21:32.349 --> 00:21:37.426
It's time to find out.
Next Dragon Ball Z Kai.

00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:45.610
♪ Closing Song ♪

00:22:45.496 --> 00:22:47.032
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:50.306
I stalled Babidi and Majin Buu
as long as I could.

00:22:50.406 --> 00:22:52.343
Now I'm going to
show him the true power

00:22:52.443 --> 00:22:54.748
of Super Saiyan Three
and hope it's enough

00:22:54.848 --> 00:22:56.786
to buy Trunks the time he needs.

00:22:56.886 --> 00:23:00.326
[TRUNKS] Ah! I can't
find the Dragon Radar!

00:23:00.426 --> 00:23:02.931
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z Kai:

00:23:05.904 --> 00:23:08.108
[GOHAN] After all these years,
Dad still finds a way

00:23:08.208 --> 00:23:10.112
to surprise me!
