[GOKU whispers]
No, not yet.

00:16:49.752 --> 00:16:52.056
Huh. Here!

00:16:52.089 --> 00:16:54.260
Ah. Number one!

00:16:54.294 --> 00:16:56.799
Pan has drawn number one!

00:16:56.832 --> 00:16:59.838
Ooh, so Pan's number one, huh?

00:16:59.872 --> 00:17:02.143
Which means
she'll be fighting...

00:17:02.911 --> 00:17:04.247
No, it can't be!

00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:07.087
Of all people, why'd she
have to draw that giant?

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.661
I'm number one! I'm number
one! I'm number one!

00:17:10.694 --> 00:17:13.867
Next up we have a
former champion: Goku!

00:17:13.901 --> 00:17:15.402
Ah, it's about time!

00:17:15.436 --> 00:17:18.409
[GOKU]
Hm. What's still open?

00:17:18.442 --> 00:17:20.981
All right Buu, I need you
to give me number three.

00:17:21.014 --> 00:17:23.252
[BUU whispers]
Okay.

00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:25.991
Hey!

00:17:26.024 --> 00:17:27.561
It's been a while, Goku.
We've really missed

00:17:27.595 --> 00:17:30.667
having you at the tournament
these last couple of years.

[GOKU whispers]
Here we go.

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:39.885
[ANNOUNCER] And Goku
has drawn number three!

00:17:39.918 --> 00:17:43.527
Next up, Kirano.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.494
Cool.

Put him at... Let's see...

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:53.212
Make him number six, okay?

00:17:53.245 --> 00:17:54.481
[whispers]
Okey-doke.

00:17:54.515 --> 00:17:57.821
Wait. Really?
That guys not the one?

00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:07.608
Number six! Kirano has
pulled out number six!

00:18:07.641 --> 00:18:10.848
Right. Next... is Uub!

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:12.851
Aah! Me?

00:18:12.885 --> 00:18:14.087
[whispers]
Buu, number four.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.691
Change his ball to number four.

00:18:15.724 --> 00:18:17.694
After this kid draws,
no more cheating.

00:18:17.728 --> 00:18:18.997
[whispers]
Buu got it.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.466
Ah! No way!

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:23.305
That scrawny boy?
Get out of here!

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:24.609
[GOKU]
I've been waiting for this.

00:18:24.642 --> 00:18:27.080
The whole time I was off
by myself training,

00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:29.752
I was waiting for this kid
to enter the tournament.

00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:33.794
I have no clue what's going on.
So why don't you enlighten me?

00:18:33.827 --> 00:18:36.298
Ten years ago, right before
I finally defeated

00:18:36.332 --> 00:18:39.539
the purely evil version
of Buu, I made a wish.

00:18:39.572 --> 00:18:41.509
I wished for him to
come back as a good guy

00:18:41.542 --> 00:18:44.414
so we could fight again
without destroying the world.

00:18:44.448 --> 00:18:46.018
Well, it looks like
King Yama must've

00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:47.888
heard my wish
and decided to grant it.

00:18:47.922 --> 00:18:52.163
So, you're saying that child's
the reincarnation of Buu?

00:18:52.196 --> 00:18:55.135
Mhmm. I'm sure of it.
Don't know how,

00:18:55.169 --> 00:18:57.073
but I can just tell
that it's him.

00:18:57.107 --> 00:18:59.444
And look at his name.
It's "Uub," you get it?

00:18:59.478 --> 00:19:03.553
Read it backwards, it spells
"Buu." How 'bout that? Huh?

00:19:03.587 --> 00:19:06.324
Quite a coincidence,
don't you think?

00:19:07.293 --> 00:19:09.765
[UUB] Uh-oh. It looks like
Mom might have been right

00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:11.168
when she warned me.

00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:13.238
I might be the strongest
one in our village,

00:19:13.272 --> 00:19:14.809
but the world's
a really big place,

00:19:14.842 --> 00:19:16.979
and there are bound to be
a lot of people out there

00:19:17.013 --> 00:19:19.184
who are a whole lot
stronger than me.

00:19:19.217 --> 00:19:21.287
People like that guy.

00:19:24.127 --> 00:19:26.098
[UUB]
What am I supposed to do now?

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:29.772
I already told everybody back
home I was gonna win easily,

00:19:29.806 --> 00:19:33.880
and use the prize money to buy
tons of food for the village.

00:19:36.151 --> 00:19:38.488

I'm fighting Goku?

Next, comes Goku
facing off against Uub!

The third match is between
Kirano and Captain Chicken!

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:02.671
After that, it's Mr. Buu
taking on Goten!

00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:06.879
Followed by Trunks
battling Otokosuki!

00:20:06.913 --> 00:20:11.589
And, rounding things out
will be Knock versus Vegeta!

00:20:11.622 --> 00:20:13.627
The tournament will begin
in just a few moments,

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.964
so please pay attention
and when your name is called,

00:20:15.997 --> 00:20:17.534
go ahead and step into the ring.

00:20:17.568 --> 00:20:19.672
Until then, you're welcome
to rest, warm up,

00:20:19.705 --> 00:20:22.076
or do whatever else
you need to do to get ready.

Well, that's all.

Man, this is so unfair!

fight Buu first?

Luck of the draw, I guess.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.561
Well, it serves
you right, Goten,

your training to go have fun.

should be upset, it's me!

to ignore me?

come by and pay my respects,
