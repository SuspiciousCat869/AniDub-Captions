[THEME SONG IN
JAPANESE - D-TECNOLIFE]

2
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:50,227
-Dammit!

3
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:52,327
Now where did Ganju run off to?

4
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:53,794
Ikkaku said the
soul reaper chasing

5
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:56,394
him was the Fifth Seat
from Squad Eleven.

6
00:01:56,427 --> 00:02:03,627
His name was-- it
was-- it was-- gah!

7
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:04,827
Well, forget it!

8
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:06,727
All it means is that
he's the fifth-strongest

9
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:08,527
from the captain on down.

10
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,227
And all I know is I've
gotta rescue Ganju, 'cause

11
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:13,127
there's no way he can
beat him on his own!

12
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:16,894
All I see are these same stupid
walls all over the place!

13
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:18,127
That's it!

14
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:19,094
Now I'm really mad!

15
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,994
(SHOUTING) Hey, Ganju!

16
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:26,461
Where the hell are you?

17
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:29,427
If you can hear me shoot off
some fireworks to let me know!

18
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:30,461
-Huh?

19
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:31,461
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN,
SHOUTING): Dumbass!

20
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:38,627
(NORMAL VOICE) That's great.

21
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,727
Now I just gave myself away.

22
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:41,561
-There he is!

23
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:42,061
Guards!

24
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:42,594
Here!

25
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:43,261
Soul reaper!

26
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:44,394
-You won't get away!

27
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:45,561
-Let's kill him!

28
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:49,561
-For the glory of captain
Zaraki, capture him!

29
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:50,561
-He's getting away!

30
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:59,894
[all shouting at once]

31
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:00,894
-Dammit!

32
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:02,861
Ganju, where the hell are you?

33
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:17,561
-A hole?

34
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:19,927
A pit?

35
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:20,761
Dammit!

36
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:22,527
Not another one.

37
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:24,461
How many of these
things are there?

38
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:28,094
-You could say it's the
last one-- the last one

39
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,661
for you, anyhow.

40
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:31,094
-You can't be serious!

41
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,627
If you think something like
this will stop me, you're wrong!

42
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:35,461
Because I know damn
well that you'll never

43
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:37,227
be able to catch
me, even if I have

44
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:38,861
to fall into a pit to prove it!

45
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:39,627
-Hmph.

46
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:41,361
Well then, be my guest.

47
00:03:41,394 --> 00:03:43,494
Oh, but there's one
thing you should know.

48
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:45,361
When these pits were
originally dug out

49
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:47,461
they were lined
with sekkiseki rock,

50
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,527
a stone capable of
neutralizing spiritual powers.

51
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:53,427
In other words, anyone
who happens to fall in

52
00:03:53,461 --> 00:03:55,094
can never get out again!

53
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:02,327
[laughing]

54
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:05,994
I see the damage I inflicted
earlier is still affecting you.

55
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,427
Well, considering the
extent of your wounds,

56
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:10,194
it's certainly amazing
that you've still

57
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:12,294
managed to elude
me all this time.

58
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:14,127
I should commend you
for making it this far,

59
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:16,894
considering how
perfectly ugly you are.

60
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:20,294
-You really make me sick,
you self-serving bastard!

61
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,527
-Oh, is that right?

62
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,294
Well, that can't be helped.

63
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:24,394
It's only natural.

64
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:26,594
Ugly ones always envy
the beautiful ones.

65
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:30,094
This proves my point.

66
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:31,561
[laughing]

67
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:32,561
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Hey!

68
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:33,327
-Huh?

69
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:34,894
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Ganju!

70
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:36,394
-I guess that's
your comrade who's

71
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:37,961
been making all that racket.

72
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:41,061
He's been calling your
name all this time.

73
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,294
GUARDS (OFFSCREEN):
Get back here!

74
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:46,561
Bow down to your fate now,
you insignificant worm!

75
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:47,527
-Damn!

76
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,527
Those guys are
awfully persistent!

77
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:50,827
Ganju!

78
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:51,427
Hey!

79
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:52,494
Ganju!

80
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:53,827
-I'm sure that you're
aware of the fact

81
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,294
that your friend behaves in
the same ugly manner as you do.

82
00:04:57,327 --> 00:04:58,994
Don't you know
these vulgar actions

83
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:02,161
will result in summoning up
a never-ending horde of soul

84
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:03,294
reapers?

85
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:05,594
Good sense-- it seems to
be something both of you

86
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:06,961
are lacking completely.

87
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:09,927
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): Now ain't
you the one without good sense.

88
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,061
-Huh?

89
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:13,127
-There's only one reason
why Ichigo's still here,

90
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:14,694
and that's because
of the fact that he

91
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:16,994
must have been able to defeat
your bald-headed partner.

92
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:21,261
-No, that cannot be right!

93
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:22,661
It makes no sense!

94
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:24,694
Squad Eleven is the best combat
unit of all the Thirteen Court

95
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:25,727
Guard squads!

96
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:27,694
And Ikkaku was our
third best fighter!

97
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,227
How could he have defeated him?

98
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,127
You bastard!

99
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,794
Your only worthwhile
skill is in taking

100
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:39,027
advantage of cheap diversions!

101
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:40,827
-You ain't seen nothin' yet!

102
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:41,627
Get ready!

103
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:43,261
Shiba-style Shooting Flower!

104
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:45,127
Senpen Banka!

105
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:46,727
-You underestimate me!

106
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:48,594
Like I said, you
call that skill?

107
00:05:57,327 --> 00:06:01,494
My face-- how dare you do this!

108
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,394
-Maybe now with that little
scar you look more like a man!

109
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:12,061
-What a shame-- you
have no finesse.

110
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:14,561
You probably meant to use
one of the strange skills

111
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:17,061
in your measly arsenal to
collapse the surrounding

112
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:18,961
ground, and in that
way kill both of us.

113
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,927
-Me, die on purpose
alongside you?

114
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:27,994
You think I'd throw away
my life trying to kill you?

115
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:28,494
-Silence!

116
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:35,127
I have to admit that you
are a tough opponent.

117
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,494
Since our first
encounter, you've

118
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:38,427
exhausted yourself
running away from me,

119
00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:40,294
while sustaining my attacks.

120
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:42,661
And yet you can still
move when you need to.

121
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,461
I can only marvel at your
pure physical strength.

122
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:48,161
-(THINKING) I must be patient.

123
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:49,894
Wait just a little while longer.

124
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:52,994
He still underestimates the
true strength of my power.

125
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:56,861
The only time to use Seppa is
now, while his guard is down.

126
00:06:56,894 --> 00:07:01,527
-Unfortunately for you, to rely
solely on that is regrettable.

127
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:03,461
If only you had been
born more beautiful.

128
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:08,394
Your death at my hand
would most certainly

129
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,894
have been my very favorite.

130
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,061
-(THINKING) Can't dodge him!

131
00:07:22,394 --> 00:07:23,561
-What's the matter?

132
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:25,794
Aren't you able to employ
that floating technique

133
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:27,161
that you used earlier?

134
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:28,561
What a pity.

135
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:32,161
What good is it for one who was
so ugly to persist in living?

136
00:07:32,194 --> 00:07:34,694
I've always thought that
if one was born ugly,

137
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:37,894
he should at least
die beautifully.

138
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:41,761
-Well, I don't agree with you.

139
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,594
It comes down to the fact that
our ideas about aesthetics

140
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:46,294
are completely different.

141
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:48,661
I was taught the when it
comes to mortal combat,

142
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:50,661
it doesn't matter if
you're ugly or beautiful.

143
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:52,294
In the end what matters
is who survives!

144
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:02,994
-You bastard!

145
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:07,594
How dare you lay your
ugly hand on my head!

146
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:09,727
-It helped that you
continue to underestimate me

147
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:10,894
to the very end.

148
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:14,427
And it ends now, with a
Shiba-style secret move!

149
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,394
Renkan Seppa Sen!

150
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:27,127
-Dammit!

151
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,594
You can't finish me
with this puny attack!

152
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:35,194
Don't make me laugh!

153
00:08:35,227 --> 00:08:36,094
Where are you?

154
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:37,261
Show yourself!

155
00:08:37,294 --> 00:08:38,261
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): Hey!

156
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:39,227
Take this!

157
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:43,894
-What the hell?

158
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:44,394
-Enjoy!

159
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:54,061
-Uh?

160
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:55,827
Guess he's over there.

161
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:58,661
Well, it's a little
late for that.

162
00:08:58,694 --> 00:08:59,161
Quiet!

163
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:05,994
-Look there!

164
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:07,927
They're close!

165
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,661
But, we can't go this way!

166
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:12,594
It's a dead-end, right?

167
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:14,727
I thought all along you
shouldn't have turned right

168
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,027
at that last corner!

169
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:18,461
-But you're the one who
said to come this way!

170
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:21,527
-Hey, c'mon, Kenny, its not
like you to blame someone else!

171
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,294
See that!

172
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:23,194
Wasn't I close?

173
00:09:23,227 --> 00:09:26,494
Go over there!

174
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,394
-This way, right?

175
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:27,894
-Right!

176
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:36,527
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
They're gone, aren't they?

177
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:38,127
URYU (OFFSCREEN): I think so.

178
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,294
-He seemed terribly strong.

179
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:42,827
It's lucky he didn't
see us, don't you think?

180
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:45,461
-Yes, but he must be the
same type as Ichigo--

181
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:47,894
he has incredible strength
but his powers of observation

182
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:49,294
are quite weak.

183
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:51,361
Now, I know that we
should keep moving,

184
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:53,961
but the real question is,
where do we go from here?

185
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,894
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
Well, how about that way?

186
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,761
I can see a tower
in the distance!

187
00:09:57,794 --> 00:09:58,394
-Yeah?

188
00:09:58,427 --> 00:09:59,361
Where is it?

189
00:09:59,394 --> 00:09:59,861
-Look!

190
00:09:59,894 --> 00:10:00,561
Over there!

191
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:07,561
-Hm.

192
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:08,261
Didn't touch her.

193
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:15,261
I'm impressed that you
were able to dodge me

194
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:16,361
at such close range.

195
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:18,427
Very good.

196
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:20,794
If our paths had not
crossed this way,

197
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:23,627
then perhaps you might
have lived awhile longer.

198
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:25,727
It's rather unfortunate.

199
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:28,727
I'll count to ten to give
you some time to regret.

200
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,461
That's the least
I can do for you.

201
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:32,961
One.

202
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:41,061
-I sense clashes of spiritual
pressure everywhere.

203
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:43,861
Now stay alive, young friends.

204
00:10:57,714 --> 00:10:59,681
-One.

205
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:02,614
Two.

206
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:03,381
-Uh, thanks for--

207
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:04,581
JIROBO (OFFSCREEN): Three.

208
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:06,447
---what you did, Uryu,
but I'm all right really!

209
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:06,847
JIROBO (OFFSCREEN): Four.

210
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:07,481
-Yes.

211
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:08,747
You'll be fine.

212
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:09,814
JIROBO (OFFSCREEN): Five!

213
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:11,414
-(THINKING) I believe him.

214
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:12,114
He's not--

215
00:11:12,147 --> 00:11:13,414
JIROBO (OFFSCREEN): Six!

216
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:14,181
-(THINKING) --the same Uryu
he was a few minutes ago.

217
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:15,247
JIROBO (OFFSCREEN): Seven!

218
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:16,014
-(THINKING) He moved
so quickly just now.

219
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,181
For a split second, Uryu
vanished from my senses.

220
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:26,181
Then I was safe
before I realized it.

221
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:28,681
His transformation is
absolutely amazing!

222
00:11:34,214 --> 00:11:37,681
Everything's turning out exactly
like Yoruichi said it would,

223
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:41,181
Uryu transforming at the
mere sight of a soul reaper.

224
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:43,647
I'm certain now he's a Quincy.

225
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:46,647
Soul reapers are
his mortal enemies!

226
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:48,314
-Ten!

227
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:51,247
Now it's time for us
to end this charade!

228
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:53,914
Hope you've had enough time
to reflect on your grief.

229
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,581
-He's coming.

230
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:58,647
-And so now the time
has come for you

231
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:00,481
to experience another
form of regret.

232
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:09,414
-Come on then, soul reaper!

233
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:10,747
I'm the one you should fight!

234
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:29,881
-It is not for you to
decide who it is I fight.

235
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:39,314
Now, allow me the opportunity to
end your regrettable misfortune

236
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:40,047
with your death.

237
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,447
-Orihime!

238
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:47,147
You must run!

239
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:48,347
-(THINKING) No, you're wrong.

240
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:49,847
I must not run!

241
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,314
I've got to stay and fight!

242
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:53,714
Otherwise, how
can I save Ichigo?

243
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:54,214
Tsubaki!

244
00:12:58,147 --> 00:12:59,147
-At last!

245
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:00,014
Showtime!

246
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:03,314
Aim well.

247
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,314
-Not this time!

248
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:05,781
Koten Zanshun, I reject!

249
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:12,514
Tsubaki!

250
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:18,981
-You stupid girl!

251
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:23,481
What were you thinking,
hesitating like that?

252
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:26,481
-Tsubaki, no!

253
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,147
-I have never seen a
move like that before.

254
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:32,947
And yet, I sense no murderous
intent behind your attack!

255
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:35,281
Although you might be able
to kill certain hollows

256
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,147
with that type of
move, I assure you

257
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:41,347
it will have no effect
whatsoever on soul reapers.

258
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:43,781
-(THINKING) My body won't move!

259
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:48,047
-This is a battleground, and
by you not fighting to kill,

260
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:50,181
you'll never succeed
in stopping anyone!

261
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:08,914
-If you want to face an
attack with an intent to kill,

262
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:10,981
then why not fight me?

263
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:13,981
I'm sure you'll find
it here in my bow.

264
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:16,847
It's a thrill I'd
love to give you.

265
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:52,014
-Hanutaro.

266
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:57,381
-What do you want?

267
00:14:57,414 --> 00:15:00,114
I'm sure you must know that
this is no place for your kind.

268
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:01,181
-Beat it.

269
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:03,147
We never sent for
anyone from Squad Four.

270
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:04,547
-Ah.

271
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:06,847
It's just that I was the one who
used to clean her cell when she

272
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:09,314
was held prisoner in
the Squad Six barracks.

273
00:15:09,347 --> 00:15:12,314
And so I got to thinking that
this repentance cell might

274
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:13,981
be in need of some cleaning too.

275
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,447
-You should know this
repentance cell cannot be opened

276
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:19,347
for anyone until the prescribed
execution of sentence.

277
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:21,881
-Even a dumb halfwit
like you must know that.

278
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:23,114
-Now buzz off!

279
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:24,181
-Right, but--

280
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,747
-You heard me,
scram, or I'll hack

281
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:28,781
you pieces, you
insignificant maggot!

282
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:29,914
-As you command, sir.

283
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,081
-What's wrong?

284
00:15:58,114 --> 00:15:59,047
Scared, ryoka?

285
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:01,714
You can't get away!

286
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:03,514
You'll get us a
special promotion!

287
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,914
-I let up for just a
minute, and what happens?

288
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:11,614
They get cocky and it
goes to their heads.

289
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:13,281
-All right, men!

290
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:14,281
Kill him!

291
00:16:18,247 --> 00:16:20,681
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
I'm-- getting-- crushed!

292
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:21,681
Get off!

293
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,147
Get off!

294
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:26,147
Give me some space,
you you bastards!

295
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:27,981
So I can get the
hell out of here!

296
00:16:28,014 --> 00:16:28,614
-There he goes!

297
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:29,581
Get him!

298
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,614
-These guys are
freaking everywhere!

299
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:32,581
How many of them
are there, anyway?

300
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:38,781
-Ah, very interesting.

301
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:41,847
So I guess that
makes you a Quincy.

302
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:43,414
-You're right about that.

303
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,581
-Uryu's bow!

304
00:16:47,614 --> 00:16:49,881
It's totally different
from the one I saw before,

305
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:53,781
both in its appearance and
even its spiritual pressure!

306
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:57,347
And that glove-- he must
have been practicing in order

307
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:58,181
to use it properly!

308
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:19,281
Learning to use it,
practicing all alone.

309
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:20,747
-How interesting.

310
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:24,381
One uses an unfamiliar
skill, the other is a Quincy,

311
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:26,914
and both employ
projectile weapons.

312
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:30,047
And you have both come to this
very place at this very time

313
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:31,314
to fight against me.

314
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:33,614
So do I call this an
amazing coincidence

315
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:35,714
or a brilliant twist of fate?

316
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:40,714
Either way, I must show you
the true form of my Zanpakuto!

317
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:41,947
Time to spread your wings!

318
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:42,581
Tsunzakigarasu!

319
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:47,214
So what do you think?

320
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:49,114
Time to lament?

321
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:51,881
I am the Fourth
Seat of Squad Seven.

322
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:56,847
I'm Jirobo Ikkanzaka, also known
as Jirobo of the Slicing Wind.

323
00:17:56,881 --> 00:18:00,081
My nickname, Windscythe, proves
that I'm the most skilled when

324
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:02,381
it comes to dealing
with projectile weapons.

325
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,314
See how my countless
blades dance through space?

326
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:08,114
No one who has seen
my attack has lived.

327
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:09,947
So tell me, do you
like what you've

328
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:12,181
seen of my Tsunzakigarasu?

329
00:18:12,214 --> 00:18:14,647
You can't even follow them
with your eyes, can you?

330
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:16,447
They're a prelude to
your glorious death!

331
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:22,747
Before my Splitting Crow,
your bows and arrows

332
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:24,881
are all but as helpless
as a newborn babe.

333
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:28,647
As a fellow master of flying
weapons, all I can say you'll

334
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:30,981
truly regret ever having
laid eyes on these--

335
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:34,914
-Interesting.

336
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,547
Unlike the outside world, in
here, the most skilled fighter

337
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:41,681
seems unfortunately to be the
one who ends up by circumstance

338
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:43,814
the most long-winded whiner.

339
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:45,414
-Absurd!

340
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:46,914
That was just a fluke!

341
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:48,847
You're too cocky
for your own good!

342
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:50,181
-You still don't understand?

343
00:19:00,414 --> 00:19:02,581
If you're supposed to be
the most skilled one dealing

344
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,747
with flying weapons,
then I'd think

345
00:19:04,781 --> 00:19:07,014
about getting a new
nickname, because where

346
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:11,014
flying weapons are concerned
I seem to be the better man.

347
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:15,181
Unfortunately, "Uryu Windscythe"
doesn't have as nice a ring

348
00:19:15,214 --> 00:19:16,814
to it.

349
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:19,014
CAPT. MAIYURI (OFFSCREEN):
You men search over there!

350
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:21,314
If you find them,
take them alive!

351
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:24,547
They might make interesting
research specimens.

352
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,181
Don't let the other
squads capture them first.

353
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:28,914
GUARDS (OFFSCREEN, ALL
TOGETHER): Yes sir!

354
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:31,147
-Now go!

355
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:33,447
Still, since they're
only human beings,

356
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:35,281
I don't really expect
any good specimens.

357
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:50,581
A hell butterfly?

358
00:19:50,614 --> 00:19:52,814
So tell me the message, Nemu.

359
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:53,881
-Sir.

360
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:56,481
Apparently Ikkaku
Madarame of Squad Eleven

361
00:19:56,514 --> 00:19:59,181
has recently encountered
and fought against a ryoka.

362
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:00,281
-What?

363
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:01,681
How can you just stand
there and inform me

364
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:04,547
that Squad Eleven already
has their hands on a ryoka?

365
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:07,314
-No, apparently Ikkaku was
soundly beaten by the ryoka

366
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:09,714
and has been taken to the
Squad Four treatment room

367
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:11,414
1 for medical attention.

368
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:14,281
Unfortunately, the ryoka escaped
and his current whereabouts

369
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,414
remain unknown.

370
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,247
-An intruder defeated him?

371
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:20,281
It seems that among
these ryoka there

372
00:20:20,314 --> 00:20:23,047
appears to be quite a
few interesting subjects.

373
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:24,347
Where's Zaraki?

374
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:26,681
-He's searching
for the ryoka now.

375
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:29,481
-Then he shouldn't know
about any of this yet.

376
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:31,614
In any event, before
he does get wind of it,

377
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:36,347
let us try to get some
information on these ryoka.

378
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:38,181
-Tell me sir, where
are you going?

379
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:39,647
-To see Ikkaku.

380
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:41,381
Have you not heard
a word I've said?

381
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:43,514
Come along, my dull-witted girl.

382
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:54,114
-I sense Zaraki's
spirit pressure.

383
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:56,847
So, he is on the move.

384
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,847
Be careful, Ichigo.

385

[THEME SONG IN
JAPANESE - HOKIBOSHI]

386

ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
We're surrounded.

387
00:22:51,682 --> 00:22:52,948
So many soul reapers!

a plan to outwit the enemy.

him with an attack right

through the middle!
