[theme song]

00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,178
NARRATOR: Although
Kenryu and the others

3
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,114
had tried to shield Princess
Rurichiyo from the truth,

4
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,650
she was still able to
discern Gyokaku Kumoi's

5
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,051
sinister intentions.

6
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,555
Rurichiyo returned home
to the Kasumioji palace.

7
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,091
Ichigo and Rukia followed,
and attempted a rescue

8
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,659
during her arranged wedding.

9
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,595
But they soon discovered they
had walked into Kumoi's trap

10
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,631
and that the bride
was an imposter.

11
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:14,201
They were immediately surrounded
by Soi Fon and her squad.

12
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,537
Thanks to some unexpected help
from Rurichiyo's fiance, Shu

13
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,740
Kannogi, they managed to escape.

14
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,242
But now, Ichigo is a wanted man.

15
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,384
-Any sign of them?

16
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,351
-No, sir.

17
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,619
We're searching
the entire complex.

18
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,353
-There's no one in here.

19
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,221
-I'll look over here.

20
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,188
-I'll check the east corridor.

21
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,089
-You check that room.

22
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,064
-Are you all right, Ichigo?

23
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:44,765
-Yeah.

24
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,366
It's really just a scratch.

25
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,235
-Wow.

26
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:53,240
I never had any idea that places
like this existed underground.

27
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,241
-Sorry.

28
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,109
I'm sure this makes
you uncomfortable.

29
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,177
-Oh, I'm fine.

30
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,146
Don't worry about it.

31
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,049
The important thing is we
have to find Rurichiyo.

32
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,316
-I understand.

33
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,453
But we are wanted, and Soul
Reapers are looking for us.

34
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,156
If we go out now, we're
as good as captured.

35
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,691
-Right.

36
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,727
-Keeping that in mind, we
still have to look for her.

37
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,463
Any idea where she is?

38
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,666
-The truth is, I've
never even walked around

39
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,036
outside the palace grounds.

40
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,273
I've seen a bit of the world
while riding through town,

41
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,407
though.

42
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,542
-I can't believe it.

43
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,343
Are all you nobles like this?

44
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,411
-Not everyone.

45
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,013
I heard that Rurichiyo
used to sneak out

46
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:33,747
every once in a while.

47
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,750
But I was too scared
to go with her.

48
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,419
-You shouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

49
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,521
-Look, she couldn't have
been taken very far.

50
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,157
She's probably somewhere
inside the Kasumioji palace.

51
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,059
Should we try breaking in again?

52
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,762
-But even Sir Kenryu
couldn't pull that off.

53
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,297
How are we going
to manage eluding

54
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,166
all of those guards on our own?

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,102
-Shu, you may not know
the world outside,

56
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,471
but you know the layout
of the palace, right?

57
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,072
-For the most part.

58
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:04,211
But it's so big, I
haven't seen all of it.

59
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,681
-You'll have to give
it your best shot.

60
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,281
-Right.

61
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,590
-Captain, Groups Three and Four
have been searching the palace

62
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,725
grounds, but haven't
found them yet.

63
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,460
-Groups One and Two
have just returned.

64
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,997
Groups Five and Six have
headed out to take their place.

65
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,098
-Very well then.

66
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,533
Keep me updated
on their progress.

67
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,100
-Right.

68
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,673
SOI FON (VOICEOVER):
Why did he do this?

69
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,175
-Sorry.

70
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,443
Can you give me just a second?

71
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:41,515
-Captain.

72
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,183
-Mm?

73
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,551
-Squad Three has just reported.

74
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,453
I have their information.

75
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,054
-Were they are
able to find them?

76
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,322
-They've disappeared completely.

77
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,257
No trace.

78
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,192
-Is that so?

79
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,495
-I've been thinking about those
two guys Kenryu and Enryu.

80
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,230
Do think we should
have handed them over

81
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,299
to the Kasumioji Clan?

82
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,636
Maybe we should have kept
them in custody ourselves.

83
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,603
Captain?

84
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,172
-Mm?

85
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,473
-Is everything all right?

86
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,073
-Yes.

87
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,642
I'm fine.

88
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,278
Those two men are no
longer our concern.

89
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,613
The head captain made
it perfectly clear to us

90
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,282
that we're to allow
the nobles to take

91
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,184
care of their own affairs.

92
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,587
Our mission is to go out
and capture Ichigo Kurosaki,

93
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,222
and that's all.

94
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,658
I'm going to lead the
punishment force myself.

95
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,593
You're in charge here.

96
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,094
-Yes, Captain.

97
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,096
-We'll determine the truth
once he's in custody.

98
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,604
-Squad Three has been
ordered to remain on standby.

99
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:41,374
Groups should go get
their meals one at a time.

100
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,375
-Right, sir.

101
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,078
Group one, move out for chow.

102
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,113
-How's everything going?

103
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,115
-Welcome back, Captain Amagai.

104
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,383
Things are fine here.

105
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,551
-Good.

106
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,020
Squad Two seemed to have
everything under control.

107
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,388
I'm taking a quick break.

108
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,758
-You're in time for dinner.

109
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:01,261
It appears we'll be out
here for quite a while.

110
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,231
-Our adversaries are well
trained and very smart.

111
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,266
We have to be patient.

112
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,400
Let me ask you.

113
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,069
-Hm?

114
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,372
-How has Makoto
been acting lately?

115
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,342
-He's done nothing
out of the ordinary.

116
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:15,742
-All right.

117
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,348
I have to say I'm
relieved to hear that.

118
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,151
It never feels good to have
suspicions about your comrades.

119
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,152
-Of course.

120
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,054
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Captain Amagai!

121
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,223
Are you coming down
here for dinner?

122
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,024
-I am!

123
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:35,695
[cheering]

124
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,296
-Huh?

125
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,540
-Have the emergency repairs to
the walls been completed yet?

126
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,742
-Yes sir.

127
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,112
-Those bandits may try to
break in again any time.

128
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,414
Let's double the number
of men on the watch.

129
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,015
-Yes.

130
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,150
Right away.

131
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,719
-I can't believe they
managed to escape.

132
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,156
The 13 Court Guard Squads
were absolutely useless.

133
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,592
-Master Kumoi?

134
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,560
It's time for Lady
Rurichiyo's dinner.

135
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,728
Is she in her room?

136
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,730
-The princess was traumatized
by today's events.

137
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,265
She took to her bed.

138
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:13,333
She needs her rest.

139
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,068
She isn't up to eating a meal.

140
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,070
-But my lord!

141
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,705
-Imagine how the
princess must feel.

142
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,407
Her wedding completely ruined.

143
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,107
-Of course.

144
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,509
I'm so sorry, sir.

145
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,714
-I certainly hadn't
counted on Shu Kannogi

146
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,516
being taken hostage.

147
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,384
But that's unimportant.

148
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:36,289
Bottom line is the princess
is still in my hands.

149
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,992
-The princess has been spotted?

150
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,193
-Yes, sir.

151
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,095
She's passed through the
Senkaimon and is on her way

152
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,363
here.

153
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,131
But we're keeping a close
eye on the precipice world.

154
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,572
-Have you completed
all the preparations?

155
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,206
-Yes, sir.

156
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,686
-Why don't we gather
in the grand hall?

157
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,325
Everyone, come and
join the princess.

158
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,627
We will celebrate her
return with a toast.

159
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,530
[cheering]

160
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,080
-I wonder why there
are no guards on duty.

161
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:43,990
-Huh?

162
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:54,367
-[laughing]

163
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,370
-I am really back.

164
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,506
I have returned to my true home.

165
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,378
The sky seems so small
when I look at it now.

166
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,719
Huh?

167
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,522
[gasp] Help me, someone!

168
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,090
Anyone!

169
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:23,029
[muffled screaming]

170
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,993
-Whoever you are,
tell me, how long

171
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,629
do you plan on keeping me
locked up in this place?

172
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,032
-You'll be released
in a little while,

173
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,501
after I take care of that
substitute Soul Reaper

174
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,069
who's here looking for you.

175
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,437
-Huh?

176
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,439
-Hm.

177
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,308
-Ichigo.

178
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,111
He followed me here.

179
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,612
-He must be a fool.

180
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,981
I was told he made a
mess of your wedding,

181
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:19,385
and turned the 13 Court
Guard Squads against him.

182
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,054
-What is it you're after?

183
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:24,457
-You're in no position to
be asking any questions.

184
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,560
-Is Kumoi paying you to do this?

185
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,730
-You have such a simple mind.

186
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,467
I'm not a fool who can be led
around by the promise of money.

187
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,270
I am here for a
different reason.

188
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,338
-I guess you must be.

189
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,206
Otherwise, you
wouldn't be so afraid.

190
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,141
-Afraid?

191
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,643
What are you talking about?

192
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,145
-Do not deny it.

193
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,413
I may not know much about
the world out there,

194
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,716
but it is obvious
to me that you are

195
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,217
deathly afraid of something.

196
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,720
It is written all over your
face, and it is in your voice.

197
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,554
-Stop talking!

198
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,130
It's no matter, Princess.

199
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,166
You won't have to be
brave for much longer.

200
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,078
-There's the man.

201
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,480
How you doing,
Third Seat Kibune?

202
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,514
-Huh?

203
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,516
-You're the last person
I expected to see.

204
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,219
Why are you out here so late?

205
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,453
-Have you been drinking?

206
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,221
-Huh?

207
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,689
You mean you can tell?

208
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,125
-We're supposed to be
on emergency alert.

209
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:32,992
-Sorry about that.

210
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,361
I only had a little bit of sake.

211
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,498
Do you mind keeping this
between the two of us?

212
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,432
-Hm.

213
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,135
-And if you do,
Third Seat Kibune,

214
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,671
I promise I'll keep my mouth
shut about what you were doing

215
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,306
out here in the
middle of the night.

216
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,174
-Hm?

217
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,644
You saw where I was coming from?

218
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,280
-Captain Amagai, something
urgent has come up.

219
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,983
Third Seat Kibune is missing.

220
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,484
-Excuse me?

221
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,752
-There's more, Captain.

222
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,754
One of our squad members has
been missing since last night

223
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:02,555
as well.

224
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,157
-It can't be coincidental.

225
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,525
-I don't think so.

226
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,560
From what I've learned,
some of our squad members

227
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,163
apparently snuck out and
had a small drinking party

228
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,231
last night.

229
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:12,665
Halfway through the
evening, one of the men

230
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,268
thought he saw Third Seat
Kibune and ran after him.

231
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,303
The other men said
he never came back.

232
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:21,140
-He's been missing for hours and
nobody's seen any trace of him?

233
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,275
-Right, Captain.

234
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,078
-Hm.

235
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:29,682
Izuru, I want you to take
over the search for Makoto.

236
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,085
I'll go find that
substitute Soul Reaper

237
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,254
and find him as
quickly as possible.

238
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,989
-Understood, Captain.

239
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,757
-I have a bad
feeling about this.

240
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,734
-I leave the search
under your command.

241
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,402
Something wrong?

242
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,072
-Captain, how are you going
to handle this problem?

243
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,707
-What are you talking about?

244
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,744
-Ichigo and Rukia, of course.

245
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,713
There has to be some kind of
explanation for their actions!

246
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,516
They'd never do something like
this without a good reason!

247
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,051
-And what if they did?

248
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,719
I have no sympathy
for anyone who

249
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,256
chooses to defy orders that
come from the Soul Society.

250
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,159
-But your sister.

251
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,560
-I stand by what I said.

252
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,096
I expect you to personally
head up the search parties.

253
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,202
-You're putting me in
charge of everything

254
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,304
relating to this search?

255
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:28,741
Understood, sir.

256
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,643
I'll take command of
Squad Six and begin

257
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,378
to conduct a thorough
sweep immediately.

258
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,093
-Huh?

259
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,227
What's wrong?

260
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:48,628
-Shh.

261
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,333
-I'm sensing it as well.

262
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,101
Someone's coming this way.

263
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,703
-You're right.

264
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,504
-Have we been found?

265
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,041
-They haven't
discovered us yet, but--

266
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,377
-It's just a matter of time now.

267
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:04,977
-Come on.

268
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,414
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): I thought

269
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,749
I heard someone
moving over there!

270
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:10,383
-Damn!

271
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,517
They noticed us!

272
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,518
-Hurry!

273
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,152
[shouting]

274
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:13,986
-Go get them!

275
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:14,520
-Don't let them get away.

276
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,089
-Catch up to them!

277
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,323
Cut them off!

278
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,292
-If Anatura were here,
we wouldn't have to run!

279
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,160
He knows all the escape routes!

280
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:21,994
-Quit complaining.

281
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:26,599
-Damn.

282
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,969
It's a dead end.

283
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:30,370
-Ichigo.

284
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,971
This way.

285
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,274
We can get to the
surface from here.

286
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,409
-Guess we have no choice.

287
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,117
-What's the matter?

288
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:49,655
-What a surprise.

289
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,225
I must say we never thought
we'd run into you here.

290
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,161
-We were set up.

291
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,429
-You're mistaken.

292
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,031
It was just a coincidence.

293
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,466
-How very convenient.

294
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,236
Who are you, anyway?

295
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:07,306
-The captain of Squad Three,
of the 13 Court Guard Squads.

296
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,141
I'm Shusuke Amagai.

297
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,554
-The captain of Squad Three?

298
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,191
-He must be the new guy they
recently appointed to the post.

299
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,459
-That explains it.

300
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,494
It's no wonder I
don't recognize him.

301
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,430
-What bad luck.

302
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,465
We might have been
able to get out of this

303
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,066
if we were dealing
with a captain who

304
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,568
happened to know us.

305
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,604
-You must be Ichigo Kurosaki?

306
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,273
-That's right.

307
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,042
-I see.

308
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,343
I'm afraid I have to arrest you.

309
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,483
-Captain, can I speak to you?

310
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,685
I'm Rukia Kuchiki of Squad 13.

311
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,220
Is there any way
you might consider

312
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,023
hearing our side of the story?

313
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,458
-I'll tell you what.

314
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,594
If you come quietly and let us
take you to our holding cell,

315
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,229
I'd be willing to listen.

316
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,231
-But that's not--

317
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,067
-Rukia, you take care of Shu.

318
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,005
-Stand down!

319
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,341
I've heard a lot about this
substitute Soul Reaper's

320
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,476
abilities.

321
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,244
I'd like to see them myself.

322
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,413
I'm ordering you
not to interfere.

323
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,682
--[laughs] You may come
to regret that order.

324
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,973
-What's wrong, kid?

325
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,040
Is that all you got?

326
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,151
-You move pretty fast,
considering how big you are.

327
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:05,191
-I have a bit of
exper-- Guess I better

328
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,293
stop holding back if
I want to defeat you.

329
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:17,236
Sever, Raika!

330
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,651
The real battle
is about to start.

331
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,418
-So let it.

332
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,686
I'm ready for you.

333
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,031
-Ichigo!

334
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,147
-[growling]

335
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,285
-Your power is very impressive.

336
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,693
-Is this the best
you can come up with,

337
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,094
substitute Soul Reaper?

338
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,133
-Getsuga Tensho!

339
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,752
-OK, kid, that wasn't bad.

340
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,103
-Stop this!

341
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,071
-Sir Shu, don't!

342
00:18:59,105 --> 00:18:59,472
-Shu!

343
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,106
-No!

344
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,974
Stop, please!

345
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:05,011
-Young man, why are you
defending the very people who

346
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:08,581
ruined your wedding ceremony and
then proceeded to kidnap you?

347
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,750
What, have you lost your mind?

348
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,418
-No, you don't
understand, Captain!

349
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,486
You've got all wrong!

350
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,088
I went with these people
of my own free will.

351
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,256
-Hm?

352
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,491
-Please, Captain.

353
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,559
I'm begging you, just
hear what I have to say.

354
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,160
-Shu.

355
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,565
-These people came
here to try and save

356
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,634
Princess Rurichiyo's life.

357
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,404
Believe me.

358
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,239
That's why I went with them.

359
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,241
I've always wanted
to help the princess,

360
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:39,378
but everything I tried
ended in failure.

361
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,414
What they showed
me opened my eyes

362
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,650
about what's really going
on and who's responsible.

363
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,652
The Kasumioji Clan is
in terrible trouble,

364
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,655
but with their help, we
have a chance to save it!

365
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,757
-Oh, Sir Shu.

366
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,526
-Oh, boy.

367
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,729
-Captain, please help us find
Rurichiyo before they kill her!

368
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,166
[crying]

369
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,272
-All right, fine.

370
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,441
I'll listen to what
they have to say.

371
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,676
After hearing the
sincerity in your voice,

372
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,978
I have to give you the
benefit of the doubt.

373
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,980
Put away your swords, everyone.

374
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,048
-Thank you, Captain Amagai.

375
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:23,422
-Upheaval amongst the
Kasumioji Clan, you say?

376
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,692
So, you were hired to be
bodyguards for the princess,

377
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,626
right?

378
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,227
-Yeah.

379
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,162
-Uh-huh.

380
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,431
That makes things clearer.

381
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,300
But not easier.

382
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,003
We weren't ordered to
investigate the Kasumioji Clan.

383
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,538
It seems that the
head captain doesn't

384
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,574
want to stick his nose
into their affairs.

385
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,476
He doesn't want
to mess with them.

386
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,444
He's made it pretty clear.

387
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,513
It's outside our jurisdiction.

388
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,683
At the very least, we will need
to find some solid evidence

389
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,986
as a basis to justify
our initial involvement.

390
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,757
-There is one starting
point, and that's the Bakoto.

391
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,225
-The Bakoto?

392
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,560
-That's the name they give
to the weapons they're using.

393
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,663
-We've all had to face them,
and they're definitely illegal.

394
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,465
I believe at the
very least, they're

395
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:09,301
much too powerful for
one clan to possess.

396
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,403
-Huh.

397
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,441
So before we captured you, what
was going to be your next move?

398
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,676
-We were searching for
the real Rurichiyo.

399
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,013
The girl who was involved in
the wedding ceremony was a fake.

400
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,282
-First we wanted to
rescue the princess,

401
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,551
then expose Kumoi as a criminal.

402
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,453
It will be easier to
accomplish that now

403
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:31,290
that Sir Shu is helping us.

404
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,558
-I understand.

405
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,293
Now that I've got
the whole story,

406
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,263
I've decided we will help
you rescue the princess.

407
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,031
-Are you sure about that?

408
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,399
-Captain!

409
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,700
-It's all right, men.

410
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,035
Trust me on this.

411
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,570
I'm convinced they've
been telling us the truth.

412
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,572
-You're a man of great insight.

413
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,074
Thank you for your
faith, Captain.

414
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,342
-Don't mention it.

415
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,212
I have a few issues of my
own that need to be resolved,

416
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,648
and it seems to me that siding
with you will take care of them

417
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,750
much more quickly than
attempting to work them out

418
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,185
alone.

419
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,320
Go to Lieutenant Kira and
tell him about all of this.

420
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,521
-Yes, sir.

421
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:03,989
SHU (VOICEOVER): Thank goodness.

422
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:04,757
Hang on, Rurichiyo.

423
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,624
We're coming.

424
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,626
We're coming to save you.

425
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,968
[theme song]

426
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,425
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Whenever
I come to the Soul Society,

427
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,093
I always feel like
I'm running away.

428
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,361
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): That's silly.

429
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,330
By the way, we need to
find a place to hide.

430
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,197
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Oh, great.

431
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,232
What about your house.

432
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,466
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Impossible.

433
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,634
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Why?

434
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,369
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Because
my older brother's there.

435
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:58,203
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Oh, yeah.

436
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,038
That would be bad.

437
00:23:59,071 --> 00:23:59,104
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Very bad.
