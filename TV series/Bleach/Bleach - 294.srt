<i>sense of strategy.</i>

154
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:31,684
<i>Because of your youth,</i>
<i>you think that I'll</i>
<i>succumb to your</i>
<i>relentless pounding.</i>

155
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:34,184
Your attacks are
too predictable.

156
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,684
Yaaaa-yayayayayaya!!

157
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:02,151
[moaning]

158
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:04,718
(CM slightly surprised
reax)

159
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:06,418
Haaa!

160
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:09,418
Yayayayayayaya!!

161
00:16:24,118 --> 00:16:25,218
<i>Pathetic.</i>

162
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,418
<i>[disappointed moan]</i>
<i>huaahh.</i>

163
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,718
Is that all you've got?

164
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:33,684
<i>Eeeyaiii!!</i>

165
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:37,684
I'm glad you're now a
monstrous creation, and
no longer just a child.

166
00:16:37,718 --> 00:16:40,918
I can kill you without
being tortured by
feelings of remorse.

167
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:44,218
hu uh... aie...

168
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,084
Huuuuiai!

169
00:17:03,784 --> 00:17:05,051
<i>Sokotsu!</i>

170
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:11,084
Hauee...

171
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:14,384
Grrahh!

172
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:40,018
Poor creature.

173
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:43,218
When he created you,
he didn't take away
your feelings, did he?

174
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:49,218
What a cruel thing to do.

175
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:50,584
What do you mean?

176
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:54,018
Creatures who become
Hollows have no free will.

177
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:58,184
Their one obsession in
life is to devour souls,
just for the fun of it.

178
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:03,451
How can you then say that
what I did was cruel,
when it gave him a purpose?

179
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:07,884
In fact, when you look
at it dispassionately,
you're the cruel one.

180
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:10,384
You crushed the poor
boy into pieces.

181
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:13,518
I won't waste time on
some foolish argument.

182
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:18,551
You can flap your jaw
as much as you like.

183
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:21,318
It will all end soon.

184
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:23,584
"Foolish argument"?

185
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:26,651
That's an odd response to
what I just said to you.

186
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:30,318
You're unaware,
because you chose to
ignore what I said.

187
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:34,551
What are you
talking about?

188
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:37,484
You have to think back on
what I told you earlier.

189
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:44,184
<i>I said that Extinguir was</i>
<i>created for the sole</i>
<i>purpose of sealing away</i>
<i>Ryujinjakka's flames.</i>

190
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:48,318
What that means is,

191
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:54,251
he prevented you from creating
new flames, by sealing your
Zanpakuto in his own sword.

192
00:18:57,584 --> 00:19:00,318
But were those the only
flames you created?

193
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:03,218
Weren't there more?

194
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:06,418
<i>What about the flames you had</i>
<i>already released earlier?</i>

195
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:12,251
Huh?

196
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,418
So, what do you suppose
happened to them?

197
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:16,218
Where did those
flames go?

198
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,818
Augh!

199
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:26,484
You have a sharp mind,
Head Captain of the
Thirteen Court Guard Squads.

200
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:33,018
<i>You're well aware of what</i>
<i>would happen if all the</i>
<i>power and energy you were</i>
<i>able to produce here today,</i>

201
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:36,951
was suddenly released
in one huge blast.

202
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:05,251
[Exhausted panting]

203
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:11,751
[clapping]

204
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:15,684
Well done, Head Captain,
You were able to contain
the explosion.

205
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:19,418
A remarkable feat,
I must admit,
I'm very impressed.

206
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:24,251
<i>If you hadn't thrown</i>
<i>your body over the</i>
<i>explosion to contain it,</i>

207
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:29,084
the flames would have blown
away your barrier, this small
town, and everything around it.

208
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:32,251
<i>All that you see here</i>
<i>would have instantly</i>
<i>been turned to dust.</i>

209
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:37,984
I have to thank you,
Genryusai Yamamoto.

210
00:20:38,818 --> 00:20:42,684
By your heroic actions,
you have protected my world.

211
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:49,184
Damn you.

212
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:13,618
Genryusai Yamamoto.
Unfortunately, I cannot
spare your life.

213
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:18,318
<i>You are the embodiment of</i>
<i>the Soul Society's history.</i>

214
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:23,384
Out of respect,
I have decided
I will finish
you off quickly.

215
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:30,251
Don't make me explain
it again, Sosuke Aizen!

216
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:31,951
You're a fool!

217
00:21:33,784 --> 00:21:36,051
<i>Hado Number Ninety-Six!</i>

218
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:39,051
Ittokaso!

219
00:21:54,218 --> 00:21:55,051
[gasp]

220
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:04,051
Heeaaaa!!

221
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:06,918
Yahh!

222
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,233
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Here I come, Aizen!</i>

223
00:23:47,266 --> 00:23:48,600
<i>[Genryusai Yamamoto]</i>
<i>Stop right there, Ichigo!</i>

224
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:50,466
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>What now?</i>

225
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,200
<i>[Genryusai Yamamoto]</i>
<i>You're putting</i>
<i>your energy in</i>
<i>the wrong place!</i>

226
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:55,700
<i>Your sword skills cannot</i>
<i>improve unless you have</i>
<i>control over your mind.</i>

227
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:58,900
<i>We'll re-do your</i>
<i>attack from here in</i>
<i>the next episode.</i>

228
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:00,633
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Really? Are you serious?</i>
