1
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:12,100
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:19,766
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,466
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:27,633
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul Reaper.

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:30,500
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:25,266
Afternoon, Lieutenant
Ise. How about some
tea?

7
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:29,266
Have I been here that
long? Sorry for taking
over your desk like this.

8
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:33,999
Oh, I don't mind. To me,
these temporary quarters
feel like I've gone off
to camp. I know it's

9
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:38,166
kinda silly, but to tell
you the truth, I'm sort
of enjoying it.

10
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,899
I know what you mean.

11
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:44,932
Oh! I meant to tell
you--- Lieutenant
Hinamori brought in some
cookies she baked herself!

12
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,366
Do they look like the
normal kind you'd eat?

13
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,966
Of course, is
something wrong?

14
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:53,132
Not at all. I just had
a silly flashback.

15
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:59,099
Well... They sure look
like normal cookies to
me! See?

16
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:02,032
Well, that's a relief.

17
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:04,299
Let me get you your tea.

18
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:10,132
Huh? Now that's weird.

19
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,499
Is something the matter?

20
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:14,299
I can't seem to find any
of the tea leaves.

21
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:18,066
That is weird---I just
bought some the other
day.

22
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,699
I have to tell you,
Lieutenant, there's been
a whole lot of things
that have been reported

23
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:25,199
missing lately. Rice
and soybean paste, to
start with...

24
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:29,799
Captain Kyoraku was
saying his secret stash
of sake disappeared the
other day.

25
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:38,899
Hanamaru is... My
Hanamaru is missing!

26
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:50,032
I'm afraid this is all
we've got. This is the
clearest image caught by
the surveillance cameras.

27
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:53,599
<i>Not really much help, is</i>
<i>it? It could be anything.</i>

28
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:57,499
We were unable to get any
clearer images, but
according to what we
could make out, the

29
00:03:57,532 --> 00:04:03,866
intruder snuck into the
barracks and stole four
chickens. Hanamaru, Hanae,
Hanakichi, and Hanaemon.

30
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:05,832
Why do we have chickens?

31
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:10,132
Ever since the Muramasa
incident, Squad Four has
been so busy, its members
barely have time to go

32
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,466
home between one shift
and another.

33
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:16,066
So they've tried to
become more
self-sufficient. They now
raise chickens, and

34
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:19,299
they've started growing a
vegetable garden on the
grounds of their
barracks.

35
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:22,732
<i>Their tomatoes and eggs</i>
<i>are delicious, I can tell</i>
<i>you that.</i>

36
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:26,466
It's a group effort---I
was in charge of raising
the chickens..

37
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,832
They were all perfectly
fine as of yesterday.

38
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:35,666
The fence around the coop
was secure, and there
weren't any holes dug
underneath it. If we're

39
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,032
to assume the culprit
stole the chickens by
opening the entrance
door, then it can't be

40
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:42,166
the work of a
simple-minded predator.

41
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,266
The timing of this
incident is so unusual,
I'm wondering if it could
be connected with the

42
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:48,366
rash of recent thefts at
the barracks?

43
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,099
Do you suppose this could
be the work of one of the
Sword Beasts?

44
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:56,066
Captain Unohana... What
are your thoughts?

45
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:00,399
I'm afraid we can't
eliminate the possibility
But the truth of the
matter is, we don't have

46
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:03,399
enough information yet to
make any kind of
conclusion.

47
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:07,866
I traced the footsteps
found on the scene, and
confirmed that the
alleged culprit escaped

48
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,399
by accessing the
underground waterway.

49
00:05:14,432 --> 00:05:18,532
The reason we've
assembled this unit is,
we need you to identify
the thief who escaped

50
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:23,032
through the underground
waterway, track him down,
and take him into custody.

51
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:27,566
Uh-huh. And tell me how that
affects me. Why was I summoned
here?

52
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:32,532
Oh, that's an easy one to
answer. From what we've
been able to determine,
the thief may in fact be

53
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,632
a Sword Beast.

54
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,666
So just to be safe, we
want you to protect
everyone.

55
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:39,432
Well... It'll be a good
way to pass the time.

56
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:41,266
I suppose.

57
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,999
Sorry to involve you,
Nanao...

58
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:45,566
But I'm depending on
you to get the job done.

59
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,766
Yes! I understand completely,
sir. My team and I are ready
to go!

60
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,499
Are you having any
trouble tracking them?

61
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:14,832
No. See for yourself.

62
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:17,432
So this is their present
position in real time?

63
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,999
Yes sir. But if you
don't mind my saying...

64
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:24,099
Conducting a search while
mapping the underground
waterway is a lot for
them to handle.

65
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:26,799
I wonder if we're being
too ambitious here.

66
00:06:26,832 --> 00:06:31,332
Why waste the
opportunity? Truly,
it's killing two birds
with one stone.

67
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:34,999
But it's kind of dangerous,
will they be okay?

68
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:38,332
Oh... I wouldn't worry,
I'm sure they'll be fine.

69
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:51,866
This place sure has a
creepy feel about it.

70
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:57,532
You're right about that.
I've been hearing scary
stories about this place, ever
since I was a little kid...

71
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,532
Oh? What sort of
stories?

72
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:01,932
Well, stories about
how people down here
have died.

73
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:04,632
Or worse, how people
who have come down and
gone missing.

74
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,599
They even talk about
people being trapped here
while working on extending
the waterway!

75
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:12,132
They say, when conditions
are right, you can hear
their voices calling for
help.

76
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,266
Terrific, that's a good
one!

77
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:18,932
Maybe our thief is one of
those people who's been
stuck down here all this
time.

78
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:20,466
<i>Ridiculous!</i>

79
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:23,466
Those ghost stories are
told to scare little
children.

80
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:27,299
Everyone knows there's no
such thing as ghosts in
the Soul Society...

81
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:32,832
What's wrong?!
[screaming]
Something touched my
neck! I can feel it!

82
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:37,099
Was it an enemy?

83
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:40,966
Oh, it's okay
Lieutenant.

84
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:45,699
Don't worry. That was
just a drop of water.

85
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,066
Look there.. Up in the
ceiling...

86
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:56,932
Water seeps down through
the rock in quite a few
places.

87
00:07:56,966 --> 00:08:01,066
You were spooked by a
water droplet. I never
noticed it before, but
you're kind of a

88
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:03,566
scaredy-cat, aren't you,
Lieutenant?

89
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:19,066
What was that?! I just
bumped into something!
What just happened?!

90
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,932
You set off a booby trap!
Someone tried to wipe
us out!

91
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:26,766
You're right. It
appears someone doesn't
want us down here. We're
unwelcome guests.

92
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:30,032
That means the enemy's
nearby, and watching us.

93
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:33,166
From this point on, we'll
have to proceed with
caution.

94
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:44,032
How come you stopped?

95
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:50,399
Look. That spot in the
floor is definitely a trap.
It might be a hole or it
might be a land mine.

96
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:57,166
I have to say, though,
putting it smack in the
middle of the path is a
pretty amateurish move.

97
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:09,132
I've got it. We just have
to walk along the edge
and avoid stepping on
that spot.

98
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,199
Wait, wait, wait! Don't
do it!

99
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:22,232
Well look at
that! Nothing happened!

100
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:23,799
I thought I'd get blown
to pieces!

101
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:25,399
You imbecile!

102
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,766
Because of your reckless
behavior, you might have
just killed us all!

103
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,999
I'm so sorry.

104
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:32,132
Well, nothing happened
this time, you were
just lucky!

105
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,932
<i>Be quiet, everybody!</i>

106
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,399
What's happening?

107
00:09:36,432 --> 00:09:37,866
Anyone else hear that?

108
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,299
What are you talking
about?

109
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:40,599
The sound of water.

110
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:43,366
You mean like those
little drips you talked
about before?

111
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,532
No, it's bigger! It
seems more like rushing
water. I hope it's not
headed this way.

112
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,999
I guess that answers your
question! Run for it!!!

113
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:04,866
It must have been a
time-delay trap! It
tricked us into thinking
nothing happened, so we

114
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,299
had no chance to escape!

115
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:10,566
Thanks for explaining!
Now I'll feel a lot better
about things if I drown!

116
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:36,661
So is everyone all right?

117
00:10:36,694 --> 00:10:38,428
Could you define 'all
right'?

118
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,694
Damn! What is this
place?

119
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:46,761
I don't know. It seems we
got swept along for quite
a ways, though. We could
be anywhere.

120
00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:51,194
Oh, that's just great,
you're lost! I thought
you were supposed to know
your way around down here.

121
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:55,294
I know my way around some
of it! But I've never had
a chance to come this far!

122
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:57,328
This part of it is
all new to me!

123
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:03,894
So here we float.
Doesn't look to me like
we're going to accomplish
our mission.

124
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:09,028
Who cares about the
mission? We'll be lucky
if we all get out of here
alive!

125
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:16,161
I blame you. You were
supposed to be our guide
and you turn out to be
useless!

126
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:19,428
Ikkaku!

127
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,661
What's going on?!

128
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,761
Third Seat Madarame!

129
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:38,061
[awkward laughing]
That's a pretty good
joke, Ikkaku...

130
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:42,794
But not really appropriate,
you know what I mean? Don't
you agree with me, Lieutenant
Ise?

131
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:09,994
Ikkaku, hold on! I'm
coming to save you! I'll
be there in a minute!

132
00:12:11,194 --> 00:12:13,261
Don't do it! Stay away!

133
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:15,494
I'm gonna try and figure
something out!

134
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:18,561
Meanwhile, you all have
to get out of here!

135
00:12:18,594 --> 00:12:19,894
Ikkaku!

136
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:20,928
Ikkaku!

137
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:23,128
Third Seat Madarame!

138
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:40,894
What were we just
attacked by?

139
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:46,228
I can't believe it! This
can't be! Ikkaku went and
sacrificed himself just to
save us!

140
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:48,261
<i>Don't worry...</i>

141
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:53,394
A Zanpakuto and its
master have separate
bodies... but they both
share one heart.

142
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:55,228
Trust me, he's not dead.

143
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,294
Thanks, Hozukimaru.

144
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:02,294
Wait a minute. Do you
smell something?

145
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:03,228
What?

146
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:06,294
I do smell it. Where's
it coming from?

147
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:22,228
Who's been camping here?

148
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:35,161
Wait a minute!
It can't be!

149
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:39,694
Did somebody make
kabobs with my chickens?!

150
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:45,828
Wait. I recognize this
sake...

151
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:48,528
This bottle was stolen
from my captain!

152
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,028
It has the name 'Shunsui'
on it!

153
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:55,661
So what are you telling
me? That all these things are
items that the thief stole
from the barracks?

154
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:57,361
Yes, it would seem so.

155
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:09,394
Hey, come back here, you
little thief!

156
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:16,828
You're not getting away.

157
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:21,928
<i>Hanataro!</i>

158
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,961
Seventh Seat Yamada!

159
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:25,461
Help us head him off!

160
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:27,128
He's the thief!

161
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:31,061
But I... What am I
supposed to...?

162
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:46,761
I am so sorry!

163
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,961
Why are you apologizing,
all of a sudden?

164
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:55,861
I want to see what you
look like. Lift up your
head and show us your
face.

165
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:00,128
Wait a minute, you're---!

166
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:01,994
Do you know him, Yamada?

167
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:04,728
'Fraid not. How 'bout
you?

168
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:07,628
Stop confusing us with
inappropriate reactions!

169
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:10,361
Sorry for misleading you.

170
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:15,794
But since you brought up
the subject, I have to
admit, there's something
awfully familiar about him.

171
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,394
<i>Hey, you!</i>

172
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:20,528
Tell us what you did with
Ikkaku!

173
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:22,094
I'm... sorry!

174
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:25,428
Don't play dumb with us,
we're not buying it! Who are
you and why are you here?!

175
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:26,494
I'm sorry!

176
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:29,694
Cut it out! Can't you
say anything but I'm sorry?!

177
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,661
I'm really sorry!

178
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:36,161
That is enough of that!
You'd better come clean
with us, or things are
gonna get ugly for you!

179
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,094
Ikkaku!

180
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,128
What just happened?!

181
00:16:09,661 --> 00:16:12,461
It's about time you
showed yourself!

182
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:17,128
That's a huge Sword
Beast! You're responsible
for this! Don't even try
to deny it!

183
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:19,161
I'm sorry!

184
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:22,294
You protect the others.
I'll take care of that
beast.

185
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:23,194
Right.

186
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:27,628
Don't worry,
Ikakku. This guy's about
to be sashimi!

187
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:30,261
Bankai!

188
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:47,194
Ryumon Hozikimaru!

189
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:54,961
Huh?! What happened?
Did I miss?!

190
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,628
What the hell?

191
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:05,494
Let go of me, you
overgrown octopus!

192
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:08,261
<i>Hado Number Thirty-One!</i>
<i>Shakkaho!</i>

193
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:20,228
He threw him like a rag
doll!

194
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:23,594
Seventh Seat Yamada! We
need your help! You'll
have to fight, too!

195
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:25,161
What?

196
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:28,594
You're a Soul
Reaper! What's the
matter with you?! Get
on your feet and attack

197
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:30,728
this monster with your
Zanpakuto!

198
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:36,194
Well, I would Lieutenant,
but my Zanpakuto is mainly
used for healing, and so I...

199
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:38,161
What are you saying?

200
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:43,594
I thought I wouldn't need
it for this search, so I
guess I... I kinda left
it back at the barracks.

201
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:47,194
You're kidding.

202
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:56,161
Lieutenant Ise!

203
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:07,361
What now?

204
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:12,161
How do I fight without a
weapon? This is horrible!
What do I do?!

205
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:31,428
Wait! What are you doing?!
Stop that! You're going to
cripple Ikkaku!

206
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:41,461
I don't know why this is
happening, but suddenly,
I feel great!!

207
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:46,494
What?! Hold on. I know
that Zanpakuto. Are you--?

208
00:18:58,094 --> 00:19:01,428
Fill up! Vermillion
Hisagomaru!

209
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:41,128
So, from what I
understand, you're saying
the thief was

210
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:47,228
the manifested form of Seventh
Seat Yamada's Zanpakuto. Are
you absolutely sure about that?

211
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:48,528
Yes sir.

212
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:51,461
Wait! If you knew that,
then why didn't you say
so at the time?

213
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:55,128
Sorry. He looked so
different that I didn't
recognize him at first.

214
00:19:55,161 --> 00:20:00,694
Hmm... I guess that's not
such an unusual story for
you, Seventh Seat Yamada.

215
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:09,594
According to Hisagomaru,
he was manifested by
Muramasa, just like all
of the other Zanpakuto.

216
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:13,828
However, he had no
complaints against his
master, and when he
realized what had

217
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:20,194
happened, he immediately
tried to return to sword
form. Despite his best efforts,
he was unable to do so.

218
00:20:20,628 --> 00:20:24,694
Eventually, he got
depressed. He thought his
master had rejected him,
and he went to live like

219
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:28,828
a hermit in the
underground waterway.
That's where we found
him, and told him what

220
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,928
was really going on.

221
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:35,494
What?! You mean the
reason I'm not able to
return to my original
form isn't because my

222
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:36,894
master hates me?!

223
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:39,694
That's right. As you
can see, we've all been
affected.

224
00:20:39,728 --> 00:20:42,428
None of us have been
able to return to our
original form.

225
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:45,394
All this time, I thought
it was something I did!

226
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:46,761
Are you all right?

227
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:51,228
Oh sure. It was just such
a relief, my body went
limp for a second!

228
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:58,594
So, did you ever find
out about those grilled
chicken kabobs?

229
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:02,661
What? Those aren't mine!
I could never kill
something, then eat it!

230
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,528
Then where did that
chicken come from?

231
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:07,561
They were prepared dishes
from the camp kitchen.

232
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,461
Your chickens are right
here!

233
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:16,528
Ah! Hanamaru! Hanae!
Hanakichi! And Hanaemon!

234
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:19,694
So why did you take the
chickens in the first
place?

235
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:24,628
After my master had rejected
me, I decided I was going to
live alone. But I was

236
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:27,194
still lonely, and I
wanted some company...

237
00:21:27,228 --> 00:21:28,761
<i>Hisagomaru...</i>

238
00:21:28,794 --> 00:21:32,394
It's all right. I can
promise you, you're not
alone.

239
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:35,861
You have me now, and I
swear to you, I'll always
be your partner!

240
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,461
Master!

241
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:39,328
Hisagomaru.

242
00:21:41,228 --> 00:21:43,128
Master!
Hisagomaru!

243
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:45,461
<i>Hold on a minute...</i>

244
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:50,061
Something in all this
isn't clear to me...
Where is Hisagomaru,

245
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:52,961
the one who was at the
center of your little
drama?

246
00:21:52,994 --> 00:21:55,194
Well...You see...

247
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:57,928
We kinda... got
separated.

248
00:21:58,794 --> 00:22:02,994
He took one turn. We took
another, and we couldn't
find him again.

249
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:07,861
Where did everybody go?

250
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,203
Captain Unohana, my
Itegumo has manifested
itself, as well.

251
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:50,203
<i>I know that.</i>

252
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:51,670
And it refuses to be
ignored!

253
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:52,970
<i>I see that.</i>

254
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:55,703
Why does it only get to
appear in previews for
the next episode?

255
00:23:55,737 --> 00:23:57,303
<i>We don't have any control</i>
<i>over that.</i>

256
00:23:57,337 --> 00:24:00,637
It's not fair! Hisagomaru
got a whole episode!
