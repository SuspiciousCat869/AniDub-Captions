00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,771
[gasp]

3
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:02,409
We've expected
you.

4
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:04,213
[angry exhale]

5
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:09,891
Damn! We're
surrounded!

6
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:13,564
Just because
we're outnumbered
doesn't mean
we'll give up!

7
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:15,101
Ichigo...

8
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,470
Yeah?

9
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:21,480
I'll keep these
guys occupied
while the two of
you get past them.

10
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:23,151
What are
you saying!?

11
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:27,726
(Yoruichi)
A suicide dash!?

12
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:30,632
-Huh?
-Wha?
-Hm?

13
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:33,237
How pathetic
of you...

14
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:35,809
What are
you doing
here?

15
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:37,612
I'm not
alone.

16
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,560
You're all
here! You're
all alive!

17
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:48,200
Now then! It's
time for a real
fight!

18
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,222
So tell me,
Yoruichi, where
were you guys hding
this whole time?

19
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:01,359
Kukaku was the
one who ended up
helping us.

20
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:03,230
She saved us
from a close call.

21
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:06,837
[attack grunt]

22
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:08,707
[attack yell]

23
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:11,212
Soi Fon!

24
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:12,581
[painful shout]

25
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:15,520
[attack yell]

26
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:17,191
[gasp]

27
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:23,436
[evil laughter]

28
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:27,544
[gasp]

29
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:34,859
Hey! Kukaku!
It's you!

30
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,506
Damn it! Who
are these
intruders!?

31
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:43,810
I didn't expect
reinforcements!

32
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:45,212
Huh?

33
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:54,364
I anticipated this
possibility, and
made preparations
before hand.

34
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,903
(Yoruichi)
We healed our
injuries at
Kukaku's place.

35
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,209
And then we
waited for the
opportunity to
strike back.

36
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:03,215
[attack yell]

37
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:08,659
You're in the
way, Ichigo!
Get lost!

38
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:09,594
What'd you
say!?

39
00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:10,730
Listen to him,
Ichigo!

40
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:13,369
We'll handle
things here! You
better get going!

41
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:14,337
Yoruichi!

42
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:16,241
Come on,
Ichigo!

43
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:22,754
Damn it! Come
back, you cowards!
Hiya!

44
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,294
Now there's
nothing to stop us
from finishing this.

45
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:31,505
How many times
must we go
through this?

46
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,375
You're going
down!

47
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,511
Hiya!

48
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:37,717
I'm going to
end your existance
once and for all!

49
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,854
{struggling breaths]

50
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:45,800
Ahhhh!

00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:52,847
[running breaths]

52
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,351
Hey! Ichigo!
What's up?
You okay?

53
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:58,558
I'm doing fine!
Don't worry
about me!

54
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:01,932
We need to
find Kageroza's
lab!

55
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:04,403
[gasp]

56
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:10,348
[gasping breath]

57
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:14,323
(Kon)
Ichigo!

58
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,525
[grunt]

59
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:20,067
(Ichigo)
Kon...

60
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:22,305
(Ichigo)
Kisuke...

61
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,849
(Kon)
Listen up, Buddy!
You almost turned
into a Hollow again!

62
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:32,057
(Ichigo)
I did..?

63
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:34,630
(Kisuke)
Here's what I think,
Ichigo... I'm guessing
that inside you--

64
00:05:34,663 --> 00:05:41,342
--the balance between your
Hollow Powers and your Soul
Reaper Powers is beinning
to break down.

65
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,480
[gasp]

66
00:05:43,814 --> 00:05:47,722
Believe me, this
isn't easy for me
to say, Ichigo--

67
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:51,596
--but I think you
should stay here
while we continue
with our mission.

68
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:52,866
[gasp]

69
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,343
No wait! I--
[painful grunts]

70
00:05:58,343 --> 00:06:01,449
You've gotta hang
in there, Ichigo!
Come on, pal!

71
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:04,055
Let's not
kid ourselves
here...

72
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:07,428
You know your
body best, it's
for your own
good.

73
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:14,675
[gasping]

74
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:21,088
Ichigo, he's
right! You should
stay here.

75
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:22,992
Let me handle
this!

76
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:26,899
I'll find a way
to fully restore
your Spirit Energy,
i promise you!

77
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,837
I appreciate
the thought,
but...

78
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,578
Why can't you just
for once say something
like, "Thanks Kon!"--

79
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:35,817
--"I'm counting on you!"
I'm more than just
some talking stuffed
anumal, you know.

80
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,888
(Ichigo)
What is
it, Kon?

81
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:41,061
I'm going too!

82
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:42,765
(Ichigo)
That's noble
of you, but--

83
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:45,436
I don't know
if I'll be any
kind of help,
really...

84
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:49,010
I mean, you know,
since I'm soft
like this...

85
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:52,383
But well, I
wanna try and
save Nozomi too!

86
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:54,554
No! I will
save her!

87
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,760
Know what,
you're right.

88
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:58,796
Huh!?

89
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:00,733
I'm counting
on you, Kon.

90
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:04,541
I've gotta tell you,
I wasn't expecting that.
It kinda give me the
creeps.

91
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:05,943
And, another
thing--

92
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:08,415
I want you to
take this with
you.

93
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:12,857
You want me to
take the Reishi
collector? Thanks.

94
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,463
It's in good
hands, Ichigo!

95
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:23,010
Hey Clog-Dude, did
ya really have to
leave him the way
that you did?

96
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:25,816
Well, I thought
just to be
safe...

97
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:29,858
...but I have
no idea if it's
gonna help him
get through this.

98
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:35,569
[grunting]

99
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:37,640
In any case, time
is of the essence.

100
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:40,445
Let's finish our
job and get
back here as soon as
we can, Kon.

101
00:07:40,813 --> 00:07:45,121
Hmm, I hope this
guy knows what
he's doing!

102
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:46,792
Did you say
something?

103
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:49,931
Oh! No! I
was just mumblnig
to myself!

104
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,218
No matter how many
times we fight, it's
not going to change
anything--

105
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:05,895
--the bottom line
is this: There is
only one true head
of the Kuchiki Clan.

106
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:07,866
You <i>do</i> speak
the truth.

107
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:12,576
The fact is, that
one head of the
Clan, is me.

108
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,521
[attack yells]

109
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,992
[grunts]

110
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:22,796
Hiya!

111
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:33,483
Ha ha ha, I guess
you've still got it.

112
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:35,922
You still want
more, I assume?

113
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:38,660
And you know
that's the way
I like it.

114
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:42,067
Let's throw
down then! The
fun's just
beginning!

115
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:43,603
Lady Yoruichi!

116
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:44,272
Right!

117
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:49,917
Hiya!!

118
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,919
Ahh!

119
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,823
She seems to
have good
reflexes.

120
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:55,627
A little
too good.

121
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:58,500
Obviously their
capabilities have
been improved.

122
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,737
We may have
a little problem.

123
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:03,877
[attack roar]

124
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:08,620
Arg!

125
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,865
Haven't you
learned that you
have no chance
of winning?

126
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:17,771
Please, why don't
you just give up
and run away.

127
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:21,579
Or will your pride
get in your way when
you try to retreat
from a Reigai?

128
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:23,717
You've got it
all wrong.

129
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,090
I won't run, because
I'm committed to a
mission.

130
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:30,229
The Thirteen Court
Guards are here to
protect the Soul
Society!

131
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:37,878
Hey, Clog-Dude?

132
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,815
What is it, Kon?

133
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:43,857
Isn't this the place
we just escaped from!?
Why are we going
back in there!?

134
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,597
(Kisuke)
You're right, it is.
Which is why we are going
through the back door.

135
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,034
That's not
what I meant!!

136
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:52,674
Why in the heck
did we go the long
way around just to
come back here!?

137
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:57,583
Well, do you know the
old phrase, "To decieve
your enemies, you must
decieve your friends first."

138
00:09:57,617 --> 00:10:03,127
I get that! That's not
the point. Can you
explain why in the world
we took our sweet time!?

139
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:08,605
The truth is, I wanted
to investigate Kageroza's
unit Squad Twelve before
we went any further.

140
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,079
But to prevent
suspicion, I needed
to come up with a
strategy.

141
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,185
I needed to make our
persuers think we
went somewhere else.

142
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:16,688
Okay...

143
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:18,926
Well, here we
are.

144
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,832
Unfortunately there's
nothing left from my
time here.

145
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:26,273
Wait a minute!
You used to be in
Squad Twelve like
Kageroza!?

146
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:28,611
Oh my! Did I
forget to
mention that
part?

147
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,250
Are you kidding
me!? You know
damned well
you didn't!

148
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:34,991
That means all
this time you've
known about
Kageroza!

149
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:37,729
Actually, he came
along after me.

150
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,968
He wasn't even
inducted yet when
I was here.

151
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:41,670
You're a useless
resource!

152
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:46,948
Here we go! Let's
see. I hope we can
find something in
their database.

153
00:10:48,618 --> 00:10:51,757
Hey, it's
asking for a
password.

154
00:10:51,757 --> 00:10:54,163
Yes, I was
expecting that.

155
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:58,003
Every peice of
equiptment in here
has been programmed
by Mayuri.

156
00:10:58,036 --> 00:10:59,706
He's not that
hard to read...

157
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,048
I don't think it
will be too difficult
to figure out what he'd
use for a password.

158
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:07,254
Let's see now.
First try...

159
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:10,895
Too bad!
You're wrong!

160
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:11,730
Oh my...

161
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:12,766
Come on!!!

162
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,003
Alright then, how
about this.

163
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,849
Idiot!

164
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:23,019
What? Alright, I've
got another one.

165
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:25,992
Ha!

166
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:27,896
(Kisuke)
See!?

167
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:31,069
You sure that
wasn't just a
lucky guess?

168
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:35,310
I can't make heads
or tails of this
stuff. Is this what
you were looking for?

169
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:41,222
Yeah. According to
this, Kageroza was
inducted into the Soul
Society about 60 years ago.

170
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:44,295
Really? That long
ago? And Nozomi?

171
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,167
I don't see
anything about
her in this
database.

172
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:48,336
[gasp]

173
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:50,741
What is it!?

174
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,448
Hey Clog-Dude!
Stop ignoring
me!!!

175
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:56,084
What's going
on!?

176
00:11:57,988 --> 00:12:00,092
Let's get out
of here, Kon.

177
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:02,998
Huh!? Hold on,
where are
you going!?

178
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,202
(Kon)
Are you gonna
answer me, or
not!?

179
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:08,008
(Kisuke)
I have to go
to the library.

180
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,849
(Kisuke)
There are some
records I need
to check.

181
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,695
Wow! Look at
all of the books
they keep in
this place!

182
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:22,236
So what are you
checking on here?

183
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:26,713
I'm going through
the background files
of each Squad's recruits
and discharges as they--

184
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:31,755
--were recorded between
the time I was banished
and the time Kageroza
first appeared.

185
00:12:31,788 --> 00:12:32,457
Oh...

186
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:37,900
[gasp]
As I expected.

187
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,141
We need to go
to Squad Ten
barracks.

188
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:44,414
For what reason!?
Will you stop keeping
things to yourself!

189
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:48,455
Jeeze! This bastard
is all about
keeping secrets!

190
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:03,017
[struggling grunts]

191
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:14,139
(Kon)
Are they gone?

192
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:15,810
(Kisuke)
Looks like it...

193
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:19,416
So, did you learn
anything? If you
did it's time you
told me!

194
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,420
Cause if you
don't I'm
gonna lose it!

195
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:24,359
Kon, you need to
calm yourself down
and lower your voice.

196
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:26,530
Now think back...

197
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,336
Do you remember what
Nozomi said to you before?

198
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:30,906
What are you
talking about?

199
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:32,910
He's the one...

200
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:36,050
I'm the one...

201
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,955
...who originally
developed the
Mod Souls.

202
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:42,829
And that wasn't the
only thing she said,
do you remember?

203
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:50,010
(Nozomi)
Out of all the Mod
Souls that have
been created...

204
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:52,014
...I was the
first.

205
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:55,254
Then Kageroza
explained it further...

206
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:58,059
(Kageroza)
It's quite simple
you see.

207
00:13:58,093 --> 00:14:02,836
(Kageroza)
Nozomi and I were both
from the Reishi of a
single Soul Reaper.

208
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:05,040
No one knows
her better
than me.

209
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:09,215
Did you notice that
their two stories
differed in one
important aspect?

210
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,087
[mmuffled shouts]

211
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:15,594
And because of
that, isn't it
obvious that one
of them is lying!

212
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:19,903
Well it's certainly
possible. But there
might be another
explanation.

213
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:22,208
What if what
they both said
was actually
true?

214
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:23,510
Hm?

215
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:28,220
What I'm trying to say
is, what if Kageroza
is a Mod Soul himself?

216
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:29,155
Hm?

217
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:36,836
(Kisuke)
In other words,
the two were once
a single Mod Soul.

218
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,479
I don't get it!
If Kageroza is
also a Mod Soul,

219
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:44,518
then how could
he be the one who
developed Mod Souls!?

220
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:48,893
It sort of begs the
question, who
created his Mod Soul?

221
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,864
[gasp]

222
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:55,374
Like the invading army
Mod Souls were originally
created from the Reishi
of a particular Soul Reaper.

223
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:58,279
And then imbued with
enhanced capabilities.

224
00:14:58,312 --> 00:15:01,118
And if that's true,
then there can only
be one answer.

225
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:05,861
The person who developed
Mod Souls had to use
himelf as the basis for
their creation!

226
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:08,633
Exactly right, which
would mean then, that

227
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:15,146
tboth Nozomi and Kageroza
are representations of
the same Soul Reaper who
originally developed them.

228
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:19,487
Wait but that still
leaves one question!
Who in the world could
that Soul Reaper be!?

229
00:15:20,122 --> 00:15:24,497
I'm thinking we
might find the
answer at the
Squad Ten Barracks.

230
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:26,903
If we can figure
out the true
developer--

231
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:30,309
I'm hoping that
we'll be able to
locate the original
lab as well!

232
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:34,918
And if we can find
the lab, we can
probably restore
Ichigo'sSpirit Energy!

233
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:38,158
Hey Clog-Dude! When
did you figure this
whole thing out!?

234
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:42,433
I have to admit, I
had my suspicions
before we came here
to the Soul Society.

235
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:45,506
Then you should have
told us, instead of
keeping it to yourself!

236
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:47,042
That was really
selfish of you!

237
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:51,418
I didn't really
want to tell anyone
until I had more
proof of my theory.

238
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:57,563
At the Squad Twelve
barracks, I began
reviewing the records
from the time I left

239
00:15:57,597 --> 00:16:02,239
the Soul Society, until
the time Kageroza assumed
his post at the Department
of Research and Development.

240
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:04,644
(Kon)
And..?

241
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:08,618
I expected to find a
Soul Reaper who disappeared
before Kageroza showed up,

242
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:11,157
but I found something
else instead.

243
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:18,037
The records in which
I was interested, had
all been erased.

244
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,542
And that's why
you went over
to the library?

245
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:26,187
Yeah. I thought whoever
had tampered with the files
might have overlooked the
archives in the library.

246
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,191
--and the records
would still be in
tact.

247
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:30,195
(Kon)
So, how did that
work out?

248
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:33,301
I found nothing
listed in Squad Twelve's
registry of names--

249
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,238
--and no signs of
alterations...

250
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:38,744
But I did find
indications of tampering,
in the books of another
squad.

251
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:42,184
Really? Intersting.
In which particular
book was that?

252
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:45,959
It was a book of
Squad Ten's records
from a long time
ago.

253
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:49,165
Ninety-six years
ago to be exact.

254
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:54,408
(Kon)
Come on! Haven't you
found it yet!?

255
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,114
No, nothing that
looks even remotely
like it.

256
00:16:57,147 --> 00:17:00,722
(Kisuke)
There's no way that
these particular records
could have been changed.

257
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,258
(Kisuke)
Bring me more books.

258
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:03,260
Ahhhh!

259
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,195
[gasp]

260
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,635
Arrgghhh!!

261
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:11,142
(Kisuke)
Here it is...

262
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:13,380
Huh!? Really,
you found it?

263
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:16,085
Yes, I'm sure
this is it.

264
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,195
It's dated ninety-six
years ago. The man was
transferred to Squad
Twelve.

265
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:23,300
So?! What is
the guy's name!?

266
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,604
(Kisuke)
Ouko... Yushima.

267
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:31,382
(Kon)
Hey! This guy
sorta does look
a little like Nozomi!

268
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,490
So, where do we
find him!? Where
is this guy!?

269
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:39,030
What does that crossed
out part of the page mean?

270
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:47,246
What it means, is that
the man doesn't exist
within Squad Twelve anymore.

271
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:54,361
But I believe
I know where he
is today.

272
00:17:58,168 --> 00:18:03,278
This is the Special
Underground Confinement
Station, also known as
"The Maggot's Nest"

273
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:05,182
Why would he
be here?!

274
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:09,190
The Thirteen Court
Guard Squads make no
provision for resignation.

275
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,563
That means if no
records exist after
their time of service--

276
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:15,636
--this is the only
place a Soul Reaper
could be!

277
00:18:19,611 --> 00:18:21,481
How come there's
no one here!?

278
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:28,829
I mean really! There
wasn't even a guard
at the entrance back there!

279
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:30,666
Doesn't that seem
strange to you!?

280
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,639
Yes. It's unusual.
I wonder if--

281
00:18:33,672 --> 00:18:36,545
(Soi Fon Reigai)
We thought you might
show up here,
Kisuke Urahara!

282
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,354
We've been waiting
for you!

283
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:45,095
And now that you've
arrived, I'll put
an end to you myself!

284
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:47,767
Hey! It's the Bee
Chick, and Slim
Fatso!

285
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:49,838
Who the hell are
you calling "Fatso!?"

286
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:52,342
I'm nothin' at
all like that guy
so back off!

287
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:54,681
Are you ready to
complete the
mission, Kon?

288
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:57,385
You go on ahead,
I'll hold them
off here.

289
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,423
Right! I won't
let you down!

290
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:02,529
Why are you
waiting! Go
after him!

291
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:03,431
Gotcha!

292
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:07,172
I was right. Just
as I suspected.

293
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:12,115
This is where you're
holding Ouko Yushima,
the developer of
Mod Souls.

294
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,553
How mart of you.

295
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,659
Sting all enemies to
death! Suzumebachi!

296
00:19:19,396 --> 00:19:20,598
Arghhhhh!!!

297
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:22,836
Ahhhh!

298
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:25,141
Ahhh!

299
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,414
Hey! Come back
here ya little
pibsqueak!

300
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:31,152
Ahhh! I'll never be
able to out-run him!

301
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:36,497
Hey Clog-Dude!
I need some
help!

302
00:19:42,274 --> 00:19:43,310
Heh heh
heh...

303
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,484
[gasp]

304
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,621
[running]
Psych!

305
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,157
[laughing]

306
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:53,865
[pained grunt]

307
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:55,500
[pained grunt]

308
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,743
Shibari
Benihime.

309
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:02,816
[gasp]

310
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:07,491
Hiasobi Benihime!
Juzutsunagi!

311
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:10,430
Damn it!

312
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:19,215
We did it!
The Doppelganger
Plan worked!

313
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:21,352
Yes! All thanks
to you, Kon!

314
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,193
[chuckles]
Thanks, but I
really didn't do
that much.

315
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:26,729
Come on.
Let's go.

316
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:31,238
Right! We've come a
long way. Let's go
meet the real developer!

317
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:46,769
[nervous groan]

318
00:20:50,443 --> 00:20:53,415
So.. You really think
he's down here?

319
00:20:53,615 --> 00:20:58,625
This is the facility's
lowest level. If he's
not down here, then I
have to believe that

320
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:03,302
those two Reigai we met
earlier, were wasting their
time, guarding this place
for nothing.

321
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:05,239
True. You have a
good point there.

322
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:19,334
Are you
Ouko Yushima?

323
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:26,548
He's not
responding.

324
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:29,320
Hey, you there!
Get up!

325
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:31,391
Wakie wakie!

326
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,994
Hey, anybody
in there?!

327
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:33,962
It's no use.

328
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:35,866
Huh?

329
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,609
I hate to say this, but it
doesn't look to me like he'll
ever regain consciousness.

330
00:21:40,643 --> 00:21:42,512
Are you
serious?

331
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:52,299
[pained groans]

332
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,898
[roar]

333
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,696
I'm tired of
being so small
and helpless!

334
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:51,501
I wish I were in
a bigger and
stronger Gigai!

335
00:23:51,535 --> 00:23:52,036
All right!

336
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,539
You agree?

337
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:56,378
Yeah, you can take
my place and go up
against Marechiyo
and Soi Fon,

338
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:57,731
and get beaten
to a pulp!

339
00:23:57,764 --> 00:24:00,900
Uhh, my size isn't
so bad after all.
