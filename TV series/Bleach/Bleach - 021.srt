MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Attention, red alert.

5
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:52,896
Red alert.

6
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,963
Intruders detected
in West Rukon.

7
00:01:54,996 --> 00:01:56,063
This is not a drill.

8
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:57,530
Repeat, red alert.

9
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:59,363
Breach detected in West Rukon.

10
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:00,430
-Wait a second.

11
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:01,830
What the hell is going on?

12
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,230
-Don't look now, but that
section we just came through

13
00:02:12,263 --> 00:02:13,230
is collapsing on us.

14
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:14,963
I'm running as fast as I can.

15
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:17,263
But I still don't think we're
going to make it through.

16
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:19,496
-Quit looking behind you,
and concentrate your efforts

17
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,563
on running.

18
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:22,230
If the restrictive
current swallows you up,

19
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:23,163
then it's all over.

20
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,930

22
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,863
I knew that stupid outfit of
his was going to get him caught.

23
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:34,830
-Hold it.

24
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,763
You musn't do that, Ichigo.

25
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:39,263
The restrictive current
entangles the spiritual body.

26
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:41,596
If you reveal yourself
using you zanpakuto,

27
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,263
it'll swallow you too.

28
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,663

-Thanks for that, Chad.

31
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:50,596
-Let's go.

32
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,096
-Whoa!

33
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,596
What do you think you're doing?

34
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,296
Hey!

35
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,330
Put me down, will you?

36
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:56,796
I can run on my own!

37
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,196
I, I don't mean to bother
you while you're running,

38
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,396
but something else is coming.

39
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,063
Ah!

40
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:12,530
Yoruichi, what is that?

41
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,896
-It's the cleaner.

42
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,663
It comes through
here every seven days

43
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:22,196
to clear out the passage way.

44
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,963
And it's just our bad luck
that today is the day.

45
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,863
Don't look back at it.

46
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:27,663
That'll only slow you down.

47
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:31,163
Just keep running, or it
will crush you to powder.

48
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:32,163
Go, go!

49
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,130
We're almost to the exit.

50
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:40,163
-Guys, we're not
going to make it!

51
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:53,463

Hey, is everyone all right?

[giggling]

57
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,730
-Ichigo, the way
you landed showed

58
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:20,463
tremendous artistic flair.

59
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:22,363
-Gee, thanks a lot.

60
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,563
-Unh.

61
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,996
I knew it would be rough
getting through that gate.

62
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,630
But I had no idea it would take
such a toll on my equipment.

63
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:32,330
I wasn't expecting to have
to use my spare cape so soon.

64
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:33,596
-Aw, man.

65
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,663
Don't tell me he brought
a change of clothes.

66
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:37,430
-Guys, isn't this great?

67
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:38,096
We all made it.

68
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,163
And everyone's OK.

69
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,096
-It's not great.

70
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,096
We were lucky.

71
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,563
-My eye.

72
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:45,730
-I told you not to expose your
spiritual powers in there.

73
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,530
We're fortunate that
the cleaner only

74
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:49,463
make contact with
the shield area.

75
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:52,263
If it had even touched any part
of the six flowers themselves,

76
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:54,163
you'd all be dead now.

77
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:56,763
-I, I didn't know.

78
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,830
-Hey, lighten up.

79
00:04:57,863 --> 00:04:59,730
How was Orihime
supposed to know that?

80
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:02,130
And anyway, if it hadn't
been for her quick thinking,

81
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:04,230
we wouldn't have made it through
that gate in the first place.

82
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,930
-I don't think any
of you appreciate

83
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:08,030
how serious the
situation really is.

84
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:09,596
-Listen.

85
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,363
Doesn't it seem awfully
quiet around here?

86
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,730
-Yeah.

87
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:19,696
Is this place really
the soul society?

88
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,096
-Yes.

89
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,396
And the specific area we're in
is called the Rukon district.

90
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,430
It's here in the Rukon
district that souls

91
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:29,463
come to live when they first
arrive in the soul society.

92
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,530
As a matter of fact, it's
right on the perimeter

93
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:33,863
of the Seireitei, where
soul reapers live.

94
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:35,696
It's the poorest
section, but also

95
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,463
the one with the
greatest freedom.

96
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:39,063
And it has the
largest population

97
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:41,496
of souls within
the soul society.

98
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,996
-If that's true, then
where is everybody?

99
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,096
-Hey, look at those
buildings over there.

100
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,596
Why do they look so different
from everywhere else?

101
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,930
-Just forget about that.

102
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:52,130
-I know.

103
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:53,930
I bet that's the Seirei--
whatever you mentioned,

104
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:55,263
where all the soul reapers live.

105
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:56,096
-Uh!

106
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,063
-All right, you soul reapers.

107
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:57,830
Here I come.

108
00:05:57,863 --> 00:05:58,396
-Wait!

109
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,596
Stop, you idiot.

110
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,363
You can't run up to
the gate like that.

111
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:02,530
You'll be killed!

112
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,863

-[coughing]

116
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:26,630
-Well, well, it's
been a long time

117
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:29,396
since anyone tried to pass
through the spirit gates

118
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,863
without a travel permit.

119
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:36,163
And I don't get many
guests these days.

120
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,396
So welcome to you, little man.

121
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:44,096
[laughing]

122
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,830
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
So the intruders

123
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,330
have landed outside
the Hakudo gate.

124
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:49,930
-But as long as
they're on that side,

125
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:52,130
there's no need for us to
get involved in the matter.

126
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:53,430
-I agree.

127
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:55,330
Because on the other side,
they all have to deal with--

128
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:59,296
-[roaring]

129
00:06:59,330 --> 00:06:59,796
-Jidanbo.

130
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:06,363
-[laughing] Whenever
you are ready,

131
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:08,030
give it all all you've got.

132
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:09,396
And good luck.

133
00:07:13,996 --> 00:07:15,530
-He's a leviathan.

134
00:07:15,563 --> 00:07:18,130
What kind of creature do
you suppose he is, anyway?

135
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:20,030
He's way too big to
be a human being.

136
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,430
-He is known simply as Jidanbo.

137
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:24,696
He was chosen from among
the very best warriors

138
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,396
the soul society has.

139
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,030
His task is to guard
the Hakuto gate, one

140
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:31,963
of four entrances that
make up the spirit gate.

141
00:07:31,996 --> 00:07:33,063
-He's the guard?

142
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:34,630
If we intend to get
through this gate,

143
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,330
it looks like we have no
choice but to defeat him.

144
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:38,463
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN): Yes.

145
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:41,130
But that will not be an
easy task, I'm afraid.

146
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:44,330
In the 300 years Jidanbo
has served at this post,

147
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,896
countless invaders have tried.

148
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,663
But not a single one has ever
broken through the Hakuto gate.

149
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:53,396
Jidanbo has become a legend
of power and strength.

150
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,763
-How in the world
are we supposed

151
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:56,030
to defeat something like that?

152
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:58,196
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN): That's
where your intelligence

153
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,463
and creativity come in.

154
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:01,563
The first thing we need
to do is to have a meeting

155
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:03,430
to decide on a strategy.

156
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:05,963
Ichigo, let's start
with-- [screaming].

157
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:07,130
No!

158
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:07,863
Chad!

159
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:08,796
Orihime!

160
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,430
Come back here, both of you!

161
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:11,496
Have you lost your minds?

162
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,363
-(THINKING) We're coming
to help you, Ichigo.

163
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:14,763
Hang on.

164
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:16,163
We'll fight him together.

165

-He's not only huge.

00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,663
He's insane.

170
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:40,596
-You two need some
work on your manners.

171
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,230
What are you, country
bumpkins, or something?

172
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,330
We're civilized in this city.

173
00:08:45,363 --> 00:08:46,696
Here are the rules.

174
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,330
Rule number one,
always wash your hands

175
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,996
before you sit down to eat.

176
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,696
Rule number two, don't eat food
that's fallen on the floor.

177
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:02,096
Rule three, battles in the city
are always fought one on one.

178
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,963
The kid with the
spiky orange hair

179
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:06,096
was the first to approach
and challenge me.

180
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,330
So you shall be
my first opponent.

181
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:10,630
Then I'll come back
to deal with you two.

182
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:13,763
This won't take long, promise.

183
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:14,830
-Oh.

184
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:15,896
CHAD (OFFSCREEN): Orihime.

185
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,130
-Oh?

186
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:18,996
-I'm going to wait for
the right opportunity,

187
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,630
and then punch a big
hole through this wall.

188
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,363
As soon as it's open, you
aim Subaki at the big guy

189
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:25,430
through the opening.

190
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:27,196
-What was that?

191
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,430
Don't tell me you two are still
plotting schemes over there.

192
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:32,563
-Even his ears are powerful.

193
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:35,496
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Orihime,
Chad, are you there?

194
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,763
-Ichigo, yes, we're here.

195
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:38,796
Are you all right?

196
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,830
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

197
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:41,363
I'm still alive and kicking.

198
00:09:41,396 --> 00:09:42,663
-We're coming to help you.

199
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:43,963
Just wait right there.

200
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:46,596
-Yeah, well, here's
the thing, Orihime.

201
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,863
I actually want you and Chad
to just stay put, and let

202
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:50,396
me handle this by myself.

203
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,796
-What?

204
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,396
Ichigo, this is too big a job
for even you to handle alone.

205
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,730
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Don't worry.

206
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,530
Just wait for me over there.

207
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,596
It'll be OK.

208
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,263
-I refuse to do that.

209
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:01,530
-Yeah, tell him.

210
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:03,863
-Ichigo, we can't
afford to wait around.

211
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,530
Instead of wasting time
battling the guard individually,

212
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:09,063
we've got to attack together,
and get past this gate.

213
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:10,930
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
You're here too, Uryu?

214
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:13,163
-I've been here the whole time.

215
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,763
It's just like you
to waste energy

216
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:16,430
with stupid comments, Ichigo.

217
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:17,863
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Oh, shut up.

218
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:19,863
You're giving me a headache.

219
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:22,896
-Can you defeat him?

220
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,063
-Probably.

221
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:25,196
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Probably?

222
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,296
What's wrong with you?

223
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,030
Don't you understand
this is a life and death

224
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:29,363
situation we're in here?

225
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,596
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Look, don't
worry about it, all right?

226
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,396
-How can I not worry, Ichigo?

227
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,096
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Listen, I'll tell you

228
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,030
all an interesting little story.

229
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:39,730
Remember when I was training
with Mister [inaudible]?

230
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:42,163
He said it was going to take
me 10 days for my soul reaper

231
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:44,296
powers to be
completely restored.

232
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,230
But as it turned out, it
only took me five days.

233
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:50,163
So what do you think I did
for those other five day?

234
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:52,230
-Knowing you,
probably goofing off.

235
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:56,063
-I fought with him the
whole time, for so long,

236
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:58,663
nonstop, for five
days and nights.

237
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:01,430
He and I battled each
other one on one.

238
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:02,663
URYU (OFFSCREEN): I see.

239
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:05,396
And you learned all his
fighting techniques, right?

240
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,630
-Wrong again.

241
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:08,763
URYU (OFFSCREEN): So
what's your point, then.

242
00:11:08,796 --> 00:11:12,096
I didn't learn a single thing
from him about fighting.

243
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,896
But in those long hours, I
gained tremendous strength

244
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,530
and stamina.

245
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:21,430
[music playing]

246
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,267
-You done making speeches yet?

247
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,400
-Look, pal, I never
asked you to wait.

248
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:47,200
So you could have attacked
at any time, right?

249
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:50,133
-So you are a country
bumpkin after all.

250
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,167
Didn't your folks
teach you any manners?

251
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,533
When someone is polite
enough to wait for you,

252
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,533
you should always say thank you.

253
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,933
-[screaming]

254
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:03,133
-This can't be good.

255
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,000
-Huh?

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,933
Who are you, spiky head?

257
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:26,600
-I'm no expert, but
isn't it also bad

258
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:30,067
manners to attack before
your opponent is ready?

-[grumbling] [laughing]

260

261
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:45,233
-You're gutsy.

262
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:47,567
I'll give you that, spiky head.

263
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,967
I can't remember the
last time someone was

264
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,033
able to stop the
thrust of my axe.

265
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,900
This is going to be fun.

266
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:58,967
For once, I'll be able to
give it everything I have.

267
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,033
Of all the intruders who have
tried to get past this gate,

268
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:04,267
there have only been
two who have come along

269
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,700
before you who were powerful
enough to stop my first thrust.

270
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,633
But that is where
the story ends.

271
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,133
Because neither they
nor you could ever

272
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,967
hope (SHOUTING) to fend
off my second thrust.

[roaring]

274
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,567
Are you still standing?

275
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,767
I guess I get to keep trying
my attacks on you, then.

276
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,167
See how you like this.

I've never had to
count this high before.

282
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,333
But I must be at 10 by now.

283
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,633
So it's time to finish this.

288
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,367
What?

289
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,767
That's impossible.

290
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,533
How can you still be standing
after that attack, spiky head?

291
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:41,567
-I agree.

292
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,867
It does seem impossible.

293
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,800
-But he's still all right.

294
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,967
-(THINKING) Now I understand.

295
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,500
What Ichigo gained
from his training

296
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:49,967
wasn't fighting skills.

297
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,733
And it wasn't just strength
and stamina, either.

298
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,600
-Ichigo has spiritual
power far beyond that

299
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:56,967
of most soul reapers.

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,867
But he has a long way to go.

301
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,067
Because he's still inexperienced
at wielding that great power.

302
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,600
-(THINKING) So before, when he
confronted other soul reapers,

303
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:11,100
the only thing that Ichigo
was lacking was experience.

304
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:14,667
And now that he's gained that--

305
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,933
-Are you finished, gate keeper?

306
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:19,067
CHAD (OFFSCREEN):
(THINKING) I have a feeling.

307
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,567
-Because if you are,
then it's my turn now.

308
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,933
CHAD (OFFSCREEN):
(THINKING) He's

309
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:25,133
going to be so
powerful, it's scary.

310
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:29,833
-I'm not done.

311
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,400
I'm not done.

312
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:34,867
I just have to bring
out some more weaponry.

00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:47,400
Ichigo just sent
that giant flying.

325
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:56,467
-[grunting] [chuckling] Whoa,
you almost caught me that

326
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,667
time.

327
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,033
I can't believe I slipped
and fell on my behind.

328
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,967
It's been a long time
since that happened.

329
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What's that weird
look on your face for?

330
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:07,867
I bet you think you're the one
who sent me flying backwards,

331
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,133
don't you?

332
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,867
[chuckling] You should
really know better than that.

333
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,667
But it's typical of
a country bumpkin

334
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,567
like you to believe
that a gatekeeper like

335
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,433
me could be blown
away so easily.

336
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:20,500
All I have to do is
make one more swing

337
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:23,500
with my mighty axe and-- oh!

338
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,833
-Huh.

339
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:34,167
It appears Jidanbo's mighty axes
have been modified somewhat.

340
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,167
-Wow.

341
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,600
A single blow, and
he got them both.

342
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,100
-Well, are you going to say
something, or just stand there?

343
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,600
-(WHIMPERING) My axes.

344
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:49,033
My axes, ruined!

345
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,700
Why did you have to do it?

346
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:54,067
Why did you have
to-- Why did you

347
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,567
have to destroy my
beautiful babies?

348
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,500
Why?

349
00:17:57,533 --> 00:18:00,767
[sobbing]

350
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,433
-(THINKING) This giant is such
a big tough guy on the outside.

351
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:04,633
But on the inside--

352
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,300
-(THINKING) He's more
like a little boy.

353
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,267
-[sobbing]

354
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,967
-Look, I'm sorry about
your axes, and everything.

355
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,367
But, hey, I couldn't let you
keep swinging them at me.

356
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,467
Although I guess I could have
just destroyed one of them,

357
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,133
and let you keep the other one.

358
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,533
My bad.

359
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,833
-No, you not bad.

360
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,100
Even though you my enemy.

361
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:25,333
You care.

362
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:28,167
Instead of thinking of
your quest, and your desire

363
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,233
to get through the
gate, you're actually

364
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:33,433
concerned for you
opponent and his axes.

365
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:36,567
What a good person you
are, my spiky headed enemy.

366
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,000
What a generous heart you have.

367
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,133
-Well, it's only natural
to want to console someone

368
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,600
who cries so much, even
if they are really big.

369
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:44,400
-I know.

370
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,467
I'm acting like a big baby.

371
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
All that crying and moaning
over a couple of old axes.

372
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:52,433
I'm nothing but an
embarrassment as a man.

373
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:57,600
[pouting] I'm a total loser.

374
00:18:57,633 --> 00:19:00,300
-Huh?

375
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,967
-(SHOUTING) A total loser!

376
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,933
You beat me not only as a
warrior and gate keeper.

377
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:07,400
You have defeated me
as a man, as well.

378
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:10,000
It has been 300
years since I became

379
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:11,667
the keeper of the Hakudo gate.

380
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,467
And in all those years, never
have I lost a challenge,

381
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,767
or allowed anyone
to pass this way.

382
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,467
I thought the day
would never come.

383
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,500
But you are the first man
to defeat me. [sniffling]

384
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:28,733
Therefore I, Jidanbo,
hereby grant you passage

385
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,333
through the Hakudo gate.

386
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,067
-Huh?

387
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,167
Whoa, cool.

388
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,367
URYU (OFFSCREEN): You're
allowing all of us to pass?

389
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,633
-That's right.

390
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:43,400
I was decisively defeated
in battle by your leader.

391
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,467
As a result, I have no right
to stop anyone in your group.

392
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,700
-What?

393
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:50,167
Whoever said anything about
Ichigo being our leader?

394
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,367
Absolutely not!

395
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,900
-It's no big deal, but why
are you so upset, Uryu?

396
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:57,367
-So your name is
Ichigo, huh spiky head?

397
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,233
-That's right.

398
00:19:58,267 --> 00:19:59,767
I'm Ichigo Kurosaki.

399
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,333
That's a pretty cute
name for someone

400
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,367
who seems to take himself so
seriously, don't you think?

401
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,800
-My name is not cute!

402
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:06,800
Ichi means number one.

403
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,933
And go stands for guardian.

404
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,233
And that's what I am!

405
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:11,933
-[chuckling] Yeah, whatever.

406
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:13,867
You take care now.

407
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,733
I don't know why you
were so determined

408
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:17,900
to pass through this gate.

409
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:22,467
But those will meet on the
other side are all very strong.

410
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,367
-I'm aware of that.

411
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,700
-Very well.

412
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:28,467
As long as you think you know
what you're getting into.

413
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,800
Now stand back.

414
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:33,567
And I'll open the gate for you.

415
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,000
[grunting] This is
not going to be easy.

416
00:20:36,033 --> 00:20:38,500
It's been closed a long time.

417
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:47,500
[grunting]

418
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:49,000
-Oh!

419
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:59,067
-[grunting] [roaring]

420
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:05,400
-[grunting] [roaring]

421
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:05,900
-Oh!

422
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,167
-Amazing.

423
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,867
-I never thought anyone could
lift something so heavy.

424
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,300
-Jidanbo, what is it?

425
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,900
Why are you frozen like that?

426
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:19,500
Something wrong?

427
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:24,433
-[stuttering]

428
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,733
-Who is that?

429
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:40,300
-That is none other
than the captain

430
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:44,667
of Squad Three, Gin Ichimaru.

431
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,167
-[chuckling]

432
00:21:53,004 --> 00:22:03,037
[music playing]

433
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:52,532
[music playing]

434
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:54,965
URYU (OFFSCREEN): A mysterious
wild boar gang attacks.

435
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,665
And it seems that
the only one who

436
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,132
can stop this dangerous
bunch is Ichigo.

437
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:00,065
-Ha!

438
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:01,832
-And so we leave
it to you, Ichigo.

439
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:02,865
Don't let everyone down.

440
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:04,199
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Right.

441
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:05,532
Vroom, vroom, vroom.

442
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:07,432
Hey, don't run away, you guys.
