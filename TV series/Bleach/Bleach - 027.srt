00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:43,654
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Red
patrol, to the east sector!

3
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,462
Blue patrol, you search
the northwest sector!

4
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:46,662
Green patrol, head south!

5
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:48,162
Now go!

6
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:50,696
Report any sightings
of the Ryoka intruders!

7
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:51,929
Capture them at all costs!

8
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:53,896
GUARD 1 (OFFSCREEN): How
could those damn Ryoka

9
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:55,429
have disappeared so fast?

10
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:56,396
GUARD 2 (OFFSCREEN):
Never mind how.

11
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:57,629
Let's get moving!

12
00:01:57,662 --> 00:01:59,229
We've gotta find them
before the other patrols do!

13
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:00,029
GUARD 1: Follow me!

14
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:01,196
This way!

15
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,762
GUARD 2 (OFFSCREEN,
DOUBTFULLY): Are you sure?

16
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:05,562
Idiot!

17
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:06,829
It's a dead end!

18
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:08,362
GUARD 1 (OFFSCREEN): Hey,
who you calling an idiot?

19
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:09,462
GUARD 2 (OFFSCREEN):
What do you expect,

20
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,362
a medal for leading
us down a blind alley?

21
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,062
GUARD 1 (OFFSCREEN): Oh, like
you have any better ideas!

22
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:14,629
If you're so smart
then why did you

23
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:15,962
follow me in the first place?

24
00:02:15,996 --> 00:02:17,496
GUARD 3 (OFFSCREEN): Oh, just
shut up and keep looking,

25
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:17,996
both of you!

26
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:22,329
GUARD 4 (OFFSCREEN): Get moving!

27
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:23,162
Come on!

28
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:23,662
GUARD 2 (OFFSCREEN): Come on!

29
00:02:23,696 --> 00:02:24,096
Everybody!

30
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:24,596
Forward!

31
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:25,296
Let's go!

32
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:25,696
GUARD 3 (OFFSCREEN): Up!

33
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,096
Up!

34
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,229
Up!

35
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:27,862
MALE SPEAKER 2 (OFFSCREEN):
Attention, please.

36
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:28,596
Attention, please.

37
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:29,262
The search for--

38
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:29,896
-Hey, you!

39
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:30,662
You're in the way!

40
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:31,496
Move it!

41
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:32,029
-Oh!

42
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:32,696
Forgive me!

43
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:33,662
Uh-- Oooh!

44
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,596
-Stupid [inaudible] peon!

45
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:38,496
Take your menial
chores someplace else!

46
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:40,429
-I'm just trying not to spill!

47
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:41,796
Hoo hoo hoo!

48
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,329
MALE SPEAKER 2
(OFFSCREEN): Effective

49
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:46,896
immediately, Squad Six's new
perimeter is West Sector.

50
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:47,396
-Whew!

51
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,562
Hello there, Rukia!

52
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:55,229
I've brought you your lunch!

53
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:55,796
Are you awake?

54
00:03:01,996 --> 00:03:03,496
I don't see you!

55
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:04,729
Are you in there?

56
00:03:04,762 --> 00:03:06,429
FEMALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN):
Who goes there?

57
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:07,862
Squad Four?

58
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,029
-Yes.

59
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:12,429
I'm Hanataro, the caretaker
for Rukia Kuchiki.

60
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:13,896
I've brought her lunch.

61
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:14,962
Where is she?

62
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:17,096
-Rukia Kuchiki has
already been transferred

63
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:19,829
to the repentant cell
to await her execution.

64
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:27,162
-[gasping] But--
But I was just--

65
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:28,062
-Hm?

66
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:29,129
What's the matter?

67
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:30,596
You got a problem?

68
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,562
-No, I just wasn't expecting it.

69
00:03:34,596 --> 00:03:37,529
-In any case, you shouldn't be
here during the intruder alert,

70
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:38,529
understand?

71
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:40,062
Return to your
squad, immediately.

72
00:03:44,462 --> 00:03:45,129
-Oh, Rukia.

73
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,562
-I wonder what that
strange light in the sky

74
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:01,929
could have been.

75
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:07,196
Behind these walls, I can't
feel any spirit energy at all.

76
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:09,862
Ichigo, could it be
that you're really here?

77
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,696
-You talk as if this
battle is already over,

78
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:28,162
but you haven't even caught
a glimpse of my skills.

79
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:29,629
yet.

80
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:32,596
Get ready, Ikkaku,
because this time

81
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:34,896
it'll be you who finds he
can't hold onto his sword.

82
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:43,229
-If only your talents
were as well-developed

83
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:47,329
as your boasting, newbie.

84
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:49,962
Your arrogance is
just a cheap disguise.

85
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:01,829
Too slow!

86
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:38,596
What was that you were
saying before, you amateur?

87
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,529
Did you really think you could
make me lose grip of my sword?

88
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,262
-If I'm so slow, then
how did that happen?

89
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:10,029
-Just a fluke.

90
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:11,596
And it won't happen again.

91
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:14,029
-Your predictions are even
shakier than your fighting

92
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:14,529
ability.

93
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,696
-You're still not
fast enough to beat--

94
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,229
-You're lucky!

95
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:01,996
-Hey, what's wrong?

96
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,262
What happened to all
that big talk of yours?

97
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:08,562
Hozukimaru can
transform at will.

98
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:12,362
I guess you really aren't
in my league after all.

99
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:18,462
-I'll admit, it took me a little
while, but I've got it now.

100
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:21,562
I finally have your attack
completely figured out.

101
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:38,362
-(THINKING) Impossible!

102
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:40,796
He took Hozukimaru
with his bare hand!

103
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:44,762
-Heh.

104
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:50,162
-Hey, this way, Kenny!

105
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:51,662
They're right up ahead!

106
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:53,129
-They'd better be.

107
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:55,829
We've been running for a while
now without seeing a thing.

108
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:56,929
-Oh, don't worry!

109
00:07:56,962 --> 00:07:59,496
My super-sharp intuition
never lets me down!

110
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:00,429
Turn right!

111
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:01,829
Right here!

112
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:03,229
-Oh, super-sharp, eh?

113
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:04,662
It's a dead end!

114
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:06,462
-Oh, whoopsie, wait a minute!

115
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:07,729
I meant to say it's that way!

116
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:09,862
-(DEADPAN SARCASM) That's
some intuition you've got.

117
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:12,429
I'm beginning to wonder
how reliable it really is.

118
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:17,862
-Wow.

119
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:19,996
Get back, Orihime.

120
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:22,229
-No sign of the
Ryoka in this sector.

121
00:08:22,262 --> 00:08:23,029
-Damn!

122
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:24,362
Where did they disappear to?

123
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:26,829
-It looks like our arrival
has caused quite a commotion.

124
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:29,262
It's going to be almost
impossible for us to meet up

125
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:31,329
with Ichigo and the
others with so many guards

126
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:32,629
out looking for us.

127
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:34,696
Maybe instead of risking
capture you and I

128
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,396
should just start looking
for Rukia on our own.

129
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,229
Or we could start a fight
and hope Ichigo shows up.

130
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:41,696
I don't know.

131
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,829
What do you think, Orihime?

132
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,029
Orihime!

133
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:48,162
Where are you?

134
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:49,029
Great.

135
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,529
Where did she disappear to?

136
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:51,996
ORIHIME (FAR
OFFSCREEN): Uryu, help!

137
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:53,462
They're after me!

138
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:53,962
Help!

139
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:55,562
[crying]

140
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:56,962
GUARDS (OFFSCREEN):
There she is!

141
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:57,629
Get her!

142
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,429
She's getting away!

143
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:00,896
This way!

144
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:01,396
Run!

145
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:05,629
-What did you do, Orihime?

146
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:06,862
-I'm sorry!

147
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:08,462
I just went down that alley
to take a look around,

148
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:10,362
and a bunch of them spotted me!

149
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:11,996
-At least you settled on a plan.

150
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:14,129
Now I'm going to
have to fight them.

151
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:15,962
-I'll stand and fight with you!

152
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:18,129
-No, just go and hide
and leave this to me.

153
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:19,396
-Attack!

154
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:20,062
-We got 'em now!

155
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:20,629
-Let's go!

156
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:21,829
C'mon, c'mon!

157
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,796
-Boy, there sure are a
lot of them, aren't there?

158
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:24,729
-Yeah.

159
00:09:24,762 --> 00:09:26,229
GUARD (OFFSCREEN):
There they are!

160
00:09:26,262 --> 00:09:26,729
C'mon!

161
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:32,562
GUARD (OFFSCREEN):
We've got you now!

162
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:34,029
-Now there are even more!

163
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:35,296
What do you think?

164
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:36,362
Do you have a strategy?

165
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:37,529
-I do-- run!

166
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:55,262
-What is that?

167
00:09:58,962 --> 00:09:59,862
(THINKING) I know.

168
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:00,962
It must be Ichigo.

169
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:13,162
-What's wrong with you, Ikkaku?

170
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,129
You look like you've just
seen a ghost or something.

171
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:20,062
I hope you haven't lost the
will to fight all of a sudden.

172
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:22,896
But if you won't attack, I will.

173
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,796
I'll tell you one
more time, Ikkaku--

174
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:36,496
the one who's not going to
be able to hold their weapon

175
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:37,496
is you!

176
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,837
-(THINKING) This can't be!

177
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:46,170
I guess you think it's over, but
you're dead wrong, my friend.

178
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:52,903
It won't be over as long
as I can hold my sword.

179
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:54,570
You really want to end this?

180
00:11:54,603 --> 00:11:58,903
[laughing maniacally]

181
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:02,403
-'Cause the only way I'll put
down my sword is if you cut off

182
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:05,137
my arm!

183
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,070
-Don't make me do this.

184
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,603
-You don't have
the stomach for it?

185
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:12,870
-Why don't you just face the
fact that this fight is over?

186
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:15,337
You can't win, and you
know it, so give it up!

187
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,170
-No chance, greenhorn.

188
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,270
This battle isn't over yet.

189
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:22,270
And it's not going to be
until one of us is dead.

190
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:47,437
-You're too slow!

191
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,837
-Maybe you are strong.

192
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,003
I'll give you that.

193
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:14,137
Not so lucky after all.

194
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:32,537
-This wasn't a lucky day
for either one of us,

195
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,770
if you ask me.

196
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,603
-Where'd that guy go?

197
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,403
-When are you going to
stop running from me?

198
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:56,903
-Just as soon as
you surrender to me.

199
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,937
-This is getting so tiresome.

200
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,737
I think I'll just end it.

201
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:06,937
It won't require much, just
one stroke of my Fuji Kujaku.

202
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,570
-End it, huh?

203
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,503
If that's what you want.

204
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,237
I could show you
a trick of my own!

205
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,103
-What is this, some
kind of poison gas?

206
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:29,237
Augh, my eyes!

207
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,270
It's burning my beautiful eyes!

208
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:33,203
-You like that?

209
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:34,537
Isn't it wonderful?

210
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,437
The one and only original
Kukaku brand Chili Pepper Smoke

211
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,870
Bomb with bloody tears effect!

212
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:42,737
Hey, wait a minute,
what's going on here?

213
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,937
My eyes are starting
to hurt, too!

214
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,170
-Now it's burning my throat!

215
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:49,903
-Some powerful stuff, huh?

216
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:51,637
-Powerful, and stupid!

217
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,903
I can't believe you
actually blasted yourself

218
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:57,137
with your own toxic smoke bomb!

219
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,703
-That's OK.

220
00:14:57,737 --> 00:14:59,870
I can take it.

221
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:01,770
-I'd kill you if
I could see you.

222
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:04,070
-You know, somehow, that's
not very scary right now.

223
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,270
-Whoa!

224
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:08,470
-Hey, let go of
me, you big leech!

225
00:15:08,503 --> 00:15:10,737
-Oh, right, so I could
fall to my death?

226
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,803
I don't think so.

227
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,137
-How come-- how come
I'm still alive?

228
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,137
-ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): I
see you're finally awake.

229
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,903
Hey.

230
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,703
-Ichigo!

231
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:41,470
What are you doing?

232
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:43,670
Why are you still here?

233
00:15:43,703 --> 00:15:46,903
-Well, I learned something.

234
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:49,703
I learned that a Zanpakuto
goes right back to normal

235
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:53,337
just as soon as its
owner passes out.

236
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,037
-My Hozukimaru!

237
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,970
Give it back to me!

238
00:15:56,003 --> 00:15:56,937
-Come on, relax.

239
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,570
I'm not going to
take it from you.

240
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:01,270
I only used its ointment
to stop the bleeding.

241
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:03,637
Unfortunately, between
both our injuries

242
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,970
I had to use it all up.

243
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:12,037
I have to admit, though, that's
some pretty amazing ointment

244
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,970
you have!

245
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:13,770
-You bastard!

246
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:15,403
You had no right to do that!

247
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:16,603
-Are you kidding?

248
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:19,403
Sure it's all gone now,
but it saved your life.

249
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,070
-That's exactly the point!

250
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,303
-Huh?

251
00:16:22,337 --> 00:16:23,803
-Don't you see?

252
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:26,137
Now you've denied me
the glory of death

253
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,270
after being so
thoroughly defeated.

254
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:31,470
How can I possibly live on
now, in such humiliation?

255
00:16:34,937 --> 00:16:37,270
Dammit, Ichigo, if
I could get up now,

256
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:39,270
I would beat you
to a bloody pulp!

257
00:16:39,303 --> 00:16:40,770
-What an idiot.

258
00:16:40,803 --> 00:16:42,503
Obviously, I shouldn't
even have bothered

259
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:44,870
saving your life
in the first place.

260
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,537
But, whether you
appreciate it or not

261
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,170
doesn't really matter to me.

262
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:54,503
I just need some
answers from you.

263
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:57,737
-Oh, I should have known there
was something more to this.

264
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,903
I am unlucky.

265
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,903
So what is it you want from me?

266
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,603
You want to know my birthday?

267
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:06,970
-I want Rukia Kuchiki.

268
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:07,503
Where is she?

269
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,970
-Let go of me!

270
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:16,003
I can't hold us both up!

271
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:17,037
Let go!

272
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,803
Then at least one
of us will live!

273
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,137
-No!

274
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,203
Believe me, there's no fate
worse than falling in there.

275
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:23,870
We've both got to hang on!

276
00:17:23,903 --> 00:17:25,570
YUMICHIKA (MEMORY
VOICEOVER): These days,

277
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:28,570
those who fall into this
pit can never get out.

278
00:17:28,603 --> 00:17:31,103
-I can't-- hold on-- anymore!

279
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,803
I don't want to die!

280
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:41,937
I don't want to die!

281
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,003
Urgh!

282
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:44,403
Holy crap!

283
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:45,803
This place smells like a dump!

284
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:47,370
Wait, it is a dump!

285
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:49,170
Hey, I thought you
said falling in here

286
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:51,770
was the worst fate that
could happen to someone!

287
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:55,303
-Goes to show you, you can't
believe everything you hear.

288
00:17:55,337 --> 00:17:58,337
Regardless of that,
how dare you plunge me

289
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,970
into a disgusting pit like this!

290
00:18:01,003 --> 00:18:03,770
You'll pay!

291
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:04,637
-Dumbass!

292
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,970
You fell in here
all on your own!

293
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:06,770
-Shut up!

294
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:16,503
-Don't tell me we're
back to running again!

295
00:18:16,537 --> 00:18:17,003
-Rukia?

296
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:21,270
Right.

297
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:28,737
Yes, I know about
that capital offender.

298
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,803
What do you want with
someone like that?

299
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:33,537
-We're here to save her.

300
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,003
-What the--?

301
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:36,737
Do you mean a rescue?

302
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,403
How many of you are there here?

303
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:40,570
-I'll check over here.

304
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,970
IKKAKU (VOICEOVER):
I mean, for something

305
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,703
like that there must be at
least nine or 10 of you, right?

306
00:18:53,737 --> 00:18:57,170
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): No,
five humans and one animal.

307
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:02,370
-Five humans and an animal?

308
00:19:02,403 --> 00:19:07,237
And you seriously intend
to rescue her with so few?

309
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,903
-That's right!

310
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,637
You'll never pull off a suicide
mission like that, you idiot!

311
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,137
What, are your real goals
stupid or something?

312
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,337
Agh!

313
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,070
I laughed so hard I
opened my wound again!

314
00:19:23,103 --> 00:19:24,137
Dammit that hurts!

315
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,203
-And he's telling me
I'm the stupid one?

316
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:28,570
-Yeeaugh.

317
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:31,170
All right, listen.

318
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,503
If you go directly
south from here,

319
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:38,070
you'll come to the stations
for the 13 court guards squads.

320
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:40,870
-So, you are willing to
give me the information?

321
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:44,203
-Just shut up and listen
before I change my mind.

322
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:47,403
Off by itself at the far west
end of all the squad stations,

323
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,837
you'll see a tall white tower.

324
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,303
That's where the
prisoner is being held.

325
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:54,503
-What?

326
00:19:54,537 --> 00:19:55,503
Are you sure?

327
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:57,637
-Now you're doubting me?

328
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,903
I have no interest in
the success or failure

329
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:01,203
of your rescue.

330
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:02,770
Save the girl if you want.

331
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:06,303
I don't care about
it either way.

332
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:08,237
But, if you stay
here any longer I

333
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,837
guarantee you other soul
reapers will find you.

334
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,270
So go if you're going.

335
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:13,337
-Right.

336
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,670
Thank you.

337
00:20:14,703 --> 00:20:17,103
I owe you for this, Ikkaku.

338
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:19,137
-Don't go getting
sentimental on me.

339
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,670
It's annoying.

340
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:22,637
Just a minute.

341
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,637
Can I ask you a question?

342
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,070
-Hm?

343
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:29,403
-Who's the strongest
member of your group?

344
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:33,770
-Well, that would be me.

345
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:38,237
-If so, then I suggest
you keep an eye out

346
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,137
for my captain, Ichigo.

347
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,237
The captain has no
interest in fighting

348
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,603
against weak opponents.

349
00:20:43,637 --> 00:20:46,770
If it's true that you are
the strongest, then it's you

350
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:48,670
he will come after.

351
00:20:48,703 --> 00:20:50,870
-He's that good?

352
00:20:50,903 --> 00:20:53,770
-You'll find out when you meet.

353
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:56,837
That is, if you can somehow
manage to stay alive

354
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,070
long enough after he finds
you to take his measure.

355
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:06,003
-Tell me what his name is.

356
00:21:06,037 --> 00:21:09,337
Captain of Squad
Eleven, Kenpachi Zaraki.

357
00:21:20,703 --> 00:21:21,670
-Crap.

358
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:23,570
It's another dead end, Yachiru!

359
00:21:23,603 --> 00:21:25,637
-Hey, I'm only the
passenger here!

360
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,070
I can't help it if your
sense of direction stinks!

361
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:29,403
-Don't get smart.

362
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:31,637
We only came this way
because I believed

363
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,970
in your so-called intuition.

364
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:35,870
Let's keep moving.

365
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:37,170
-Aye-aye, sir!

366
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:49,064
[theme song]

367
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:53,555
URYU (VOICEOVER): Absolutely
no sense of fashion.

368
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:54,721
It really bothers me.

369
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:56,755
Do you mean these soul
reapers are actually

370
00:22:56,788 --> 00:22:57,921
happy with their look?

371
00:22:57,955 --> 00:22:59,455
I can't understand it!

372
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:02,121
That's why I've always
despised soul reapers!

373
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:05,055
-Uryu, Are the soul reaper
are still your enemies--

374
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:06,588
-Because of their clothes?
