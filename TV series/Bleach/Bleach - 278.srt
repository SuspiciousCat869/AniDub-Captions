1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,433
Your only option is to
attack me from where you
stand.

2
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:07,932
Kick about, Los Lobos!

3
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:58,366
And that counter attack
packed a real punch. Damn.
I'm impressed.

4
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,032
Why thank you, Captain.

5
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:04,032
I went through all the
trouble of a sword
release.

6
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:07,466
You can at least show
me what I want... your
Bankai.

7
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:22,832
Cero Metralleta.

8
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:35,266
It's no use
running away!

9
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:40,399
Hey! Hold on, wait a
second!

10
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:41,999
You had your chance!

11
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:49,832
When fired like this,
even a Cero blast should
be enough to destroy you,
right?

12
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,532
I dunno, isn't that
kinda like cheating?!

13
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,366
<i>Seems fair to me.</i>

14
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:58,966
What's wrong? Have
you had enough, Captain?

15
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:03,199
Maybe it's time you
show me... your Bankai.

16
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,766
Looks like I
don't have a choice.

17
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:20,366
[panting]

18
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,032
Damn it. I must have
taken too much damage.

19
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:37,932
Are you all right,
Captain!

20
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:39,032
I'm fine!

21
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:40,532
Huh?!

22
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:45,099
Oh, come on! Why can't
you just accept somebody
trying to be kind to you?

23
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:46,932
What did you just say?

24
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:49,866
Uh?! That wasn't
me, ma'am!

25
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:54,566
Must've been the wind.
But that guy was scary,
wasn't he, Captain?

26
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:00,132
Um, Captain?

27
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:02,232
We're done with
that, now.

28
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,866
Sogyonokotowari.

29
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:14,266
[gasping]

30
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:28,232
Jushiro?

31
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,832
What the hell? Did
he shoot... a Cero?

32
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,166
That was definitely a
Cero.

33
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,299
Hey, what gives?

34
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:55,266
<i>There's no use arguing.</i>

35
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:58,466
<i>We're basically up</i>
<i>against two of them.</i>

36
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:01,532
There's nothing
cowardly in accepting
my help.

37
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,266
I got the sense you
weren't planning on
using your Bankai.

38
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:10,766
Actually, I was just
about to.

39
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,132
No. You
shouldn't.

40
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,599
Hm??!

41
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:18,266
It's too risky. Your
Bankai shouldn't be
used where it could
be seen.

42
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:26,232
Not to mention, against
an enemy like this...
my attacks will be more
effective.

43
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:28,532
Hey you.

44
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:29,332
Huh?

45
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:30,732
<i>Not you.</i>

46
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:33,632
You, the captain with
the white hair.

47
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,766
Oh, me?!

48
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:35,832
Yeah...

49
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:39,966
How did you manage to
fire that Cero just now?

50
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:46,032
Well, I can't really say.
If you shoot at us again,
there's a good chance
you'll find out.

51
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,299
That sounds fair.

52
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:55,266
Guess I'll try that!

53
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:59,666
Hey wait-Hold on! He's
trying to set a trap for
you!

54
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,266
Isn't it pretty obvious?!
He wants you to shoot at
him! Hey, come on!

55
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,232
Are you listening
to me?!

56
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:09,832
Just shut up.

57
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,332
See! He fired back at us,
just like I thought he
would! Would you listen
to me?!

58
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,032
Now I get it.

59
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:45,799
You have the ability to
absorb an enemy's attack
and send it directly back
to where it came from.

60
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,732
But that's not
all, is it?

61
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:56,232
Those five talismans
hanging from that cord
adjust the speed and
pressure of the technique

62
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:59,766
when it returns, which
throws off your
opponent...

63
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:04,032
It complicates your
enemy's timing and disrupts
their defense.

64
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:09,199
You may have the
appearance of a
gentleman...

65
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:12,432
... but you've got some
pretty nasty skills,
don't you?

66
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:17,399
Amazing! I never thought
you'd figure out that much
from just three attacks!

67
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:21,632
Thanks for the compliment.
I'm pleased to know that
your ability isn't some

68
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:25,266
mindless trick that only
reflects your enemy's
attacks back at them.

69
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:28,299
But since you absorb the
attacks before sending
them back,

70
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:31,466
there has to be a limit as
to how much you can take in.

71
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:37,099
If I fired hundreds of
shots at you at the same
time, you couldn't
return all of them.

72
00:08:49,832 --> 00:08:53,166
Looks like you're
acting out of
character... Captain!

73
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,899
You don't know me well
enough to speak about
my character.

74
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:02,232
I'd have to say my
biggest characteristic,
is being completely
uncharacteristic.

75
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:06,999
Uh! And all this time I
thought you and I were
alike!

76
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:30,966
I've got you!

77
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:32,099
Not quite.

78
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:42,099
So, you're staying at
close range where I can
shoot you. In that case...

79
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:51,232
Now you can't get to me
from this side.

80
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:56,632
Your only option is to
attack me from where you
stand.

81
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,066
Hm!

82
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:04,699
Uh!

83
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:18,932
Hm! You're
really good!

84
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:22,232
Huh.

85
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:27,299
Oh, you guys are actually
trying to hustle me, aren't
you? Was that your plan?

86
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:29,932
He never promised to
fight you alone.

87
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:32,732
Jushiro, how are you
holding up, old buddy?

88
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:34,832
Heh, never
felt better.

89
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,032
<i>You bastards!</i>

90
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:39,232
Two on one's unfair!
Attack him one at a time!

91
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:43,899
What are you talking
about?! There are two
of you as well! You're
helping him.

92
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:46,866
A kid like you shouldn't
be involved in this thing.

93
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,532
<i>Will you give it a rest,</i>
<i>old man?</i>

94
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,599
<i>I've really had</i>
<i>it with you.</i>

95
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:54,232
<i>I want this guy dead</i>
<i>right now, Stark!</i>

96
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:59,032
Okay, okay! I want to get
this over with quickly as
well, but--

97
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:03,132
This time, I'll see to
it from the start that
he won't get near us.

98
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,166
Are you ready?

99
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:07,966
Yeah.

100
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,532
[gasping]

101
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:28,666
What? A Garganta?!

102
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:32,599
It's huge! What the
hell is going on up
there?

103
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,266
Hmmm...

104
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:42,966
It can't be.

105
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:45,132
No, not now.

106
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:48,866
A Garganta?
Reinforcements?

107
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:54,032
Are you trying to tell me
there are more of them coming
over here to help these
Espadas attack us?

108
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:56,632
Well, now, that's
not a pleasant thought.

109
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:24,832
What the--?
Who is that?

110
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,932
He's one creepy
looking fella,
that's for sure.

111
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,699
Aaaaa.

112
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:44,766
Wonderweiss.

113
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,366
Haaauuhhh.

114
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:54,866
Whoa.

115
00:12:56,332 --> 00:12:59,532
Hey look! Now something
else is coming out.

116
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,666
Captain! What's
going on?!

117
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:13,166
What?!

118
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,766
Uh! You're
kidding me.

119
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,200
Aaaa-oouh-ah.

120
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:46,333
Hmm.

121
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:52,733
That's the eye...
from before.

122
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,667
Ahhh! Captain, let's
get out of here before--

123
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,000
Just shut up.

124
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:23,233

Sorry.

Aaa-aauuh.

<i>The fact that Wonderweiss</i>

Uh... Captain?!

143
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,267
Captain Komamura.

144
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,033
Hm?

145
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:24,533
We'll be fine here.
Please sir, go.

146
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,567
Are you sure?

147
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,867
You must go!

148
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:32,067
I know your presence here
is keeping us safe, Captain!

149
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,467
But our survival means
nothing, if everyone is
wiped out because you
stay with us!!

150
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,633
Aaaaahhh-oooh-ahh.

151
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,833
Hmm?

152
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,400
That's rather a foul
stench... as always.

153
00:16:58,433 --> 00:16:59,900
<i>Agreed.</i>

154
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:04,200
This must be what people
refer to as the stench of
death.

155
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:09,167
Yes, the stench of death
is quite fitting here.
It's a perfect
description...

156
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:12,667
... of what's about
to happen before us.

157
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,067
Uh!

158
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,500
Uh!

159
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,700
This is it.

160
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,167
We're finished!!

161
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,867
Not so fast.

162
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,767
[gasping]

163
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,033
Heh!

164
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,400
Rose...!

165
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:25,033
I'm on it, everyone
get back!

166
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,600
Good! Now I gotcha!

167
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:30,167
[roaring]

168
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,667
Bakudo Number
Ninety-Nine...!

169
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,300
...Restrict!

170
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:46,767
Shin... ji...

171
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,333
Let go of me!

172
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:53,000
[gagging]

173
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,367
[gasping]

174
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,300
[screaming]

175
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,733
Hold on a minute...!

176
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,700
...Kaname!

177
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,067
He's actually quite...
loyal.

178
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:29,267
As a matter of fact,
Kaname was just loyally
following my orders.

179
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:34,133
You, of all people, can
understand that, so
please don't hold it
against him...

180
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:36,133
...Captain Hirako.

181
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:39,233
Sosu... ke...!

182
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:42,300
Sosuke!

183
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:49,200
What's happening to me?

184
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:51,733
[gasping]

185
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,667
Sosuke!! What's
going on?!

186
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,067
I suppose, when it comes
right down to it, that
you owe your friends here
an apology. Because you

187
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,567
were chosen by me, they
ended up on the ground as
casualties, through no
fault of their own...

188
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:19,967
[struggling]

189
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,867
As we thought... it
appears that an agitated
state helps to accelerate
the Hollowfication process.

190
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,933
Hollowfication?

191
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,967
What have you
done to us?

192
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,800
I see no reason to
explain, Captain.

193
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:38,267
[struggling]

194
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,333
I believe it's time
to finish you off...
...Dear Captain Hirako.

195
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:48,800
In the end, I hope you'll
remember one thing...

196
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,667
Any betrayal you can see
is trivial.

197
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,667
What is truly frightening,
and much more lethal, is
the betrayal you cannot see.

198
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,200
Goodbye...

199
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:08,933
I must commend you---You
people have provided
wonderful research
material.

200
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:15,967
[screaming]

201
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,509
It's been awhile,
hasn't it?

202
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:06,175
Sosuke...

203
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:45,709
Aaaah!

204
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:47,509
<i>Damn! He's</i>
<i>still screaming.</i>

205
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:50,709
<i>Sorry Izuru, I could no</i>
<i>longer hold back my</i>
<i>instinctual urges.</i>

206
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:51,742
<i>Captain Komamura?</i>

207
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:56,809
<i>[barking]</i>
<i>[screaming]</i>

208
00:23:58,946 --> 00:24:00,105
<i>Stop that!</i>
