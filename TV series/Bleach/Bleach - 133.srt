00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:53,715
-Guys!

3
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:54,348
What happened?

4
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:56,348
How are you hurt?

5
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,115
-How should I put this?

6
00:01:58,148 --> 00:02:01,915
It'll Sound strange, I guess,
but we kind of got ambushed.

7
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:03,448
-An ambush?

8
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:04,248
-Yeah.

9
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:05,915
It was.

10
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:07,715
Tell me who you are!

11
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:10,348
-We are the Kotei
Academy kendo team,

12
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,115
and we are going
to be victorious

13
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:14,348
at the regional tournament!

[shouting]

15
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:22,748
-You're calling that an ambush?

16
00:02:22,782 --> 00:02:24,282
But they told you who they were.

17
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:25,515
-It was an ambush.

18
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:26,915
-You've got to be kidding me!

19
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:29,915
-I ran away, but I was too slow.

20
00:02:29,948 --> 00:02:32,348
-No, it's not your
fault, Shinji.

21
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:34,382
It's those idiots
who are to blame.

22
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:37,648
But with the starters being
all banged up like this,

23
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:39,715
it looks like we've got
no choice but to pull out

24
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:41,215
of next month's
regional tournament.

25
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,482
-No!

26
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:44,948
Something this dumb is no
reason for us to give up.

27
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:46,648
I'll make arrangements
with Kotei Academy

28
00:02:46,682 --> 00:02:49,782
to have a friendly match,
and then we'll destroy them!

29
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:50,548
-Huh?

30
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:51,882
-You were ambushed.

31
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:53,582
I think that it's
obviously they want

32
00:02:53,615 --> 00:02:55,048
you to pull out of
the competition.

33
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:56,415
Aren't you agnry?

34
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:57,815
I sure am!

35
00:02:57,848 --> 00:03:00,215
Get revenge at this match, and
come the regional tournament,

36
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:01,882
you'll have momentum!

37
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,248
-I wish we could.

38
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,815
-But we just got
ambushed yesterday.

[sigh]

40
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:09,682
-You freshmen look like
you're in good health.

41
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:10,748
-Huh?

42
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:13,082
We're not strong enough
to take on Kotei.

43
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:14,848
-You are completely pathetic!

44
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:16,882
Are you mice, or are you men?

45
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:19,015
You're giong to avenge your
upperclassmen no matter

46
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:19,982
what it takes!

47
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:20,948
Got it?

48
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:22,115
-She's completely crazy!

49
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:31,482
-Mizuho, I brought Ikkaku
and Yumichika here,

50
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:32,715
just as you ordered.

51
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:36,082
But who are they?

52
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,448
-We're freshman students.

53
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:40,315
We're here for the Karakura
High School kendo team.

54
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:41,448
Pleased to meet you.

55
00:03:41,482 --> 00:03:43,782
It's an honor for us and
Karakura High School.

56
00:03:43,815 --> 00:03:46,915
-OK, Mizuho, so what
do you want with us?

57
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:49,582
All of a sudden you just
make me put on this outfit.

58
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:53,182
-Uh, you don't seem
too upset about it.

59
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:55,848
-Oh, darling, you look
so handsome in it!

60
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:58,915
You look so heroic
standing there.

61
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,515
-This is bad, Ikkaku.

62
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:03,482
Now, it's true that I brought
you here, but be warned,

63
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:05,115
whatever she wants
will benefit her.

64
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:07,882
That's all.

65
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,415
-Keep your mouth shut!

66
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:15,415
-Listen, darling.

67
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:17,782
This very weekend we're
having a friendly match

68
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:20,915
between our kendo team and
the kendo team for the Kotei

69
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:22,082
Academy.

70
00:04:22,115 --> 00:04:24,048
And I want you to prepare
them for the event.

71
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:25,015
-Huh?

72
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:26,882
Every one of these guys is weak.

73
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:28,048
MIZUHO: That's right.

74
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:32,348
I want you to make them
into real men somehow.

75
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:33,082
-I, uh--

76
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:34,382
-Hm?

77
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:38,482
-Um-- can I change
into a real man?

78
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:42,982
-No way!

79
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,015
Participate in your
youth club activities?

80
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:46,582
Ikkaku would never do that.

81
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:48,815
Right, Ikkaku?

82
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:49,582
-OK.

83
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,648
Count me in.

84
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:53,282
-You'll really do that?

85
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:55,015
-I'm in debt to
this strange woman

86
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:56,515
for giving me food and shelter.

87
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:58,615
-You're the sweetest man ever!

88
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:00,248
-I'm not getting involved.

89
00:05:00,282 --> 00:05:03,382
-Yumichika, don't go!

90
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:05,048
-What an unmanly guy he is.

91
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:07,548
-But you can handle
it, right, darling?

92
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:09,582
-We'll depend upon you, sir.

93
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:10,982
-Yes!

94
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:11,982
-Good.

95
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:15,482
You'll find this
training very difficult.

96
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,882
-He really wants to do this.

97
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:17,648
-That's wonderful!

98
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:19,382
-But why?

99
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:20,548
-Come on, wimp!

100
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:21,315
Come on!

101
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:22,448
Pull!

102
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:25,015
You've got to put your
back into it and pull!

103
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:25,848
-Yes, sir!

104
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:27,448
I'll do my very best to pull it!

105
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:28,215
-You wimp!

106
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:29,248
Come on, come on, come on!

107
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:30,682
-Yes, sir!

108
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:32,815
-They're pulling carts?

109
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:35,182
More importantly,
that sword's for real!

110
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,315
-Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

111
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,382
Climb up, already,
you weaklings!

112
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:42,815
-Hopping up the stairs
while squatting like that?

113
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:44,482
Isn't that bad for your back?

114
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:48,548
-61, 62, 63!

115
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,348
-That's crazy, right?

116
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:54,515
-I don't know how else to say
it, but this is beyond heavy!

117
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:56,248
-I think I can endure it!

118
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:56,982
-That's right!

119
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:59,582
Real men endure pain!

120
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,782
Beyond that is victory.

121
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:03,448
-I can't fail!

122
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:06,515
-Stranger and stranger.

123
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:07,782
-We're doing it!

124
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:09,148
Everything's looking super good!

125
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:10,548
-This is good?

126
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:13,148
It doesn't even resemble kendo!

127
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:13,882
-Huh.

128
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,848
-I'm sorry, sis.

129
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:17,182
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, but don't you

130
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:19,415
think the training's
going a little too far?

131
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:20,748
-Ikkaku won't kill 'em.

132
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:22,948
Don't worry about it.

133
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,448
Because my darling
has his own ideas!

134
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:26,748
-That's what I'm afraid of!

135
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:35,248
-Karakura students, I hope that
you haven't given up already,

136
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:36,015
men.

137
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:39,715
[groaning]

138
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:40,982
-It's all so bad.

139
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:43,548
-My aching body.

140
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:46,948
-So you quit?

141
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:49,015
-I will go on, sir.

142
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:50,282
-Hmph.

143
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:52,782
I thought you'd be the
first to give up, Shinji,

144
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:55,348
but I see that
you've got spirit.

145
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:56,848
Come on.

146
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:57,548
-Kya!

147
00:06:57,582 --> 00:07:00,182
Ow!

148
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:02,782
-So, is that all the
spirit you possess?

149
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:07,648
-I-- I must work even harder
if I want to become stronger.

150
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:10,815
For the upperclassmen who
protected me from harm.

151
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:11,315
I must!

152
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:21,682
-You can't go charging
straight in like that.

153
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:25,415
Look for your enemy's openings.

154
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:27,148
-But I can't find any openings.

155
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:28,182
-Quit, kid.

156
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,448
Shut up.

157
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,915
We're going to keep going
'til you find an opening.

158
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:33,448
Come on, come on, come on!

159
00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:34,148
SHINJI: Wah!

160
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:34,982
IKKAKU: Bring it on!

161
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:50,615
-Um, incidentally, I
must ask, why are you

162
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:52,682
working so hard for this?

163
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:55,848
-You're asking me why?

164
00:07:55,882 --> 00:07:57,815
Well, because it's fun.

165
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:00,482
Heh.

166
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:01,148
-Oh.

167
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:01,648
Sure.

168
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,048
I see.

169
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,548
Because it's fun.

170
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:05,648
What?

171
00:08:05,682 --> 00:08:06,615
That's it?

172
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:08,082
'Cause it's fun for you?

173
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:12,715
-It's been awhile
since I've seen it.

174
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:19,882
That look of desperation
that comes from one's desire

175
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:20,548
to get stronger.

176
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:32,548
-He is majorly wrapped
up in this kendo thing.

177
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:34,015
-What's wrong with you?

178
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:36,115
-We're sorry.

179
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,315
-We're beat!

180
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:41,182
-Thing is, I'd say that
the upperclassmen really

181
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,482
aren't injured this badly.

182
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:46,582
-Guess I overdid it.

183
00:08:46,615 --> 00:08:47,815
-Oh, no!

184
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:50,315
Is it true that the team
members have all been hurt?

185
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:51,115
-Mizuho!

186
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:52,582
-No!

187
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,448
Whatever will we do, darling?

188
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:56,982
-I didn't think
that they'd break

189
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:59,082
from just a little
bit of training.

190
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:01,115
-I'm sorry.

191
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,415
-This is problematic.

192
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:07,315
Can the match be won with
those injuries, everyone?

193
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:08,382
-Absolutely not.

194
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,282
-Uh-huh.

195
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,182
-What?

196
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,948
But what about the match?

197
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:12,782
-Mizuho?

198
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:14,048
-Huh?

199
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:16,215
-Doesn't it make sense if
we just forfeit the match?

200
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:17,515
-No way!

201
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:20,582
The student body president
doesn't alter her schedule!

202
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:22,415
I always win my matches.

203
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:23,548
Get it?

204
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:26,082
Besides, we requested
the match, so we'll

205
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:27,282
look stupid if we forfeit.

206
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:29,848
We have to do it.

207
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:32,182
-But didn't you request the
match in the first place

208
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:33,582
in order to get revenge on them?

209
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,415
Not for the honor of the school?

210
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:36,215
-Huh?

211
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:36,715
-Dah!

212
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:37,282
Fine!

213
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:38,015
I'll be quiet.

214
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:40,348
-So you agree, darling?

215
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:42,048
-It's important, is it?

216
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,882
Then you've just gotta win.

217
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:48,515
Well, in that case,
my friends and I

218
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:50,448
can enter the kendo match.

219
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:52,482
-Your friends?

220
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:54,948
-I've go some friends who
are pretty skilled when

221
00:09:54,982 --> 00:09:57,348
it comes to fighting.

222
00:09:57,382 --> 00:09:58,815
-My darling!

223
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,882
You're so wonderful!

224
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:03,248
I knew I could count
on you, my darling!

225
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:05,215
[squealing]

226
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:07,582
-Ikkaku, isn't it
true that you really

227
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,382
wanted to enter
from the very start?

228
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:11,282
-Did you say something?

229
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:12,248
-Who, me?

230
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:14,015
No, I didn't say anything!

231
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,382
-All right.

232
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,548
I'm going to ask Yumichika
and the others for some help.

233
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:21,148
So, who's going to
participate in the match?

234
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:23,382
Do any of you have
the guts to do it?

235
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,548
-I-- um--

236
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:27,048
-Hm?

237
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:32,082
-I will enter, if I may.

238
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:35,415
No, I am entering.

239
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:38,048
-Now you're talkin'.

240
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:41,348
We just need three more.

241
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:41,848
-That's it?

242
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:42,582
Two?

243
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:43,548
Just two friends?

244
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:45,048
We're short three people.

245
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:47,848
We need three people
still, you got that?

246
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:48,882
1, 2, 3!

247
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,982
-Shut up!

248
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:53,748
Anyway, I'm going to
ask them for their help.

249
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,115
-Hm.

250
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:56,115
-Yeah?

251
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:58,748
And what exactly
would we be doing?

252
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:00,815
-I have an idea of
what it is he wants.

253
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:01,615
-Good.

254
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:03,115
That makes explaining easy.

255
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:05,615
-I want you to participate
in the match that we--

256
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:06,448
-No.

257
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:08,515
-Come on!

258
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,848
-There's absolutely
no way I would do it.

259
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:11,448
-That's right.

260
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:12,715
There's no way.

261
00:11:12,748 --> 00:11:13,948
-But I'm begging you.

262
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:16,415
This match is really important.

263
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:18,515
-It's a shame that I
can't help you out.

264
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:21,515
-I guess we're the only ones
you can even ask for help.

265
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,948
-So participate, then, will ya?

266
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:26,415
-No. 'Cause the
protective gear smells.

267
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:28,282
-It what?

268
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:30,148
-The protective gear smells!

269
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,048
-Well, that sucks.

270
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:45,715
-We've just got to keep trying.

271
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:46,482
-Yeah.

272
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:48,215
The match is on tomorrow.

273
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:49,915
-We've got to make
some powerful friends

274
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:51,982
by then, who really like us.

275
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:53,348
-I blew it.

276
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:56,148
It never would've happened if
I had only run away faster.

277
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,682
-Now, if I had to
do it, you'd have

278
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:00,348
seen me run faster than
a speeding cheetah.

279
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,148
-Idiot!

280
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:03,382
What the hell's the point?

281
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:05,448
You never run away.

282
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:08,182
You make yourself stronger!

283
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:09,782
And you!

284
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:11,748
Stop your whimpering!

285
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,382
See where your bruises are?

286
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:15,848
Go ahead and take a
good look at them.

287
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:19,282
Those are the bruises of
someone that runs away.

288
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:21,915
Bruises don't affect men.

289
00:12:21,948 --> 00:12:24,882
They ignore their injuries when
they confront things head on.

290
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,682
Don't worry at all about
the unfilled spots.

291
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:37,482
-You mean you're going to make
the new friends right now?

292
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:43,982
-Back off.

293
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:02,572
-I wonder if we're going to have
enough participating members?

294
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:09,806
-So, give me one good reason
why I should participate.

295
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,606
IKKAKU: Sorry,
Captain Hitsugaya.

296
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,372
Please accept this.

297
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:16,372
-Don't try to bribe
me with sweets.

298
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:19,406
-So, you say that,
but you're already

299
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:20,639
wearing the protective gear.

300
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,372
-That's because
you made a big fuss

301
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:28,339
and told me to put it on
without any explanations.

302
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:30,372
-I'm very sorry, Captain.

303
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:32,139
But this is a
token of my regret.

304
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:36,372
-You bastard.

305
00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:38,272
-I'm glad my younger
brother in grade school

306
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:41,039
had protective gear
that fits you perfectly.

307
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:42,472
-A grade schooler?

308
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:49,706
Madarame.

309
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:50,972
You're going to pay.

310
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:54,172
-I want to win this match,
and I want to win it bad.

311
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:56,572
-I warned you that
it was a bad idea

312
00:13:56,606 --> 00:13:59,239
to get yourself involved
in the lives of humans.

313
00:13:59,272 --> 00:13:59,806
-Sorry.

314
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,872
You're right.

315
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,606
-Yeah, you should be sorry.

316
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,239
We're busy here with
training, and it's

317
00:14:04,272 --> 00:14:05,806
a real inconvenience for us.

318
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,039
-Inconvenience?

319
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,472
Then tell me why you're here.

320
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:10,739
-Well, uh--
actually, Kisuke kept

321
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,172
pestering us to come today.

322
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,806
-Ah, Renji.

323
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,006
And Chad.

324
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,339
We're going to wrap up all
the training for today,

325
00:14:24,372 --> 00:14:26,072
and I want you to go
over to the school.

326
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:26,572
-Hm?

327
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:27,072
-Huh?

328
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:28,339
-Yes.

329
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:31,572
Something troublesome's arisen,
and you must offer help.

330
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:33,339
You'll find that
all the other Soul

331
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,772
Reapers will be there as well.

332
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:35,472
-Why?

333
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:36,939
Did a Hollow appear?

334
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:40,372
-You'll know when you get there.

335
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:42,572
-And then what do
I find, but this?

336
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:44,872
-It's a shame I'm
taking your time up.

337
00:14:44,906 --> 00:14:47,306
-Did you give Kisuke a box of
sweets just so he'd do this?

338
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,972
You should be ashamed.

339
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:52,706
-Bribes are always necessary
in this type of situation.

340
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:55,139
So, anyway, where did Chad go?

341
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:57,539
-I'm afraid that
he won't be here.

342
00:14:57,572 --> 00:15:00,406
His policy is never to
accept a bribe, because--

343
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:01,506
-What was that?

344
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,772
Those sweets cost
me an arm and a leg!

345
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:05,539
-And I don't care what you paid!

346
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:11,039
-Guys we're still
a member short.

347
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:14,372
It's almost time for the match.

348
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:15,639
-Please help us out!

349
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:17,039
I beg you!

350
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:18,906
-I won't do it.

351
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:22,306
I don't want my
hair to be smelly.

352
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,972
-All right, fine.

353
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,306
We can manage.

354
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:26,139
[yelp]

355
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:29,006
-But someone has to volunteer.

356
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,539
You will!

357
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:30,706
-No!

358
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:33,539
I've never even held
a bamboo sword before!

359
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:34,472
-It's simple.

360
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:36,706
All you have to do is run away.

361
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:37,772
Really simple.

362
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:40,339
Only three of the five
of us need to win.

363
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,106
[whimper]

364
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:44,606
-His style can't be matched.

365
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,439
ANNOUNCER: The match between
Karakura High School and Kotei

366
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:51,972
Academy well now begin.

367
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:55,139
Because we are having
a friendly match today,

368
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:58,672
the person who gets the first
point will win the round.

369
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:02,872
-I'm second to last?

370
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:04,406
-Don't worry about it.

371
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:06,639
I'll win even if
you're defeated.

372
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:10,006
Your match doesn't make
any difference to me.

373
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:13,106
However, winning is crucial.

374
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:13,606
-Ah--

375
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:17,706
-Begin!

376
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:32,506
-Huah!

377
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:39,406
-Yay!

378
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:40,906
-Yeah! 'Atta way, little guy!

379
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:43,239
-Nice one.

380
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:45,539
-And you kept saying
that you didn't want to.

381
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,039
-Just shut your mouth.

382
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,872
-Second round
participants, ready!

383
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:50,372
-Ready.

384
00:16:53,272 --> 00:16:55,139
-Begin!

385
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:56,106
-Hmph.

386
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:57,739
I can run away really fast.

387
00:16:57,772 --> 00:16:58,606
Watch!

388
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,139
Ha ha!

389
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:00,072
Just look!

390
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:00,972
Catch me if you can!

391
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:01,806
-How pathetic.

392
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,039
-Check out my fancy footwork.

393
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:04,506
-What are you, a crab?

394
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:05,639
-Ha!

395
00:17:05,672 --> 00:17:08,072
-What in the world is
my stupid brother doing?

396
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:09,939
-Start fighting!

397
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:10,972
-No way!

398
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:12,539
If I start fighting,
I might get hurt!

399
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:13,472
Huh?

400
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:14,406
Ah!

401
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:14,906
-Hit.

402
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,472
-A Hollow.

403
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:23,339
-ANNOUNCER: Begin.

404
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:23,839
-Yah!

405
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,239
-Ikkaku, don't be late.

406
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:35,406
-I'm going to have to
leave for a moment.

407
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:36,806
-Huh?

408
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,206
-We will win.

409
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:42,272
You see, my opponent will be
defeated, so we can't lose.

410
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:45,372
You're the one who
wants it most, so fight,

411
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:47,606
and become a real man.

412
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:48,106
-Ah?

413
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:48,972
Huh?

414
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:50,439
What?

415
00:17:50,472 --> 00:17:51,706
Transforming?

416
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,572
I wonder where he went?

417
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,872
Huh?

418
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,606
-I'm scared.

419
00:17:57,639 --> 00:17:59,306
-I'm going to lay here
on the ground 'til

420
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:00,906
my master gets back.

421
00:18:00,939 --> 00:18:01,772
"Nyar."

422
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:02,872
-Huh?

423
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:05,772
-If you even look at me,
then be prepared to die.

424
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:07,272
-I'm not gonna leave.

425
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:08,539
I'll just stay put.

426
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:11,406
-There's so many men here.

427
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:13,272
-Have their personalities
all been altered?

428
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:15,639
ANNOUNCER: Round four
participants, come forward!

429
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:16,139
-Yes.

430
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:22,372
[laughing]

431
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:26,939
-(THINKING) Indeed, even if I
lose, Ikkaku will avenge us.

432
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,772
But, I have to try.

433
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:30,272
-Begin.

434
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:38,572
-Zabimaru!

435
00:18:38,606 --> 00:18:41,506
Grow, Haineko!

436
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:43,472
-Extend, Hozukimaru!

437
00:18:57,706 --> 00:19:00,872
Even though Aizen is using the
hogyoku to create a rankai,

438
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,839
small fries are all that
have been appearing.

439
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:05,972
I've got to get back there.

440
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:06,472
Fast!

441
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:10,906
-Run away!

442
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:12,872
Run away!

443
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:17,272
Wait for just the right
moment, then lose him, Shinji!

444
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:18,872
-Don't be stupid!

445
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:21,972
Koji's going to get
some divine retribution!

446
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:24,472
KEIGO: But even if he
loses, Ikkaku will win!

447
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:25,739
MIZUHO: Shut up!

448
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:26,939
-I can't go that.

449
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:29,439
There'd be no point
to this unless I win.

450
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:34,739
-Shinji, try to be more careful.

451
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:35,906
-Don't push it so hard.

452
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:36,972
-(THINKING) Upperclassmen?

453
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,439
I'm going to do is.

454
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:46,672
I'm going to beat this
guy and become a real man.

455
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:48,739
-You really are annoying.

456
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,039
-You wait for me, Shinji.

457
00:19:51,072 --> 00:19:53,739
Don't you dare lose
before I get there.

458
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:55,106
-If they'd been
a little quicker,

459
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:56,506
they could've gotten away.

460
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,306
But now your teammates will be
shamed, as well as embarrassed.

461
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:02,172
That's all it took to do you in.

462
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:04,906
I guess there was no
need to ambush you.

463
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:07,239
-Damn!

464
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,439
This is for Karakura!

465
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:15,239
-Shinji!

466
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:16,239
[grunting]

467
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:23,639
[cheers]

468
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:24,139
-All right!

469
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:24,639
We won!

470
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:26,006
We won!

471
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,339
-We did?

472
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:30,439
ANNOUNCER: The match between
Karakura High School and Kotei

473
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:35,506
Academy, Karakura High
School wins 3 to 1.

474
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:36,472
-Hold on!

475
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:37,472
Hey, ref.

476
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:39,139
What happened to my turn?

477
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:40,106
-Huh?

478
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,339
-Actually, Karakura
has already won.

479
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:44,072
-There's no need to fight.

480
00:20:44,106 --> 00:20:45,172
We already won.

481
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:46,672
We won all of it.

482
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:48,672
But I'll never
forget what you said.

483
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,539
It meant a lot to me.

484
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:53,039
Thank you for everything
you taught us, Ikkaku.

485
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:53,806
-Yeah.

486
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,772
It's my pleasure.

487
00:20:55,806 --> 00:20:56,706
-Hey!

488
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:58,539
I want an opportunity
for a match.

489
00:20:58,572 --> 00:21:01,606
-Karakura High School
won the match 3 to 1,

490
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:03,072
so you don't have a turn.

491
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:05,406
-What?

492
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:07,339
Bring your captain to me!

493
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:08,506
I want him dead!

494
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:09,639
-There he is!

495
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:12,339
This man is Igarashi,
and he's their captain!

496
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,539
-Ah-- sis?

00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,872
-He's a bad man, and he
dumped me a long time ago!

-What?

501
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:21,672
Hey, so your method
of getting revenge

502
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:24,006
was using us to get even
with your old boyfriend?

503
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,506
Ikkaku!

504

Just what the hell
do you think you're

507
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,906
doing to our captain's toupe?

508
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:34,872
-Come on.

509
00:21:34,906 --> 00:21:36,806
I'll scalp every
one of your wienies.

Yes, darling!

Because of the unruly actions
of Karakura High School captain,

00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:52,339
this match is--

ANNOUNCER: Stupid!

520
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,972
Get out!

521
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:57,139
-Their captain's defeated!

522
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:00,939
-Darling!

523
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:02,039
You're amazing!

524
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,772
You really were the
man I thought you were.

very much alike.

531
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:52,861
Are you sibl

532
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:55,227

that alike at all.

harmony with each other.
