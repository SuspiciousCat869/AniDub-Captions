-Hey Karin, wait for me!

4
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:52,147
There have been so many
incidents like this lately.

5
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:56,981
So many UFO sightings and all
of those poltergeist weirdos.

6
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:59,414
-I think this is
probably because of them.

7
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:01,381
-What, do you see something?

8
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:04,081
-Yeah, and it's better
you can't see them.

KARIN (OFFSCREEN): Huh?

12
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:08,947
What was that?

13
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:11,381
It's-- [screaming] a cat?

14
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:13,847
Great, now it looks like that
other thing is heading right

15
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:14,347
for us.

16
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:15,747
Damn!

17
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:20,581
If those things came to fight,
let's get this party started!

18
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:22,514
I guess that should teach 'em.

-Ah!

20
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:24,681
That was sure scary.

[gasp] Karin, look!

22
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,847
What a cute little kitty.

23
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,381
It kind of reminds
me of our brother.

KARIN (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, yeah it's him.

25
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:35,647
Um, do you think there's
something wrong with this cat?

26
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:39,681
-Uh, well I-- I had this
really strange feeling like I'd

27
00:02:39,714 --> 00:02:41,014
seen him somewhere before.

28
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,914
Hm, but now that
you mention it, it

29
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:47,247
does seem like there's something
wrong with this little kitty,

30
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:48,681

[cat meows] Oh really
now, is that so?

35
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:55,947
-Uh, what'd it say?

36
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:57,681
-He said that he's hungry.

37
00:02:57,714 --> 00:02:58,447
-Are you serious?

38
00:02:58,481 --> 00:02:59,481
-Yep.

-OK, but uh-- do you
at least remember

41
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:06,181
where you saw this cat before?

42
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:07,314
-Hm, no I don't.

guess we can do that.

-Ugh, man what a waste.

48
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,381
It's useless cleaning
up around here.

49
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:23,847
I mean, it's not
like anyone's ever

50
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:26,147
going to be coming to a
store like this anyway.

-That's not true.

52
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:28,781
Why would you say that?

53
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:32,214
-OK, then tell me how many
customers we've had this month.

-Well, uh--

there've been a lot more

Aha!

-Lately I don't think I'm
getting enough exercise.

64
00:03:57,781 --> 00:04:00,447
I have a feeling that I've
put on a little weight.

65
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:01,847
-Well, I've got
something for you

66
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:03,214
that should take care of that.

67
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:06,281
It's a foolproof weight loss
remedy-- Ginkgo Below the Belt.

68
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,781
I got it on the Grasshopper
shopping channel and it works.

don't get me wrong.

But it's just that I've
never really believed

73
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:15,781
in a quick fix that
comes out of a bottle.

74

-Well boss, I'm here to
tell you I'm living proof.

75
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:20,181
I tried it myself and the
results were truly amazing!

Sounds like
something's growling.

-Uh, Gita.

Now's the time for us to act.

It's up to us to get
rid of the Hollows

you're saying!

I think there might

87
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,947
be something wrong with

Why is that?

00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:48,847
-Uh, well it's just a hunch.

with you, is there Cammy?

-What do you mean, Cammy?

-It's his name.

96
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:56,414
It's short for camel.

97
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,981
Because he's the same color
as my camel-colored underwear.

I am so sorry.

startled you, huh?

-Of course, these
beautiful ladies

must be related to my

-Are you serious?

125
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,747
Do you mean to tell
me my brother's

That's so cool!

Can you believe it?

00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:57,147
Ichigo's your number
one pupil, wow!

132
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:59,447
-And since I had a rare day
off, I came here in cognito

uh, have you two seen him?

-In cognito?

135
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:07,347
Looks to me like you're
doing a bang up job of that.

136
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:09,747
-Actually our brother
isn't home right now.

-Oh my goodness!

138
00:06:12,181 --> 00:06:13,381
-Guess you're done here.

139
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,481
So why don't you go on home?
[howling overhead] Wait,

Oh, you bad spirits.

Karin, what do you
think those things were?

146
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,781
-Uh, you mean you can
actually see those things?

147
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:31,781
-Uh I guess I can.

148
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:32,881
-Now I get it.

149
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:34,681
It looks like you're
able to see them too.

Ah!

Hey, listen-- don't
underestimate the enemy!

00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,414
-Uh, I'm fine, I guess.

167
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:12,181
[crowd chattering]

168
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:14,014
-Huh?

169
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:15,014
-Hey, Yuzu, Karin!

170
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:17,147
I don't believe
it you lucky dogs!

171
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,181
Don Kanonji saved you!

172
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:19,947
I'm so jealous!

173
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:20,847
-Mission complete!

174
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:24,081
Wa ha ha ha ha!

175
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:26,347
-Hey Don Kanonji, why
not join us for some tea!

176
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:27,047
-Come on!

177
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,314
You two come with me!

178
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,614
-It's a pretty good tea,
even if I-- huh, you're gone?

179
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:35,114
Well then I guess I'll
just see you at home!

180
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:36,547
[gasping for breath]

181
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,014
-Pardon me for asking,
but who are you anyway?

182
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:42,481
-I'm Ginta, the one who'll be
batting cleanup in the majors

183
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:43,114
someday.

184
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:44,981
-And I'm Ururu.

185
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:47,014
-I'm Yuzu Kurosaki.

186
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:48,414
-Kurosaki?

187
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,714
Then I'm sure you
must know carrot top.

188
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:51,881
-Hm?

189
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:53,714
-You mean you know our brother?

190
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:56,847
-Sort of.

191
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:57,914
See that cat?

192
00:07:57,947 --> 00:07:59,814
-Seems a number of
Hollows are popping up

193
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,814
lured here by its
spiritual power.

194
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:03,681
-Huh, Hollows?

195
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:04,881
That's what you call them?

196
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:06,281
-That's right.

197
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:08,581
And it'd be best for everyone if
we just let that cat's spirit--

198
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:11,014
uh, pass on peacefully.

199
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,547
-Wait, what are
you talking about?

200
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:13,914
Cammy isn't a ghost.

201
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:14,747
-Huh?

202
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:16,347
You got it all wrong.

203
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:18,147
That cat is a spirit!

204
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,047
-Is not!

205
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,881
How dare you say such things!

206
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:22,014
-But it's true!

207
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:24,581
Believe me, that mangy
old cat's already dead!

208
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:26,081
-No way this cat is dead!

209
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:27,647
Why are you being so mean?

210
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:28,214
[crying]

211
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:29,447
-Jeez, come on!

212
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:31,681
You're both carrot top's
sister's and you can't even

213
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:32,781
figure out what's going on?

214
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:35,547
-Wonderful and totally great!

215
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,781
[laughing] I've got to be the
luckiest man in the world.

216
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:41,181
Imagine kinds with such talent
gathered here before me.

217
00:08:41,214 --> 00:08:42,847
Though your skills
are weaker than mine.

218
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:43,981
You know what's next?

219
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:46,881
You are all going
to be my pupils!

220
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:48,414
-Not interested!

221
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:50,381
-Yeah, [coughing] Let
me tell you something.

222
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:53,214
I'm starting to really
like you boys and girls.

223
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,681
I have been looking for
sharp kids with young power

224
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:57,647
just like all of you.

225
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,014
So come on kids, let's go!

226
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:00,114
What are you waiting for?

227
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:01,514
Hey kids, chop chop!

228
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:02,281
Come on the spirit
hunter says let's go!

229
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:03,147
-Listen to me mister.

230
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,114
You want another one?

231
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,147
-Such a pity.

232
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:08,347
There is power
hidden within you.

233
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,281
I do know that much.

234
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:11,714
But I'll do it.

235
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:14,481
So much power, so little time.

236
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:15,781
Yes, all right.

237
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:18,081
The first thing I need to
do if I'm going to help you

238
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:20,214
is to take a good
look at your powers.

239
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:22,014
-I don't understand
what this is all about,

240
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:23,414
but I guess this
is my one chance

241
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:25,214
to explore my true power.

242
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,781
-Just in case you
couldn't tell, I

243
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:28,914
haven't had the chance
to get serious either.

244
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:30,181
-I've never seen such
energetic children!

245
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:30,981
-I'm taller than you!

246
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:31,781
-Yeah, I got news for you!

247
00:09:31,814 --> 00:09:32,947
-Come on, follow me!

248
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:34,547
-Height's got nothing
to do with it!

249
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:35,547
-Come on kids!

250
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:36,214
KARIN (OFFSCREEN):
Of course it does!

251
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:37,014
-It's in your hands.

252
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:37,947
JINTA (OFFSCREEN): Does not!

253
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:38,581
Hey don't stand
up in front of me.

254
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:39,781
-Do you know what?

255
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:42,614
Without protection that
cat'll be attacked again.

256
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:44,281
-Do you think so?

257
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:47,247
Before we had Don Kanonji
to make sure we were safe.

258
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,447
What do we do now?

259
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,614
-I could ask my boss
if he would help.

260
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:52,214
-Ah.

261
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:53,947
YUZU (OFFSCREEN): Out to lunch?

262
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:55,047
-Sorry about that.

263
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:55,881
-Oh, it's all right.

264
00:09:55,914 --> 00:09:57,547
Don't worry.

265
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:58,981
-What do you want to do?

266
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:01,281
-Well if you think this man
Kisuke can do something,

267
00:10:01,314 --> 00:10:03,347
then I guess I'll wait
till he comes back.

268
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:05,647
There's really nothing
else we can do.

269
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:07,047
-Mm hm.

270
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,481
[cat meows]

271
00:10:08,514 --> 00:10:10,447
-Thank you, Ururu.

272
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:13,447
-Hm?

273
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:14,947
[gasp] Hollows!

274
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,947
They've come here now.

275
00:10:18,981 --> 00:10:20,447
Hurry, inside!

276
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,447
[howling]

277
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:24,447
-Go out the back door!

278
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:27,414
-Ururu!

279
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:29,414
[cat meows]
Everything's all right.

280
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:30,181
Don't worry.

281
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:30,847
I'll protect you.

282
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,181
-Damnit!

283
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:41,481
How long is he going to
keep us waiting like this?

284
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,714
DON KANONJI (OFFSCREEN):
Sorry to keep you waiting.

285
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:46,514
Boys and girls!

286
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:52,181
[coughing] The century's
premiere spiritualist,

287
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:54,414
Don Kanonji, at your service!

288
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,247
-You wanted to
see my true power?

289
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,547
Then ready or not, here I go!

290
00:10:58,581 --> 00:10:59,447
-I'm coming too!

291
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:01,381
-Hold your horses!

292
00:11:01,414 --> 00:11:03,681
[yelling] Now just
wait a minute, kids.

293
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:06,181
You don't think that
I'm the enemy, do you?

294
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:07,114
-Huh?

295
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:08,414
-Come on now kids,
think about it.

296
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:11,081
What's the point in heroes
trying to fight each other?

297
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:11,881
-Well.

298
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:12,947
-There is none.

299
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:14,947
But seriously, I've
been kicking around

300
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:17,214
the idea of creating
a special team of kids

301
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:20,047
just like you-- kind-hearted,
self-sacrificing kids

302
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:22,181
with their own special
powers who share my vision

303
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,847
and want to join me in keeping
the peace in this town!

304
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:26,181
-Huh?

305
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:28,781
-And this team would be called
the Karakura Superheroes!

306
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,181
You know the entertainment
world is youth-oriented.

307
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:33,781
Everyone's looking for any grade
schooler with special talents

308
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:35,181
to become the next big thing.

309
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:37,781
Well if you ask me, you
two have the potential

310
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:39,047
to shoot right to the top.

311
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:39,947
Well how about it?

312
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:40,881
Will you form a unit--

313
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:42,081
-(IN HEAD) So long winded.

314
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:43,714
-(IN HEAD) This is stupid.

315
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:45,981
-And I'm happy to inform
you that since both of you

316
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:48,681
are the first two Karakura
Superheroes I've recruited,

317
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:49,347
guess what!

318
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:50,247
It's your lucky day!

319
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:51,647
The red position is still open!

320
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:52,881
-Uh, red?

321
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:53,847
-It's the lead.

322
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,081
Oh and did I mention
that I intend

323
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,847
to turn this little
project into a segment

324
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:59,081
on my top-rated
Spirit Hunter TV show?

325
00:11:59,114 --> 00:11:59,814
-Television!

326
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:01,014
-I'm in!

327
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:03,014
-Well, then I guess I'll
have no choice, since it's

328
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,581
an opportunity to keep the
peace in Karakura town.

329
00:12:05,614 --> 00:12:06,847
-OK!

330
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:10,214
Your enthusiasm has gotten
you a place on the squad!

331
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:13,414
-Great since no one
objects, I'll be red, OK?

332
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:14,247
-Hey!

333
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:15,314
You can't just decide like that!

334
00:12:15,347 --> 00:12:15,881
I'm red!

335
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:16,347
You got that?

336
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:17,214
Me, red!

337
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:17,881
Red, me!

338
00:12:17,914 --> 00:12:19,014
-Shut your pie hole.

339
00:12:19,047 --> 00:12:20,681
Come on, you know
better than that.

340
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:21,814
No girl can be red.

341
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:22,581
-What?

342
00:12:22,614 --> 00:12:23,947
Are you looking for a fight?

343
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:25,981
-Oh man, what a
pain in the butt.

344
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:27,247
-Ugh!

345
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,647
There is absolutely no way
I'm going to let you be red!

346
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:31,047
-That's it.

347
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:32,381
Get ready for our first job.

348
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:34,281
She's in terrible danger.

349
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,381
Bad spirits are
after your sister.

350
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:38,614
-I can't understand a
single word he's saying.

Huh?

00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:33,780

Huh?

367
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,680
-Sorry to have kept you waiting
little girl but there's no need

368
00:13:46,713 --> 00:13:49,180
to worry anymore
because we're here!

369
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:52,847
-Karakura Red-- Karin Kurosaki!

370
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,613
-And the real Karakura
Red-- Jinta Hanakari!

371
00:13:57,647 --> 00:13:59,980
-Hey, just one minute
there jerk face.

372
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,280
What do you think you're doing?

373
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:02,047
Didn't you hear me?

374
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,780
I'm red, got it?

375
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:03,780
-Would you shut up?

376
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:04,780
It's already decided!

377
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:05,580
I'm red!

378
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:07,280
-No way I'm definitely red!

379
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,313
Red is me!

380
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,613
-Look, this is what
we're going to do.

381
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,780
We'll decide who will be red
based on your performance

382
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,080
today, OK?

383
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:13,580
-Huh?

384
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:14,347
-Yeah!

385
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,480
-I'll show you who's red!

386
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:16,480
-Don Kanonji!

387
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:17,980
And Karin, too!

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,813
-Secret attack!

390
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,480
Super spirit javelin!

391
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:27,513
With this device you can
reach any bad spirit.

392
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:28,947
With detachable
saw and solid grip,

393
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,513
even high branches are a breeze.

394
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:33,713
These extendable pruning sheers
are so easy to manouv-- oh!

395
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,147
How dare you!

396
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,880
Come back and fight
me you coward!

397
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,247
-You're too slow!

398
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,180
Beat it!

399
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,113
Go on, scram!

400
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:40,947
-Oh yeah, come on!

401
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,480
You show 'em, sister!

402
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:45,613
I shall entreat the super
spirit of the javelin to you!

403
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:46,247
[laughing]

404
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,980
-The lead is mine!

405
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:52,813
-And now batting cleanup,
number 55, Jinta Hanakari!

406
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:53,647
-Aha!

407
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,013
Excellent swing!

408
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:57,380
Who could ever forget
an effort like that?

409
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:58,780
You're the super star of suave!

410
00:14:58,813 --> 00:14:59,747
-That's right!

411
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,713
It's only natural
because I'm red!

412
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:02,713
-Karin!

413
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:04,680
-Hey Yuzu, get away!

414
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:06,113
-OK.

415
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:06,613
-Oh?

416
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:07,247
Huh?

417
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,080
-Hey wait hold it!

418
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:11,013
I'm right behind you Yuzu!

419
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:11,513
-Huh?

420
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:12,513
-Stay down!

421
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,847
-Ururu?

422
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,413
-Huh?

423
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:20,313
What is this?

424
00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:22,313
Another one of the
new generation?

425
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:23,347
Wonderful!

426
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,480
There are so many
red candidates here!

427
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:28,247
-Aw, Ururu, showing up
out of the blue like that.

428
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,480
Well listen, you're not
taking the red title from me!

429
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:34,013
-How many times do I have
to tell you, you're not red!

430
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:36,580
-OK, rule number
one-- only the recruit

431
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:38,047
who gives a number
one performance

432
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,380
deserves the title of red!

433
00:15:40,413 --> 00:15:42,280
-I am not going to lose!

434
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:42,847
-Oh yeah?

435
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,180

The Karakura superheroes

fight too, Don Kanonji?

00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,480
-Hey kids!

442
00:15:56,513 --> 00:15:58,813
That kind of fighting won't
earn you the title of red!

So, do you see the power of red?

-Yeah!

let's go over our strategy.

[roar]

498
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:21,980
-The Karakura
Superheroes prevail!

499
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:23,347
And our mission
was accomplished!

500
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,347
Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

501
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,480
KARIN (OFFSCREEN): Did
that thing really work?

502
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:30,380
DON KANONJI (OFFSCREEN):
Why of course it did!

503
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:32,613
It delivered the final blow!

504
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:34,980
JINTA (OFFSCREEN): No way.

505
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,313
YUZU (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, I remember now.

506
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:39,480
I did meet Cammy before.

507
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:40,180
It was raining.

508
00:18:40,213 --> 00:18:41,647

-Oh, here, here you go.

512
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,713
See you later.

513
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,847
Oh.

517
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,613
YUZU (OFFSCREEN):
If I hadn't come by,

518
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,013
then Cammy wouldn't
have had to die.

519
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:15,813
I thought maybe you'd
hold a grudge against me.

520
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:16,313
But--

521
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:22,180
[cat meows]

522
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:24,413
-Cammy.

-Karin!

526
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,380
-Thank goodness!

527
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:33,113
-Huh?

528
00:19:33,147 --> 00:19:34,713
What happened?

529
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:37,213
-You see, the legendary
Karakura sonic lion,

530
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:39,580
which was properly summoned
through our extreme power

531
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:43,680
of justice, was responsible
for saving your life.

532
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:45,013
-He's right!

533
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:48,180
Together we all summoned this
absolutely amazing thing!

534
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:49,947
-Hey, I don't see him anywhere.

535
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,780
Where'd he go.

536
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:51,313
KARIN (OFFSCREEN): That's right.

537
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:52,147
[cat meows]

538
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,447
KARIN (OFFSCREEN): He's gone.

539
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,947
JINTA (OFFSCREEN): Too bad,
you should have seen him.

540
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,347
[laughing]

541
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,647
-Secret?

542
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,047
[cat meows]

543
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,480
-All right then.

544
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:03,847
I guess that it can
be our little secret.

545
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:07,213
-What!

546
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,580
-What's happening?

547
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:12,480
[gasps]

548
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,913
-It's for the best.

549
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,047
I'm glad though.

550
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,180
I think that it was
able to pass on.

551
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:20,947
-Um, so then does that mean that
the cat was really a spirit?

552
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,280
-If that's what happened
then it was probably

553
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:26,213
able to come to terms with
whatever regrets it had.

554

[crying]

555

[crying]

557
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,347
-I wasn't able to do
anything for Cammy.

558
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,313
Nothing!

559
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:36,713
I couldn't do
anything for Cammy!

560

his way of saying thanks to you

562
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:45,080
just now.

563
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:45,880
-Is that true?

564
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,047
-Of course it is!

565
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,347
A man senses these things, OK?

566
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,813
-I hope it's true!

567
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:52,313
I hope it's true!

00:20:56,847 --> 00:20:59,280
-There, there.

00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:01,613
-(IN HEAD) Cammy, thank you.

-I said I'm red!

00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:19,321
Do you hear me?

00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:20,288
-Shut up already!

00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,288
I'm red!

578
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,888
-Well you're not fit to be red!

579
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:24,221
-You're more like yellow!

580
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:26,821
-And Karakura gold, the leader
producer of the Karakura

-What do you mean,
Karakura gold?

585
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:35,454
That's a bunch crap!

-Tune in every one!

587
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:38,588
It's time you put
aside your differences

588
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:40,388
and follow your leader producer!

Not!

What about everyone's idol, Kon?

595
00:22:56,685 --> 00:22:57,685
What happened to him?

596
00:22:57,718 --> 00:22:58,752
Who's responsible?

00:22:58,785 --> 00:23:00,218
-No one cares about
your existence.
