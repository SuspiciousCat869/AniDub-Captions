NARRATOR: During the
battle in Hueco Mundo,

3
00:01:51,688 --> 00:01:54,288
Ichigo and Orihime learned
of Nell's true identity

4
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,388
as Nelliel Tu Odelschwanck,
a former Espada.

5
00:01:57,422 --> 00:02:00,388
Nelliel regained her powers
and released her Zanpakuto,

6
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:02,055
transforming into her
Resurreccion form,

7
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:05,955
she overwhelmed Nnoitra,
the Espada who despises her.

8
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:07,722
-Lanzador Verde.

9
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:19,788
-[scream]

10
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:20,788
-Relax.

11
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,255
I don't intend to kill you.

12
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:30,922
-Huh?

13
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,222
What?

14
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,822
Why is Nell small again?

15
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:46,622
-[laughing]

16
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:48,488
You're right, Nelliel!

17
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:49,255
It is over!

18
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:51,588
-[scream]

19
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:52,722
-Leave her alone!

20
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:57,655
-It's over for all of you.

21
00:02:57,688 --> 00:03:01,555
At this point, you can't win.

22
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:02,955
Tesla, he's all yours.

23
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:03,888
Go for it.

24
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:06,055
He's got nothing
left to fight with.

25
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:09,988
Do what you want with him.

26
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:14,888
-[screaming]

27
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:17,355
-[whimpering] Ichigo!

28
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:28,522
-[gasp]

29
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,155
-What's going on here?

30
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:42,322
You're in a real fix,
aren't you, Ichigo?

31
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:49,522
-Kenpachi!

32
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:50,755
-[laughing]

33
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:57,155
-Are you really Kenpachi?

34
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:57,955
-Huh?

35
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,788
You better hope that I am.

36
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:04,322
Have they knocked you around so
much that your brain is gone?

37
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:07,922
-And just who might you be?

38
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,788
I see you don't
intend to answer.

39
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:20,788
Very well then!

40
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:23,488
I'll kill you!

41
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:24,822
-Don't charge, you idiot!

42
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:28,255
Get back, Tesla!

43
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:28,922
-Master Nnoitra.

44
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:46,422
-So, you next?

45
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:53,288
Come on, you're next, right?

46
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:57,788
-Kenpachi, I don't get it.

47
00:04:57,822 --> 00:04:58,888
Why are you here?

48
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:00,222
Am I wrong?

49
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:02,388
I thought the Soul Society
had pulled out of this fight.

50
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:05,655
-Ichigo!

51
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:09,555
-Time to move.

52
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:10,988
Stand aside.

53
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:13,788
-[coughing]

54
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:15,755
-You jerk!

55
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:17,022
-I see.

56
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,655
You feeling better?

57
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:20,322
-I'm feeling like crap.

58
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:22,622
You kicked me in the
gut all you've got!

59
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,088
How'd you get here?

60
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:27,255
What's the story?

61
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:28,055
-Kisuke Urahara.

62
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:34,655
Seems that a while ago, he
was given a bunch of orders

63
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:36,122
from the old man.

64
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:39,555
That was back when the
showdown was set for winter.

65
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:43,088
Kisuke was ordered to stabilize
this underground cavern called

66
00:05:43,122 --> 00:05:44,288
Garganta.

67
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:46,755
He was to make sure it
was safe so captain level

68
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:50,888
personnel could
pass to Hueco Mundo.

69
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:54,355
They expected it would take him
three months to finish the job,

70
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:57,922
but Kisuke claimed he'd be done
with it in one month's time.

71
00:05:57,955 --> 00:05:59,922
Before he could carry
out his assignment,

72
00:05:59,955 --> 00:06:04,355
your friend Orihime
got snatched away.

73
00:06:04,388 --> 00:06:05,688
-Yeah!

74
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:08,255
So Ken is here because that
cavern finally got fixed up.

75
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:09,322
Isn't that great?

76
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:11,555
-Yachiru, you just
keep your mouth shut.

77
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:16,855
-Hm?

78
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,255
Well now, who are you?

79
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:31,955
-Hm?

80
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:44,388
-Regrettably, it is no
longer possible for me

81
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:45,822
to tell you my name.

82
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:48,088
But I guess that's your fate.

83
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:50,688
Now pass on, Miss Soul Reaper.

84
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:06,188
-I swear, I already said that
I can more than handle this

85
00:07:06,222 --> 00:07:06,855
by myself.

86
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:15,888
No one hears or
believes what I say.

87
00:07:23,222 --> 00:07:25,188
-Exactly who are you?

88
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:26,188
Speak up.

89
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:32,622
-I am Retsu Unohana, Squad
Captain of the 13 Court Guard

90
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:33,688
Squads.

91
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:35,722
-And I am her lieutenant,
Isane Kotetsu.

92
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:43,022
-From your coat, I take
it that you are a captain.

93
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:48,388
I am Zommari Rureaux.

94
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:51,822
I am also known as
Espada Number Seven.

95
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,488
Now identify yourself, intruder.

96
00:07:54,522 --> 00:07:58,422
-[laughing] Who am I, you ask?

97
00:07:58,455 --> 00:08:03,188
Why, I don't see any point in
me answering such a question.

98
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:05,255
-What?

99
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:06,955
-I'll give you an answer.

100
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:11,188
All of our identities are one.

101
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:15,155
We are your enemies.

102
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:18,122
-I understand.

103
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:20,655
-I would strongly suggest
that you stand down.

104
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:22,988
We are here only to
heal everyone's wounds.

105
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:25,488
We have no intention
of fighting you.

106
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:28,255
We come here in peace,
but with a purpose.

107
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:30,155
As long as you do not
impede our efforts,

108
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:33,422
we have no intention of
interfering with you.

109
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:35,888
It is your decision.

110
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:40,255
-Arrancar, Arrancar, Arrancar.

111
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:43,088
[laughing] Espadas.

112
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,222
[laughing] How fantastic.

113
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:55,755
Hueco Mundo is a
treasure trove of riches.

114
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:58,988
-I have a question for you.

115
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:02,122
Were you the one who
fought this woman?

116
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,422
-No.

117
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,388
I did not fight her.

118
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:09,188
However, I was about to deliver
the blow that would finish her.

119
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,022
-Were you?

120
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,988
-[growling]

121
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:20,555
-So you finally the attacked.

122
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:32,655
Come on, then.

123
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:34,722
I've waited quite
a while for this.

124
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:35,855
-Stop it!

125
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:38,588
Kenpachi, you can't just
jump into this fight!

126
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:39,855
-Stay out of this!

127
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:41,422
You're all beat up.

128
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,155
-What was that?

129
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:43,955
I can still-- [groan]

130
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:47,155
-[laughing] No you don't, Ichi!

131
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:48,055
-Stop that!

132
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,455
Yachiru, don't!

133
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,455
You mustn't!

134
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:54,222
He's already taken
too many punches!

135
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:55,188
Oh, no!

136
00:09:55,222 --> 00:09:57,122
Now look what you've done!

137
00:09:57,155 --> 00:09:58,088
He's woozy.

138
00:09:58,122 --> 00:09:59,022
Breathe, Ichigo.

139
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:00,955
Don't pass out!

140
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:04,522
Seems like I saw this
just a little while ago.

141
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:07,455
-Ichi, you have to
stay out of this one.

142
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:08,522
Yep.

143
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:10,888
Because Kenny has
that look on his face.

144
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:19,188
Kenny, it's all good now!

145
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:21,022
-Yachiru, stay right there!

146
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,522
-Right!

147
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:25,288
-You're mocking me.

148
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:27,555
-Huh?

149
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:30,188
-I don't have time to play
around with you clowns!

150
00:10:35,422 --> 00:10:39,222
-Hey, is that the
best that you've got?

151
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:41,422
-There's a lot more
you haven't seen yet.

152
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:44,522
Tell me your name, Soul Reaper.

153
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:46,222
-Squad 11 Captain,
Kenpachi Zaraki.

154
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:52,422
-I am Espada Number
Five, Nnoitra Gilga!

155
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:54,222
[growl]

156
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,522
-It certainly appears that
a very sensible captain

157
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:01,822
stands before us.

158
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:03,155
I'm convinced of that.

159
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:10,888
Fall back.

160
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:12,022
-Wait!

161
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:15,555
-Isane, our task here
is not to spill blood,

162
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:17,922
but to keep it
from being spilled.

163
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:21,788
We will not pursue those
who choose to run away.

164
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:23,788
Come, we must heal both of them.

165
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:27,055
Chad and that Arrancar.

166
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:29,688
-Wait, is that
Captain Kurotsuchi?

167
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:30,388
-Huh?

168
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:31,955
What are you doing here?

169
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:34,222
This doesn't add up.

170
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:35,488
-Huh?

171
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:38,522
-So, Quincy, is this
someone you know?

172
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:39,988
-Know this man?

173
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,055
Hardly.

174
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:44,388
I would never know
such an inferior being.

175
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:46,122
-What was that you said?

176
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:49,655
-The fact is there aren't
very many Quincies around.

177
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:51,855
However, in spite
of that, I find

178
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:55,555
them to be of no great value
or interest to me at this time.

179
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:56,655
-I see.

180
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:59,022
So you came all this
way just to insult us?

181
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:03,388
Huh?

182
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:10,088
-Ta-da!

183
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:11,155
-The three brothers
of the burning sands--

184
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,455
-The three desert
brothers, two of three,

185
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:13,555
are back and ready to roll.

186
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:15,055
- --Well, two out of
three, are back again.

187
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:17,355
-[gasp]

188
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,455
-You guys!

189
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,022
So tell us, what
were you fighting

190
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,022
about when we were gone?

191
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:23,088
And you're not too
convincing trying

192
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,988
to act strong when you're
all beat up, Ichigo.

193
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:27,155
I mean, Uryu.

194
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:29,522
-Will you stop talking about me?

195
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:31,922
You look just as
beaten up as I do.

196
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:32,422
-Me?

197
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:33,455
Beaten up?

198
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:34,622
You're the one whose
body got messed up.

199
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,355
When Sero Syncratico
didn't work,

200
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,222
that might have messed
me up psychologically,

201
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:40,922
but I'm still strong enough
to pound you like a drum.

202
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:41,855
Got that, Uryu?

203
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:44,122
-You sound much worse.

204
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:45,388
-Now, now.

205
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:46,788
Stop fighting each other.

206
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:47,755
Good heavens.

207
00:12:47,788 --> 00:12:49,455
What a waste?

208
00:12:49,488 --> 00:12:51,288
Answer me, will you?

209
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:53,688
Who exactly are you?

210
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:57,255
On second thought, why
am I asking your name?

211
00:12:57,288 --> 00:13:00,688
After all, no matter
what, I'll crush you.

212
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:03,922
Finding out your name would
really just be a waste of time.

213
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:05,288
-Oh, really?

214
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:08,522
And yet I'm thinking it could
end up being quite a problem

215
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,755
if I don't get
your name from you.

216
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:12,488
-Why is that?

217
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:13,322
-Why?

218
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:15,388
Only an idiot would ask that.

219
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:17,988
It should do rather obvious why.

220
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:20,055
So that when I stuff
you into a jar,

221
00:13:20,088 --> 00:13:23,355
I'll be able to write
your name on the label.

222
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:24,555
-[laughs]

223
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:29,955
-Why do you wait?

224
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:32,588
Aren't you going to
attack me, intruder?

225
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:38,455
Before you do that, know this.

226
00:13:38,488 --> 00:13:41,488
If your plan is to save
that collapsed Soul Reaper,

227
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:42,588
don't bother.

228
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,188
It's no use.

229
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:46,388
You won't succeed.

230
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:47,822
-What did you say?

231
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:48,988
-Hm?

232
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:51,222
-What do you mean
by "It's no use"?

233
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,055
-This is what I mean.

234
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,691
-This is what I mean.

235
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:22,851
I see.

236
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:25,985
As I expected, Captain,
your speed and reaction time

237
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:27,318
are outstanding.

238
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:30,685
And your fighting
instincts are quite superb.

239
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:33,718
However, as developed
as your skills are,

240
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:37,051
they are, of course, at
a Soul Reaper's level.

241
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,051
-What do you mean by that?

242
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:39,918
Explain it.

243
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:52,018
-Orihime!

244
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:04,718
Hey, are you OK, Orihime?

245
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:05,685
-Yes, I'm fine.

246
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:06,651
But how about you?

247
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:09,151
-Still a little weak, but OK.

248
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:11,051
I'm wondering how
much longer that damn

249
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:13,151
Kenpachi is going
to keep at this.

250
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,218
-That was outstanding.

251
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:26,985
I get the feeling we could
have an interesting duel.

252
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:29,185
You think you're up to
keeping this battle going

253
00:15:29,218 --> 00:15:31,218
a little longer?

254
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:31,718
-Longer?

255
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:32,985
Let's go.

256
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:34,351
-Hm.

257
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:37,551
-[laugh]

258
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:41,318
-Stuff me into a jar?

259
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:43,151
[laugh]

260
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:44,551
-Hm?

261
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:52,651
-[laughing]

262
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,051
-Why is he laughing like that?

263
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:56,085
Hey, did you see what happened?

264
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:57,651
-I was right here,
but I didn't see

265
00:15:57,685 --> 00:15:58,951
anything that was funny at all.

266
00:15:58,985 --> 00:16:00,551
And I was listening,
too, so there's

267
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,718
no way I would have missed
a joke if he said one.

268
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:06,851
-Hey, what he said was
in no way a joke, idiot.

269
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,151
-Are you serious?

270
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:10,285
So you're saying that guy
made Szayelaporro laugh out

271
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:11,751
loud without
telling him anything

272
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:12,885
even resembling a joke?

273
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,251
Well, how did he
perform such a miracle?

274
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:17,251
-Is that guy a joke ninja?

275
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:20,618
Did he use a mind trick
to make him laugh?

276
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:21,918
-Just shut up!

277
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:24,951
Your stupid babbling
nonsense makes me nauseous!

278
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,918
-Oh, come on.

279
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:28,951
You're as cold as
a woman who has

280
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:33,051
absolutely no interest
in the man she left.

281
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:36,218
-[growl] I've had it!

282
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:38,185
-Uryu, you shouldn't
be straining yourself.

283
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:39,118
You're all messed up.

284
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:40,051
Really messed up.

285
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,351
Man, are you messed up.

286
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:44,685
-We'll let you rest, all right?

287
00:16:44,718 --> 00:16:46,385
-[sigh]

288
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:47,618
-All right then!

289
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:49,785
It's up to us to
cheer on the warriors!

290
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:51,218
Go, warriors, go!

291
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:52,685
-All right!

292
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:55,751
-[scream]

293
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:56,418
-Gemelos sonido.

294
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:03,351
Among all the Espadas, my
sonido is was the fastest.

295
00:17:06,018 --> 00:17:09,918
And by adding a small step,
I've created something else.

296
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:13,451
Something that resembles
a pseudo-clone.

297
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:16,885
Yes, you might think of
it as playing with magic.

298
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:23,185
Magic is a skill that
astounds the observer,

299
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,218
so don't think
yourself a simpleton

300
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:27,085
if you're amazed
by what you see,

301
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:29,451
because it will happen too fast.

302
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:30,685
-Really?

303
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:33,485
You can't say it's magic
after what you've just done.

304
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:36,385
No magician reveals
his trick before he

305
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:37,585
has completed his deception.

306
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:47,318
-[growl]

307
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:50,051
Too bad for you.

308
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:54,518
The Gemelos Sonido is not
limited to only two bodies.

309
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:56,751
-That much I figured.

310
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:57,218
-Oh!

311
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:01,718
[grunt]

312
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:03,785
-Hado number four, Byakurai.

313
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:11,451
[gasp]

314
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:29,551
-Enough of this!

315
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:36,051
-Kenpachi!

316
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:39,385
-I know earlier I said it
would be a waste of time

317
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,818
for me to learn
what your name is.

318
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,885
However, you said something
quite intriguing to me,

319
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:47,918
so now I wish to treat
you with some respect.

320
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:51,951
Therefore, I've decided after
all that I will ask your name.

321
00:18:51,985 --> 00:18:54,785
So you'll have a name when
you become my marionette.

322
00:18:58,151 --> 00:18:58,951
-This is bad.

323
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:00,251
Those things are fatal.

324
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:02,718
-Captain Kurotsuchi!

325
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:03,218
-Huh?

326
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:13,718
-Gemelos Sonido does have
a maximum of five bodies.

327
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:20,351
-You look rather shocked.

328
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:22,518
Don't tell me that
fighting at this level

329
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:24,585
is enough to challenge you.

330
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:27,285
If so, this duel
of ours won't leave

331
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:29,518
me feeling very satisfied.

332
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:31,251
Come on, I'm waiting.

333
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:33,618
Attack me as if your
life depends on this!

334
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:41,485
-It puked him out!

335
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:44,251
-This is what happened
to us all over again.

336
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:45,818
-Whether you're
a captain or not,

337
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,818
it doesn't matter, because
the fact you've come here

338
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:52,718
isn't going to change in
any way how things turn out.

339
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:56,185
I'm afraid your expectations
for affecting the outcome here

340
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:57,851
are about to go up in smoke.

341
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,718
I pity your fate,
for your lives are

342
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:07,393
about to come to
a meaningless end.

343
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:10,806
-You pity us?

344
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:18,775
-Farewell, nameless
Soul Reaper captain.

345
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:21,942
Your defeat was caused
by the arrogant act

346
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:24,108
of not stating your name.

347
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:24,608
Huh?

348
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:28,975
Huh?

349
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:34,642
-So be it.

350
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:39,908
Stealth Hoho, Shiho
Number Three, Utsusemi.

351
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:44,275
I wish I didn't have to use a
technique I learned from her.

352
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:47,008
-What's that?

353
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:57,242
--[laughing] I've been waiting
for you to say that to me.

354
00:20:57,275 --> 00:20:59,942
I feel the adrenaline
shooting through my body.

355
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:00,442
-Huh?

356
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:06,342
-From here on, it's
kill or be killed.

357
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,975
No more playing around.

358
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,875
-It is I who have pity
for you, because you

359
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:16,742
are about to
experience a world that

360
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,542
is well beyond
your comprehension.

361
00:21:23,642 --> 00:21:27,775
-Actually, you are the
arrogant one here, Espada.

362
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,442
There's no need to fret.

363
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:31,408
Your arrogance will
not be your undoing,

364
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:33,942
though you will taste defeat.

365
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:37,042
The reason is simply
a difference in skill.

366
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:48,030
[theme song]

367
00:23:17,273 --> 00:23:18,607
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
Just what was

368
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,340
Nnoitra doing by sticking
his finger in the ground?

369
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:22,373
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
That's the method

370
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:23,573
he uses to measure
spiritual pressure.

371
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:24,573
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): You!

372
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:25,940
I-I thought Kenpachi killed you!

373
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:27,240
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER): If
I don't explain it, who will?

374
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:29,340
Master Nnoitra
isn't exactly nice.

375
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:31,407
He doesn't explain
anything to anybody.

376
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,940
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
I guess you're right.
