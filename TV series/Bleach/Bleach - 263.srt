1
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:11,033
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,966
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,700
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:27,733
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:30,200
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:20,278
[chuckling]

7
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:21,378
It went that way!

8
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:23,344
Don't let it escape!

9
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:29,044
[chuckling]

10
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:31,111
It's been fun, but
hide and seek is over.

11
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:34,978
Let's just call
it a day!

12
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:36,411
Roar!

13
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:41,311
Surprise!

14
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:43,478
Over here! Here! Here!
Here, here, here! Here!

15
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:46,544
[laughing]
That a boy!

16
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:48,144
[chuckling]

17
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,511
[struggling]

18
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,578
Well, check that one off
the list.

19
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:00,844
<i>Zabimaru!</i>

20
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:04,911
I don't believe it! You
already took it down?!

21
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:09,111
<i>Heh. Just as you'd</i>
<i>expect of Lieutenant</i>
<i>Abarai's Zanpakuto.</i>

22
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:10,811
Oh come on, stop.

23
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:14,311
Seriously, that was a walk
in the park. Child's play,
right, Monkey?

24
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:17,778
Yeah. Nothing to get
excited about, we've
nabbed bigger fish.

25
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:18,744
[growling]

26
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,844
[roaring]

27
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:26,444
[yelling]

28
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:31,211
[gasping and coughing]

29
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:37,844
[chuckling]
[screaming]

30
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:38,778
Oh no!

31
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:40,811
We have to save them!

32
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:43,744
[struggling]
Can't get free!

33
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:47,811
[chuckling]

34
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:50,678
[screaming]
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

35
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:53,278
Scatter!

36
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:58,711
[gasping and screaming]

37
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:05,511
[grunting]

38
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:08,544
Senbonzakura!

39
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:14,778
You both let your guard
down.

40
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:17,111
[grunting]

41
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,011
Boy, we owe our lives to
Senbonzakura today, huh?

42
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,111
I'll say. He's just
what you'd expect of
Captain Kuchiki's
Zanpakuto.

43
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:35,744
Yeah! Cool and collected.
With unparalleled skill.
He's a revelation.

44
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:41,078
The exact opposite of
you-know-who!
[laughing]

45
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:47,278
Lousy bunch of jerks.
They know that we can
hear them.

46
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:51,044
Screw it. I'm gonna go
set them straight.

47
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:54,711
Like hell you will-now
hurry up and finish these
letters of apology!

48
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:56,478
[gasping]

49
00:04:56,511 --> 00:05:00,444
Why do we have to write
these stupid things in
the first place?! It's
a total waste of time!

50
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,078
You can say that again!

51
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:06,178
I don't wanna hear it! If
you don't like it, you can
shut your mouths and stay in
your sword forms then!

52
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:10,178
I'm sick of cleaning up
all your messes! Every
time I turn around you
two are sticking your

53
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,011
noses where they don't
belong!

54
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:16,311
Yeah, but Renji, staying
cooped up in sword form is
so boring

55
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:18,678
now that we're able to
manifest our physical form!

56
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:23,078
Oh, cry me a river. What's
the point if you two aren't
effective against the enemy?

57
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:24,811
Yeah, well don't
blame us.

58
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:29,711
After all, a Zanpakuto's
fighting techniques are
passed down from its
master, right?

59
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:33,011
Oh you just had to go
there again, didn't
you?!

60
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:37,711
Man. Everyone's always
comparing you to the
Captain's Senbonzakura.

61
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:40,311
It just gets embarrassing
after a while...

62
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:41,478
[grunting]

63
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,611
Sorry for the
inconvenience.

64
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:48,344
Where do you two think
you're going?

65
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:53,344
We're gonna turn this
Sword Beast over to the
Department of Research
and Development.

66
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:55,044
And your apology letter?

67
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:56,178
<i>All done.</i>

68
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:03,244
I swear. Those two are
becoming more trouble
than they're worth.

69
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,311
Huh?

70
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:07,544
[screaming]
Why those rotten
little---!!!

71
00:06:12,844 --> 00:06:16,611
Hello?! Is
anybody here?!

72
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:20,611
Anyone home?

73
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:22,644
<i>Maybe they stepped out.</i>

74
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,278
Sure looks that way.

75
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:26,544
What do we do now?
Come back later?

76
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:28,878
Please. It's
too much trouble.

77
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:33,244
There we go.

78
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:34,178
Bomb's away!

79
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,744
Oh, of all the
dumb things--

80
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:41,644
[screaming]

81
00:06:41,678 --> 00:06:43,878
Oh my gosh are you okay?!
Snake, talk to me!

82
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:47,011
What the hell is the
matter with you?! You're
choking me!

83
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:50,778
Oh will you shut up?! Stop
complaining and pull me out
of here!

84
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,944
Hang on.

85
00:06:56,344 --> 00:06:58,578
What are you
doing up there?

86
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:02,078
Are you blind or
something? I'm stuck
up he---

87
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:03,511
Oh! Ah!

88
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:08,544
[groaning]

89
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,978
<i>Senbonzakura!</i>

90
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:18,244
Look at the pair of you.
You've sunk pretty low if
you'll go sneaking around
in someone else's barracks.

91
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:19,544
Excuse me?!?

92
00:07:19,578 --> 00:07:22,478
Take it easy, Snake.
Anyway, what about you?

93
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:25,511
These aren't your barracks
either, what are you doing
skulking around?

94
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:28,678
My master requested that
I bring this Sword Beast
here.

95
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:32,111
You don't say, 'cause
that's exactly what we're
here to do.

96
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:35,511
We're all out of luck,
though. The place is
empty today.

97
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:40,211
Hmm, I'd noticed. Seems
they're all out conducting
experiments at the moment.

98
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:43,644
Pretty careless of them,
leaving the place
unguarded like this.

99
00:07:43,678 --> 00:07:48,944
Hey! Wait a minute...
How did you get inside,
Senbonzakura?

100
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,011
Hmph.

101
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:52,544
I came in through the
front.

102
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:56,144
Now who's sunk to a new
level? You broke in here
just like we did!

103
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:59,778
Coming back later
would've been a waste
of time. Let's go.

104
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:00,878
'Scuse me?

105
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:05,178
Jeez, it's almost like
talking to a little kid,
isn't it?

106
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:08,811
And none of the Soul
Reapers have any idea. He's
got every single one of them
fooled.

107
00:08:13,544 --> 00:08:17,911
[screaming]

108
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:20,778
[sobbing]
This place is creepy!

109
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:23,378
Now who's acting like a
little kid?! Will you
get it together?!

110
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:26,278
<i>Hey, look. That</i>
<i>one's empty!</i>

111
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:29,544
[whining]

112
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:40,544
How do you even know how
to operate that, Monkey?

113
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:43,978
I've been here with
Renji a million times.
Monkey see, monkey do.

114
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:52,411
Hmmm...

115
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:53,444
In we go...

116
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:56,744
Senbonzakura, wanna
see how we---

117
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:59,644
What the hell are you
doing?!

118
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,578
You shouldn't have
startled me. You caused
me to drop it.

119
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,811
Quit messing around
before we get in trouble-

120
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,811
[alarm sounding]

121
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:13,478
Oh no.

122
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:17,944
What now?!

123
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:21,044
Oh great!

124
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:23,544
What just happened?

125
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:27,478
Idiot! You set off the
security system and got
us in locked inside this
thing, you dumbass!!

126
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:30,711
Great! What are we
supposed to do now, huh?!

127
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:32,344
Heh. That's
simple.

128
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:34,044
Huh?

129
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:37,711
Scatter!

130
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:41,611
What?! Wait,
don't do it!

131
00:09:43,044 --> 00:09:46,144
[screaming]

132
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:52,911
It's quite sturdy.
In that case...

133
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:54,711
I think you've done
enough already

134
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,778
Don't do anything, all
right, just slow down!

135
00:09:56,811 --> 00:10:00,278
Oh man, for a minute
there I thought I was
going to be snake
sashimi.

136
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:04,011
These walls are
unbreakable, genius!

137
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:07,078
They're highly reinforced
to keep violent Sword Beasts
from getting away!

138
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:10,344
That's right, genius!
Whoa, are they really?

139
00:10:10,378 --> 00:10:14,411
Quite an annoying pair,
aren't you? So what do
you propose?

140
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:16,644
Well, it's not like we
have a lot of options.

141
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:20,078
We'll just have to wait
until the staff from the
Department of Research and
Development returns.

142
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:23,511
Oh, I see. It's out
of our hands, then.

143
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,611
[sighing]

144
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:33,778
Are they here yet?

145
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:34,911
Huh?!

146
00:10:34,944 --> 00:10:38,344
How long do they expect
me to wait..?!

147
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:40,711
Hey, uh... you
doin' okay over there?

148
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:43,444
[grunting]
I'll not wait
a moment longer!

149
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,878
Please calm down!

150
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:52,078
I've already counted to ten
in my mind! There's a limit
to my patience!

151
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:55,044
This isn't a game of
hide and seek, you
lunatic!

152
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:56,944
Unhand me!

153
00:10:56,978 --> 00:10:58,844

Perhaps because you

00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,252
Of course he ran off,
your murderous aura
scared him away!

What are we gonna do
now?! The remote control
is in pieces!

We wait. Until someone
from the Department of

gets back.

Hmph. That was child's

for?!

That's the same damn
question I have for you!

197
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:27,919
Destroying everything in
sight isn't helping us
right now!

198
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:31,052
It was necessary for us
to escape.

The building's defense
mechanisms are kicking
in.

203
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,186
This is a disaster!

204
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,219
We'll be locked
in all over again!

205

We have to run for it!

Senbonzakura! How much
farther to the exit!?

207

No idea!

00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:53,152
Then why the hell are you

Heh. Do you think I'd
follow anyone other
than my master?

I feel Rejuvenated.

224
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:45,152
So, where do you
think we are now?

225
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,819
Looks like the control
room.

226
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,119
Perfect. I'll try to

Huh? Hot!!

233
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:14,819
What?

234
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:16,786
What did you go and do
that for?!

235
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:19,552
I was only trying to
help.

236
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,819
Never mind, just stop
messing with the controls,
all right?!

237
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:26,019
I don't get it. What's
going on here?

238
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:30,452
<i>Most of the barracks were</i>

Alright, smart guy, what
do you intend to do about
this?!

311
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:18,652
Why're we the only ones
apologizing?!

312
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:20,052
Yeah! It's not fair!

313
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,152
<i>Hey, kids.</i>

314
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,519
Hmmm?

315
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:24,652
We've got plenty more
where those came from.

316
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:29,219
Also, we'll need you to
start repairs on all of those
buildings you destroyed, so try
to wrap up soon.

317
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:30,619
Come again?!

318
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:32,752
Oh please, we're so
exhausted!

319
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:34,586
Never mind, just hurry up
and do it!

320
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:41,519
I never would have
guessed Senbonzakura
had such a short fuse.

321
00:20:41,552 --> 00:20:45,152
And zero consideration
for those around him.

322
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:46,786
He's so different
from his master.

323
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:48,586
Oh, I don't know.

324
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:52,686
I think he mirrors Captain
Kuchiki's temperament fairly
well, actually.

325
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:57,286
I swear, that boy'll do
anything to get his way,
am I right or am I right?

326
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:01,186
I'll say. He's always had a
short temper. Even when he
was younger.

327
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:06,319
Yeah, he was an arrogant
little brat.

328
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:08,986
Always stirring up
trouble, the rascal.

329
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,086
Huh? Really?
That's crazy.

330
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:13,752
Sir!

331
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:18,152
Bad news. A new Sword
Beast has just shown up
within the walls of the
Seireitei!

332
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:21,919
A team from Squad 6 is
heading out now to face
it! Senbonzakura is
leading them!

333
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:25,152
Huh?!

334
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:28,686
Damn. If he goes out there
alone, there's no telling how
much damage he'll cause.

335
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,186
We'd better keep
an eye on him.

336
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:31,986
Let's go, Monkey!

337
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:34,186
Hey, get back here!
You've got letters to
write!

338
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:39,019
[laughing]
There's a bit of
irony for you.

339
00:21:39,052 --> 00:21:42,686
After everything that
happened, they're still trying
to reign in Senbonzakura.

340
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,486
<i>Sounds like a thankless</i>
<i>job.</i>

341
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:52,086
Oh, hey... What do you
think we should do about
Research and Development
spying on everybody?

342
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,819
Mmm... pretend
it didn't happen.

343
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:58,386
Seems all the data has
been destroyed. I say
we just call it even.

344
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:06,086
Absolutely unacceptable!
I go away for two seconds
and this is what I return to?!

345
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:49,554
Lieutenant Abarai, I'll
need those repairs done
today, all right?

346
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:51,288
<i>That's kind of a</i>
<i>tall order.</i>

347
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:54,254
We do have backups from
the surveillance cameras
you know.

348
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,054
<i>Huh?!</i>

349
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:58,254
It would be a shame if
some of your more private
moments were leaked...

350
00:23:58,288 --> 00:24:00,088
<i>Repairs will be done by</i>
<i>the end of the day!!</i>
