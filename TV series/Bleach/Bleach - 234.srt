1
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:13,133
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,333
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:22,666
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,866
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,266
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:31,748
Still no leads, huh? All
right, well keep me posted
on your findings, will ya?

7
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:32,715
Yessir!

8
00:02:33,648 --> 00:02:35,215
Hmmm...

9
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:40,448
How's it going,
Shunsui? Did you
find out anything new?

10
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:44,448
No, nothing very helpful,
and Old Man Yama is still
missing.

11
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:46,548
What's happening at your
end?

12
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:49,015
Well, we're having a
hard time.

13
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:54,615
However, Captain Soi
Fon's Punishment Force is
rushing to assess the
situation and handle the

14
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:56,315
damage done to each
squad.

15
00:02:56,348 --> 00:03:00,781
Thanks to their efforts,
we're now able to mobilize
our resources more efficiently.

16
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:04,948
I've already
dispatched all available
squads to seek and
capture each Zanpakuto

17
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:06,848
that has been
manifested.

18
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:16,281
Oh, brother! Everyone
out there trying to capture
their own weapons.

19
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:19,115
What a screwed up
situation to be in.

20
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:23,048
One more thing. It's
about Byakuya, who's
still missing.

21
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:26,048
It seems his Spiritual
Pressure has been
extinguished.

22
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,081
That's very strange.

23
00:03:28,115 --> 00:03:29,681
Yes.

24
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:33,248
Sounds like a very
unpromising state of
affairs.

25
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,081
Captain Unohana!

26
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:38,081
What a surprise--I had no
idea you were here.

27
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:42,881
Oh, I don't believe for
one moment that you didn't
sense my presence, Shunsui.

28
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:44,881
You frighten me with your
insight.

29
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:48,081
Rukia? How is she
doing? Any improvement?

30
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:50,381
Well....

31
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:54,981
For now... if nothing
changes... it appears
that her life is out of
danger.

32
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:59,881
But her wound is deep and
she remains unconscious.

33
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:03,915
Considering the severity
of her injury, we should
be grateful she's alive.

34
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:08,815
I'd like to apologize for
overrunning your barracks
while setting up our temporary
command center.

35
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:14,081
It's alright. We need to
consolidate. Now is not
the time to scatter our
military strength.

36
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:18,548
My Squad Four is ready to
assist. We'll do everything
possible to help with the
situation.

37
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:24,115
Well, at the moment, our
top priority is to somehow
stop the Zanpakuto and their
vicious rampage.

38
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:26,048
In regards to that...

39
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:31,548
I received a request from
Squad Twelve for test
subjects to use in
gathering further data..

40
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:34,815
I just came from
Captain Kurotsuchi's
examination.

41
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:37,748
You did,
Captain Unohana?

42
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,315
Is it a problem?

43
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:43,848
Not at all.
Frankly, I'm just
surprised that you would
comply with his request.

44
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:47,481
Now is not the time to
be concerned with one's
ethics.

45
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:53,048
According to Captain
Kurotsuchi, the Zanpakuto
have somehow managed to

46
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:56,581
become completely
independent of their
Soul Reapers.

47
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:58,581
<i>Independent?!</i>

48
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:00,281
That's correct...

49
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:04,248
...If we err in any way
when dealing with them,
it's it is entirely
possible that the

50
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:06,515
Zanpakuto will be
lost forever.

51
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:13,748
North Block Twelve has
been checked. Nothing to
report, sir.

52
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,615
We found nothing in South
Block Seventy-Five
either, sir.

53
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:21,681
How could they disappear
without a trace of
Spiritual Pressure? I
don't get it. It makes

54
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:24,615
no sense---Where could
they possibly be hiding?

55
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:28,648
They're not just made of
mist or smoke. They have
to be around here somewhere.

56
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:31,548
No. Maybe they did
disappear.

57
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,248
Huh?!

58
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,781
What do you mean?

59
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:36,348
They originated as
Zanpakuto...

60
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:37,715
But may have changed.

61
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:41,215
It is possible that they're
not in their manifested state
anymore.

62
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:45,181
But Lieutenant, if that's
so, how will we ever be
able to find them?

63
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:51,081
Don't sound so hopeless!
Listen up, both of you. Our
very existence as Soul Reapers
is on the line!

64
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:53,715
No matter what it costs,
we must capture them!

65
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:54,615
<i>Yessir!</i>

66
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:01,315
Looks like... they're
coming to us.

67
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:26,515
Come
back here.

68
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:30,581
That's a sharp blade you've
got there. Such speed and
sharpness aren't that common.

69
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:35,681
...And yet that
swordsmanship doesn't
look like any stranger's.
It seems far too familiar.

70
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:43,281
Is that you?

71
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:47,148
Kazeshini?!

72
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:51,248
So you figured it
out, ey, partner?

73
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:07,015
I came back to this place
hoping to find something,
but...

74
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:10,548
Damn it. There has to be
a clue here somewhere!

75
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:19,448
Where could the captain
have possibly gone?

76
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,615
<i>Give it up!</i>

77
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:22,881
Who's there?!

78
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,781
<i>It's me! Over here!</i>

79
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:31,515
An idiot like you will
never be able to find a
clue, no matter how hard
you try!

80
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:54,315
Oh, great! You're
awake!

81
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:57,115
Lieutenant Kotetsu?

82
00:07:57,148 --> 00:08:02,115
Your wound hasn't healed
yet. You'll need to rest
a little more.

83
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,648
But where am I?

84
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:06,781
It's okay, you're inside
the Squad Four Barracks.

85
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:11,848
You were brought here
after someone found you
lying unconscious. You
were very lucky.

86
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:19,315
My objective is to free
all the Zanpakuto from
their Soul Reapers.

87
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:25,915
And in order to do that,
I needed you, Ichigo Kurosaki,
to find your way here...

88
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:28,881
You're saying... you
used Rukia?!

89
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:33,615
Welcome to my world.

90
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:39,381
Ichigo! Where is Ichigo
Kurosaki?

91
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:44,548
The person who brought
you here didn't report
anything about his
whereabouts...

92
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:49,115
At this moment, each
squad is focused on
assessing the damages
they sustained, and

93
00:08:49,148 --> 00:08:51,548
taking care of their
wounded as well.

94
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:55,881
I'm afraid there just
aren't enough hands to go
through the rubble to
search for the missing.

95
00:08:58,248 --> 00:08:59,481
Ichigo!

96
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:21,148
I'm back here again?

97
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,115
But why?

98
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,181
Why am I here?

99
00:09:57,376 --> 00:10:03,347
Zangetsu!
Zangetsu! Where
are you?! Zangetsu?!

100
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:09,415
Wait a minute. Everything about
him leaving my body... it was
true?!

101
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:10,748
<i>Exactly!</i>

102
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:15,981
What? But how--?

103
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:19,581
It seems you finally
understand.

104
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:30,181
This is all supposed to
be inside my mind. So how
the hell can you be here?!

105
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:32,748
Did you forget
that I am a Zanpakuto

106
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:37,415
and if
I wish, I can use my
Zanpakuto powers to enter
the mind of a Soul Reaper

107
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:40,315
at any time, with no
effort at all.

108
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,648
And what are you planning?
What are you trying to do
here?!

109
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:46,981
What is your master
thinking? Why has he
put you up to this?

110
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,315
My Master?

111
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:57,548
My master's gone. I've
eliminated him.

112
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:02,048
What are you talking
about?! You killed him?!
But how?

113
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:13,115
With my will. It was
quite easy to wipe him
out. And Ichigo
Kurosaki...

114
00:11:13,415 --> 00:11:17,248
...I've taken quite an
interest in you as a
Soul Reaper.

115
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:25,116
What is that power you possess?

116
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:28,915
What is the source that changes you
and gives you your power?

117
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:33,048
You think I'd answer to
someone like you? Think again.

118
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:38,915
You really don't get it.
Your power is nothing compared
to mine. I'm afraid it's not
even close.

119
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:43,215
Your defiance is useless
pointless. Just answer
my question.

120
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:52,881
And if I refuse?

121
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,515
You die.

122
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:02,181
Damn you!

123
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:26,690
Tell me...

124
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:29,090
Who... the hell...

125
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,923
Ummm... uh... uh.

126
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:35,057
..are you?!

127
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:40,490
You're unbelievable!
You really don't know who
I am?

128
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,690
Not a clue? You're so
hopeless, Renji.

129
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:49,257
I thought for sure you
would remember me, after
all the years we spent
together.

130
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,657
All the years?
Together?

131
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,857
I'm very sorry, but I'm
afraid I don't recall knowing
any women as hairy as you are.

132
00:12:58,057 --> 00:12:58,923
Huh?!

133
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,557
How 'bout my
partner?

134
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,323
You still going to say
you don't remember me or
him, as if you could
forget?

135
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:13,123
What?!

136
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:18,057
You're saying... you two
are my Zanpakuto?!

137
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:24,957
What's wrong? Why that
look of shock? This isn't
like you, Renji.

138
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,790
Y-You used to be just a
plain monkey and a snake!

139
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:30,957
Oh, you're so stuck on
petty details.

140
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,590
Petty?! You've
completely changed!

141
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:38,023
I'm not sure you
appreciate how much you
used to rely upon us,
Renji.

142
00:13:39,457 --> 00:13:41,823
What's that? Relied
upon you?!

143
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:44,257
Yes.

144
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:47,057
Right, Snake?

145
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,490
Cut that out, it's
disgusting!

146
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:53,490
Got it! Big one.

147
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:55,923
Pay attention you
stupid little brat!

148
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:59,623
Why did you whack me on
the head? That really
hurt, you big-butt broad!

149
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:03,857
Leave my butt out of
it--If you paid more
attention to what was
going on, I wouldn't

150
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,657
always have to be the one
doing the talking!

151
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,723
<i>You like the sound of</i>
<i>your own voice so I</i>
<i>didn't want to butt in!</i>

152
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:10,257
There you go again with
the 'butt'!

153
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,123
<i>How about I call it an</i>
<i>'ass' instead--</i>

154
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:15,657
If you don't have
any business to discuss
with me, could you come
back later, because I

155
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,323
really don't have time
for this right now.

156
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,457
What's that? What did
you say? Renji...

157
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,457
Now listen... We're not
leaving...

158
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,057
..And I might as well
tell you straight out,
you won't be going
anywhere either.

159
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,190
What?

160
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,623
Listen to me. You seem
to have the wrong idea
about us.

161
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,490
You see we really came
all the way out here to
find you just to eliminate
you.

162
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:48,923
Wait! I want to know.
What's your reason? Why
do you have to do this?

163
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:50,790
We both heard the voice.

164
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,057
Yes. It told us to
follow our instinct.

165
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,990
What instinct?

166
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,223
<i>Yes, and we will</i>
<i>fight.</i>

167
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:04,390
Because that is our
natural instinct!

168
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:10,757
<i>Awaken! Awaken your</i>
<i>instinct!</i>

169
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,857
<i>It lies in the deepest</i>
<i>and darkest part of you.</i>

170
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,023
<i>Now, I want you to</i>
<i>show it to me.</i>

171
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,523
Zangetsu...

172
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:34,857
You are awake Ichigo
Kurosaki...

173
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,257
Let's go. Time
to release.

174
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,057
...The instinct inside
you.

175
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:45,090
<i>I can't move my body.</i>

176
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,290
Now, manifest it Show
your inner self. Let it
come out!

177
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:11,623
Here it
comes.

178
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,290
Hm...

179
00:16:50,223 --> 00:16:51,523
Hey you...

180
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,857
Did you call for me?

181
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:10,357
Damn it. He really is
quick with that thing.

182
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,457
This is all it took to
graze you?!

183
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,257
Seems like you don't have
too much strength without
me, eh?

184
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:46,290
I could say the same, but
I think it's both of us.
Doesn't my strength fuel
your power?

185
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,823
Really? I think that's
just some convenient
delusion that you keep
telling yourself.

186
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:53,123
What?

187
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:58,457
And of course, you don't
have the slightest idea
what my true desire is.

188
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,657
What are you trying to
say? What is your
reason for wanting to
separate?

189
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,590
I was inspired when I
heard the voice...

190
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:08,890
...It told me to listen
to my instinct.

191
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:11,957
The voice? What voice?

192
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:17,457
Yeah. But hey, I don't
expect you to get it. You
don't understand me at
all.

193
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,357
And you don't understand
what my blade truly
wants, either!

194
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:26,790
What do you mean by that?

195
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:30,657
Oh, I know you don't
really like this thing, but
did you notice its shape?

196
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,890
I think you should look
very carefully.

197
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:36,957
Doesn't it look like it
was made for reaping lives?

198
00:18:49,423 --> 00:18:51,657
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

199
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,923
Snake, would you quit
playing around?

200
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:57,257
Will you shut your mouth?
You're the one that's just
standing there!

201
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,557
Oh? Well, so what?

202
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:06,747
So, Renji... You don't
seem to be taking us
seriously. You haven't
even drawn your sword.

203
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:13,559
Are you totally crazy?
There's no way I can
get serious against a
little brat like him.

204
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:18,026
Besides, I have no reason
to draw my sword and
fight you two.

205
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:23,526
Huh, you're just saying
that because you know you
can't beat us. You're so
pathetic, Renji.

206
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:25,559
Oh really...

207
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:29,426
Well, there's no reason
for you to get so excited.

208
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:35,426
...But on the other hand,
we don't have time to
play around, trifling
with a weakling like you!

209
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,659
Wha--- what?!

210
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:55,292
What now?! What kind of
game is he playing? And
what's he doing here
again?

211
00:19:57,426 --> 00:19:59,326
Interesting...

212
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,326
...A glimpse into the
inner world of a Soul
Reaper...

213
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:07,326
...And the other Ichigo
Kurosaki who appeared
from it...

214
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,592
...Exuding the Spiritual
Pressure of a Hollow.

215
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:13,592
Just what are you?

216
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:20,026
Me, well.. In simple
terms, I'm his real self.

217
00:20:20,626 --> 00:20:24,059
You could also call me
his basic true instinct.

218
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:29,659
Interesting.. So if you
are what you say, then...

219
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:33,592
...The power Ichigo
Kurosaki demonstrated
when we fought...

220
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:36,359
... was the same as a
Hollow's...

221
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,759
It makes sense now. You
are the source of that power.

222
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:48,192
Well, who really knows?

223
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,659
Now it's my turn to
ask you some questions.

224
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,892
...Just who the hell are
you anyway?!

225
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:03,526
I am the Zanpakuto
Muramasa. I am here to
free all of the Zanpakuto.

226
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:08,030
Zanpakuto respond to my voice.

227
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:13,192
And I possess the power to awaken their
true instincts.

228
00:21:13,226 --> 00:21:18,159
So that's why both Zangetsu
and Sodenoshirayuki turned
against us!

229
00:21:23,026 --> 00:21:26,326
Now I see... if you
possess the power of
a Hollow...

230
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,692
...And are Ichigo
Kurosaki's true
instinct...

231
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:32,692
..It all works out. You
can utilize my power

232
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:35,759
to liberate the instinct
living within you.

233
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:51,792
It's done.

234
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:48,973
Why is the Zabimaru
monkey female?!

235
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,640
<i>Because I'm your secret</i>
<i>desire, you pervert!</i>

236
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:52,807
Is that right?

237
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,140
Rukia, it's not what you
think!

238
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:59,307
<i>Oh, I don't know about</i>
<i>that--I'll never forget</i>
<i>the night you made me</i>
<i>submit to you!</i>

239
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,473
You are sick.

240
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:01,073
But...!
