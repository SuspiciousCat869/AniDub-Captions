1
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:12,033
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:19,600
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,200
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:27,233
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper
and dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:30,400
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,715
There's faint Spiritual
Pressure here...

7
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:33,948
I want all of you to
split up and find where
it's coming from.

8
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:34,482
Right!

9
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:36,448
Relax! Leave it to me!

10
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:40,882
Hold on! Think you can
handle this job?

11
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:45,482
Stop treating me
like a kid.

12
00:02:57,515 --> 00:02:59,948
All right,
found one.

13
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:09,648
You're a Sword
Beast, aren't you?

14
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:12,648
Don't move!

15
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:21,015
[flustered]
Uhhh!

16
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:46,415
Why am I feeling so
weird?! I mean, he must
be a Zanpakuto! I'm a
Zanpakuto, too,

17
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:49,948
but just by looking at him,
I can tell that he's clearly
a lot younger than me.

18
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:53,815
Come on, Haineko, you like
older guys, you don't like
kids! You're never interested

19
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:58,948
in skinny-looking wimps.
You're into more mature guys.
Guys who have more meat on
their bones than his beanpole.

20
00:03:58,982 --> 00:04:00,082
Yet...

21
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:04,715
I can't help myself!

22
00:04:04,748 --> 00:04:06,782
I'm lovestruck!

23
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:10,548
Damn---
[struggling]

24
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,248
You all right?!

25
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:20,548
I don't get this. I
like manly men. Guys
filled with testosterone.
Not passive guys like

26
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:23,415
this weakling who's
breaking a sweat just
trying to stand up.

27
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:28,748
But a Sword Beast is a
Sword Beast. I'm gonna
have to take you down.

28
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:36,015
[gasping]

29
00:04:37,948 --> 00:04:41,882
I can't believe he's using
puppy dog eyes on me and it's
working! All I wanna do is
take care of him!

30
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:48,915
[sighing]
Well, I guess you
need some help.

31
00:04:58,282 --> 00:04:59,448
Is everyone okay?

32
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:00,582
All clear on
this side.

33
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:02,748
They've all been
taken care of!

34
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,948
So, were you
able to find one?

35
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:14,348
Sure. Yeah.

36
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:16,748
So then you
dealt with it?

37
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:17,782
Yup.

38
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:19,748
Hmmm?

39
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:22,948
Say, Rangiku... uh--

40
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:29,115
Haineko? Is something
wrong?

41
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:31,815
No, no. Nothing worth
talking about!

42
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,848
Hey. Wake up Rangiku!

43
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:55,948
Hm? Oh Captain! What
are you doing here?

44
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:59,415
Never mind why I'm
here! Why are you
laying around?!

45
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:04,248
I'm depressed because
someone took these special
sweets I'd been hiding.
They're gone.

46
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:06,415
You ate them, didn't you?

47
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:10,748
Why would I do that? And
besides, it's rude not to
share! You shouldn't hide
them!

48
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:12,982
Hyorinmaru, can you
get me some tea, please?

49
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:14,515
Yes, ma'am.

50
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:18,115
I never gave you permission
to treat my Zanpakuto as
if he's your servant.

51
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:22,648
Anyway, we're still not
finished hunting down all
those Sword Beasts...

52
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,548
We can't relax yet!

53
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:25,848
I know.

54
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:29,715
Lieutenant, where exactly
is Haineko?

55
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,315
Who knows?

56
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:34,048
Probably somewhere
sleeping.

57
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:40,548
Is this really okay?

58
00:06:41,548 --> 00:06:45,882
I mean, I don't owe anyone
anything. It's not like I'm
a Soul Reaper.

59
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,448
But still...
[exhaling]

60
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:55,782
Hey! I've
come back.

61
00:06:57,415 --> 00:06:58,548
Ta-dah!

62
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:07,415
There we go!

63
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:09,815
Thank you so much
for helping me.

64
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:12,315
But... why are
you doing this?

65
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,148
You need help.

66
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:17,282
But isn't destroying
all of us your sworn duty?

67
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:20,882
Why would you be treating
the injuries of your enemy?

68
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:25,748
Attacking an opponent
who's really too wounded
to fight back, isn't my
idea of fair.

69
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:28,348
Besides, you're not like
other Sword Beasts I've
met!

70
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:31,848
You're not aggressive at
all! You're quite nice!

71
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:36,015
What am I talking about?!
Oh, well. He does seem
harmless.

72
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:39,715
You are a Sword Beast,
aren't you?

73
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:42,815
That is the name the
Soul Society has given me.

74
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:47,315
But I'm not a beast, I'm
just an ordinary Zanpakuto
who's lost his master.

75
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:52,982
My master was a cowardly
Soul Reaper. And now I've
found out, I'm just like him.

76
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,048
So to survive, I needed
to protect myself.

77
00:07:56,082 --> 00:08:00,715
I was scared and knew I
was weak. I thought if I
aligned myself with the
other sword Sword Beasts

78
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:02,048
I'd be protected.

79
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,515
But because I was close
to them, I was hunted
down, as they were.

80
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:09,948
At the first sign of
danger, I ran and hid.

81
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:13,982
[heavy breathing]

82
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,248
And I'm still hiding
to this day.

83
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:21,815
You really need to get
some rest. You're obviously
in a lot of pain!

84
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:23,848
Thank you.

85
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:28,948
[gasping]
What?! Is there...
something on my face?

86
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:32,882
You're not like any other
Zanpakuto or Soul reaper
I've ever met!

87
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:34,415
I'm not?

88
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,882
So! I'm gonna help you
with your situation!

89
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:38,882
Huh?

90
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:41,015
I can tell there's
nothing dangerous
about you.

91
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:45,182
So I'll ask the others to
treat you like a regular
Zanpakuto instead of a
Sword Beast!

92
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:47,315
Oh, and I brought
you some sweets.

93
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:49,448
Could you really do that?!

94
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:51,382
Just leave it to me!

95
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,048
Please tell me.
What's your name?

96
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:56,282
I'm Narunosuke.

97
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:59,348
Mm-hmm. Well,
I'm Haineko.

98
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:02,582
[gulping]
Nice to meet you,
Miss Haineko.

99
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:04,948
Don't call me that.
Makes me sound old.

100
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:06,315
Lady Haineko?

101
00:09:06,348 --> 00:09:08,348
That sounds even worse!

102
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:15,148
[giggling]

103
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,682
That's not possible.

104
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:21,815
Why?

105
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:25,582
Once Zanpakuto lose their
masters, there's no way of
knowing when they'll

106
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,715
become violent and
turn dangerous.

107
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:31,182
So we have to deal with
all these Sword Beasts
the same way.

108
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:34,882
But there may be some
Sword Beasts that aren't
really dangerous to us at all!

109
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,048
I wish that that were
true, but...

110
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:40,715
While each Sword Beast
is different, we know
from Squad 12's research

111
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:45,682
there's an extremely
high possibility that they
will eventually lose their
minds and go out of control.

112
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:49,648
Our job is to stop them
before they can hurt someone.

113
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:53,848
Why are you asking?
Have you found another
Sword Beast?

114
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:58,615
No! It's nothing! I'm
just kinda curious about
them! See ya!

115
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:07,415
I can't let any of them know
about him! These Soul Reapers
would wipe out even a harmless
guy like him!

116
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:11,915
She mentioned that Sword
Beasts have a very good
chance of losing their minds!

117
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:15,182
So then, are there Sword
Beasts out there who haven't
done that?!

118
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:20,882
That's it! He's not like
the others! He's just a
scared Zanpakuto who lost
his master.

119
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:23,848
I'll explain that.
That'll change Rangiku's
mind!

120
00:10:23,882 --> 00:10:28,615
Whoa! You like younger
guys, really?! Ew!
[laughing]

121
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:31,715
Maybe telling her that
might not work.

122
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:35,715
Hey! Haineko!

123
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:37,782
How are you?

124
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:41,148
All I know is, I've gotta
do something about this
myself!

125
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,315
Wha-- Huh?

126
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,082
Is it good?

127
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:53,048
Yes! Very good!

128
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:56,248
He's just a young guy. I
can't see him becoming
violent.

129
00:10:56,282 --> 00:11:00,682
He's definitely not a
Sword Beast. He's a
Zanpakuto. Just like me!

130
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:02,415
I'm glad you
like it!

131
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:08,715
Oh, I meant to ask. Am
I still going to be dealt
with as a Sword Beast?

132
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:11,148
Did you talk to the
others like you promised?

133
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:12,782
[gasping and coughing]

134
00:11:12,815 --> 00:11:16,615
Oh that! Why sure! I did
ask my Soul Reaper about
that!

135
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:20,782
She said she'd talk to
her superiors about it,
but it seems they're kind
of busy right now, so it

136
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:23,482
might take some time for
them to get back to you!

137
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:25,282
Oh, I see.

138
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:28,348
Speaking of my Soul
Reaper, those sweets I
brought for you for lunch
yesterday, were

139
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:32,348
candies that she hides
from everyone because she
swears they keep her from
catching colds! Have you

140
00:11:32,382 --> 00:11:33,682
ever heard of
anything so nuts?!

141
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:35,215
Achoo!

142
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:40,282
[laughing]

143
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:41,782
Now that's pretty funny!

144
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:43,082
Isn't it?!

145
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:46,948
[struggling]

146
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:48,048
You okay?

147
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,082
Uh, yeah. Fine.

148
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:54,515
You're still not
completely healed. Maybe you
should rest a little more.

149
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,682
I can't thank you
enough, Miss Haineko.

150
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:00,482
No one's ever cared about
me before. You're special.

151
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:06,215
Um! Wow! Really?

152
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:12,348
[laughing]

153
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:14,182
Oh!
Huh?

154
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:16,782
[laughing]

155
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,082
I wonder what
happened to her.

156
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:23,582
Who knows?

157
00:12:24,748 --> 00:12:26,215
What's up?!
I'm back!

158
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:27,715
What is it?!
What's going on?

159
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,815
It is just so darn
amazing to be alive!

160
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:33,315
Don't you agree,
my dear Rangiku?

161
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:37,182
Uh... D-d-dear Rangiku?!

162
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:47,482
Not again.

163
00:12:47,515 --> 00:12:49,748
It's happening more
often!

164
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:07,279
[humming]

165
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:20,746
Heyyyy!

166
00:13:22,613 --> 00:13:26,413
I brought you lunch
again! I brought a
little sake too!

167
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:29,513
You can have a sip,
right? You must be
feeling better,

168
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:31,713
so I thought we'd
have a drink together.

169
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:34,079
Mmmm. Miss Haineko...

170
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,713
Huh?

171
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:40,879
I'm sorry. But right
now, the last thing on
my mind is having fun.

172
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:42,379
What?

173
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:45,413
Don't you see? I need to
know what will really
happen to me!

174
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:49,713
You told me you were
going to handle it! Were
you just telling me lies?!

175
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,979
No, but you see...

176
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:56,179
<i>I'll tell you</i>
<i>the truth.</i>

177
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:02,679
Now I see.

178
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,279
I'm so sorry.

179
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:12,946
It's okay. None of this is
your fault. A Sword Beast
is a Sword Beast.

180
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:16,779
I must accept my
situation and not
expect any help.

181
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:20,346
Wait! What
will you do?

182
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:27,046
If I stay here, the Soul
Reapers will eventually find
and destroy me! I must leave
before that happens.

183
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:29,213
Aaargh!

184
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:32,679
You're not well! You're
in no condition to go!

185
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:37,913
Thanks to your help, my
wounds have healed enough.
I'm very grateful to you.

186
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:41,346
Please, don't leave
yet! Besides, I--

187
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:45,046
[screaming]

188
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:46,213
What's wrong?!

189
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:48,346
[screaming]

190
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:49,746
Narunosuke!

191
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:50,579
Ahhh!

192
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:54,979
This is bad.

193
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:58,413
While each sword Sword
beast Beast is different,
we know from Squad 12's
research there's an

194
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:03,279
extremely high possibility
that they will eventually
lose their minds and go
out of control.

195
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:07,913
[gasping for breath]

196
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:09,646
Sorry I hit you.

197
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:13,679
Sometimes I get these
excruciating headaches.

198
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,746
And my hands start doing
things on their own...

199
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:20,879
It's been happening more
and more frequently.

200
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:22,346
What's with
that look?

201
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,913
Nothing! Nothing
at all.

202
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:29,279
You're just gonna need to
stay here until you're not
having those headaches anymore.

203
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:32,646
Heh. You're so
very kind.

204
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:39,413
Someone's taking our
supplies?!

205
00:15:39,446 --> 00:15:43,679
That's what it looks like.
We've had a lot of things
missing lately.

206
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:49,746
It's true. Some medicine is
missing and someone's taken
some food rations from the
barracks.

207
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,146
Mmmm.

208
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:54,646
Do you have any idea
who it might be?

209
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:56,846
No clue.

210
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,679
But there may be some
Sword Beasts that aren't
dangerous to us at all!

211
00:16:00,946 --> 00:16:02,313
Oh...

212
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:12,479
Come in, Haineko.

213
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,946
You knew I'd
been gone?

214
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:21,813
Of course I did. Where
were you, anyway?

215
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:23,279
Nowhere.

216
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:26,913
So, Haineko...
What is it?

217
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,313
Um, I, uh--

218
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:38,179
By the way, have you heard
the news that we've discovered
someone has been stealing

219
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:39,946
medicine and food
from our barracks?

220
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:42,846
What?! Wow,
that's bad news.

221
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,513
Yeah. Awful. Who
would do that?

222
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:49,379
[sighing]
No idea. Goodnight!

223
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,413
[screaming]

224
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:05,279
Another headache?!
What can I do?!

225
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:08,146
I just need to know what's
going to happen to me!

226
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:12,679
Well, I don't know.
You'll be okay, you
just need some time to--

227
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,013
Stop lying! You know
what's happening to me!
[screaming]

228
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:20,146
Narunosuke! I know it
hurts, try to hang in
there!

229
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,013
Just tell me the truth!!

230
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,079
<i>You're becoming</i>
<i>a Sword Beast.</i>

231
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,913
Rangiku!

232
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:32,879
I knew that something strange
must have been going on. Now,
it makes perfect sense.

233
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:34,913
So you followed me?

234
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:39,513
Why didn't you tell me
about this earlier? Why
did you try to hide this?

235
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:44,713
I need you to try to
understand my position.

236
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:48,646
I'm a lieutenant. And
you are my Zanpakuto.

237
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:54,046
I'm ordering you! Back
away from that Sword
Beast!

238
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,946
Hold it! He's not a
Sword Beast. He's
just suffering!

239
00:17:57,979 --> 00:18:01,979
That's just the start! Soon,
he'll lose his mind and go
out of control!

240
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:04,646
That's what happens
to Sword Beasts!

241
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,613
I'm turning... into
a Sword Beast?!

242
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:10,713
Wait, there has to be some
way to save his life!

243
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:12,679
[trembling]

244
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:13,979
There isn't.

245
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:15,346
<i>What?</i>

246
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,513
Miss Haineko,
please save me!

247
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:23,946
[screaming]

248
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:30,046
[gasping]

249
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,979
[screaming]

250
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:40,746
Out of the way, Haineko!
I'm getting rid of him
for his own good!

251
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:44,579
No way! I will find a
way to save him!

252
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:46,713
Why do you refuse
to hear me?!

253
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:51,646
If you must kill him,
think of me as a Sword
Beast, too and get rid
of me.

254
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:55,279
It's disappointing that
I can't get you to listen.

255
00:18:55,846 --> 00:18:57,779
Growl! Haineko!

256
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:00,813
[yelling]

257
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:04,446
Ha!

258
00:19:11,813 --> 00:19:15,713
She leaves me no other
choice! I'll restrain
her with bakudo!

259
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:26,146
Narunosuke! Don't!

260
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:29,279
[growling]

261
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:29,913
[gasping]

262
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:33,746
[growling]

263
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,546
Rangiku!

264
00:19:44,046 --> 00:19:54,013
[growling]

265
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:55,779
Haineko!

266
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:02,479
I'm sorry..

267
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:10,679
Please Haineko get away!!

268
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:15,146
[screaming]

269
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:20,346
I'm here for you. You
wouldn't hurt me. I was
sure of that.

270
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:26,313
Haineko...

271
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:29,813
Narunosuke.

272
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,679
Thank you, Miss
Haineko.

273
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:05,746
Narunosuke!

274
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:35,013
I was in love with him.
I couldn't help myself.

275
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:37,613
And I couldn't admit
it. I couldn't tell him.

276
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:42,179
I know you were. You
all right?

277
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:43,646
What's that?

278
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,079
Nothing.

279
00:21:45,113 --> 00:21:48,846
I was blinded and made
a big mistake. Is that
what you think?

280
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:52,879
No, not really. But I do
think that you're foolish.

281
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:57,579
I might be. I think I'll
give younger guys a rest
for a while.

282
00:21:57,613 --> 00:21:58,646
Why is that?

283
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,779
I'm sure they'll be lots
more fun when I'm your age.

284
00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:04,879
Whatever works.

285
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:49,094
Captain, should we give
Haineko something to help
to mend her broken heart?

286
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,194
<i>Oh, yeah. Perhaps</i>
<i>she'd like--</i>

287
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:53,994
I've got it! Booze and
shopping always helps a
broken heart!

288
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:57,194
But I'm worried about Haineko
going off on her own, so I'll
go with her!

289
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,394
This bottle's
for Haineko!

290
00:23:58,427 --> 00:23:59,927
<i>Rangiku!</i>
