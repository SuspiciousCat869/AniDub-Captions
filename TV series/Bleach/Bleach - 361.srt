1
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:55,796
So then... You're one
of them too, huh?

2
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,437
Uh!

3
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:07,212
Uryu...

4
00:02:09,114 --> 00:02:10,483
Ichigo!

5
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:12,053
Don't you get it?!

6
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:13,220
Huh?!

7
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:17,360
The guy who attacked me,
is standing right behind
you!

8
00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:34,117
[grunting]

9
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,055
No...!

10
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:40,492
[grunting]

11
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:53,745
[laughing]

12
00:02:53,778 --> 00:02:55,279
Ginjo...

13
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:57,483
Why?

14
00:03:05,627 --> 00:03:08,832
Now your Fullbring is
mine!

15
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:10,768
[grunting]

16
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:36,771
[short breathing]

17
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:38,707
[grunting]

18
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:43,648
Now I remember...
everything.

19
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:50,323
Damnit!

20
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:01,639
Oh dear. One of Ichigo's
friends, right?

21
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,146
I think it would have
been much easier if I'd
cut him with my
Fullbring, instead.

22
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,684
What are you talking
about? He's going to be
the key to everything.

23
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,620
Huh?

24
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:15,559
Kurosaki's fate depends
on whether he's able to
notice the difference
between what happened to

25
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:19,664
this guy, and what's
going to happen to our
next targets.

26
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:24,371
Think about it. It won't
be any fun if the game
is fixed so we can't
lose.

27
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,242
Hm.

28
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:28,544
All right, then...

29
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:30,780
Hurry up and
cut me.

30
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,621
Once this is finished,
you and I will appear to
have become enemies who
betrayed each other.

31
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:37,657
Hmm.

32
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,525
You're determined to do
this.

33
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:42,130
I guess I have no choice.

34
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,137
That's how we got here.

35
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,483
[struggling]

36
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:05,663
Like I said, 'Book of the
End' allows me to insert
my existence into a person's
past. But...

37
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,800
If I cut that person
again, they return to
normal.

38
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:20,817
As we laid out our plan,
I realized I would be the
one working closest to
you. So I had Tsukishima

39
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:24,156
slip his existence into
my past, as an enemy...

40
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,158
...So you'd believe I
was on your side.

41
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,760
[chuckling]

42
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:32,300
Correction, Ginjo. I cut
you because we both knew
you couldn't pull it
off on your own. After

43
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,603
all, you're such a
terrible actor.

44
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:39,544
Get out of here! My
acting has always been
extremely believable!

45
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:44,718
Well, you don't remember
your lines very well. You
referred to Ichigo as Kurosaki
right after I cut you.

46
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:46,152
[grunting]

47
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,826
So you're saying you cut
him.. before you cut any
of the others?

48
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:56,301
Well now.. You catch on
quickly.

49
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:58,470
Now I don't have to
explain as much.

50
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:04,712
After I cut Ginjo, I
slipped memories into the
other Xcution members,
as well. But I didn't make

51
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,349
them hate me as much as
Ginjo did.

52
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:12,423
It wasn't necessary. I
didn't have to worry
about the acting
abilities of the others

53
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,692
quite as much.

54
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:16,262
Shut up.

55
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:25,675
Did you hear that? Looks
like Kugo did it.

56
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,844
I believe you're right.

57
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:32,251
Everything we've done
to date has been designed
to get to this moment.

58
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:43,367
Yes, and it finally paid
off. I think we can
safely assume everything
has gone his way.

59
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,205
Yeah? So exactly what is
it we're supposed to do
now?

60
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:49,308
For now, we just have to
wait.

61
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:50,710
Huh?

62
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,449
That's right. Once Kugo
puts in the final
touches...

63
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:58,555
...Our mission will then
be complete.

64
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:12,608
Yeah, I thought as much...
In order to make sure this
plan worked out, you had a
lot to accomplish.

65
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:18,716
You had to change
Orihime, Chad, and
Ichigo's sister's memories
so you could corner him.

66
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:23,690
Interesting. You sound as
if you figured it all out
before you arrived here.

67
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:27,662
Except I didn't realize
Tsukishima had the power
to change people's pasts.

68
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:35,840
But... I realized something
was wrong, from the Spiritual
Pressure lingering around
everyone.

69
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:40,780
I just wasn't able to
identify who was
responsible. You each
took different actions to

70
00:07:40,814 --> 00:07:43,518
take down Ichigo, didn't
you?

71
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:49,660
You came to this conclusion
while you were immobilized?
I'm impressed, but you only
observed the end result.

72
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:51,195
What do you mean?

73
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:57,204
What you failed to
realize is that
Tsukishima and I have
been following the same

74
00:07:57,237 --> 00:07:59,908
plan to achieve a single
goal...

75
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,945
...Ever since the
beginning!

76
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:05,682
Hmmm.

77
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:11,256
So that's what you're
gonna do, okay?

78
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,763
No way! That... seems
like it's way over the
top, don't you think?

79
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:16,965
What?!

80
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,603
Why you little punk! Are
you refusing to take a
direct order?!

81
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:22,839
Take it easy,
Shishigawara.

82
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:26,177
We shouldn't force him to
do things, you know.

83
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:32,720
However.. there is
something you remember,
isn't there?

84
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:43,235
You do remember... that
once, in the past, I
saved your life.

85
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,377
[trembling]

86
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:04,465
It seems a single
incident wasn't enough to
convince him. In that
case...

87
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:15,681
Now then...

88
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:19,486
... time to move
on to the next stage.

89
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:45,990
The bottom line is.. I'm
not really interested in
what his reasons were for
trying to get our help.

90
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:51,731
...Whether he liked it or
not, we set this thing in
motion so he would team
up with us from the start.

91
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:08,388
[struggling]

92
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:12,894
Good, here it comes.

93
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:15,431
[struggling]

94
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,771
There... we go!

95
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:35,526
My Fullbring...
it's gone.

96
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:45,340
I wanted to regain my
power... But I couldn't
figure out a way to do
that on my own.

97
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,784
I just had to tolerate my
condition.. Powerless...
for seventeen months.

98
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,860
I thought I had finally
found a way...

99
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:07,838
I thought I could finally
protect everyone, with my
own hands.

100
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,311
But now...

101
00:11:12,344 --> 00:11:14,414
... it's all gone.

102
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:26,465
[exhaling]

103
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:43,454
[crying and screaming]

104
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,964
He's gotten very
emotional. I almost feel
sorry.

105
00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:56,507
Just let him cry. We have
no use for him anymore.
And to be perfectly
honest...

106
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,277
...We probably won't see
him again.

107
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:10,660
[quietly crying]

108
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:38,766
Is that it?

109
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,406
Am I finished? Completely
useless?

110
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:49,447
[gasping]

111
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:26,599
Give it back!

112
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:33,876
My power... Give it back
to me, Ginjo.

113
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:36,346
What are you babbling
about?

114
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:42,856
The only reason you got
your power back at all
was because of me. Now I'm
through giving you things.

115
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:48,830
And even though I'm done
with you, I'm not gonna kill
you. All things considered,
you should be thanking me.

116
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,673
I said, give it back.

117
00:13:54,906 --> 00:13:58,611
And if I choose not to,
what are you going to do
about it?

118
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:01,883
I don't know yet... But I
promise...

119
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,354
...I have no intention of
giving up 'till it's
returned!

120
00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:08,024
What the hell?

121
00:14:08,058 --> 00:14:10,895
I'll say it again.

122
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:13,398
Give it back!

123
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:17,538
Give me back my power!
Right now...!

124
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:20,909
Ginjo!

125
00:14:34,762 --> 00:14:36,898
[struggling]

126
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:40,636
Dad? Kisuke?

127
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:43,975
No.

128
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:49,516
So that's it, then? He
played with your
memories and
changed you, too?!

129
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,893
You idiot. I'm not
holding the sword. Look
behind you.

130
00:14:56,926 --> 00:15:00,030
Open your mind, and
you'll see.

131
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:01,733
[gasping]

132
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,904
You should be able to see
who it is, now.

133
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,840
[gasping]

134
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:23,631
Rukia!

135
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:24,698
Heh.

136
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:35,815
[small gasps]

137
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,416
Heh.

138
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:55,776
[grunting]

139
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:12,099
No way! Impossible!

140
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,107
Rukia...

141
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:19,543
Hi...

142
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:22,447
It's been a while,
hasn't it? Ichigo?

143
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:30,591
You've become strong and
mature.. since the last
time I saw you.

144
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,160
In your dreams!

145
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:34,129
[comically spinning]

146
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:39,504
Here you are, crying like
a pathetic fool! You turned
into a wimp the minute I
took my eyes off of you!

147
00:16:39,537 --> 00:16:41,439
You're pitiful, Ichigo!

148
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:44,043
[panting]

149
00:16:44,077 --> 00:16:50,619
Kisuke told me all about
Tsukishima and his power.
Apparently, he can write
over the past.

150
00:16:50,653 --> 00:16:52,555
That's pretty
terrifying.

151
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:54,859
[grunting]

152
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,728
But so what if he can?!

153
00:16:56,728 --> 00:17:01,669
You still have power!
Even if he's able to
change your past, he
can't change your future!

154
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:06,609
The damage may be
effective in the short
run, but lost bonds can
be forged again! Am I

155
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:08,644
right, Ichigo?!

156
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:13,852
Rukia. There's
something you should
know.

157
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,958
He didn't change my past,
despite what you heard.

158
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:21,830
Why are you always so
nitpicky, you jerk!

159
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:26,971
Man, what is your
problem?! I was only
trying to explain things,
and you're trying to kill me!

160
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,008
Don't be ridiculous!
This blade can't cut
people!

161
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:34,681
Now that you mention
it, what exactly is
that sword?

162
00:17:34,715 --> 00:17:39,555
This is a special sword
that Kisuke prepared
specifically for you,
Ichigo.

163
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:45,629
Thanks to this, I was
able to give you Soul
Reaper powers once again.
It's extremely effective.

164
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,632
Heh!

165
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:53,141
Oh please, that's
completely absurd. So his
appearance is now like a
Soul Reaper, but that

166
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:55,745
doesn't mean his powers
are back.

167
00:17:56,879 --> 00:18:02,920
The transfer of Soul
Reaper powers worked in the
past because Kurosaki already
had those powers in him.

168
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:07,427
But that's all changed
now. Those powers no
longer exist!

169
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,566
That's because I was able
to reach in and remove
them!

170
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:17,007
Believe me, there's
nothing left in this boy.
And there's no way your
Spirit Energy alone will

171
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,177
be enough to bring
his powers back.

172
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:21,080
It's a waste of your
time!

173
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:24,017
Shut up, dumbass!

174
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:27,723
What makes you think
she's acting alone?!

175
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,097
[gasping]

176
00:18:57,898 --> 00:18:59,433
Renji!

177
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:06,510
Byakuya!

178
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,515
Toshiro!

179
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,219
Kenpachi! Ikkaku!

180
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:16,959
Listen carefully! We put
all of our Spirit Energy
into that sword!

181
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:21,564
That's more than enough
to restore Ichigo's Soul
Reaper powers!

182
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:25,070
Ginjo, was it?

183
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,039
Uh!

184
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:30,911
When you attacked Ichigo,
you were only able to
steal the top layer of
his power, the part that

185
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:33,081
had been fused with his
Fullbring.

186
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:40,191
The power within Ichigo
is another story. It's not
something you could ever
take or have access to!

187
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,761
Heh.

188
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,899
Ichigo!

189
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:49,938
These guys don't know
you like I do! They think
they were able to fill
you with despair. But

190
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:54,678
it's gonna take more than
this to make you give up.
They don't know the kinds
of hopeless situations

191
00:19:54,678 --> 00:19:56,581
you've overcome in the
past!

192
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:04,091
Show them, Ichigo! Show
them that despair, no
matter how deep, will never
be enough to stop you!

193
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:06,495
Right!

194
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:09,499
Yeah, yeah...

195
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:15,207
I'm very impressed! But
things aren't gonna be
that easy!

196
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:19,246
[grunting]

197
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:33,967
[fighting]

198
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:36,804
His Spirit Energy
has increased, as well!

199
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:41,577
[fighting]

200
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:53,227
[fighting and grunting]

201
00:20:53,227 --> 00:20:59,602
Okay, I admit, you are a
bit stronger now, but not
as strong as you were before.
You can be defeated.

202
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:04,276
[grunting]

203
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:16,826
Ha! Your Getsugatensho
is much more powerful,
but is that all you've
got?!

204
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:21,967
Because the bottom line
is... That isn't going to
be enough to kill me,
Kurosaki!

205
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,836
You've got it all wrong.

206
00:21:24,771 --> 00:21:28,076
That wasn't a
Getsugatensho at all.

207
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:30,212
Just a strike.

208
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:34,151
[inhaling]

209
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:40,260
What's happening?!

210
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,264
What the hell is this
Spirit Energy?!

211
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:47,503
Getsuga... tensho!!!

212
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:49,708
Ichigo, allow me to tell
you what I've been doing
for the past few months.

213
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:51,344
Uh, no thanks.

214
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:55,321
Come on, aren't you a
little curious as to why
I'm wearing a Lieutenant's
badge on my uniform?

215
00:23:55,355 --> 00:23:56,923
Well now that you mention
it...

216
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:59,792
I've drawn some pictures.
They should explain
everything that's been
going on!

217
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:00,693
Forget it.
