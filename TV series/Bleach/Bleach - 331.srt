1
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:01,647
[struggling breaths]

2
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:04,587
Leave him alone!

3
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:06,158
Huhh?

4
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,766
I also... want to protect.

5
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:13,375
I want to fight too!
For everyone's sake!

6
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,145
I can't just watch!

7
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:16,816
Huh?

8
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:18,452
What's this?!

9
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:20,825
[roar]

10
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,958
[roar]

11
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:39,268
Haaaa!

12
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:41,607
Haah!

13
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:48,923
There you are.

14
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,928
I was wondering where
you'd gone off to.

15
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:53,634
Don't know if you're
hungry yet, but
dinner's almost ready.

16
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:56,474
What's the matter?

17
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:58,746
Nothing important.

18
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,819
But while I'm thinking about
it, it would be nice if you
knocked before you came in.

19
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:04,660
Oh. Sorry about that.

20
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:08,735
Hey! Wait a minute,
it's my room, you know!

21
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,005
Are you coming
or what?

22
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,845
D'agh! Listen,
this isn't a hotel!

23
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:22,367
Do you have
a minute?

24
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,309
Why, of course,
Captain Kuchiki.

25
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,813
What is it you're doing?

26
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:35,330
Well, I'm still working on
repairing the invading forces
whose cores were destroyed
from the last battle.

27
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:37,335
It won't be
long now.

28
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:39,574
How are you doing, personally?

29
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:42,948
Not so bad, as you
can see for yourself.

30
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,819
Then we may proceed?

31
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,423
Yes.

32
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:51,300
Inform Captains Zaraki,
Hitsugaya, and Komamura.

33
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,413
It's now time for us
to re-enter the World
of the Living.

34
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,567
According to Captain Unohana,
who escaped from the Soul
Society,

35
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,643
the Reigai are intensely
dangerous, now that their
powers are not restricted.

36
00:04:09,976 --> 00:04:13,652
Even the Head Captain's
wounds will take time
to heal completely.

37
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,995
The situation, she says,
is critical.

38
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,534
At least we know what
the enemy is after.

39
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:23,475
We must hide Nozomi
Kujo immediately.

40
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:26,482
And in the meantime,
we have to come up
with counter-measures.

41
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:28,018
What kind of
counter-measures?

42
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,894
It's so upsetting.
Do you think the
other Captains
are really dead?

43
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,534
Don't be ridiculous!

44
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,536
Huh?

45
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,977
Don't you have any faith?
Captain Zaraki would
never die that easily!

46
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:41,550
But if they're alive,
then where are they?

47
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,822
Stop whining!
Or I'll kill you!

48
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:45,425
I'm not hiding!
I'm gonna fight!

49
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:46,594
[gasps from all]

50
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:50,905
Nozomi...

51
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:53,878
Just a minute, young lady!
Don't get carried away!

52
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:57,787
Just because you got your
Zanpakuto back, doesn't make
you a match for these guys!

53
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:03,634
[Nozomi]
Kageroza's Zanpakuto has the
power to cut time and space,
and restore it at will.

54
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:08,378
But I'm not worried about that.
My Zanpakuto can counter his.

55
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:11,786
...At least I think so.

56
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:14,726
You don't seem
all that confident
about it.

57
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,664
What can you do
with your power?

58
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:20,406
I'm not sure just yet,
because I can't
remember everything.

59
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:22,645
But I still know
it'll be effective!

60
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:24,917
Hah! And we're
supposed to
trust that?

61
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,522
Maybe you'll be effective,
and maybe not.

62
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:29,527
You're not completely
sure yourself!

63
00:05:29,694 --> 00:05:32,835
I'm not willing to risk my
life on your faulty memory!

64
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:38,447
Why are we basing our
whole strategy on
protecting this girl?

65
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:40,887
We should fight the enemy
head-on and defeat them!

66
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,424
It's as simple as that.

67
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:43,726
Where are
you going?

68
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:46,433
I don't see any point
in further discussion!

69
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:52,179
He's never been much
of a team player.

70
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:55,654
Regardless, what are we gonna
do, I mean about the girl?

71
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,959
Nozomi, listen.

72
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:01,702
Since you're the enemy's
target, and you don't know
what your powers are,

73
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:04,140
we really can't
allow you to fight,
do you understand?

74
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,612
But I can help you
defeat them, I know it!

75
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:09,186
Its name is on the edge
of my consciousness!

76
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:10,989
I'm so close to
remembering
what it is!

77
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:14,998
[Ichigo]
Nozomi, with everything at
stake, you can't expect us
to believe your story.

78
00:06:18,072 --> 00:06:21,012
But if your power's dormant,
Let's awaken it.

79
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:38,520
Huh?

80
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:42,930
Got 'em, boss.

81
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:46,939
Good. It looks to me like
our trap was effective.

82
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,944
Shall we proceed
with our next step?

83
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:50,714
Go right ahead.

84
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:54,790
Obviously, we can't expect any
support from the Soul Society.

85
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:58,900
As a result, we have no choice
but to freeze the space
ourselves.

86
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,941
I'm tellin' you, it's
going to be a huge job.

87
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:08,756
So that little trick was
Kisuke Urahara's doing.

88
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:12,130
Well played.
[chuckles]

89
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:17,710
So he managed to scatter
my Invading Forces into
separate locations.

90
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:21,085
But this contrivance
isn't going to buy
them much time.

91
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:23,790
Yaaaaah!

92
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:29,871
Huaaah!

93
00:07:31,943 --> 00:07:34,015
That won't do it! I need more!

94
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:34,983
Yaah!

95
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:36,855
Agh!

96
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:38,324
Come on, Nozomi!

97
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,131
This training is
going too far!
It's dangerous!

98
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:43,002
Just keep out of
this, pervert.

99
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:46,076
It's the only way to
re-awaken my Zanpakuto.

100
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:47,613
Whatever's
necessary.

101
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:49,283
Your body can't take
the punishment!

102
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:50,252
Shut up!

103
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:50,987
Agh!

104
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:52,857
Huaah!

105
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:03,015
This is how Kisuke helped
me awaken my power.

106
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,986
I know it'll work for her too!

107
00:08:20,054 --> 00:08:20,889
[gasp]

108
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:27,772
Huh?

109
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:28,875
[amazed]
Oh!

110
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:34,754
Did she just?

111
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:37,294
...suck away Chad's
Spirit Energy?

112
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:39,900
It's working!

113
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:41,905
Who's next?

114
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,040
Me!

115
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:08,800
Any progress
to report?

116
00:09:09,702 --> 00:09:11,807
Ikkaku, what's the matter?

117
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:18,088
Are you worried?

118
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:19,491
Yeah, right.

119
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,799
[Ikkaku]
All this means nothing.

120
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,073
What I'm concerned about
is when the Reigai will
be showing up.

121
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:32,020
[panting]

122
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:33,456
Let's take
a break.

123
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:35,195
I don't
need one.

124
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:36,932
Don't rush,
Nozomi!

125
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:40,306
Believe me, you're going
to fail if you try to do
everything at once!

126
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,281
That's right! You
tell her, Orihime!

127
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:49,026
Nozomi, have some of
Orihime's special sports drink
and try to relax a little.

128
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:51,198
It might help you
recall things.

129
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:51,932
I don't want any!

130
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:52,768
Baah!

131
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:54,505
Where are
you going?

132
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,846
To go wash my face.

133
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,051
No sense in rushing
things, right?

134
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:09,406
You really think this
exercise is going to
help you remember?

135
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:10,843
Uh?

136
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,179
You might as well stop.

137
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:14,818
You're just gonna
hurt yourself if
you keep this up.

138
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:16,790
You're wrong.
I'm right on
the verge--

139
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:18,260
On the verge of what?

140
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:20,432
I'll concede
you've got some
sort of power.

141
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:24,474
But that's no guarantee
you'll be able to
survive in a real fight.

142
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:25,243
[light gasp]

143
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:30,087
Even if you regain the
power to fight, it'll only
lead you to your death.

144
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,027
When I first
came here...

145
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:35,801
I intended to die.

146
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,803
Hm?

147
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,509
Instead, I was
told to live.

148
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:42,483
Since then, I've tried to
take those words to heart.

149
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:46,325
So this time, it's my turn
to help everyone else live.

150
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,434
To accomplish that,
I'm ready to die
fighting.

151
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:51,604
[gasp]

152
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,188
[Ikkaku] [flashback]
I have a dream as well;
To fight and die as
Zaraki's subordinate.

153
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:00,457
End of discussion.

154
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:04,968
You're a fool.

155
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:08,242
I don't give a damn
about your problems.

156
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,882
But you won't be
protecting anyone
if you're dead.

157
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:14,022
If you want to live,
you'll have to learn
how to strike back.

158
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,306
You ready?

159
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:22,976
Bring it!

160
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,282
[rumble]

161
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:27,620
What is this
Spiritual Pressure?

162
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:30,561
[gasp]

163
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:32,531
Renji!

164
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,436
The enemy's attacking.

165
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,913
A few of Kageroza's Reigai
got caught in the trap Kisuke
set in the Precipice World.

166
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,182
You're serious?!

167
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,927
But we're not ready!
Nozomi still hasn't
regained her Shikai.

168
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,936
Then we have to get
her someplace safe,
and quickly!

169
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,440
Let's continue, Ichigo.

170
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:53,279
Hold on! Don't you
understand what's
happening here?!

171
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,954
If the Reigai are
coming here, there's no
safe place to hide me.

172
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:00,329
I need to power up as
quickly as possible.

173
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:03,336
Yeah. I think
Nozomi's right.

174
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:04,973
You sure about that?

175
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:12,691
Mmm...

176
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:14,495
Well fine, then.

177
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:17,937
If that's how you
feel I guess I'd
better lend a hand.

178
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,473
Thanks, buddy.

179
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,380
No time to waste talking.
We'd better get started.

180
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:23,984
Right!

181
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:41,190
Well well. Looks like
I'm the first one here.

182
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:43,629
Hm?

183
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,467
Haaaiii!

184
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,399
So does this mean
you're my opponent?

185
00:12:59,432 --> 00:13:00,669
That's right, pal.

186
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:04,076
I have no intention of going
along with the others.

187
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:07,685
When an enemy shows up,
I fight to win!

188
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:15,436
[gasp]

189
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:17,039
Now what's happening?

190
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:19,311
That's Ikkaku's
Spiritual Pressure!

191
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:22,185
What's he up to?
Is he fighting one
of those Reigai?

192
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:23,421
We've gotta help him!

193
00:13:23,421 --> 00:13:25,025
[Yumichika]
Don't do it, Ichigo.

194
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:28,265
If you interfere,
you're only going to
undermine his efforts.

195
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:29,669
Don't you get it?

196
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:31,807
He's out there, trying
to buy us some time...

197
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:34,179
to help that girl.

198
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:39,725
Heh.

199
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:42,164
Ikkaku!

200
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:45,739
We'll all take
him out together.

201
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:49,280
Keep out of this!
It's my fight,
and mine alone!

202
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:50,850
Are you gonna pull
that crap again?

203
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,762
Besides, you guys are
gonna be busy fighting
your own opponents.

204
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:57,132
What do you mean?

205
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:58,702
[gasp]

206
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:08,357
He's sent more Reigai!

207
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,095
Damn it all!

208
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:14,171
I'll handle this one.
You guys take care of
the rest.

209
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:17,278
Guess we have no choice.
Don't die, Ikkaku!

210
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:19,383
Heh!

211
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,187
Sorry for the wait.

212
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:23,326
Now that there's
no one in our way,

213
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,764
let's have it out once
and for all, you and me!

214
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,803
Fine, but it's futile.

215
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:29,340
You can't beat me!

216
00:14:39,563 --> 00:14:42,403
Hey! You took that very well!

217
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:44,173
Shut up!

218
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:46,412
Extend, Hozukimaru!

219
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:51,291
Haiiyayaa!

220
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,170
Is that all you've got?

221
00:14:58,173 --> 00:15:00,412
Auugh!

222
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:09,298
[gasp]

223
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,337
Raagh!

224
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,446
Ah!

225
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,453
Nozomi! No!

226
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,627
Are you all right?!
You look like you're hurt!
You need a break!

227
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,400
Just shut up!
Ichigo, keep going!

228
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:25,703
As you wish!

229
00:15:25,903 --> 00:15:27,707
Heeeaah!

230
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:42,842
Aah!

231
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:47,754
One more time!

232
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:48,890
Fine!

233
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,925
Hey!

234
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:50,694
Huh?

235
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:53,500
Tell me something.
How long are you gonna
keep up this farce?

236
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:56,774
Come on, this is a waste
of effort on your part.

237
00:15:56,774 --> 00:15:59,681
You need to hit her with
some serious Spirit Energy.

238
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:01,453
What are you
talking about?

239
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:11,609
Hmpf! As usual,
you're nothing
but talk.

240
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:14,649
We're done here.
Time to grab that girl.

241
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:16,420
Hm?

242
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:23,537
Is this some
kind of joke?

243
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,677
Heh heh.
It's not
over yet.

244
00:16:28,414 --> 00:16:29,283
Hmpf!

245
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:31,822
Augh!

246
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,796
This is
becoming
boring.

247
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:36,567
You might as well
accept it, kid.

248
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:38,538
I'm telling you,
you're no match
for me.

249
00:16:40,743 --> 00:16:45,688
Don't be so sure about that.
You can decide better,
after you see this.

250
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:51,501
Huh?

251
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:56,913
What do you mean exactly?

252
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:58,852
Just what I said.

253
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:03,796
You both say you're going
all out but the truth is
you're holding back
without realizing it.

254
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:05,868
At this point, you're
spinning your wheels.

255
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:08,406
The girl's Zanpakuto
will never wake up.

256
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:15,389
You'll have to throw
a Spirit Energy attack
powerful enough to kill her.

257
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:15,957
(Small CT nervous breath)

258
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:17,327
Stop the attack,
and you live.

259
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:20,969
Fail, and you die.
It's as simple as that.

260
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:27,617
All right, then.
Let's do this!

261
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:28,386
[gasps]

262
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,524
Hey! Now hold on!

263
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:33,097
This is way over the top!
Have you lost your mind?!

264
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:34,500
Whatever it takes!

265
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,038
But why Nozomi?

266
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,843
Ichigo! Come on,
say something to her!

267
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:42,519
You're sure you want to do this?

268
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:43,956
Whaaaa?

269
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:47,063
Yeah. I am sure.

270
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,105
This'll be... your last chance.

271
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,377
Bankai!!

272
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:07,677
Eh?

273
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:10,650
Ryumon Hozukimaru!

274
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:14,559
This one's just for you,
my friend!

275
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,874
Oh? If you're so sure
you've got the goods,

276
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:22,779
then let's go ahead
and mix it up!

277
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:24,682
Hyaah!

278
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:39,451
Ha ha ha ha! All right,
now we're having fun!

279
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:42,223
I don't think you'll be
laughing in a few minutes!

280
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,593
Oh really?

281
00:18:45,464 --> 00:18:49,474
This particular Zanpakuto
only awakens during a battle!

282
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,576
Huh?

283
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:54,752
Here we go!

284
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:58,661
Huaah!

285
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,679
Raagh!

286
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:21,915
Bankai!

287
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:31,771
[Ichigo]
Damn it!

288
00:19:33,776 --> 00:19:37,050
Yaaaah!

289
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:41,860
Haaaaaa!

290
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:46,872
Heh.

291
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:49,144
Raaagh!

292
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,153
Getsuga...tensho!

293
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:05,548
I don't give a damn
about your problems.

294
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:08,022
But you won't be
protecting anyone
if you're dead.

295
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:11,195
If you want to live,
then you have to learn
how to strike back.

296
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,839
Gotta strike back...

297
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,345
[gasp]

298
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:23,891
That's it! I remember now!
My Zanpakuto's name!

299
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:26,998

00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:41,198
Nozomi!

303
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:48,682
Nozomi!

304
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:53,894
[panting]

305
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,335
Are you finished?

306
00:20:59,707 --> 00:21:00,643
Damn it!

307
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:09,329
Hmpf! I did enjoy that a bit.

308
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,347
But now, it's over!

309
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:17,916
[Nozomi]
Stop!

310
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:18,717
[gasp]

311
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,765
Huh?

312
00:21:25,935 --> 00:21:29,342
Well, well! Did you come all
this way, just to be captured?

313
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,214
In your dreams, Reigai!

314
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,900
Rain down,
Arazomeshigure!

315
00:21:40,435 --> 00:21:41,905
Interesting!

316
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:43,909
Haa!

317
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:48,386
Engh!

318
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:00,949
Heh! Now that was
pretty awesome!
