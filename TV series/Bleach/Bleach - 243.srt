1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,833
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,333
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:22,733
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:29,066
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,166
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:17,834
What the hell is this?!

7
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:19,001
<i>Don't move!</i>

8
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:22,334
We are here to take you
into custody.

9
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,001
Bankai!

10
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:33,334
Getsugatensho!

11
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:42,301
We don't wanna give you
the impression that we
have nothing left.

12
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:57,034
Hado number thirty-one!
Shakkaho!

13
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:13,634
I am the Third Seat of
Zaraki's Squad!

14
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:18,334
Ikkaku Madarame!

15
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:29,434
Lieutenant Iba!

16
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:32,367
Oh, Lieutenant Kotetsu.

17
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:34,267
What's the situation?

18
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:38,167
Captain Soi Fon and the
others are fighting at
the Squad Six barracks.

19
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:42,334
We've gotten reports
that the Stealth Force
has the enemy surrounded
and is preventing them

20
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,067
from escaping.

21
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:48,134
I see. Then I suppose
we should hurry to their
position and give them
some backup.

22
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:52,501
I agree. Apparently,
there are many fighters
who have been wounded already.

23
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,601
What the--? What's wrong?

24
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,834
Over there!

25
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,301
What the hell is that?

26
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:10,034
My guess is it's
Ashisogijizo.

27
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,334
How can you tell?

28
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:16,067
Look at it.

29
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:21,001
I've never seen
anything like it.

30
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:27,367
<i>Hey, is it</i>
<i>talking to us?</i>

31
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,734
Well, no matter how weird
it looks, we've got a
Zanpakuto here.

32
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,434
Let's capture it!

33
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,101
Not just yet!

34
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:38,701
I think that's
poison!

35
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:42,434
What?! Come on! You
gotta get outta here!

36
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:45,401
Hado Number One!...Sho!

37
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:57,634
We better go inform
Captain Kurosuchi
immediately!

38
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:58,534
Right!

39
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,567
I'm not letting
you do that!

40
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,401
Who are you!?

41
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:23,267
Great, now it's
raining.

42
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:30,167
Thunder and lightning are my
allies. It is in this rain that
I can display the special powers
that make me truly great!

43
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:34,767
What is so funny?!

44
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:39,134
Correct me if I'm
wrong, but your friend
there. Isn't that Tenken?

45
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:44,134
I wouldn't think it's
a good thing to let him
get wet.

46
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:47,901
Well don't worry!...

47
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:53,167
Even a torrential rain
would have no chance of
extinguishing Tenken's
flames of hell.

48
00:05:55,934 --> 00:06:01,234
I'm not convinced.
The way you just said that
makes me think you're not
too confident either.

49
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:02,334
What?!

50
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,767
What Tenken? I see.

51
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:12,167
You're saying that
these rain clouds are
nothing more than a means
to reinforce my technique.

52
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:17,434
And that even if this
rain itself appears to be
weak, I have nothing to
worry about, right?

53
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:25,301
I, Gonryomaru, feel
unworthy Tenken, I
allowed myself to be
tricked by her flawed

54
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,834
logic. I am
ashamed.

55
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:33,367
So how do you communicate
with that fire breather? Do you
have some sort of code like
maybe smoke signals?

56
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:35,101
Silence!

57
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:38,901
Tenken usually keeps to
himself and can be shy
and reserved!

58
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,534
You are very weak...

59
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:46,567
Are you sure you're a
captain-level Zanpakuto?

60
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:51,134
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! You will
not belittle us!

61
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:56,601
Feel my wrath!

62
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:00,901
So then, is that the
extent of your power?

63
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,401
You want power!??

64
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,267
You're done!

65
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:45,701
How'd she..?!

66
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:02,067
<i>So. Looks like you do</i>
<i>have some power.</i>

67
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:06,434
This isn't going to be
easy.

68
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:09,701
Gotcha!

69
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:17,367
Aw that was close!

70
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:20,267
I was sure I would get
the second strike in!

71
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:26,167
So tell me, was that the
first time you were struck
by your own technique!

72
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:29,234
Yay!

73
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:32,101
Are you... Suzumebachi?!

74
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:36,634
Ding ding ding! Right!
You are correct!

75
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:43,934
So how do you like my
look? I didn't like your
lame style, so I really
went for it!

76
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:51,367
I've always said to myself if
I ever got free, I would create
my own fashion statement to look
awesomely sharp!

77
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:55,101
I'm really glad I was
able to manifest myself
the way I wanted to.

78
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:59,534
What? Do you have a
problem with that?

79
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:05,367
You always waste your
free time doing something I'd
never do! You worship Yoruichi!
That's so dumb!

80
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:11,767
You should use that time to pay
more attention to yourself! You
need a change! Go find yourself
a real man!

81
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:16,934
What the hell? You're
really my Zanpakuto?

82
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:19,667
So you don't
believe that?!

83
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:22,767
Maybe another strike
with this will convince
you.

84
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:39,367
You sure talk a big
game...

85
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:41,834
You're kind of a
weakling, you know?

86
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:45,501
You're so irritating!

87
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:52,601
Damn you!

88
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,234
You look awful mad.

89
00:09:58,267 --> 00:09:59,601
You.

90
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,201
I will... never
forgive you!

91
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:08,501
Oh well, I didn't
expect you to.

92
00:10:09,134 --> 00:10:12,401
Come on. Why don't you
go ahead and give up?

93
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:17,001
At least if you gave up
now, I'd still be
willing to let you
live.

94
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:20,201
I'm never giving up to
you!

95
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:25,467
Listen.

96
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,401
Notice that Spiritual
Pressure?

97
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:33,301
Earlier, Ikkaku's
Spiritual Pressure just
disappeared, didn't it?

98
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,101
Ikkaku.

99
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:44,167
You people have no chance
to win against us with
the level of your
abilities.

100
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:50,834
Ikkaku did not lose!
Hozukimaru's Spiritual
Pressure disappeared as
well!

101
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:57,734
Hmph! I suspect that
Hozukimaru tailored his
power to match Ikkaku's
fighting level. As you

102
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:01,334
know, those two are quite
alike...

103
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,434
But you and I are
different.

104
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:09,867
You always try to hide my
true nature. I'm proud
to display my power
anywhere.

105
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:12,034
No! Don't!

106
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,267
I will!

107
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:17,167
Tear in Frenzy.

108
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:35,901
Well?

109
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:39,567
How does it feel to be
struck by the power that
you loathe?

110
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:48,134
I don't want everyone
to know about this power.

111
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:51,834
I wouldn't be able to
stay in Squad Eleven.

112
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:56,101
Are you still saying
that? Why're you so
stubborn?

113
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:08,401
Must stay in Squad
Eleven.

114
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:09,934
Again with that!?

115
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,301
Shut up, Fujikujaku!

116
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,167
I see.

117
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:25,334
<i>[screaming]</i>

118
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:43,390
Sorry!

119
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:46,090
<i>And what was that about?!</i>

120
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:50,890
That woman down there is
your target! It's your
job to keep her in check!

121
00:12:51,157 --> 00:12:54,490
Well I don't see why
I'm the one who has to
back you up!

122
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,090
'Cause that's how it works!
We lost last time because you
didn't hold up your end!

123
00:13:03,357 --> 00:13:05,324
Oh, is that right?

124
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,357
As I recall---

125
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,190
What are those
two doing?

126
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:09,524
Weird.

127
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:13,490
Whatever. Let's
move out while we can.

128
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:18,224
<i>Hey!-Stop!</i>

129
00:13:22,624 --> 00:13:24,024
You are not getting away!

130
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:26,824
And you over there! Show
yourself!

131
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:31,790
Oh-no!

132
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:35,690
Hado 31. Shakkaho!

133
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:44,690
Damn!

134
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,524
Isane-Are you okay?

135
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:56,090
No you don't!

136
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:04,357
My legs! I
can't move!

137
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:10,890
I see. Don't tell me
you don't know about
the power of Ashisogijizo?

138
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:15,890
Ashisogijizo deprives its
victims of the ability to
move their limbs.

139
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,224
You were struck by its
attack and now you've
lost the use of your legs.

140
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:24,624
You're like a little
bird who has had its
wings clipped.

141
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:43,724
Uh! Where--? It's you!

142
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:46,490
You shouldn't strain
yourself.

143
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:52,357
You need to get some more
rest. The ordeal you went
through to get me back
almost killed you.

144
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,390
So what happens now?

145
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:01,424
Muramasa and the rebels
staged an all-out attack.
The Soul Reapers are out
there battling them now.

146
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:06,090
I see. Then I can't stay
here in bed any longer.

147
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:11,024
Have faith.

148
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,024
Your friends are strong.
They will not go down
so easily.

149
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:21,924
You showed me that
strength when you
reclaimed me, Master.

150
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,824
Stand aside!

151
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,324
It's no use, guy!

152
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,357
Lieutenant Hinamori!

153
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:41,290
Are you okay,
Isane?

154
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,090
What are you
doing up there?!

155
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:47,390
Hi!

156
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:48,624
Not you again!

157
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,290
<i>You're both in trouble!</i>

158
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:55,057
You two should talk
This time we're not
letting you get away!

159
00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:01,257
Hmph! That's what I was
going to say. Last time you
just got lucky! You caught
us with our guard down!

160
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,757
<i>You old lady!</i>

161
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,957
I'll knock that rudeness
right out of you!

162
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,157
Behind you!

163
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:14,390
Let's get
out of here!

164
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:21,457
Who's on the run now,
old lady?

165
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:35,624
Renji!

166
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:39,990
Byakuya!

167
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:41,724
Please make all this
stop!

168
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:48,657
Damn it!

169
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,457
Ikkaku's Spiritual
Pressure disappeared.
Yumichika's in danger
as well.

170
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:57,190
Getsugatensho!

171
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:22,157
Bakudo Thirty Nine!
Enkosen!

172
00:17:26,257 --> 00:17:29,057
Damn! You've got
good reflexes!

173
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,890
But no matter how hard
you can fight, you
yourself can't change
where this battle's

174
00:17:33,924 --> 00:17:39,224
taking place. And I
know you can feel the
Spiritual Pressure
that's all around you!

175
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,857
You sense we're
overwhelming you.

176
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:51,524
I'm getting sick of
looking at that glare of
yours! I think I'll need
to gauge your eyes out!

177
00:17:52,857 --> 00:17:57,590
Here's a thought...
You think its good to
keep making so many
direct attacks?

178
00:17:57,957 --> 00:18:00,390
What? What do you mean?

179
00:18:00,424 --> 00:18:05,890
Well... If anyone should
know the power of my
Zanpakuto, that someone
should be you, right?

180
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:07,790
What about it?

181
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:13,524
Wait-You're not saying
you regained your Shikai,
are you?!

182
00:18:18,324 --> 00:18:20,757
Answer me! Right now, you
coward!

183
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,124
You can't really expect
me to answer that question.

184
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,290
Something must be wrong
with you.

185
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:34,290
Now that I think of it,
when we were fighting,
this guy did nothing but
fend off my attacks. He

186
00:18:34,324 --> 00:18:36,324
hasn't tried to attack
me once.

187
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:42,890
But... Why would he go
through all that tedious
stuff when he could've
just used his Shikai?

188
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:44,590
He's bluffing!

189
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:56,124
<i>What's the matter?</i>

190
00:18:56,157 --> 00:18:57,590
Shut up!

191
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:01,724
He dodged it again!

192
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:03,090
What?!
Over here.

193
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:11,424
You can't use your
Shikai!

194
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:16,090
Even if he somehow
miraculously did regain
his powers, I will
shred him to pieces

195
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:18,790
before he's able to use
that Shikai!

196
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:30,890
Hado Fifty Eight!
Tenran!

197
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:03,390
Allow me to put your mind
at ease.

198
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:07,657
I have not regained my
Shikai yet.

199
00:20:07,924 --> 00:20:13,557
But you were destined to
lose the moment you let
yourself get caught in
your maze of self-doubt.

200
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,324
I knew it!

201
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,224
Bakudo Sixty
Three. Sajosabaku.

202
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:30,290
All right. I'd better
get going to help out the
others.

203
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,824
Your back is wide open to
attack.

204
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,224
Wabisuke!

205
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:49,357
Damn it!

206
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,890
You're finished.

207
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:26,324
Izuru!

208
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:29,057
What are you looking at?

209
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,757
Out of my way!

210
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:37,557
Outta my way!

211
00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:51,338
Aren't Shunsui and
Jushiro joining us in
battle?

212
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:53,438
<i>Uh, actually,</i>
<i>they're--</i>

213
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:58,705
I see! They're
commanding things from
the barracks! So this pinch
we're in is part of the plan!

214
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:01,605
<i>Uh, yes, you're right!</i>
<i>I forgot to tell them.</i>
