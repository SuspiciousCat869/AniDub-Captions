1
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:08,766
Ahhhhhh!

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,266
All right, attack!

3
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,600
Gran Caida.

4
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,133
How's this?!

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,566
It's too flashy for
an assassin.

6
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:10,882
I will show you the
meaning of fear.

7
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:15,748
Rot...Arrogante.

8
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:38,182
[gasping]
What is that?

9
00:02:50,815 --> 00:02:54,815
Look at that, everything
he's touching is completely
rotting away!

10
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,515
As I told you earlier,
I govern Senescence

11
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:05,315
Everything around me
ages and dies.

12
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:11,548
Suffer the Dying
Breath.

13
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:13,448
Respira.

14
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:20,148
[gasping]

15
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:21,848
Ahh!

16
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:38,948
[screaming]

17
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:40,048
Marechiyo!

18
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:41,282
Marechiyo!

19
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:43,682
Cut off my arm right now!

20
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:44,815
But Captain--

21
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:47,882
Hurry up! Are you going
to let your Captain die?

22
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:52,015
Marechiyo!

23
00:03:57,082 --> 00:03:58,448
Damn it!

24
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:07,682
Hmph.

25
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:18,115
How amusing.

26
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:22,548
It seems that even Soul
Reapers are afraid of
death.

27
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:29,982
Are you all
right, Captain?

28
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:31,315
Back up, Marechiyo.

29
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:32,282
Huh?

30
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:37,915
He's a...
real monster.

31
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:43,248
I've faced my share of
tough opponents, but
nobody compares to
him. This guy's way

32
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:46,448
more terrifying and
dangerous than Aizen ever
was...

33
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:50,782
We can't get near him,
let alone touch him...

34
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,115
So how the hell are we
supposed to defeat a guy
when we can't even attack?!

35
00:04:56,982 --> 00:04:59,882
<i>But that's not the</i>
<i>biggest problem we've</i>
<i>got.</i>

36
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:04,815
He was able to take
Captain Soi Fon's arm.

37
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:09,815
That means... nobody in
the 13 Court Guard Squads
can evade his attacks.

38
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:13,348
Marechiyo.

39
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:15,748
Huh? Yes, ma'am?

40
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,882
Listen. Earlier you
were saying that it's
your duty to assist me.

41
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:21,448
Huh?

42
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:30,815
[grunting]

43
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:35,248
And even though you told
me to run, it's my duty
to assist you, Captain!

44
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:38,382
I, uh... guess
you're right.

45
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:43,215
But I said that because I
think both of us will need
to combine our efforts to
defeat this guy!

46
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:46,315
You're right.
So then...

47
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:49,382
... you attack
him alone.

48
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,382
Yes, ma'am, alone.

49
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:54,615
Huh? Wait... what'd
you just say?

50
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:57,848
Act as a decoy.
Draw him in.

51
00:05:57,882 --> 00:06:00,048
So, you mean
one on one?

52
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:01,948
I have an idea.

53
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:05,048
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, no! It's
impossible!

54
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:10,715
Me against him? That's
crazy talk! I said it
would take both of us to
bring this guy down!

55
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:12,682
Ha-ha-ha! You're
kidding-right?!

56
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:15,015
A minute ago you told me
to run away!!

57
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:17,782
Well...?

58
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:20,882
If you will not
attack, I will.

59
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,615
You see? You see
Captain?! Did you hear
what he just said?

60
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:25,882
What should I do?!

61
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:27,682
Just protect your right
arm...

62
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:31,648
You'll need to use it to
amputate anything that
begins to decay.

63
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,048
I'm counting on you.

64
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,015
Wait! Uh, Captain!??

65
00:06:35,048 --> 00:06:39,748
Wait a sec, Captain!!
Come back...

66
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,748
[groaning]

67
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,982
[chuckling]

68
00:06:58,015 --> 00:06:58,882
Cero.

69
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:02,982
Whoa!

70
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:10,182
I made my move, it's
your turn! Just know...

71
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:14,715
... that you won't fair
so well if you keep on
running away from me.
Got it?

72
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:27,715
You've seen my
Cero twice.

73
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:31,648
It's only fair you
return the favor and
show me a Bankai.

74
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:33,515
I don't know.

75
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:39,148
Do you see over there?
Your skull faced friend
has presented something
called a Resurreccion.

76
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:49,248
How about it? Why don't
you show me that and in
exchange, I'll give you
an appropriate response.

77
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:52,548
You're gonna hold
out... aren't you?

78
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:54,482
But I'm not the
only one!

79
00:07:57,015 --> 00:08:00,248
[grunting]

80
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,048
Ahhhh!

81
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:05,648
All right, attack!

82
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:10,148
[grunting]

83
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:11,848
Ahhhh!

84
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,148
Keep it coming!

85
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:17,515
[grunting]

86
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:22,248
[groaning]

87
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:26,115
[whining]
I'm gonna kill you!

88
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:28,348
Well said! That's the
spirit!

89
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,615
Gimme back my sword, ya
creep!

90
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:32,315
I can't do that!

91
00:08:32,348 --> 00:08:34,515
Ahhhhh!

92
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,582
<i>Die, ya gray-haired</i>
<i>geezer! Dry up and blow</i>
<i>away!</i>

93
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:39,115
Come on!-Put more Oomph
into it!

94
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:41,248
<i>[crying]</i>

95
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:46,082
What's wrong? You
worried about that
kid down there?

96
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:50,315
No, it's not that.

97
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:54,215
Don't worry. Jushiro
won't do anything to
hurt that kid.

98
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:57,382
You should be
concentrating on
our battle instead.

99
00:08:57,915 --> 00:08:59,948
I said, that's not it!

100
00:09:04,015 --> 00:09:06,282
I'm just not
getting this...

101
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:14,782
That kid down there is
your subordinate. She's
a Fraccion, right?

102
00:09:15,015 --> 00:09:18,582
Can't say I grasp what
their relationship is
with an Espada.

103
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:36,448
But I don't think
there's a difference
between you and I, when
it comes to the feelings

104
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:39,015
we have when your
subordinates are in
trouble.

105
00:09:39,748 --> 00:09:41,182
What do you mean?

106
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,182
It's just something
I realized...

107
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:48,582
Once you felt that kid
was in danger, I saw that
you couldn't keep your mind
focused.

108
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:52,882
Damn you! Give me back
my sword now!

109
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:56,282
So are you planning to
kill her first?

110
00:09:56,315 --> 00:10:00,648
No I'm not. I just
told you... Jushiro Would
never hurt her.

111
00:10:03,782 --> 00:10:04,548
Uh!

112
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:06,015
Ohh!

113
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:09,348
Not bad.

114
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:15,682
Cero!

115
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:30,582
Hmph! Are you capable of
mounting an attack alone?

116
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:36,282
I know one thing, I better
keep my distance from
this guy, or he'll turn
me to dust!

117
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:40,048
Ahhh! The way I see
it, this is crazy!

118
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:45,682
One-on-one against a guy
this powerful? What is the
Captain thinking leaving
me to handle this alone?!

119
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:49,415
[chuckling]
Try to make this a
challenge for me.

120
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:59,348
Shut up! Stupid skull
head. I'll show you a
thing or two.

121
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:01,415
Except I've got nothing
to show him!

122
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:15,748
Ahhh! Screw it!
Well, here I go!

123
00:11:15,782 --> 00:11:19,048
Smash 'em, Gegetsuburi!

124
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:27,215
From your actions it
appears you wish for your
Zanpakuto to rot away as
well.

125
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:35,215
Ahhhh!

126
00:11:35,248 --> 00:11:40,982
Wait! Time out-time
out! Big mistake! My
Gegetsuburi will be gone
if he touches it!

127
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:43,115
Better change my attack!

128
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:49,382
[struggling]

129
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:55,215
Weren't you aiming for
me? Instead, your attack
ended up being self
destructive.

130
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,582
Moron! I'm not self
destructive, I'm
warming up!

131
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:03,482
My attack was stronger
than I thought, that's
all! So I was hit by
some rubble!

132
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,115
Wait, that's it!

133
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:08,815
Let's see you keep
up with me if you can!

134
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:13,048
How boring. All you're
doing is running away.

135
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:18,582
[panting]

136
00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:24,782
<i>What I have to do is lure</i>
<i>him to someplace where</i>
<i>it'll be harder for him</i>

137
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:28,648

139
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,948
How's this!

140
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:48,115
[grunting]

141
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:52,815
Good thinking. You
realized you can't
attack with your
Zanpakuto, so you tried

142
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:57,948
using other objects. But
pathetic efforts like
yours are useless.

143
00:12:58,348 --> 00:13:00,248
I've only begun to
fight!

144
00:13:03,348 --> 00:13:06,148
Ahhhh!

145
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:09,948
Oh yeah!

146
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:11,448
Well, well...

147
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:14,548
Rainin' shards of
glass!

148
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:20,248
How will you understand?
You cannot wound me with
shards of glass.

149
00:13:22,082 --> 00:13:27,548
You're right, I don't
expect some small glass
shards to hurt you. But what
about an entire building?!

150
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,150
[laughing]

151
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:04,850
[coughing and panting]

152
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,317
That probably wasn't enough
to kill him, but I know that
it's bought me some more time.

153
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,117
Now I need to hide out
somewhere and come up
with a plan that works.

154
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:22,317
Huh?

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:28,617
Did you just say, bought
you more time? You say
some interesting things.

156
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:31,984
What now?

157
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:41,450
Have you forgotten that
I signify the aspect of
death known as
senescence?

158
00:14:41,484 --> 00:14:47,184
Time means nothing before
my power! For it can rule
time itself!

159
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:55,850
Speaking of time, it's
time for you to suffer
the Dying Breath.

160
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:58,050
Respira!

161
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,584
Ahhh!

162
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,650
I am not done!!

163
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:17,684
[groaning]

164
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:25,450
By now, you must know.
You cannot take this
sword back from me.

165
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:29,484
I'm afraid that's
reality, and you need
to accept that fact.

166
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:32,317
Hmph! So what
if I can't?!

167
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,117
You Fracciones are
persistent.

168
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,117
And you're quite
fiercely loyal to the
Espadas, aren't you?

169
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,250
Nevertheless,
you should stop.

170
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:45,350
Your duty shouldn't
require you to die here
needlessly.

171
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:47,684
Stubbornness isn't
loyalty.

172
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:50,517
You are so full of it!
And wrong!

173
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,750
You reek from lecturing,
old fart.

174
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:57,684
Old far?! I
don't approve of you
and your foul mouth.

175
00:15:57,717 --> 00:15:59,984
Address me properly.
Call me Mister!

176
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:05,717
I don't know anything
about loyalty and stuff
like that... But Coyote
and I...

177
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:11,084
We're different than
the other Espadas and
Fracciones. We just
are--

178
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:29,284
Now that was a close
call. I thought that
Cero of yours had nailed
me.

179
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:32,284
And I would hate for
anything to happen to
this kimono.

180
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:40,950
But my suspicions were
correct. You became a
little desperate after
thinking I was going to

181
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:43,484
go after that kid,
didn't you?

182
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:49,950
How unbecoming of you,
Captain. Using cheap taunts
like that won't get you
anywhere in this fight.

183
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,084
Maybe they won't.

184
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:57,350
But as far as I can tell,
the relationship between
you two seems to be more
personal than as usual

185
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:00,350
with other Espadas
and Fracciones.

186
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:05,284
And so what if it
is? Do you think
that lecturing me is
going to help you?

187
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:08,584
Possibly. I'm not sure
that was my intention,

188
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:11,817
but I'm thinking that's
definitely the key to
the two of you.

189
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,450
You'll know soon enough.
That is, of course, if
you're worthy enough
to find out.

190
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:21,917
Respira!

191
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:28,950
I can't let that Dying
Breath thing hit me.

192
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:38,817
Ahhhh!

193
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:49,884
That was close! That
breath of his almost
got-- Ahhh!

194
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,184
[grunting]

195
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:58,884
Haven't you realized?
You can't evade my
Respira. I released it
slowly on purpose... I

196
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:04,550
know your captain is
hiding out there
somewhere and I will find
a way to flush her out!

197
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,184
Yeah, well I wish she'd
hurry up and get involved!

198
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:10,917
The only move I have
left is running away!

199
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:18,050
I must say, you're very
good at running away for
a fat chunk of meat!

200
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:23,050
Shuh- Shut up!
You're just jealous
because you're nothing
but a bag of bones!

201
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:28,350
I can't do anything
directly using my
Gegetsuburi! It'll
turn to dust!

202
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:33,250
That's just my luck! Why
isn't my Zanpakuto a
Kido-type, that shoots
flames or ice or does

203
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:35,184
something really great?!

204
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:36,984
That's it!-Kido!

205
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:41,317
A Kido can get him! I
just figured out your
weakness!

206
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,650
Bakudo 21, Sekienton!

207
00:18:53,984 --> 00:19:00,084
Damn it! I almost blinded
myself with that. You
know when I really think of
it, I can barely use Kido!

208
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:04,550
Damn! That was close. I
got carried away and
almost made him mad.

209
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:08,317
This isn't going to
work! It's obviously
not going to work!

210
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,384
I'm screwed! I'm
gonna get killed!

211
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,284
Captain!!

212
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:16,550
Save me!

213
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:25,084
Screaming out loud like
a coward... idiot.

214
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:28,050
Can't leave him in
charge for even a
second...

215
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:32,317
When this fight is over,
I'm gonna beat that loser
within an inch of his life.

216
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:36,617
All right, that should be
enough.

217
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:44,084
Looks like that's about
all he can do. Run away
from me.

218
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,884
Time to end this.

219
00:19:53,884 --> 00:19:55,617
What the
hell is that?

220
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:01,650
Gran Caida... A
guillotine too good
for a coward.

221
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,317
Rot... and die!

222
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:07,817
[trembling]

223
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,784
Bankai!

224
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:15,517
What?!

225
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,984
Huh?

226
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,284
Unh?!

227
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,417
Jakuho Raikoben!

228
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,784
So that's what your
Bankai looks like.

229
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,850
Uh-- Captain!

230
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:55,717
So that's Captain Soi
Fon's Bankai! This is my
first time seeing it!

231
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,684
What's with that shape?
How's she gonna fight
with that?!

232
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:05,150
Huh? That's a ginjotan!
A steel band used as an
under layer for armor!

233
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,817
Why did she wrap herself
in something so heavy?!
With that steel sash
wrapped around her,

234
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,784
even the Captain won't
be able to move freely!

235
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:20,617
If possible, I had hoped
to end this without using
this Bankai.

236
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:26,984
This Bankai, it violates
my standards as a member
of the Stealth Force.

237
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,417
This Bankai's too big
for me to conceal it.
And it's too heavy to
move freely.

238
00:21:34,817 --> 00:21:36,284
And its attack...

239
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,450
... it's too flashy
for an assassin!

240
00:21:45,517 --> 00:21:46,784
Ahhhh!

241
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:47,412
I won't lose to you,
you old fart!

242
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:48,879
<i>Let's play with these</i>
<i>spinning tops.</i>

243
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:51,412
I told you, kids' games
won't work on me!

244
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:55,079
<i>How about candy then?</i>
<i>I've got strawberry,</i>
<i>green tea or milk</i>
<i>flavored.</i>

245
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:56,079
<i>Which would you like?</i>

246
00:23:56,112 --> 00:23:57,712
Uhh... umm... then
I'll have the--

247
00:23:57,746 --> 00:23:59,612
<i>Quit falling for it,</i>
<i>Lilynette.</i>

248
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,579
[giggling]
