00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:42,774
-Central 46-- it gets its
name from the 40 sages and six

3
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:46,308
judges who've been gathered
from across the Soul Society.

4
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:47,908
It is the highest
judicial system

5
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,408
that exists within
the Soul Society.

6
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:53,341
When a soul reaper is
charged with a crime,

7
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:55,808
whether it occurred in the
Soul Society or the world

8
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:58,808
of the living, it is here
that they are judged.

9
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:01,774
Once a verdict is
handed down, Central 46

10
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:04,608
then designates who will
execute the sentence--

11
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:08,941
the stealth force, or the
13 court guard squads.

12
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:11,941
Once they declare their
verdict, it is absolute.

13
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:15,874
No one, not even a captain,
can appeal their decision.

14
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:20,874
That is the function
of Central 46.

15
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:21,874
-Eh.

16
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,374
[gasps]

17
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:24,208
-What?

18
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:25,608
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

19
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:27,841
How could something
like this happen?

20
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:46,541
TOSHIRO (VOICE OVER) : This
blood is completely dry.

21
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:49,508
It's already blackened, and
even started to crack and flake.

22
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,608
This obviously didn't
happen yesterday,

23
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:54,208
or the day before that.

24
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,308
The question is when?

25
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:58,774
The last time
Central 46 operated

26
00:02:58,808 --> 00:03:02,008
normally was just before
Renji was defeated.

27
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,774
After that, martial
law was declared

28
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,474
and the Central
Underground Assembly Hall

29
00:03:05,508 --> 00:03:07,974
was locked down completely.

30
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,274
No one was allowed
to enter or leave.

31
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:13,074
The defense system was
engaged, sealing all entrances,

32
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:14,641
and there was no
sign of forced entry

33
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:18,874
when we got here-- that means
they were killed before then.

34
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:22,074
If that's the case, all the
judgments and decisions that

35
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:28,174
have come from Central 46 since
that time, they were fake.

36
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,408
But who could have
pulled this off, Gin?

37
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:34,441
Even he's not capable
of doing this by itself,

38
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:36,408
so there must have been
others who helped him.

39
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,941
-Captain Hitsugaya, I
figured I'd find you here.

40
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:49,974
-Izuru.

41
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:51,808
Are you the one
responsible for this?

42
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,074
After him, Rangiku, come on!

43
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:08,474
-Uh.

44
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,974
-It's no use running.

45
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,908
Answer me, Izuru, are
you responsible for what

46
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:38,041
happened back there?

47
00:04:38,074 --> 00:04:39,408
-No.

48
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:41,408
I was merely allowed in from
the inside before you arrived.

49
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:43,341
My role was to unlock
the doors from the inside

50
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:45,941
so you could get into the
Underground Assembly Hall.

51
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:47,774
-Who gave you those orders?

52
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:49,374
Who was it?

53
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:50,574
-It's no secret.

54
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:53,041
Central 46 gave the order.

55
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:54,874
-Then where is
the official seal?

56
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:56,074
Show me, damn it!

57
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:58,608
-Instead of chasing me,
asking pointless questions

58
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:01,674
about orders and official
seals, shouldn't you

59
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,474
be more concerned
about protecting Momo?

60
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:06,374
-What are you talking about?

61
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:07,274
She's perfectly safe.

62
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,674
She's--

63
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,774
-Not in the Squat 10 barracks,
if that's what you're thinking.

64
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:13,474
-You put a force field around
the room Momo was sleeping in,

65
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:16,441
didn't you?

66
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:18,441
A Kiyomo, a high
level force field

67
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:20,541
that repels attacks
from the outside,

68
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:23,641
so you left her there
thinking she'd be safe.

69
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:29,341
But that force field is meant
to keep people out, not in.

70
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:31,074
Momo was a master of Kido.

71
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:34,041
Breaking a force field like that
would be child's play for her.

72
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:35,941
And she could put a force
field around herself

73
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:39,241
to hide her spiritual
pressure while moving about.

74
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:41,541
You didn't even notice, did you?

75
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:45,008
She's been right behind you,
following you the entire time.

76
00:05:47,674 --> 00:05:50,241
-Rangiku, can I
leave this to you?

77
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:51,708
-I've got it.

78
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:53,108
[grunts]

79
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,441
-Uh.

80
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:07,341
What, you tired of running?

81
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:09,908
-You don't know, do you Rangiku?

82
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:11,141
You've no idea.

83
00:06:11,174 --> 00:06:12,908
-About what?

84
00:06:12,941 --> 00:06:15,874
-About what my Zanpakuto can do.

85
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,308
-Perhaps that's
because you've never

86
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:19,841
told anyone exactly what it is.

87
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:22,141
-I'm afraid that's not true.

88
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:26,874
There are some-- both Renji
and Momo know its power,

89
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:29,774
but that's neither
here nor there.

90
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:33,574
Now I plan on telling you, too.

91
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:37,108
Raise your head, Wabisuke.

92
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:38,541
-How dare you?

93
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,674
-Good reflexes, impressive.

94
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,808
-What are you doing?

95
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,108
Are you completely insane?

96
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:51,608
Uh!

97
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:52,941
Uh!

98
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:56,408
Listen, Izuru, I don't know
what Dean said to you but--

99
00:06:56,441 --> 00:07:01,608
-Tell me, how many attacks
so far, about seven?

100
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:02,574
-Uh!

101
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:04,508
[crash]

102
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,308
-Whatever my sword cuts
becomes twice as heavy.

103
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:10,008
It doubles with each
strike and continues

104
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,474
doing so indefinitely,
until finally the person I

105
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:15,341
fight can no longer
lift the weight.

106
00:07:15,374 --> 00:07:17,408
They kneel helplessly
on the ground,

107
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:20,808
head bowed down as if they
were in penitence-- thus

108
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,474
the name Wabisuke,
the penitent one.

109
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,141
I can help you with the math.

110
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:27,441
If your sword weighed
16 ounces, that

111
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:33,541
multiplied by 2 to the seventh
power would be 128 pounds.

112
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:36,208
That's going to make
running with it difficult.

113
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:38,174
-So what?

114
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,108
If it gets too heavy, then
I'll just have to drop it.

115
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:46,808
Izuru, tell me, what exactly
do you want to do with her?

116
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,808
Roar.

117
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:50,241
Haineko!

118
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:51,674
-Uh.

119
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,174
-What in the world do
you want to do with me?

120
00:07:57,974 --> 00:08:00,141
Where is it that you want to go?

121
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:13,674
-What, what happened here?

122
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:19,174
Everyone in Central 46, they're
all dead, every one of them.

123
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:24,874
Toshiro was here, but he
was surprised somehow.

124
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:28,041
Izuru was here, too,
but then for some reason

125
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,541
Toshiro followed
him away from here.

126
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:33,308
None of this makes any sense.

127
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:36,641
If Toshiro killed
Captain Aizen, does that

128
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:38,908
mean that he's the
one who did this, too?

129
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:42,341
But, why would he be
surprised to see Izuru here,

130
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:45,741
unless, unless it was Izuru.

131
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:49,474
So if Hitsugaya didn't do
this, what about Captain Aizen?

132
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:54,341
-Welcome Momo.

133
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:55,808
What a pleasure to see you.

134
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,141
-Captain Ichimaru, what
are you doing here?

135
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,308
-Just come with me.

136
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:14,974
-Momo.

137
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:18,208
-But, this is the Seijotokyorin.

138
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:21,474
These are the living
quarters of Central 46.

139
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:25,508
I don't understand-- why
would you bring me here?

140
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,274
Captain Ichimaru, please.

141
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:31,541
-So, how many times have you
visited this place, Momo?

142
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:34,108
-I never have, I'm not allowed.

143
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,974
This area is completely
off-limits to me.

144
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:38,808
This is the first time.

145
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:42,341
-There's someone here
I'd like you to meet.

146
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,908
-Who would want to
meet me, and why?

147
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:48,208
-You'll see.

148
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:49,174
-But--

149
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,808
-No need to be shy.

150
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,174
Look behind you.

151
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,141
-Behind me?

152
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:57,541
[footsteps]

153
00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:59,008
[gasps]

154
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:08,274
Captain Aizen.

155
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,874
-I've missed seeing you, Momo.

156
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:14,674
-Captain Aizen, I
don't believe it.

157
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,608
Is it really you?

158
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:20,374
Ah, all this time I
thought you were dead.

159
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:22,341
-I know you did, and I'm sorry.

160
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,608
-You really are alive,
aren't you, Captain Aizen.

161
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:31,341
And I thought that,
I thought that--

162
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:35,808
[crying]

163
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:38,774
I didn't know what to think.

164
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:40,774
-I'm sorry.

165
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,541
I can see that I've
caused you pain.

166
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:48,774
MOMO (VOICE OVER): Oh,
Captain Aizen's hand,

167
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:52,608
it's so warm and comforting.

168
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:55,374
-Come in and talk until
you've calmed down.

169
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:57,574
You're welcome to stay
here as long as you like.

170
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:07,908
MOMO (VOICE OVER): He's the
same as always-- even his scent.

171
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:11,341
I always feel as if
he cleanses my soul.

172
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:13,808
It really is Captain Aizen.

173
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,808
It is.

174
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,708
[crying]

175
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:20,708
MOMO (VOICE OVER): When
I thought you were dead,

176
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:22,708
I'd lost all hope.

177
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,274
Life had no meaning without you.

178
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:27,141
I didn't think I could go on.

179
00:11:27,174 --> 00:11:29,508
But I was wrong, it was a lie.

180
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,008
I should have seen it.

181
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,008
I should have known you
wouldn't die, Captain Aizen.

182
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,774
I should have known that you
would never die and leave me

183
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:38,374
behind.

184
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:40,274
[crying]

185
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:43,508
-You've become so thin.

186
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,241
I'm sorry, Momo.

187
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:47,508
I'm sorry my actions
caused you so much pain.

188
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:53,674
But you understand,
don't you, Momo?

189
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,541
You're the only one
who could understand.

190
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:58,541
There was a task that
needed to be handled.

191
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:00,874
In order to do that, I
had to fake my own death.

192
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:01,574
-It's all right.

193
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:02,908
Everything's all right.

194
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,441
None of that makes
any difference now,

195
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,241
as long as you're alive and
back home where you belong.

196
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:09,608
-Thank you, Momo.

197
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:16,141
I'm a fortunate man to
have you as a subordinate.

198
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:17,608
Thank you, Momo.

199
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:24,841
From the bottom of my heart,
thank you-- and goodbye.

200
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,874
[stab]

201
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:32,208
[gasping]

202
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:34,641
-What have you done?

203
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:38,074
Why?

204
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,574
[thud]

205
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:54,041
-Let's go, Gin.

206
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:54,841
-Yes.

207
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,874
As you wish, Captain Aizen.

208
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,289
-Uh.

209
00:13:34,322 --> 00:13:38,255
[breathing heavily]

210
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:41,542
-Hey, Toshiro.

211
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:43,309
-What is this?

212
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:44,976
Captain Aizen.

213
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:47,742
Are you alive, or
is this some trick?

214
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:51,042
-No trick, this is
really me, Toshiro.

215
00:13:51,076 --> 00:13:52,542
Excuse me a minute.

216
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:55,242
Gin, he's returned
sooner than we expected.

217
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:57,042
I hope you have an explanation.

218
00:13:57,076 --> 00:13:58,242
-Sorry, sir.

219
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:00,842
Izuru must not have been
able to keep him occupied.

220
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:02,542
-What's going on here?

221
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:03,976
What are you two talking about?

222
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,976
-Nothing, really.

223
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:06,576
We were just discussing
the finer points

224
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:10,742
of strategy-- the breaking down
of an enemy's fighting power,

225
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:12,309
to be specific.

226
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:13,409
-Enemy, I see.

227
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:16,542
[grunting]

228
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:18,242
Tell me where Momo is!

229
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:21,476
-That's a good question.

230
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:24,376
[grunts]

231
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:25,876
[boom]

232
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:33,242
-Momo, no.

233
00:14:33,276 --> 00:14:34,609
-Huh, found her.

234
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:37,009
Guess I shouldn't have
left her lying around.

235
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,509
I apologize.

236
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:42,042
I really didn't plan on
surprising you this way.

237
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:45,276
No, I should have chopped her
into little pieces, then hidden

238
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:47,109
them away where
you'd never find her.

239
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:56,409
-Aizen, Ichimaru, how long
have you worked together?

240
00:14:56,442 --> 00:15:00,509
Did Gin help conspire
to fake your death?

241
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,842
-He joined me long before that.

242
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:05,409
Gin's been with me from
the very beginning.

243
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:06,942
From the moment
I became captain,

244
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:10,042
there was no one better
suited to be my lieutenant.

245
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:14,942
-So all this time you've been
lying to everyone-- Momo,

246
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:19,642
me, the 13 Court Guard Squads,
all the other Soul Reapers,

247
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:21,409
everyone!

248
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,876
[grunts]

249
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:24,509
You deceived us!

250
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:27,242
-Well, I had never
thought of it that way.

251
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:29,642
It's just, it
became very obvious

252
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:32,809
that no one was capable
of understanding.

253
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:35,976
My true identity
was beyond them.

254
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:38,276
-True identity?

255
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:42,042
Momo, Momo looked up to you.

256
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:44,109
She joined the 13
Court Guard Squad

257
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,576
so she could be closer to you.

258
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:49,476
She believed in you, and
everything you represented.

259
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:51,676
So much so, that she was
willing to risk her life

260
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,009
to become your lieutenant!

261
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:56,476
-Of course I knew,
that's the quality

262
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:59,776
that made her easy to
control-- her blind admiration.

263
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:02,342
That and her abilities made
her the perfect candidate

264
00:16:02,376 --> 00:16:04,442
to be my subordinate.

265
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:06,076
This is a lesson you
might want to take

266
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:07,842
to heart as well, Toshiro.

267
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:09,476
[laughs]

268
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:12,576
Admiration is a state furthest
away from understanding.

269
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:21,176
[gasps]

270
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:30,009
Bankai.

271
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:35,142
[shouting]

272
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:43,376
[breathing heavily]

273
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,309
No, Aizen, you've talked enough.

274
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:47,542
Time to die.

275
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:50,876
-Ha, you shouldn't be
making such strong remarks,

276
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,342
it only makes you look weak.

277
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:55,842
[yells]

278
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:57,842
[whoosh]

279
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:03,776
[laughing]

280
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:10,742
[grunts]

281
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,676
[crash]

282
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:20,642
-This isn't possible.

283
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,342
-What a beautiful sight.

284
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,209
It's the wrong
season, but I rather

285
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:36,076
like seeing ice
this time of year.

286
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,709
-Captain Aizen--
no, that's wrong.

287
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:44,309
After what I've
witnessed, it wouldn't

288
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:46,442
be right to call you
captain any longer.

289
00:17:46,476 --> 00:17:50,376
Sosuke Aizen, your
title is high traitor.

290
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:53,309
-Well, hello, Captain Unohana.

291
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:55,142
I have to admit that
your arrival is not

292
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:57,409
completely unexpected.

293
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,809
I knew you'd figure out
that I was staying here.

294
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:02,409
-It was the only explanation.

295
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:06,142
Seijotokyorin had been declared
totally off-limits to everyone.

296
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:08,609
This location was
perfectly suited for you

297
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:11,442
to carry out the
plans you had in mind.

298
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:13,742
You needed to hide away
in complete isolation

299
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:16,176
after you staged your own
death with that exquisitely

300
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:17,976
designed corpse doll.

301
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:20,176
And what better place in
all of the Seireitei for you

302
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,109
to go completely undetected?

303
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,642
That was your plan
at least, wasn't it?

304
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:25,876
-Not quite.

305
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:29,909
Some of that is true, but
you did make two mistakes.

306
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,642
Let me clear things up for you.

307
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:34,609
First of all, I have no
need to hide from anyone--

308
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:36,409
that's not what I came here for.

309
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:39,909
And secondly, what
you're looking at here

310
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:41,109
is not a corpse doll.

311
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:42,009
[gasps]

312
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:43,976
-But, when did he--

313
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:46,242
-When did I what?

314
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:48,842
I've been standing here
holding it the whole time.

315
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:51,176
It's been right in
front of you, you simply

316
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:52,576
weren't able to see it.

317
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:57,876
That's because I didn't allow
you to see it until just now.

318
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:59,909
-Wha, what do you mean?

319
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:02,742
-You'll soon understand.

320
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:04,942
I'm going to release
my Zanpakuto.

321
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:08,076
Shatter, Kyoka Suigetsu.

322
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:11,142
[gasping]

323
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:14,642
This is my Zanpakuto,
Kyoka Suigetsu.

324
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:18,276
Its ability is perfect hypnosis.

325
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:19,109
-Impossible.

326
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:21,042
It couldn't change.

327
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,876
Kyoka Suigetsu has always been
a running water type Zanpakuto.

328
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:26,942
It uses the diffused
reflection of mist

329
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:29,842
to confuse enemies into
attacking each other.

330
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:32,542
You yourself explained to
us exactly how it worked,

331
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:33,842
Captain Aizen.

332
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:35,309
And we saw it with our own eyes.

333
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,576
You specifically gathered
all the lieutenants together

334
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,576
because you wanted
to demonstrate it!

335
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:42,142
I see now.

336
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:45,609
Your demonstration was
actually the hypnosis ritual.

337
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,909
-You're catching on quickly.

338
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:51,709
Complete hypnosis
controls all five senses,

339
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:54,309
and is able to cause every
dimension of a target,

340
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:58,109
including its form, shape,
mass, feel and smell, even

341
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:00,942
its vocal patterns in the way it
tastes, to perfectly replicate

342
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:03,042
that of an enemy.

343
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,842
In other words, it
is possible for me

344
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,809
to make a fly appear
to be a dragon,

345
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:10,642
or a marsh, a flowerbed.

346
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:15,009
And all I need to do to activate
it is simply show my enemies

347
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:17,376
my Zanpakuto's Kanzen
Saimin release.

348
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:21,742
[breathing heavily]

349
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:25,676
The power of my Zanpakuto
is limited only by my mind,

350
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:27,709
because whoever lays
their eyes on it,

351
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:30,409
even once, will be hypnotized
into doing my bidding

352
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:33,576
whenever I release
my Kyoka Suigetsu.

353
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:34,942
-Even once?

354
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:37,909
But, uh.

355
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:39,242
-I see you've figured it out.

356
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,876
Very good.

357
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:48,876
You see, whoever lays their
eyes on it falls under my spell.

358
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:51,309
So unfortunately,
those who can't see

359
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:54,009
will never be under my power.

360
00:20:54,042 --> 00:21:00,009
In other words, Kaname Tosen
was always my subordinate.

361
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,709
-Captain Tosen, what's wrong?

362
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:05,842
Please let me by,
I'm in a hurry.

363
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:10,242
[whoosh]

364
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:12,942
What the hell's going on?

365
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:16,376
[whoosh]

366
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,376
-I want to commend you, Unohana.

367
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,609
You examined my body
far more thoroughly

368
00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:22,842
than any of the others.

369
00:21:22,876 --> 00:21:25,309
That you felt even a
bit of suspicion while

370
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:27,309
under the influence
of my hypnotic spell,

371
00:21:27,342 --> 00:21:28,776
I find most remarkable.

372
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:33,776
I congratulate you,
and bid you farewell.

373
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,176
I don't think I'll ever
see any of you again.

374
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:38,542
-Wait!

375
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:39,942
Unh!

376
00:21:39,976 --> 00:21:43,276
[coughing]

377
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:44,976
-What the hell was
that all about?

378
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:50,942
But this is Sokyoku Hill.

379
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,309
-Welcome, Renji.

380
00:21:55,742 --> 00:22:01,542
-Captain Aizen,
how did-- What the?

381
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:02,042
[inaudible]

382
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:08,042
What, what's going on?

383
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:12,009
-Leave Rukia where she
is, Renji, and back away.

384
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:14,009
[gasps]

385
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:24,623
[theme music]

386
00:22:55,144 --> 00:22:58,077
-The next episode, I plan to
divulge my true intentions

387
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:59,844
with an entertaining
dinner show.

388
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:01,411
There's still time
to buy tickets,

389
00:23:01,444 --> 00:23:03,411
but it's first
come, first served.

390
00:23:03,444 --> 00:23:05,044
-I'm making a special
guest appearance.

391
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:06,377
-Don't be late.

392
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:10,344
-You're not an actor, and
there's not going to be a show!
