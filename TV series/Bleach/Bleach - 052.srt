00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:41,881
joined 13 Court

59

obsessed with one thing--
the one man that I wanted

60
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:51,747
to surpass That man is
you, Captain Kuchiki.

die before you reach Bankai.

didn't know, you who

have no time for even

blades, each too small

93
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:18,081
for the eye to see.

94
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:21,181
When the blades fly, they
turn and reflect the sunlight,

95
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:23,781
resembling 1,000
flower petals falling.

96
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:26,014
I know it all too well.

97
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:28,981
Unfortunately for
you, my sword's joints

98
00:10:29,014 --> 00:10:31,547
are connected by
my spirit energy.

99
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:35,914
Your blades can't
cut through them.

100
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:38,947
Just now, I disconnected
all of the joints.

101
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:41,214
And then I scattered
them deliberately

102
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:45,514
in order to counter
your 1,000 blades.

103
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:47,981
Does that surprise you, Captain?

104
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:52,081
I already told you, I can
see every one of your blades!

105
00:10:57,514 --> 00:10:58,481
What do you know?

106
00:10:58,514 --> 00:11:01,247
I got you down on your knee.

107
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:02,881
And now I'm going to defeat you.

108
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:09,947
I think it's time to
bring down the current

109
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:12,247

us, Byakuya Kuchiki.

down the curtain, huh?

00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,089
Very well.

112
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:35,156
Then down it's going to come.

113
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:37,856
And the blade of my
sword will do it.

-Your sword!

115
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:44,023

this will be mine!

damage with a mid-level Kido

121
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:12,656
without the spirit chant?

122
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:14,089
RENJI: I see you.

123
00:12:14,123 --> 00:12:15,656
Are you really foolish
enough to think

124
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:17,656
you could hide from me
with such a simple trick?

125
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:28,923
RENJI (VOICEOVER): Damn it.

126
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,723
I lost control.

127
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:33,856
-You're the foolish one, Renji.

128
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:37,289
I didn't realise my Kido in
order to obscure my movements

129
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,756
from you.

130
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,189
I did it to interrupt the
rhythm of your Bankai.

131
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:47,189
The weakness of Bankai
lies in its sheer size

132
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:50,089
and the overwhelming
power it releases.

133
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:53,823
It goes far beyond the
abilities of any normal weapon.

134
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,056
It is for that reason
that it is said

135
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:59,723
one must train for 10 years
after learning Bankai in order

136
00:12:59,756 --> 00:13:03,056
to control it completely.

137
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:07,556
Renji, you are not ready to
use your Bankai in battle.

138
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,523
-I don't need your lectures.

139
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:14,456
I all ready knew
all of that when

140
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:17,023
I came here in the first place.

141
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:20,223
Luckily for me, though, my
Zanpakuto is not only big,

142
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:22,789
it's also strong enough
to lose some segments

143
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:25,623
and still keep on fighting!

Unless you still have some
hopeless idea about winning.

In case you've forgotten, or if
perhaps it didn't occur to you,

150
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:52,356
I'll remind you, Renji,
that I, too, have Bankai.

infinitely more blades

158
00:15:20,423 --> 00:15:21,356
then rise.

159
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:23,456
Impossible to know
their numbers.

160
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:28,156
Impossible to even read their
path, much less avoid them.

161
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:31,356
Nothing to do but watch,
as one watches the wind

162
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,989
pass, and wait for the
blades to pass through you.

163
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:39,856
One can do nothing but stand
there, frozen, and then be

164
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:43,789
swept away from this world.

165
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:46,689
Shall I tell you the
difference between you and I?

166
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:52,089
It's class.

167
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:54,756
It's like the story
of the monkey trying

168
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,756
to capture the moon.

169
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,089
No matter how he
struggles, it's just

170
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:02,156
the moon's reflection
on the water he sees.

171
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:04,356
So he only sinks into the water.

172
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,889
Time after time,
the monkey sinks.

173
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:14,589
Your fang could never hope
to actually reach me-- never.

174
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:17,856
But be proud, proud
of the fact that you

175
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:21,723
were failed by this blade, yet
you still retain a human form.

176
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:30,689
-[gasps]

177
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:36,956
BYAKUYA: So you
can still breathe.

178
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:42,989
Do not move.

179
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:44,623
You will only hasten your death.

180
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,023
RENJI: It's not over.

181
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:03,489
It's not over.

182
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,856
I can still fight.

183
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:08,089
-Didn't you hear me?

184
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:12,156
I told you not to move.

185
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,589
-[shout]

186
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:19,956
Huh?

187
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:21,923
[shout]

188
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:26,823
-I must compliment you.

189
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:29,656
Though you received
my Bankai, you still

190
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:33,323
live and even wish
to continue fighting.

191
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:38,556
However, do not try
to stand up again.

192
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:41,923
If you do, this blade will
carve you into pieces.

193
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:43,356
That I promise you.

194
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:51,389
You must have noticed by now
that your Bankai is gone.

195
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,889
When one's Bankai disappears
without the permission

196
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:57,323
of its master, it means that
the master's time of death

197
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:58,923
draws near.

198
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:02,723
Soon enough, now, you
will begin to fade away.

199
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:05,589
So I shall ask you
this one more time.

200
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:09,289
Will you at long last give up
this foolish dream of yours,

201
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:10,523
of saving Rukia?

202
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:19,189
RENJI (VOICEOVER):
I-- I can't breathe.

203
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:24,556
His spiritual pressure
alone is tearing me apart.

204
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:26,956
I can't even move my fingers.

205
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:37,756
In the end, this man and I,
we're too far apart after all.

206
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:46,623
-[gasp]

207
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:52,056
-Can you still stand
and continue, Ichigo?

208
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,956
-[laugh]

209
00:18:55,989 --> 00:19:01,923
-[laugh] Of course I can!

210
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:03,723
-Hm?

211
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:05,723
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
Because I swore.

212
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:08,889
RENJI: I swore
that I'd save her.

213
00:19:08,923 --> 00:19:10,756
-You swore this?

214
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:14,156
You swore it to whom?

215
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:16,089
RENJI: No one.

216
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:19,189
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
I just swore it!

217
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:23,123
-I just swore it!

218
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:23,989
To myself!

219
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:25,256
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): To myself!

220
00:19:41,123 --> 00:19:44,889
IKKAKU: You want to be
stronger than Byakuya Kuchiki?

221
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:47,589
You've set yourself
an impossible goal.

222
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:52,123
IZURU: You'd better just stay
away from her from now on.

223
00:19:52,156 --> 00:19:54,656
She understands
the situation, too.

224
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:57,489
She knows that she's
different from the rest of us.

225
00:20:00,556 --> 00:20:02,423
MAN (VOICEOVER): It's
for your own good.

226
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:03,823
And for hers, too.

227
00:20:03,856 --> 00:20:07,156
It's a shame, but, well,
it's kind of complicated.

228
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:11,189
But it's always a lot easier
to let something fall apart

229
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:13,523
than it is to try
to hold it together.

230
00:20:18,723 --> 00:20:23,023
-[shouts]

231
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:02,956
Damn it.

232
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:16,756
-Congratulations.

233
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:23,256
Very admirable.

234
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:25,589
That time, your fang
definitely reached me.

235
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:44,789
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Renji.

236
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:49,456
Impossible.

237
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:52,089
Until just now when it
faded, it was so powerful,

238
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:54,856
I couldn't tell whose
spiritual pressure that was.

239
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:56,723
It was Renji.

240
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:57,689
-Renji!

241
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:59,989
Why, why'd you do it?

242
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:00,489
Renji!

243
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:05,923
Huh?

244
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:15,289
[gasps]

245
00:22:15,323 --> 00:22:16,823
-Good morning.

246
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:20,389
How are you today, Rukia dear?

247
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,256
-Ichimaru.

248
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:25,256
Gin.

249
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:27,256

251
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:03,508
-Here are the rules of Squad 11.

252
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,842
One, your Zanpakuto must
be a direct attack one.

253
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,675
YUMICHIKA: One, if you must
die, die gloriously. in a fight.

254
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,408
YACHIRU: One, obey the
lieutenant's orders

255
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:11,508
at all costs.

256
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:12,808
IKKAKU AND MADARAME:
Now, wait just a minute.

257
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,142
-Any complaints, shiny duo?

258

IKKAKU AND MADARAME: Hey, no
giving us stupid nicknames!
