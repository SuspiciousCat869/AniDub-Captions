<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>The truth is,</i>

2
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:11,866
<i>All of the battles you</i>
<i>fought up to now,</i>

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,933
<i>were simply a</i>

4
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,933
I'm not done yet!

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,400
Hyaahh!

6
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:27,552
[exhausted panting]

7
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,752
I have to thank you,
Genryusai Yamamoto.

8
00:02:35,452 --> 00:02:39,452
By your heroic actions,
you have protected my world.

9
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:45,818
Damn you.

10
00:02:57,952 --> 00:03:02,918
Genryusai Yamamoto.
Unfortunately, I cannot
spare your life.

11
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:07,418
<i>You are the embodiment of</i>
<i>the Soul Society's history.</i>

12
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:12,752
Out of respect, I have decided
I will finish you off quickly.

13
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:15,618
[gasp]

14
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:19,285
Don't make me explain it
again, Sosuke Aizen.

15
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:24,885
<i>His charred arm is</i>
<i>starting to crack!</i>

16
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:28,685
That means he's using the
forbidden technique,

17
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:32,718
which can only be
activated by using one's
burned body as a catalyst!

18
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,185
<i>Sacrificial Hado</i>
<i>Number Ninety-Six!</i>

19
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,218
Ittokaso!

20
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:00,785
<i>I underestimated him.</i>

21
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:05,852
<i>He sacrificed his own burned</i>
<i>body as a weapon, without a</i>
<i>moment's hesitation!</i>

22
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:20,752
Getsuga...tensho!

23
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:36,685
I'm not done yet!

24
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:44,185
Damn!

25
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,085
Ssyaahhh!

26
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:03,318
Heh.

27
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:05,785
What's so funny?

28
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:10,585
You missed your
chance kill me,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

29
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:11,785
What?

30
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:16,318
Too bad for you.
You won't get that
opening again.

31
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:20,385
Don't be so sure.
I was able to
injure you.

32
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:21,818
Injured?

33
00:05:22,252 --> 00:05:24,185
You call this an injury?

34
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:28,818
<i>High-speed regeneration?!</i>

35
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:32,218
It's not high-speed
regeneration.

36
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:42,418
Do you really think I'd
undergo Hollowfication?

37
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:46,818
This is merely a compulsion
to protect its master.

38
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,685
What are you talking about?

39
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:02,018
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>But that's...</i>

40
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:06,418
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>Yes, it's the Hogyoku.</i>

41
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:17,185
Your Spirit Energy
works very well.

42
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:21,752
I'm very pleased.
You've matured
splendidly.

43
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,785
Just the way I wanted you to.

44
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:28,918
Eh? What?!

45
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,352
Months ago, you
met Rukia Kuchiki.

46
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:38,385
And following your
battle with Uryu Ishida,

47
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:40,885
you awakened to your
own Soul Reaper powers.

48
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:41,918
Eh?!

49
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:48,952
<i>During your battle with Renji</i>
<i>Abarai, you learned about the</i>
<i>power of your Zanpakuto.</i>

50
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:54,585
<i>During your battle with</i>
<i>Kanpachi Zaraki, you became</i>
<i>aware of your Bankai.</i>

51
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:59,118
<i>During your battle with</i>
<i>Byakuya Kuchiki, you began</i>
<i>your Hollowfication.</i>

52
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,652
<i>During your battle with</i>
<i>Grimmjow, you mastered</i>
<i>your Hollowfication.</i>

53
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:06,985
And during your
subsequent battle
with Ulquiorra,

54
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,152
it appears you gained
an even greater power.

55
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:24,952
<i>The truth is, Ichigo Kurosaki,</i>
<i>All of the battles you've</i>
<i>fought up to now,</i>

56
00:07:27,085 --> 00:07:29,018
were simply a
part of my plan.

57
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,152
Rauughh!

58
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:48,318
I'm too injured to fight.
Do you want to save
your family?

59
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:51,785
Of course I do!
If there's a way
then tell me how!

60
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:54,285
<i>It will only be temporary.</i>

61
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:59,685
But, you must become a
Soul Reaper yourself.

62
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,852
Then give me that blade,
Soul Reaper.

63
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:11,285
My name is Rukia.
Rukia Kuchiki.

64
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,618
<i>[monster roars]</i>
<i>Rrrauugghr!!</i>

65
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,385
And my name is,

66
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:18,218
Ichigo Kurosaki!

67
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:45,385
Heh.

68
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:00,685
What the... They just
keep on coming!

69
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:06,552
Something's wrong here.
There are far too many
Hollows coming for that
small amount of bait I placed.

70
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:11,118
<i>It's as if they're being drawn</i>
<i>by an even greater force.</i>
<i>But what?</i>

71
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,452
Sensei!

72
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:14,452
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Uryu!</i>

73
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:15,352
Huh?

74
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:24,618
You say we're at opposite poles,
but I say when two warriors are
heavily outnumbered the trick is
to fight back to back!

75
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:26,418
Sounds like a plan!

76
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,685
What the? Ichigo!

77
00:09:48,118 --> 00:09:49,218
Look at the sky!

78
00:09:49,952 --> 00:09:50,985
What's that?!

79
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:11,418
Unff!

80
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:17,618
What's he doing?!

81
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:18,985
Nnnghh...

82
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:23,318
<i>I'm feeling extraordinary</i>
<i>Spiritual Pressure!</i>

83
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:26,618
<i>Ichigo's power is</i>
<i>actually increasing!</i>

84
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:32,218
RAAAAGGHHH!!

85
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:49,918
I-iiii win!!

86
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:03,918
Hee he he he he he he!

87
00:11:04,452 --> 00:11:08,052
Ehhe! hehe!! he he he!

88
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,352
<i>[Akon]</i>
<i>Hey, Hiyosu!</i>

89
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:10,685
Eh?

90
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:13,485
I thought you should know,
the Stealth Force has
turned in their report.

91
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:17,152
Mmmhee he he he he!
So, what does it say?

92
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:23,118
It's exactly as you suspected.
Your instincts are spot-on.
It's the missing criminal.

93
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:24,852
Yep. Knew I was right.

94
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,118
We shouldn't waste any time,
we need to get on this.

95
00:11:28,152 --> 00:11:30,852
We have to catch her and
retrieve the Gigai she's using.

96
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:34,418
I agree, but I have to say,
I'm surprised you were able
to find her.

97
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:37,285
Yeee hee he he he he!

98
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:40,285
It was kind of a
lucky turn of events.

99
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:45,052
I can't tell you why, but I felt
like watching some broadcasts
from the World of the Living.

100
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:49,785
<i>When I turned on the monitor,</i>
<i>I saw this playing. Just good</i>
<i>timing, I guess!</i>

101
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:55,652
You can say that again. It's
amazing but your hobby does come
in handy, every once in a while.

102
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:57,852
Admit it, you're jealous.

103
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:02,618
So, any indication as to
when they're going to
send us her Gigai?

104
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:05,185
Well, yeah, regarding that,

105
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:07,718
It looks to me like it's
going to be a while.

106
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:10,152
There are formal
procedures to go through.

107
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:13,618
In the meantime,
to cover themselves,
they sent a retrieval team.

108
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:18,552
Well! You don't say.
Who's on that team,
if I'm not being too nosy?

109
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:20,318
Mmmf.

110
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:21,485
I shouldn't say.

111
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:29,585
Roar, Zabimaru!
Now open your eyes!
See what lies before you!

112
00:12:30,685 --> 00:12:32,518
And fall upon your prey!

113
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:47,385
It's all over you little runt.
You've lost to Renji Abarai, and
will die where you stand!!!

114
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,118
[gasp]

115
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:55,752
[shaky breaths]

116
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:17,785
Not enough time!

117
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:26,718
Ah! What!?

118
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:39,285
<i>What just happened?</i>

119
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:41,885
You're slow.

120
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:43,985
Brother, don't do it!

121
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:17,644
Rgh! Why you!

122
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:28,844
See, I'm gonna keep pushing
you and pushing you.

123
00:14:28,877 --> 00:14:31,577
so you can
always remember that attack!

124
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,477
Am I making
myself clear?

125
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:44,244
When you counter,
you don't let
them cut you.

126
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:47,644
If you protect someone,
you don't let them die.

127
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:50,444
When you attack, you kill!

128
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:57,144
<i>Understand? Can't you see?</i>
<i>My sheer resolve to kill you</i>
<i>is reflected in my sword.</i>

129
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:14,144
Huh?

130
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,044
<i>When you counter,</i>
<i>don't let them cut you.</i>

131
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:22,177
Why you--!

132
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:23,744
<i>When you protect someone,</i>

133
00:15:26,044 --> 00:15:27,444
<i>...don't let them die.</i>

134
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,344
When you attack, you... kill!

135
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,810
<i>Wait for me Chad!</i>

136
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:52,310
<i>I'll beat this guy!</i>

137
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:58,044
<i>And then I'll save you!</i>
<i>I promise!!</i>

138
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:06,044
Sorry to say, but I don't
feel like dying just yet.

139
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:11,277
Because if I die, then
everyone who is counting on
me will be destroyed, too!

140
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:16,444
What is this? You're thinking
you can beat me now, aren't you?

141
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,477
Heh heh heh.

142
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:46,277
Ichigo, do you have complete
and utter trust in me?

143
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:48,277
It goes without saying.

144
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:52,044
I'm putting all of my power
in your hands, Zangetsu.

145
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:57,610
Do with me what you will
and lend me all your power
in order to win this fight!

146
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,977
[charge growl]
Huuaaa!

147
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,144
[charge growl]
Hrrrghh!

148
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:34,910
Huaaahh!

149
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:44,944
Huaaahh!

150
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:53,210
Huaaahh!

151
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:54,610
Ban...kai!

152
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,410
Tensa Zangetsu.

153
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,844
There could never be a Bankai
as small and fragile as that.

154
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,444
<i>And a lowly ryoka could</i>
<i>never attain Bankai.</i>

155
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:44,044
It's inconceivable.

156
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:15,877
<i>I've got him!</i>

157
00:19:23,444 --> 00:19:27,044
<i>Impossible! He sliced</i>
<i>through all of them!</i>

158
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:37,110
<i>[Byakuya]</i>
<i>Senkei, Senbonzakura</i>
<i>Kageyoshi.</i>

159
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:44,644
This senkei is the form I show
to only those special few
enemies,

160
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:48,410
<i>who are truly deserving</i>
<i>of my vow to kill them</i>
<i>with my own hands.</i>

161
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,544
Byakurai.

162
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:12,177
[shocked gasps]

163
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,810
It's over for you,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

164
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,577
Ngh, what'd you say?!

165
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:31,377
<i>My body...</i>
<i>I can't move!!</i>

166
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,444
You're only a human.

167
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:37,310
Though your spirit
has not been broken,
there is a limit to
what you can endure.

168
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,910
You have reached that limit.

169
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,544
This is the end,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

170
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:50,810
<i>It's all for nothing</i>
<i>if I don't win!</i>

171
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,877
<i>I want to win!</i>

172
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,144
<i>I...need to win!</i>

173
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:02,110
<i>[White Ichigo]</i>
<i>Tsk!</i>

174
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:10,777
<i>[White Ichigo]</i>
<i>I thought I told you already,</i>
<i>It's a big problem for me if</i>
<i>you get yourself killed.</i>

175
00:21:11,377 --> 00:21:12,544
That's impossible!

176
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,077
Who or what are you?!

177
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:20,344
[White Ichigo]
You wanna know who I am?
Hee he he he he!

178
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:21,844
I have...

179
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:23,877
No name!!

180
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:32,477
Hyaa! Hee-hee ha ha ha!

181
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,577
Ichigo, what a complete
amateur you are!

182
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:41,344
Ungh!! You fool!
Damn you!

183
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:45,110
What's this? Has he already
undergone Hollowfication?

184
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,444
Hello, Gin.

185
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,377
Oh, my. Don't tell
me it's all over.

186
00:21:56,877 --> 00:21:57,677
Hmf.

187
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:00,710
Believe me, there's
no need to worry.

188
00:22:01,377 --> 00:22:03,210
It's all going
according to plan.

189
00:22:04,144 --> 00:22:06,310
And everything
begins now.

190
00:23:45,745 --> 00:23:48,545
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>So why did you review all</i>
<i>those past battles today?</i>

191
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:51,378
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>I didn't want our viewers</i>
<i>to forget what had</i>
<i>happened up to this point.</i>

192
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:54,045
<i>Believe me, it wasn't because</i>
<i>I had forgotten about it.</i>

193
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:55,978
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>Is that right?</i>
<i>Well I certainly had.</i>

194
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:57,778
[Aizen]
Not me. I never forget anything.

195
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,645
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>Oh please.</i>
<i>You so did.</i>
<i>Admit it.</i>
