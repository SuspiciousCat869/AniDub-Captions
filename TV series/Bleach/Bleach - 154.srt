NARRATOR: To save Orihime, who
was kidnapped by the Arrancars,

3
00:01:51,197 --> 00:01:54,964
Ichigo, Chad, Arruruerie, Rukia,
and Renji have travelled to Las

4
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:57,764
Noches, Aizen's
fortress in Hueco Mundo,

5
00:01:57,797 --> 00:02:00,964
while constantly battling
the Arrancar forces.

6
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,030
Upon breaking into the
fortress, the group

7
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:05,864
decided to split up and
go down separate paths.

8
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:08,197
But waiting for
them were Arrancars

9
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,097
known as Primera Espada
guarding their pathways.

00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,597
I'm over here, fool!

13
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,097
-Huh?

[fighting noises]

15
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:45,564
-That wasn't even good enough
to be a warm up exercise.

16
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:04,630
NARRATOR: Also, as Rukia
travels down her chosen pathway,

17
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:07,130
a new Espada appears before her.

18
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,097
-[gasp]

19
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,497
What's this?

20
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,530
How can there be
blue skies here?

21
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:36,297
All I did was follow
that corridor.

22
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,930
And now I'm outside?

23
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:39,430
What's going on?

24
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:42,697
-Do you want me to
explain it to you?

25
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,830
-[gasp]

26
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:55,597
-Come with me.

27
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:02,330
-Wait!

28
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,030
ARRURUERIE: Hm.

29
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:25,997
Good.

30
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,464
I can finally relax now.

31
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:47,197
Sorry, but I simply cannot
stand the sunlight out there.

32
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,997
It does not reach
inside the palace.

33
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,430
Allow me to take off my
mask and greet you properly.

34
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:14,797
My name is Aaroniero,
Aaroniero Arruruerie,

35
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,730
also known as
Espada Number Nine.

36
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,530
-It can't be.

37
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:34,997
Lieutenant Shiba?

38
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,997
Answer me!

39
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,830
Please, answer me, Kaien.

40
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:45,930
Is that really-- is that
really you, Lieutenant?

41
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:46,930
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Wait.

42
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:49,064
What am I talking about?

43
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,030
Kaien Shiba-- he's dead.

44
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:01,830
What's going on?

45
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:04,364
He can't be here.

46
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:08,897
I killed him myself,
that night long ago.

47
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,764
-Heh.

48
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:12,530
Yeah, it's been awhile.

49
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:14,630
You're looking well, Rukia.

50
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:15,597
-[gasp]

51
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:21,297
Huh?

52
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,597
-These tight clothes are
really hard to move around in.

53
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,630
-Lieutenant Shiba?

54
00:06:27,664 --> 00:06:29,097
-Huh?

55
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,730
Hey, what's with that
puzzled look on your face?

56
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:32,764
Come on.

57
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:34,797
Aren't you glad that
your beloved Kaien

58
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,430
Shiba is alive and well?

59
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,597
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): It
is Lieutenant Shiba.

60
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:50,864
This feeling again, like
the warmth of the sun,

61
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:53,564
slowly moving over my hand.

62
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:57,430
It's Lieutenant Shiba's warmth.

63
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:00,364
But that was then.

64
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,897
[gasp] A wooden sword?

65
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,030
-Here, take it.

66
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:18,130
It's been a long time
since we trained together.

67
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:19,597
-[gasp]

68
00:07:24,964 --> 00:07:28,530
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): This is Squad
13's former training ground.

69
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:32,697
-There it is again.

70
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,997
It's that same exact
puzzled expression.

71
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,164
Come on, take a stance.

72
00:07:38,197 --> 00:07:41,964
If you're not going to
make a move, then I will.

73
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:47,897
[fighting noises]

74
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,464
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): The heaviness
of his swing, his footwork--

75
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:55,197
I-- I-- remember all of it.

76
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,030
-Your side's open.

77
00:08:01,997 --> 00:08:03,730
Hey, what's wrong with you?

78
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:05,164
Don't tell me you're
giving up just

79
00:08:05,197 --> 00:08:07,064
after a little
round of sparring?

80
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:08,697
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Even his unreserved,

81
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,697
blunt way of speaking
is still the same.

82
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,864
-What did you just say?

83
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:16,464
-[gasp]

84
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,530
-I am your commanding officer!

85
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:19,997
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Lieutenant Shiba

86
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:26,264
was like that, ever since
the first day I met him.

87
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,730
-[shout]

88
00:08:27,764 --> 00:08:29,030
-You're too slow!

89
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:43,564
If this had been a real
battle, you'd be dead by now.

90
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:49,197
Heh.

91
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,964
Well, at least it looks
like you've gotten stronger.

92
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:55,330
-[gasp]

93
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:58,164
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): He
hasn't changed at all.

94
00:08:58,197 --> 00:08:59,864
Not one bit.

95
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:00,997
Lieutenant Shiba.

96
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,564
-Haven't changed, have you?

97
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:14,830
Same old Rukia.

98
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:16,630
Whenever I beat
you, you always look

99
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,930
like you're about to
cry your eyes out.

100
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:24,297
-[gasp] It really is you, Kaien.

101
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,764
-Well, it looks like you
finally believe me now.

102
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:33,964
Let's see.

103
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:36,230
I know they're around
here somewhere.

104
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:37,764
Ah, there they are.

105
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:39,964
Catch!

106
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,264
Have a seat.

107
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:43,364
You and I have got an awful
lot of catching up to do.

108
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,897
That last night,
my physical body

109
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,897
began to crumble right
after the battle.

110
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,564
And later, when I was finishing
saying my goodbyes to the Shiba

111
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:55,830
home, I disintegrated.

112
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,697
That Hallow was of the
Aizen's test subjects.

113
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:06,964
After being destroyed,
it returned Hueco Mundo

114
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:09,030
and regenerated itself.

115
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:12,330
Apparently, that's
how it was designed.

116
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:14,597
-I can't believe it.

117
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,030
-The Hollow had fused
its body to mine.

118
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:20,364
And when it regenerated, it
came back in my physical form.

119
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:24,064
I guess it probably all went
according to their master plan.

120
00:10:24,097 --> 00:10:26,964
But for some reason, after the
regeneration was completed,

121
00:10:26,997 --> 00:10:31,264
my mind was the one in
charge of our combined body.

122
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,230
Basically, I guess,
my iron willpower

123
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:36,630
was beyond their calculations
and threw a wrench

124
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:37,497
into their works.

125
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,730
[laughs] How great am I?

126
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,097
They never saw anyone
like me before.

127
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:42,997
[laughs]

128
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,364
-Lieutenant!

129
00:10:44,397 --> 00:10:47,664
I thought we were having
a serious conversation.

130
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:48,730
-Uh, well, yeah.

131
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:50,497
We were.

132
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,964
But I-- well, you
were looking so glum.

133
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:55,797
-That's because I've been
taking this seriously!

134
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,630
-OK, OK.

135
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:58,530
Don't get so upset.

136
00:10:58,564 --> 00:11:02,597
Anyway, that's the story
of how I got my body back.

137
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,297
I took one of the
Espada's places,

138
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,197
and I've been waiting
ever since for a chance

139
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,764
to get my revenge on Aizen.

140
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:14,564
Outside, you saw the blue skies.

141
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:18,130
Aizen created those blue
skies on Las Noches' ceiling,

142
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:20,397
like paint on a canvas.

143
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,897
Everything the light from
those blue skies touches

144
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,697
is under Aizen's
watchful surveillance.

145
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:32,197
RUKIA: Is that the reason why
you brought the inside here?

146
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:39,197
-Rukia, I'm just glad that it
was you who ended up in here.

147
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,930
I've got a plan,
and I think you're

148
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:43,497
the only person who can help
me pull it off successfully.

149
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,197
Let's move somewhere else.

150
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,830
Come.

151
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:49,797
Follow me, Rukia.

152
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,297
-OK.

153
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:58,330
-[laugh]

154
00:11:58,364 --> 00:11:59,830
-[gasp]

155
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,164
ARRURUERIE: Well, well.

156
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:15,597
You improved a lot more
than I thought, Rukia.

157
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:26,430
CIFER: I'm here for an update.

158
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:28,830
Has anyone reaching
an Espada palace yet?

159
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:29,330
-Hm?

160
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:35,297
Sorry for ignoring you,
but it's so unusual for you

161
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,130
to be speaking to me.

162
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:39,930
I always got the feeling
that you disliked me.

163
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:41,530
-Of course not.

164
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:42,597
-Really?

165
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,264
If that's the case, then
let's make an effort

166
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,430
to be nicer to each
other from now on.

167
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:49,264
I've been so lonely
since Luppi died.

168
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:51,864
I used to shoot the breeze
with him quite a bit.

169
00:12:54,664 --> 00:12:55,930
-What is this?

170
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:57,397
-Oh, isn't it fantastic?

171
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,530
-Controlling the passageways?

172
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:00,597
-Oh, come on.

173
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,964
I would never do
something mean like that.

174
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:08,940
It's just that I
enjoy happy endings.

175
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:24,911
-[whimper]

176
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:29,582
-What's wrong?

177
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:32,815
You have that puzzled expression
on your face again, Rukia?

178
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,482
This makes me so happy.

179
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:40,115
Back in the day,
that attack would

180
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:41,682
have killed you instantly.

181
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:46,215
It's very gratifying
to see my student grow.

182
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,815
-Tell me, what's the truth?

183
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:52,649
How much is really true?

184
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:55,549
-What do you mean
how much is true?

185
00:13:55,582 --> 00:13:56,782
All of it.

186
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,215
Did you think that I was a fake?

187
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,115
What, is there something
strange about a scenario where

188
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,615
I'm trying to kill you?

189
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:11,449
You haven't forgotten, have you?

190
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:13,182
-I am Kaien Shiba.

191
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:17,015
I'm the former lieutenant of
Squad 13, here in Hueco Mundo

192
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,615
because I was fused
with a Hollow.

193
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,149
And you-- you're Rukia Kuchiki.

194
00:14:23,182 --> 00:14:25,782
You're one who took my life.

195
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:27,282
-[gasp]

196
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:37,815
-Do you understand now
why I want to kill you?

197
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:42,249
Come now, Rukia.

198
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,215
You haven't forgotten,
have you, that feeling you

199
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:47,715
had when you stabbed me?

200
00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:53,415
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): No,
I haven't forgotten.

201
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:59,849
All of that happened,
just like he said.

202
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:04,615
He's telling the truth.

203
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:10,282
-So are you prepared to
be killed by me, Rukia?

204
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:16,615
I'm asking if you're
prepared, prepared

205
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,749
to atone for your crime by
dying at the hands of the man

206
00:15:19,782 --> 00:15:20,482
that you murdered.

207
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:26,915
-Yes, I am.

208
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:39,515
However, not right now.

209
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:41,949
I need you to wait.

210
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,215
I had to run away.

211
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:50,315
But no matter how
far I ran, I didn't

212
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:54,015
thin that sin
would ever go away,

213
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:56,615
no matter how many years passed.

214
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:02,782
But if killing me can take
away the burden and grudge you

215
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:10,149
have against me, I will
gladly offer you my life.

216
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:17,582
Bu first, I came to Hueco Mundo
to bring Orihime back home.

217
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:21,682
I came here to save my friend!

218
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,149
No matter what you
say or how I feel,

219
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:26,782
until I have saved Orihime
and returned safely

220
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:29,615
to the World of the Living,
I can't give you my life.

221
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:38,882
-Heh.

222
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,482
Relax, it was all just a joke?

223
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:43,415
-Huh?

224
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:46,082
-I was just kidding around.

225
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:48,849
You deserve to die
for killing me,

226
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,449
but I'd never think
of doing something

227
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:54,082
as silly as killing you
for my personal revenge.

228
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:59,182
I told you, I have a plan
that only you can help with.

229
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:02,582
-[gasp]

230
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:05,115
-If you really want to make
up for the terrible thing

231
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,815
you once did to me,
then I have something

232
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,849
you can do for me now, Rukia.

233
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:15,249
-Something I can do for you?

234
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:15,749
-Yeah.

235
00:17:21,382 --> 00:17:24,949
I want you to bring me the
heads of your four friends.

236
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:26,315
-[gasp]

237
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,949
-You're familiar with all of
their abilities and weaknesses,

238
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,949
so you don't have to
worry about getting hurt.

239
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:34,949
It shouldn't be too difficult
to catch them off guard.

240
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:36,815
-[gasp]

241
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,582
-If you do this, we'll wipe
the slate clean between us.

242
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:43,215
And I'll completely
forgive you for killing me.

243
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:44,482
You see?

244
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:45,782
Pretty simple, huh?

245
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,682
I would say it's an
awfully small price

246
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:51,515
to pay for taking my life,
don't you think, Rukia?

247
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:53,982
Well?

248
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:57,649
What's wrong, Rukia?

249
00:17:57,682 --> 00:18:01,215
-You're not going to say it's
a joke this time, are you?

250
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:03,182
-Rukia.

251
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,849
-You want me to kill
my friends for you?

252
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:09,482
Something like that
could never be a joke.

253
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:10,615
No.

254
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:13,215
You'd never joke about
something like that.

255
00:18:15,982 --> 00:18:19,515
Don't you dare
insult Kaien Shiba!

256
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:27,615
There's no way you can
truly be Kaien Shiba.

257
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,582
The Lieutenant Shiba
I knew would never

258
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:33,915
make jokes like that to
test his subordinates.

259
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:36,615
The Kaien in I knew
would never force someone

260
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:41,782
to choose between their friends
and themselves, no matter what!

261
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:45,949
The Kaien Shiba that I knew,
that everyone in Squad 13

262
00:18:45,982 --> 00:18:50,482
loved and respected, that
man was nothing like you!

263
00:18:59,744 --> 00:19:03,082
Even after I stabbed him, as
his lungs filled up with blood

264
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:05,015
and he could barely
breathe anymore, but still

265
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:08,315
put up with the pain just
so that he could speak to me

266
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:09,349
one final time.

267
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:16,882
-But thanks to you, I'm saved.

268
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:19,949
Now I can still
leave my heart here.

269
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:23,049
-No.

270
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:24,215
Wait, Rukia.

271
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,349
Of course I'm Kaien.

272
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:26,482
What are you talking about?

273
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:28,882
-Don't ever say that name again!

There's nowhere left

-I think you're forgetting.

Remember that I'm the
one who taught you

285

how to fight in the first place.

[sigh] I'm so disappointed.

287
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:37,215
You got a little
better, but not much.

288
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,715
You should be stronger by now.

to kill the same man twice.

while we're fighting.
