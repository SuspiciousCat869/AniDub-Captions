-Uryu!

00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:05,505
-Uryu!

5
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:22,736
-Why does that idiot always act
like he's some kind of hero?

6
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:27,203
He starts thinking he's a burden
to us, so we just walks away.

7
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:28,869
-He left.

8
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:30,536
How-- how could be?

9
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,803
-Well, I won't let
him dump us like that!

10
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:36,903
-That's right! 'Cause he's
not even a garbage man.

11
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:39,269
-I've never seen you
this-- this angry.

12
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:40,503
-Well, I am.

13
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,736
And I'm gonna find him, and
nurse him back to health

00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:44,203

URYU (OFFSCREEN):
Back then, if I

17
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:37,504
had every last bit of my
strength, maybe--

18
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:51,469
I don't know.

19
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:53,436
Maybe I could have
thrown her off my trail.

20
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:00,136
But I didn't do that.

21
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:01,903
So then why--

22
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:03,736
-Why what?

23
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,536
Why did I save you?

24
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,469
Is that what you want to know?

25
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:11,903
Because of something
I saw in your eyes.

26
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:14,736
You find what I say difficult
to believe, don't you?

27
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:26,403
-You are being
targeted by the Bounts.

28
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:27,969
Your friends wanted
to protect you,

29
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:31,236
but you knew if you stayed with
them, you'd put them in danger.

30
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:34,836
That's why even in your weak
condition, you ran away.

31
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:37,303
It's sad, because you're damned
if you do and damned if you

32
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:38,369
don't.

33
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,769
-So you felt sorry for me?

34
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,403
Somehow I didn't picture you
as the sentimental type who's

35
00:04:44,436 --> 00:04:48,136
overly concerned
about how people feel.

36
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,836
-There was a time
when I was like that.

37
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:54,836
A time when I looked at the
world through sentimental eyes.

38
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:56,969
Those warm feelings
are gone now,

39
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:59,403
replaced by an empty chill.

40
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:02,369
The passage of time
has worn them all away.

[bells ringing]

42
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,969
-Wow, those bells.

43
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:15,069
The sound goes
right through you.

44
00:05:15,103 --> 00:05:17,669
-I guess it does when
you're not used to it.

45
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:19,736
I've been hearing those
bells for so long now,

46
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,769
it doesn't affect me anymore.

47
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:28,203
Not the sound of the bells,
or the passage of time.

48
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:31,103
-So is that the way
it's been for you?

49
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:34,269
Watching over this
town as time passes by,

50
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:37,736
all alone, uninvolved
with anyone?

51
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:39,603
-It's strange.

52
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:42,436
Almost like I'm
separated from reality.

53
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:44,636
But As I watch those
people busily going

54
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,436
through their lives, I
don't feel so lonely.

55
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:51,003
-Do you mind if I ask
you a personal question?

56
00:05:51,036 --> 00:05:53,903
Why have you chosen not to
live with the other Bounts?

57
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:57,969
-I once thought that living with
my kind was the right thing.

58
00:05:58,003 --> 00:06:02,603
But that was a
long, long time ago.

59
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:04,103
-It's been a long time.

60
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:06,703
A nearly unimaginable
amount of time

61
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:08,336
in which we have
been forced to cling

62
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,869
to the shadows of history.

63
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,436
During that time, we have been
ostracized and endured cruelty

64
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:17,703
beyond that of any
civilization in history.

65
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:21,336
But we have persevered,
and that is all behind us.

66
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:24,003
The time for the Bounts to
be released from the darkness

67
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:26,103
is finally approaching.

68
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:31,336
-All this time to think, giving
our imaginations infinite fuel.

69
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:35,336
Allowing them to poison our
minds with foolish ambitions.

70
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:37,803
All things because of time.

71
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:39,903
-How strange.

72
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:43,169
Someone who obviously hates
time as much as you do

73
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:47,836
would punish yourself by
living next to this clock.

74
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:49,503
Why would you do that?

75
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:52,236
Could it be that you're
expecting something?

76
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:55,636
Like a chance to really live,
instead of just marking time?

77
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:58,536
Why else would you put
yourself through that torture?

78
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:00,003
-That's a good question.

79
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:03,936
But if it were possible,
I think I'd like to die.

80
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:07,003
-Do you really want to die?

81
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:09,503
-One of the curses of eternal
life is that after a while,

82
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:12,069
you start to believe that
you can do anything you want.

83
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:13,869
Sometimes it becomes
difficult to tell

84
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:16,903
the difference between
yourself and a god.

85
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,269
Sounds foolish, doesn't it?

86
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:21,069
-All right, Master Kariya.

87
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:23,503
We've been waiting long enough.

88
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:28,069
I think we're all curious
why you called us here.

89
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:31,369
-We have reached
our first objective.

90
00:07:31,403 --> 00:07:32,136
-Hm.

91
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:33,936
So a Quincy has been found.

92
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:35,836
-Hmph.

93
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:38,236
I'm going to need
all of your help.

94
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:42,903
You, the chosen Bounts, must
join me to capture this Quincy.

95
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:46,769
The time has come for us
to gain absolute power,

96
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:50,336
and begin the glorious
era of the Bounts.

97
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,136
-No way!

98
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:55,169
Maki Ichinose's
spiritual pressure?

99
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:57,236
-We have irrefutable
evidence confirming

100
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,736
he's definitely in the
world of the living.

101
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:00,736
Right, Aramaki?

102
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:01,236
-Huh?

103
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:02,436
Uh, yeah.

104
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:04,336
We've been looking for
him all over the place

105
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:05,603
without any luck.

106
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:07,503
Then all of a sudden we pick
up this spiritual pressure

107
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:09,069
that's definitely his.

108
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:12,103
Captain Hitsugaya and
Captain Ukitake felt it, too.

109
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:14,203
I heard them talking
about it earlier.

110
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:16,036
-Is that what you
think, Maki Maki?

111
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,869
That Maki is somewhere in the
world of the living right now?

112
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:21,069
-Well, yeah. it
certainly looks that way.

113
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:22,903
-We all thought Maki
was dead, Maki Maki,

114
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:26,603
but you think Maki's
alive, Maki Maki?

115
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:30,603
-Um, I'm sorry, but when you
call me Maki Maki and him Maki,

116
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:31,903
I get a little confused.

117
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:32,869
-What?

118
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:33,869
How's that?

119
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:35,636
You're Maki Maki,
and Maki is Maki.

120
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,603
How can you possibly
confuse Maki Maki with Maki?

121
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:40,569
-That's just what
I'm talking about!

122
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,969
It's confusing!

123
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:44,469
-I think the name Maki Maki is
a little weird to begin with,

124
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:44,969
don't you?

125
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:45,969
-Oh, yeah?

126
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:47,569
Well, who the hell
asked you, anyway?

127
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:51,069
-Any idea of what he's doing
in the world of the living?

128
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:52,236
-No.

129
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,136
-What do you want us to do?

130
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:55,869
-Leave him alone.

131
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:59,336
-But still, I kind of feel
responsible for what happened.

132
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:02,036
I'm sure you must feel the
same way too, don't you, Kenny?

133
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:02,903
-It doesn't matter.

136
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:26,536
-Wait!

137
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:28,769
Kenpachi, you bastard.

138
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:31,169
How could you do
this to the captain?

139
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,136
I cannot accept this!

140
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:34,903
-Huh?

141
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:36,503
What's the problem?

142
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:37,236
-Don't do it!

143
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:39,203
Please, don't do this!

144
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:40,336
-Let go!

145
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:41,736
-The match was witnessed
by 200 Squad members,

146
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,136
making it official.

147
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:46,503
The new captain of Squad
11 is Kenpachi Zaraki.

148
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:47,669
Stand down!

149
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:51,836
It is forbidden to
draw your sword here.

150
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:54,003
-Don't bore me with this crap.

151
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,436
Now listen up, everyone!

152
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:58,036
I plan on doing things my way!

153
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:00,103
If there's anyone who
wants to leave, then go.

154
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:01,303
I won't try to stop you.

155
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,636
-Come on, Maki.

156
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:08,436
You're not really going
to leave, are you?

157
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,503
-I have no choice.

158
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:13,903
-Are you still holding
a grudge against Kenny?

159
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:15,103
-That's not it.

160
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:17,569
I know that the fight
was fair and official,

161
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:21,036
and that Captain Zaraki
did nothing wrong.

162
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:21,969
-Then why?

163
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:23,769
Why are you going?

164
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,303
-I'm sorry.

165
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:28,836
I simply don't have
the desire to stay.

166
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:35,936
Besides, I swore an oath
of loyalty to the man

167
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,303
that you murdered.

168
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,903
My former captain.

169
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:41,069
-Do whatever you want.

170
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,869
YACHIRU (OFFSCREEN): I'm
just glad he's still alive.

171
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:53,103
Aren't you?

172
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:54,703
He looked so depressed that day.

173
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:57,503
I thought he might kill himself.

174
00:10:57,536 --> 00:11:00,003
-Someone is probably
keeping him alive,

175
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:01,703
although I don't know
who would do that.

176
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,203
-Mr. Ichinose, I'm
curious to hear

177
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:17,036
what you think Master
Kariya's real objective is.

178
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:18,836
I mean, once he
catches this Quincy,

179
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,803
what does he plan
on doing with him?

180
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:22,269
-Who knows?

181
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:24,769
It is not my place
to question him.

182
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:27,336
I simply obey Master
Kariya's orders.

183
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:30,869
-Because life is simple
that way, isn't it?

184
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:33,336
When you let him make
your decisions for you,

185
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:35,903
when you trust in his
judgment entirely,

186
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:38,203
there's no need to
think for yourself.

187
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:42,403
-So tell me, then,
what are you thinking?

188
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,036
-That's a good question.

189
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:46,536
I'll let you know
when I figure it out.

190
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,369
-Uryu!

191
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:01,869
-Eh?

192
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:08,536
-Sorry about that.

193
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,536
Damn.

194
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,036
Where the hell have you gone?

195
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,536
Uryu!

196
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:44,391
-It's so stark here.

197
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:46,225
It's kind of depressing.

198
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:47,591
You know what you could use?

199
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,558
-I've found that possessions
only complicate things.

200
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:52,358
They're too much of a burden.

201
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:53,658
Life is easier this way.

202
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:57,458
-I suppose that makes sense.

203
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:04,591
Sometimes, even things
I should be thankful for

204
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,591
feel like a burden.

205
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,058
-Another day is
coming to an end.

206
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:20,591
Sometimes, as I look down
from here at the humans,

207
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:25,191
I think, we live for
hundreds of years.

208
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:29,291
Humans are so shortsighted
compared to us.

209
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:32,591
But then again, it
could be a blessing.

210
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,325
Maybe they view
the world that way

211
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:37,058
because they know
their time is limited.

212
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:39,058
They don't take
life for granted,

213
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:41,191
and work as hard as they can.

214
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:42,225
That's why they're happy.

215
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:57,025
A long time ago, back when I
was still just a young girl,

216
00:13:57,058 --> 00:14:00,058
I remember feeling
that I was different.

217
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:04,025
That I wasn't like
everyone else.

218
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:06,591
I wanted to hide it,
to keep it a secret.

219
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:16,991
I tried desperately to
keep it from my friends.

220
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,125
They wouldn't understand.

221
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:26,391
As time went by, I realized
it was impossible for them

222
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:27,158
not to notice.

223
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,991
[groan]

224
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:44,791
-After all, everyone and
everything around me was aging.

225
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:47,625
Only I remained the same.

226
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:51,258
It was as if I were
watching history pass me by,

227
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,291
and I was the only
one left behind.

228
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,791
Never changing.

229
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:56,958
Trapped in the moment.

230
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:02,991
I continued to move
forward in time,

231
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:06,091
but I felt like time
had abandoned me.

232
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:10,891
[crowd shouting]

233
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:12,358
-Find her!

234
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:13,158
-Yes!

235
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:13,925
-She's a witch!

236
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,725
I saw it with my own eyes!

237
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:16,691
-Get her!

238
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:18,158
-Kill the witch!

239
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:21,525
YOSHINO (NARRATING): I hated
myself as much as they did.

240
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:27,558
As the days passed, all I could
think of were ways to die.

241
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:30,091
Driven by loneliness
and despair,

242
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,458
I decided to end my own life.

243
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:33,891
[door opening]

244
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:41,658
YOSHINO (NARRATING):
That's when he appeared.

245
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:48,925
-There's no need to be afraid.

246
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,191
I am like you.

247
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:53,625
URYU (OFFSCREEN):
That was Kariya?

248
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:55,925
YOSHINO (NARRATING): He asked
me to come live with him,

249
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,525
and he promised to show
me a reason to live.

250
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,591
-I want to tell you what my
reason for living is, Yoshino.

251
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,358
It's you.

252
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,425
There's one thing
I know for certain.

253
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,491
A Bount's love is deep,
as deep as the ocean.

254
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:41,625
It knows no limits, and
continues to grow eternally.

255
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:47,391
We have been giving
infinite life,

256
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:49,358
in which to experience
infinite bliss.

257
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,791
YOSHINO (NARRATING):
Eternal love.

258
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,191
There was a time when I truly
believed it was possible.

259
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,525
But I know better now.

260
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:21,491
It doesn't exist.

261
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:25,525
The word eternal, it only has
significance for you humans

262
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:27,758
because you know
your life is limited.

263
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:32,425
But to a Bount like me, it's
just a meaningless word.

264
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,525
-So it wasn't true?

265
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:35,891
The promises?

266
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:40,191
And the love between you
wasn't infinite, like you said?

267
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,225
-Thinking back, I'm
not sure there was ever

268
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:45,558
any love to begin with.

269
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:48,625
When I looked into his
eyes, I thought I saw hope.

270
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:50,091
But it was an illusion.

271
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,225
-What do you mean?

272
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:54,925
-He knew what I wanted to
see, and he lit his eyes

273
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:55,991
with the light of hope.

274
00:17:56,025 --> 00:17:57,991
I was so blinded
by it, I couldn't

275
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:00,758
see the ambition that
lay in the shadows.

276
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,258
-Ambition?

277
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:07,291
-The power hold.

278
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:10,158
Kariya has searched the world
to gather the remaining Bounts

279
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:11,258
together.

280
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,925
I think he intends
to go to Hueco Mundo.

281
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,491
If he does, he knows
he'll be able to gain

282
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:19,258
unlimited power there.

283
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,625
Enough power to
make the Bounts--

284
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:26,091
no-- to make himself
an ultimate god.

285
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,291
-That's insane.

286
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:29,425
If he does that, he'll
be going against nature,

287
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,358
and breaking all the rules he
should be fighting to protect!

288
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,925
-A god has no rules to follow.

289
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,191
A god can do whatever he wants.

290
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:38,491
-But even so--

291
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,991
-That's why I saved your
life and brought you here.

292
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:45,325
I will do whatever it
takes to stop Kariya!

293
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,925
-Yeah, but you loved him once.

294
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,158
Do you still?

295
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:51,791
-How could I?

296
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:54,758
I could never forgive
him for what he's done.

297
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:59,091
I may not have much, but I
still have some humanity.

298
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:03,191
I will never be able to forgive
Kariya for losing his humanity.

299
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,658
-What do you mean?

300
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:09,725
-Kariya took the soul of
a living person, then used

301
00:19:09,758 --> 00:19:12,458
the same mouth to
tell me he loved me.

302
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:21,791
[groaning]

303
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:22,991
[gasp]

304
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:30,125
YOSHINO (NARRATING): I couldn't
forgive Kariya for that.

305
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:32,291
But what was truly
unforgivable was the fact

306
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:34,791
that I was completely
unable to stop him.

307
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,691
It's ironic, though.

308
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:41,858
His lies are what gave
me the hope to live,

309
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:43,825
but only through the
pain of his betrayal

310
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:47,058
did I discover that I
still have a human heart.

311
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:49,991
And that gave me
a reason to live.

312
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:51,658
-So now that you know
you want to live,

313
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,858
what do you plan to do?

314
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:56,191
-I will defeat Kariya.

315
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:57,725
-But how can you?

316
00:19:57,758 --> 00:20:00,225
I'd be willing to
help you if I could.

317
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:03,191
I'd do anything, but--

318
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:07,558
-I know you would, and it's
very kind of you to say so.

319
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:10,491
But I think you've already
suffered more than enough.

320
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:13,091
I intend to deal
with Kariya myself.

321
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,658
All I want you to do is
stay here in this room

322
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:17,558
until your wounds have healed.

323
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,858
-Do you have any
hope of winning?

324
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:20,325
-Absolutely.

325
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:25,791
That's a good question,
but if it were possible,

326
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,725
I think I'd like to die.

327
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:28,791
-That's a lie.

328
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:30,491
-A lie?

329
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:33,125
What makes you think
I'd lie to you?

330
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:33,958
-It's just that--

331
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:39,891
-Listen to me.

332
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:43,791
You must not allow yourself to
be captured by Kariya's men.

333
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,925
I haven't figured out why, but
for some reason the success

334
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,491
of his plan all seems
to revolve around you.

335
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:53,391
-What use could I be, now
that I've lost my powers?

336
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:55,858
-I wouldn't be so sure
about that if I were you.

337
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:58,191
Think about it.

338
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:01,491
I think it's very possible
that the Quincy power still

339
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:05,025
lies buried somewhere
deep within you.

340
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:05,525
Live.

341
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:08,725
-Wait!

342
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:22,058
Well, I, uh-- I just
realized that at that moment,

343
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,191
I could have run away from you.

344
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:28,391
If I had wanted
to, I could have.

345
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:30,658
I chose not to run away.

346
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:34,391
But up until just now,
I didn't understand why.

347
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:35,691
-And why is that?

348
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:38,491
-Because of your eyes.

349
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:40,525
I saw something.

350
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,691
And what I think I saw
was the faintest glimmer

351
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:46,991
of hope hidden behind those
dark, lonely eyes of yours.

352
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,525
You haven't given in to despair.

353
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,858
The light of hope still
burns bright within you.

354
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:55,125
Listen.

355
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:59,158
I'm willing to make any
sacrifice in order to help you.

356
00:21:59,191 --> 00:22:01,025
I don't know what I can
do in this condition,

357
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:05,291
but even so, I will go with
you and do whatever I can.

358
00:22:12,758 --> 00:22:15,825
-You're sweet for such
a serious looking boy.

359
00:22:15,858 --> 00:22:24,758

ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): There's a
Soul Reaper among the enemy.

363
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:07,447
He's probably some kind
of whack job battle freak,

364
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,713
or a crazy eyed mad scientist.

365
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:09,747
KENPACHI (OFFSCREEN): Oh.

366
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,180
I wonder who that could be?

367
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:13,813
MAN (OFFSCREEN): I'd like to
hear more about this person.

368
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:15,247
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Huh?

369
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,247
Ah!

370
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,113
I'm sorry!

371
00:24:19,147 --> 00:24:28,680

KON (OFFSCREEN): Illustrated
Guide To Soul Reapers!

00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:31,813
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Golden!

374
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,513
-I still don't know why we
have to come to Health Land

375
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:37,413
to do this work.

376
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:38,513
-Oh come on, relax.

377
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:40,113
We can meet in the
lounge after you've

378
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,747
had a nice, long, hot bath,
and a relaxing massage.

379
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,913
You'll feel 100%
more productive.

380
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:45,580
-Hey!

381
00:24:45,613 --> 00:24:46,280
-Sorry.

382
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:47,380
He can't come in alone.

383
00:24:47,413 --> 00:24:48,847
It's our policy.

384
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,413
Children must be accompanied
by a parent or guardian.

385
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:54,847
-Oh.

386
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,680
Fine.

387
00:24:55,713 --> 00:24:56,513
Then we'll go the womens' bath

388
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:57,013
-Hey!

389
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:59,347
Rangiku!
