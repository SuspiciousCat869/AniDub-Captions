00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,466
Mappy, it's you!

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,833
You're looking well!

00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:10,966
[laughs]

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,600
Aaah! Aah!

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,633
I'll destroy that Hollow!

Heh!

10
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,201
Ooooh!

11
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:20,701
Awesome, Kenny!
Keep it going!
Do more!

12
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:27,267
Yachiru! I'm going for
a little work-out.
Go find somewhere else to play!

13
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,234
Okay, sure!

14
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,601
Oh!? Oooh...

15
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,167
Ha ha!

16
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:42,734
Hmm...

17
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:45,034
Hah!

18
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,434
Haa!

19
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:52,201
Aw...

20
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:53,934
Was that...?

21
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:59,601
Hmmm. That's odd.

22
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:03,134
I thought I sensed a
familiar Spiritual Pressure.

23
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:04,801
Hmm! Who was it?

24
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:16,801
Dear Father... Mother...

25
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:18,801
[rustling]

26
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:19,601

Huh?
Hm!

00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:34,501
<i>No! Help!</i>

31
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:35,534
Aah! Aaah!

33
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,367
Uh!

34
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:49,334
Are you all right?

35
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:51,434
Uh, I'm fine!

36
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:58,001
Thank you so much,
Mr. Soul Reaper.

37
00:03:58,234 --> 00:03:59,934
That Hollow was...

38
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:02,034
The one that
killed my family!

39
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:05,134
Now all of them will
be able to rest in peace.

40
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:06,334

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

42
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,434
Huh?

43
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:15,201
If I had only come here
sooner, maybe I could've
saved your family.

44
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:19,567
There's no need for
you to apologize here.

45
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,134
No, it was my fault.

46
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:21,834
Huh?

47
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:23,901
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,734
Well I... My name is
Mayu, by the way.

49
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,867
Would you mind telling
me your name?

50
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:35,234
<i>I am Masayoshi.</i>

51
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,834
My written characters,
spell "justice."

52
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:40,734
Masayoshi...

53
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:42,534
[Yachiru]
Mappy??

54
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:43,534
Uh?

55
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:47,934
Yachi? Why it is you!
It's been a while!

56
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:49,967
Mappy, it's you!

57
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:51,267
You're looking well!

58
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:53,534
[laughs]

59
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:00,267
So then, is this enough
wood for our fire?

60
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,167
<i>Sure, more than enough!</i>

61
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:07,501
That should last us
until tomorrow morning.
Thanks you two.

62
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:10,334
Want some konpeito?
It's candy!

63
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,167
Oh! Yes please!

64
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:13,634
Here you go!

65
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:16,634
Thank you very much.

66
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,101
Mappy, want some?

67
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:22,734
Nope.
Not for me thanks.

68
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,434
I just don't like sweets.

69
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:32,034
<i>[Masayoshi]</i>
<i>I see. So not only are you</i>
<i>the lieutenant of Squad 11,</i>

70
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:35,967
You're the Women's Soul
Reaper Association
chairwoman as well?

71
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:38,201
You're really busy.
That's great!

72
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,567
Um-hm! I am!

73
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:42,667
And what've you
been doing Mappy?

74
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:47,301
I've been travelling
as part of a partisan
squad, going after
drifting Hollows.

75
00:05:47,634 --> 00:05:49,267
That sounds like
hard work.

76
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:52,867
It's not that tough.
It's like being on
the road.

77
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,801
It's really the
perfect job for me.

78
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:58,501
Staying at home,
isn't much fun.

79
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,734
So then you don't
have a family?

80
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,467
I had a wife.

81
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:06,101
She's gone?

82
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,934
She was killed... by a Hollow.

83
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:11,534
[gasp]

84
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:17,667
That last day, we got into
a fight over nothing.

85
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,834
And I left for work without
making up with her.

86
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:26,967
Several weeks later,
when I finally got back
after finishing my
assignment on the road,

87
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,201
[roar]

88
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:41,501
I wish I could have at least
told her... That I was sorry.

89
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:46,367
Her forgiveness meant
everything to me.

90
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:54,634
[sigh] I absolutely
despise Hollows.
I will get rid of them.

91
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:57,234
I will destroy each
and every Hollow.

92
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:01,067
And some day, I'll cut down
the Hollow that took my wife!

93
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:07,701
<i>I will to see to it, that</i>
<i>not another single person</i>
<i>has to suffer like Mayu and</i>
<i>I have because of Hollows!</i>

94
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:12,301
That's my only goal, to
eradicate them from existence!

95
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:19,334
[sigh] Sorry ladies.
I sort of get carried away.

96
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:21,967
It's fine!
I'm rooting for you!

97
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:25,667
I hope you continue your quest
until you defeat every Hollow!

98
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:27,401
You can do it, Mappy!

99
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:29,767
Thanks!

100
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,934
Masayoshi is just
amazing, Isn't he?

101
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,267
Who, Mappy?

102
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:44,101
Yes. He's so brave.

103
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:45,201
Huh?

104
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:48,134
Oh, if you go
straight from here,

105
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,167
you'll come to the
forest you were talking
about, Yachiru.

106
00:07:51,534 --> 00:07:53,167
But, it's
quite a walk.

107
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:57,467
That's no problem!
Instead of walking,
I'll just run the
whole way there!

108
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,701
Thank you for showing
me the way back home!

109
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:04,367
Um, thanks Ma... Ma...?

110
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,034
It's "Mayu."

111
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:08,267
"Mayu-Mayu!" See ya!

112
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:11,734
That WAS fast!

113
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,701
What's a
Mayu-Mayu?

114
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:22,834
[Yachiru]
Kenny!

115
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:28,434
Look at all the trees
you've cut down!

116
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,067
So where've you
been all day?

117
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:33,234
I saw a friend!
Remember Mappy from
way back when?

118
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:38,734
"Map-py"? Oh...
you mean Masayoshi?

119
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:43,301
Um-hm! I saw him for the first
time in years, he looked good!

120
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:47,301
You talked with him?

121
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:48,834
I sure did!

122
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:52,201
Yachiru...

123
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:53,367
Hm?

124
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:12,134
We were so close.
We met when we joined
the Guard Squads.

125
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:19,301
Mappy, want some
konpeito candy?

126
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:20,667
Thanks, Yachiru.

127
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:24,001
You know, I can't get
enough of sweets.

128
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,501
Great! Got some more?

129
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:31,734
Why sure!

130
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:55,401
Want me to come with you?

131
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:57,901
Nah.

132
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:03,034
That's okay, you don't
need to come along Kenny!
I'll see you later on! Bye!

133
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:05,667
Hrmm.

Are you alright?

00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,734
Yeah, I'm fine.

Phew.
Um...

141
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,734
Want some?

142
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:37,001
Rice balls?

143
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:38,401
Have one.

144
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:39,901
Why thanks.

145
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,601
Delicious. Thanks Mayu.

00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,001
Mayu-Mayu!

148
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:54,801
I'd love to
try some too!

149
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,301
Uh, Sure.
Have one...

150
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,434
Tasty!

151
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:05,634
Y'know Mappy, I remember
your wife being a great
cook as well.

152
00:11:06,134 --> 00:11:10,334
Uh, yeah.
She was, wasn't she?

153
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:13,101
So, just what did
you argue with
your wife about?

154
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:15,234
Oh just
something silly.

155
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:16,501
C'mon, tell me!

156
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:19,967
It was because...

157
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:22,867
Uh...

<i>Because...</i>

That day...

00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:34,334
Huh?!

161
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,901
What's the matter
with you, Mappy?

162

293
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:57,010

You were possessed by a
Hollow that you were
chasing.

294
00:19:00,644 --> 00:19:04,510
And then, the Hollow
took control of you
and killed your wife.

295
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:10,410
But seeing such a shocking
sight gave you the strength and
will you needed to suppress the
Hollow that's still inside you.

296
00:19:11,144 --> 00:19:16,277

your love for candy and
even your wife's name.

Soon your consciousness
and your humanity will
be forgotten as well.

Huh?

327
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,710
<i>You can have all of them.</i>

328
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,810

00:23:53,528 --> 00:23:54,828
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Uh-Toshiro?!</i>

336
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:56,228
<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>Do you have a</i>

337
00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:57,428
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>No.</i>

338
00:23:57,461 --> 00:23:59,161
<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>Good, then I'll</i>

<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>So much for my</i>
