00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,708
NARRATOR: 110 years
ago, a new generation

3
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:54,942
of leaders prepared to take over
due to a number of turnovers

4
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:58,775
among the captains of the
13 Court Guard Squads.

5
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:01,342
As part of the promotions,
and at the recommendation

6
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,975
of Yoruichi Shihoin, who
was captain of Squad Two

7
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:07,142
at the time, Kisuke Urahara
filled the empty post

8
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:10,142
as the head of Squad 12
and became its captain.

9
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:14,175
However, Hiyori Sarugaki, who
was the lieutenant of Squad 12,

10
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,808
had a problem with Kisuke.

11
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:18,075
She disliked his
laid-back personality

12
00:02:18,108 --> 00:02:20,608
and resented his history
with the Stealth Force.

13
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:23,642
As a result, their
relationship was strained.

14
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:24,542
HIYORI SARUGAKI: Wha--

15
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:25,775
-Huh?

16
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:28,308
HIYORI SARUGAKI: What-- what
the hell is all of this?

17
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,208
What the heck have
you done here?

18
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:35,608
This is the captain's room!

19
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:36,875
You got it?

20
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:40,775
You can't just go doing
renovations and change it all!

21
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:41,908
-Why not?

22
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:42,775
It's OK.

23
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:44,542
I mean, it's my room.

24
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:46,042
-What?

25
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:47,942
-Besides, I didn't renovate.

26
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:49,442
I just rearranged things.

27
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:50,942
-How is this rearranging?

28
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:54,442
Come on, absolutely nothing
from the old room's left.

29
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:55,942
It's all changed.

30
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:56,442
No way.

31
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:03,408
-Ow.

32
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:06,008
All right.

33
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:09,075
Hiyori, I need to ask
you to do me a favor.

34
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:11,475
-Wha-- what do you want?

35
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:12,842
-You're going to come with me.

36
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,342
And we're going to pay a
visit to the Maggot's Nest.

37
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,308
-The Maggot's Nest?

38
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:18,808
But--

39
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:42,275
All right.

40
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:43,442
We've reached our destination.

41
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:44,308
This is the place.

42
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:44,808
-Huh?

43
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:51,175
YORUICHI SHIHOIN: Kisuke's here?

44
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,575
-Yes.

45
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,608
He said he'd already received
your permission, Lady Yoruichi.

46
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:55,108
-Hmm?

47
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,675
Hmm, I can't
remember the reason.

48
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,342
SQUAD MEMBER: What
shall we do, my lady?

49
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,642
If you're not certain of
the reason for his visit,

50
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:06,475
shall I ask him to leave?

51
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:08,342
-No, that won't be necessary.

52
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,675
Let them go wherever
he wants to.

53
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,808
SQUAD MEMBER: Is his purpose
coming back to you now?

54
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:14,542
-Hmm?

55
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:15,942
Not a bit.

56
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:17,375
-Lady Yoruichi?

57
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:19,108
-What now, Sui-Feng?

58
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:21,375
Sometimes you're so annoying.

59
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:22,375
-Yes, but--

60
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:24,175
YORUICHI SHIHOIN:
Oh, stop worrying.

61
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,008
Knowing Kisuke, I'm sure
he has a very good reason

62
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:27,875
for coming here.

63
00:04:31,742 --> 00:04:32,908
-Oh, they opened up.

64
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:33,708
That's good.

65
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:35,208
You just have to follow me.

66
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,375
-I don't wanna.

67
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:37,375
-Come on, now.

68
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:38,842
You don't have to
act like a child.

69
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,075
-I don't wanna!

70
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:42,808
KISUKE URAHARA:
Regardless, you're coming.

71
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:44,875
-I said I don't wanna!

72
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:45,908
KISUKE URAHARA: Now, now.

73
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:48,075
Don't have such a bad attitude.

74
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:50,542
Who knows, when you get in you
might think it's wonderful.

75
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:56,008
-What's the deal?

76
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,775
I thought we were going to
some creepy place called

77
00:04:57,808 --> 00:04:58,975
the Maggot's Nest.

78
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,608
This is Squad Two's
barracks grounds.

79
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:03,142
-You've heard of
the Stealth Force,

80
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:04,542
haven't you, Lieutenant Hiyori?

81
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,075
-The Stealth Force?

82
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:07,042
Well, of course I have.

83
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:08,808
It's your old unit, Kisuke.

84
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,875
And stop trying to
change the subject.

85
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:15,075
KISUKE URAHARA: The Stealth
Force is quite unique.

86
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:17,108
It's an organization
whose origins

87
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:20,342
are separate from the
13 Court Guard Squads.

88
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,808
As one of the four
great noble families who

89
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:24,875
possess incredible
soul reaper powers,

90
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,275
the Shihoin Clan serves
as the supreme commander

91
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:29,375
of this force.

92
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:31,208
And whenever the head
of the Shihoin Clan

93
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:35,208
also becomes a captain of one
of the 13 court guard squads,

94
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:38,542
that squad invariably
forms a close association

95
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:39,508
with the Stealth Force.

96
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:43,275
-What, do they
merge or something?

97
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:44,442
KISUKE URAHARA: Almost.

98
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:47,108
Yoruichi, who is the
current supreme commander,

99
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:49,775
also serves as
captain of Squad Two.

100
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:53,075
That means the current Stealth
Force is an organization pretty

101
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:56,342
much under the direct
control of Squad Two.

102
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,208
The Stealth Force is
divided into five units,

103
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:03,675
and each unit leader is also
a seated officer of Squad Two.

104
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,842
I was the leader of
unit three, which

105
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:09,842
is also known as the
confinement unit.

106
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,942
-You mean you were a yard hack?

107
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:15,375
-I think a more accurate term
would have been prison guard.

108
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,908
My main duties at that time
were to confine and keep

109
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,175
watch over anyone who
committed punishable

110
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,842
offenses within the Seireitei.

111
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,575
-Which makes you a yard hack.

112
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:24,742
-I was just a guard.

113
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,175
-It's the same thing.

114
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,842
Your job was to swagger around
in front of the criminals

115
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,275
and keep them in place, right?

116
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:34,975
KISUKE URAHARA: The
confinement unit

117
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:37,875
had another duty you may
not have heard about.

118
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:40,775
We trained and deployed
special confinement officers.

119
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:41,542
-Huh?

120
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:43,975
And just what did they do?

121
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,208
-Their job was a
little more complex.

122
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:48,408
They were to investigate,
keep under surveillance,

123
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:52,108
and if necessary apprehend
any soul reapers within the 13

124
00:06:52,142 --> 00:06:54,542
Court Guard Squads
whose ideas and actions

125
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:56,675
could put other
soul reapers at risk

126
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,142
or create an obstruction to
the performance of the squad's

127
00:06:59,175 --> 00:06:59,842
duties.

128
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,142
-What are you saying?

129
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:02,142
-Hmm?

130
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:03,642
-You're very confusing
when you talk.

131
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:05,708
Can't you find a simple
way to say things?

132
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:07,075
-All right.

133
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,742
Here it is in a nutshell-- our
job was to catch and lock up

134
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:13,642
dangerous elements within
the 13 Court Guard Squads.

135
00:07:13,675 --> 00:07:17,275
The facility where we put them
is located here, in Squad Two's

136
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:18,542
barracks.

137
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:20,975
It's isolated, on the northwest
side of these grounds,

138
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,875
beyond the huge
54-meter wide moat.

139
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:37,575
Here it is-- the underground
confinement station, also known

140
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:38,775
as the Maggot's Nest.

141
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:58,078
HIYORI SARUGAKI: Huh?

142
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:03,011
What is this?

143
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:05,445
It's nothing but a huge cave.

144
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:07,511
Do you really keep a
bunch of people locked up

145
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:10,611
in this dreadful place,
stuck way underground?

146
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:13,778
-I guess it does sound
cruel, doesn't it?

147
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:16,611
But the truth is it's not
really an underground prison.

148
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:25,245
Do you see?

149
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:36,178
It's still a prison, of course.

150
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,211
I mean, they're not allowed
to leave this place.

151
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:40,145
However, their activities
within the facility

152
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:40,945
are not restricted.

153
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,411
-I think I got this
thing figured out.

154
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:51,478
Listen.

155
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:53,878
KISUKE URAHARA: I advise
you to be careful.

156
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:56,778
Sometimes, without warning,
someone will attack suddenly.

157
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:03,045
-So tell me, what exactly
did these people do?

158
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:03,778
-Not a thing.

159
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,078
-What?

160
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,311
-As I tried to
explain, these people

161
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:11,211
haven't actually done
anything wrong yet.

162
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:13,478
According to the criteria
of the Seireitei,

163
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,978
they were people
who were determined

164
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:17,978
to be dangerous elements
within the Soul Society.

165
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:20,811
They committed no crime
so we cannot try them.

166
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:22,445
However, if they
were left free, they

167
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,611
could well end up
being dangerous.

168
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:28,078
That's why we keep them confined
in here, safely tucked away.

169
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:29,478
-That's crazy!

170
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:31,445
They haven't done a thing and
you still keep them locked up?

171
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:33,478
KISUKE URAHARA: Hiyori,
let me ask you something.

172
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:35,011
Up until now, do
you know anybody

173
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:37,678
who's resigned from the
13 Court Guard Squads?

174
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,178
-Well, I-- I suppose
there's been a couple.

175
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,811
But what's your point?

176
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:44,411
-Truth of the matter is, there's
nothing within our system

177
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:45,778
that allows anyone to resign.

178
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:50,311
Those who have no
choice but to leave

179
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:52,111
the squad for
personal reasons are

180
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:54,278
considered to be on
leave of absence.

181
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:56,878
If they're not able to
return after a specified

182
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:59,178
period of time,
they're discharged.

183
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:02,311
We cannot willingly accept the
resignation of a soul reaper.

184
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,111
HIYORI SARUGAKI:
Are you serious?

185
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,445
-If you leave the squad, you've
resigned from the organization.

186
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:09,178
And since resignation
is not allowed,

187
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:11,045
you're considered to
be expelled and brought

188
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,878
here and placed in confinement.

189
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:15,445
-I don't get it.

190
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:17,111
Why go through all that trouble?

191
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:19,011
KISUKE URAHARA: The
13 Court Guard Squads

192
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:21,711
are a noble organization,
and as such it must never

193
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:24,045
produce unsuitable
elements from among those

194
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:25,545
accepted into its membership.

195
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:28,011
That's the philosophy
of Central 46,

196
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,111
the group that
rules the Seireitei.

197
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:32,111
So rather than allow
unsuitables back

198
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,711
into the general
population, they're

199
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:37,945
taken away and dealt with
in secret as deserters.

200
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:40,911
Hiyori, something's
been on my mind

201
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:44,911
ever since I was assigned to
this place as a unit leader.

202
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,645
I don't argue that
the people here

203
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:48,445
are all potentially dangerous.

204
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:51,845
But in many cases, I
believe that negative energy

205
00:10:51,878 --> 00:10:54,745
could be turned into
something extremely positive

206
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:57,045
if we could only provide them
an environment where they

207
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:58,478
could put their
abilities to use.

208
00:10:58,511 --> 00:10:59,778
-You gotta be kidding me.

209
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:01,978
You're keeping them confined
because they're dangerous,

210
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,078
but now you want to somehow
use their abilities?

211
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:06,611
BIG MOUTH: Hiyori?

212
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,245
I can't believe it.

213
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:09,045
You're really here.

214
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:11,278
-Big Mouth is here?

215
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:11,978
-Hmm?

216
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:12,978
-We graduated together.

217
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:14,511
I thought he resigned
a while back.

218
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:17,278
He always used to boast
about things he was gonna do,

219
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:19,411
like one day being in
charge of the Seireitei.

220
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,478
That's why we all ended
up calling him Big Mouth.

221
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:22,811
BIG MOUTH: Hiyori!

222
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:24,511
Hiyori, oh, Hiyori.

223
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:26,445
Please, you've got to help me.

224
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,011
We were colleagues, weren't we?

225
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:30,378
I just want to go home.

226
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:32,378
Please, I just want to go home.

227
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:32,878
Please.

228
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:42,378
-Damn, I left my
Zanpakuto at the barracks.

229
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:56,911
KISUKE URAHARA: I'm sorry.

230
00:11:56,945 --> 00:11:58,811
I knew you forgot
your Zanpakuto,

231
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:00,511
but I didn't say anything.

232
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:03,478
Bringing any kind of weapon
into the confinement station

233
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:05,545
is expressly forbidden.

234
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:08,411
That's why there's a hard and
fast requirement of anyone

235
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:10,078
leading the confinement
unit that they

236
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,878
have to have excellent
fighting skills-- enough

237
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:14,311
to subdue someone unarmed.

238
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:21,211
My, my.

239
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:22,878
You've already
forgotten my face.

240
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,511
It's only been two days.

241
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,878
And after I took such
good care of you.

242
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:35,678
-Hey, now's our chance.

243
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,145
Come on, let's go.

244
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:42,145
-Kill those guys.

245
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,345
-Take him down.

246
00:12:44,378 --> 00:12:45,345
-Get him, come on.

247
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,445
-It appears as though you
all have forgotten me.

248
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:03,878
How terribly rude.

249
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:13,378
BIG MOUTH: Don't move.

250
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:20,945
Listen, I just want you to
get me out of here right now.

251
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:23,578
If you don't, I'll
cut her throat.

252
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:25,711
-Hmm.

253
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:29,611
Big Mouth, I must
tell you, you've

254
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:31,211
taken the wrong person hostage.

255
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:40,445
-Don't mess with
me, you big jerk.

256
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:42,411
KISUKE URAHARA: I didn't
think it was possible,

257
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,878
but his mouth got a lot bigger.

258
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,878
Oh, well, I guess we should go.

259
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:48,378
Hiyori?

260
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:53,311
-What kind of
environment are you

261
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:55,778
talking about that will
make these guys useful, huh?

262
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,745
I don't see how this
can possibly work.

263
00:13:57,778 --> 00:13:59,211
These guys are dangerous.

264
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:02,645
If you bring them outside,
they'll just create problems.

265
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:04,078
-Don't give up on
the whole barrel

266
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:05,511
because of a few rotten apples.

267
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:25,829
KISUKE URAHARA: Take a look.

268
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:29,095
Beyond here is the only person
in this place dangerous enough

269
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:31,895
to be confined to his own cell.

270
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:33,962
HIYORI (VOICEOVER): More
dangerous than most guys

271
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:35,195
in the yard?

272
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:39,662
What business could he have
with someone like that?

273
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:42,195
MAYURI KUROTSUCHI: Is
that you, Kisuke Urahara?

274
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,995
What brings you to
a place like this?

275
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:47,295
-I came down here because
I wanted to have a chat.

276
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:56,229
Let me ask you something,
Mayuri Kurotsuchi.

277
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,995
Would you be interested in
leaving this place with me?

278
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:04,062
-Wait.

279
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:06,395
Who is this creepy guy?

280
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:07,529
-Oh?

281
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:10,429
You call someone creepy
the first time you meet?

282
00:15:10,462 --> 00:15:14,295
From my point of view, you're
quite a disrespectful boy.

283
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,062
-Boy?

284
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:16,662
Who are you calling a boy?

285
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:17,929
What are you, blind?

286
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:18,862
I'm a girl.

287
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:19,895
You want me to
show you my boobs?

288
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:20,862
I'll do it.

289
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:21,429
I'll show them right here.

290
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,262
-She's upset.

291
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:23,395
Please forgive her foul mouth.

292
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:25,062
She happens to be my
squad's lieutenant.

293
00:15:25,095 --> 00:15:26,629
Ow!

294
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:28,429
And she gets offended easily.

295
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:30,495
-Lieutenant, you say.

296
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,029
Guess you must have
gotten promoted.

297
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:34,495
Congratulations.

298
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:35,429
KISUKE URAHARA: Thanks.

299
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:37,062
It's not always a pleasant job.

300
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:40,462
But getting back to the
subject, can I have your answer?

301
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:41,962
MAYURI KUROTSUCHI:
Oh, of course.

302
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:45,262
You mean your crazy idea of
leaving this place with you?

303
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:46,262
KISUKE URAHARA: Yes.

304
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:48,195
MAYURI KUROTSUCHI:
I don't think so.

305
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:48,895
-OK, then.

306
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:49,829
Are we done here?

307
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:51,095
If the guy doesn't
want to leave,

308
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,795
we'd be wasting our time
trying to convince him, right?

309
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,229
-And why not?

310
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:01,262
-Over time, I've become
satisfied with my life here.

311
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,529
I have no need to go outside.

312
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,662
-Come on, Mayuri.

313
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:06,962
That couldn't
possibly be true, not

314
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:09,695
in a place such as this
where there's nothing to do.

315
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:11,962
MAYURI KUROTSUCHI: I'm not
so sure that's a bad thing.

316
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:14,662
Why is it you want to
get me out of here?

317
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:15,495
-Truthfully?

318
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,195
Because I need your assistance.

319
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:19,729
-Let's dispense with
the lies, shall we?

320
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:22,495
You don't really expect
me to believe that.

321
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:24,562
-When you put it that
way, I guess not.

322
00:16:24,595 --> 00:16:26,529
You really don't
trust me, do you?

323
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:29,662
MAYURI KUROTSUCHI: The bottom
line is I can't figure you out.

324
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,595
You're really quite
an unpleasant fellow.

325
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:34,462
-Hmm.

326
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:37,429
I believe in your skills.

327
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:38,495
And that is the truth.

328
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:44,929
I'm in the process of creating
an organization unlike anything

329
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,662
ever seen in the Soul Society.

330
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:49,695
It'll be under the
control of Squad 12.

331
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:52,495
It's the Department of
Research and Development.

332
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:56,062
I would like you to assume the
seat of Deputy Department Head.

333
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:58,862
-What?

334
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:01,662
-You mean you want
me to work under you?

335
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,929
KISUKE URAHARA: That's correct.

336
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:04,962
It's not such a
bad offer, is it?

337
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:07,829
You'd be second
in command to me.

338
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:11,329
In other words, if
I were to pass away,

339
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:13,329
you would end up
having total control.

340
00:17:21,695 --> 00:17:23,995
MAYURI KUROTSUCHI:
As I stated before,

341
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:26,729
you really are a most
unpleasant fellow.

342
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:45,162
-Wow, that's quite
impressive, Byakuya.

343
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:46,929
I see you're working very hard.

344
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:56,462
-Grandfather, what an
unsuspected surprise.

345
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:58,029
Did you decide to
rest here today

346
00:17:58,062 --> 00:17:59,195
rather than at the barracks?

347
00:17:59,229 --> 00:18:00,462
-Hmm.

348
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,029
-I'm so glad you did.

349
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:04,662
It's been a long time since
I've been able to talk to you.

350
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:07,029
I very much enjoy
our conversations.

351
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:08,529
-Hmm.

352
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:10,162
So what do you say, Byakuya?

353
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:13,329
How about taking a break
from practice for a while?

354
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:15,229
I brought someone
here to see you.

355
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:15,729
-Me?

356
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:19,729
It's you, cat monster!

357
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:23,429
-Cat monster?

358
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:25,329
That's what I get for
coming over to visit?

359
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:27,629
And I went out of my way
to make a special trip.

360
00:18:27,662 --> 00:18:28,995
-Oh, please.

361
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:31,462
When did I ever say I wanted
you to come here and visit me?

362
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:33,195
As the next head of
the Kuchiki Clan,

363
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,962
I don't wish to be
involved in your games.

364
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:35,895
They're not fun.

365
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:37,062
YORUICHI SHIHOIN:
Oh, is that so?

366
00:18:43,395 --> 00:18:45,329
It may be games
to you, but I'd be

367
00:18:45,362 --> 00:18:47,729
worried about the clans
future if a mere girl was

368
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:50,595
able to steal a headband so
easily off its leader's head.

369
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,595
-Stay right where you are,
Miss Yoruichi Shihoin.

370
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:55,729
You haven't seen
my flash step yet.

371
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:56,529
-Oh, yeah?

372
00:18:56,562 --> 00:18:57,495
Looks like you lost.

373
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:03,029
-I do see.

374
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:06,595
It appears you're trying
to make me really angry.

375
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,029
Fine.

376
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:11,095
I guess you'll have to
find out for yourself.

377
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,795
Fact of the matter is, I'm
about to prove that my flash

378
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:15,929
step is far superior to yours!

379
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:18,362
-Oh, that boy.

380
00:19:18,395 --> 00:19:20,262
There's no telling
how far Byakuya

381
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:23,662
would go if he could just find
some way to control his temper.

382
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:28,395
Nothing I can do about it now.

383
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:29,529
Guess I'll have some tea.

384
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:35,029
-That's perfect.

385
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:47,895
-I see that smile of yours
is as powerful as always.

386
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:48,729
Hot!

387
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:49,862
-About my offer.

388
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:51,362
-Do you want me to say it again?

389
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:54,162
I'm not going to serve as
your lieutenant, captain.

390
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:56,262
-Why are you being so stubborn?

391
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,695
I'm starting to take
this personally.

392
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:00,429
-You know as well
as I do there are

393
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:04,162
lots of others who deserve to be
second in command more than me.

394
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:05,795
-There you go again.

395
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,662
You're always putting
duty before friendship.

396
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:13,529
By the way, have you heard?

397
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:14,795
KAIEN SHIBA: About what?

398
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:16,962
JUSHIRO UKITAKE: There's a
prodigy among this year's

399
00:20:16,995 --> 00:20:19,229
recruits, the first one
to show up since you.

400
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:21,862
KAIEN SHIBA: Believe
me, I'm no prodigy.

401
00:20:21,895 --> 00:20:25,695
-This young man was able to
graduate from Soul Reaper

402
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:27,562
Academy in only one full year.

403
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:29,062
-Hmm.

404
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,329
Is that right?

405
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,029
I admit that's impressive.

406
00:20:32,062 --> 00:20:34,195
-I still can't quite believe it.

407
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:36,395
From what I hear,
he's just a kid.

408
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:38,762
He's about the same age as
Captain Kuchiki's grandson,

409
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:39,662
Byakuya.

410
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:42,062
-Oh, you mean the cocky one.

411
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:43,562
-I know what you're saying.

412
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:46,062
But apparently this prodigy
has the talent of a man

413
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:47,295
twice his age.

414
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,595
I hear an officer's position
will be ready for him

415
00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:50,895
when he enters the squad.

416
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:51,962
-Oh?

417
00:20:51,995 --> 00:20:53,295
Well, it looks like
we've got ourselves

418
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:54,895
someone with quite a future.

419
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:57,595
That should make my chances to
fill a lieutenant's position

420
00:20:57,629 --> 00:20:58,995
even more unlikely.

421
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:01,429
-You don't have to
sound so happy about it.

422
00:21:01,462 --> 00:21:02,795
-So who is it?

423
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,662
Who's the lucky squad that's
going to get the new recruit?

424
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:10,595
-Well now, from what I've heard,
he'll be joining Squad Five.

425
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:15,462
SOSUKE AIZEN: Nice.

426
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:18,862
Your skill is even
better than I was told.

427
00:21:18,895 --> 00:21:21,862
What is your name
again, young warrior?

428
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:23,429
-Gin.

429
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:26,395
I am Gin Ichimaru.

430
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:28,795
SOSUKE AIZEN: And how did
you find our Third Seat?

431
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:29,862
GIN ICHIMARU: Terrible.

432
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:33,462
No competition at all.

433
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:36,329
-Interesting.

434
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,195
Glad to hear it.

435
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,329
NARRATOR: Having
swung through the past

436
00:21:42,362 --> 00:21:44,895
to observe a quick
glimpse in time,

437
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:49,995
we now flash forward
nine years as we

438
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:53,029
move even closer to the
crux of the incident.

439
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:19,670
[music playing]

440
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:48,572
MALE VOICE 1: I want
you to be my lieutenant.

441
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:49,905
Let me be clear.

442
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:52,972
What that means is if I die,
you will have complete control.

443
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,005
MALE VOICE 2: Where is
this from out of the blue?

444
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,638
MALE VOICE 1: I was trying
to imitate Kisuke Urahara.

445
00:23:57,672 --> 00:23:59,172
How'd I do?

446
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:02,705
MALE VOICE 2: It wasn't the
least bit funny, so stop it.
