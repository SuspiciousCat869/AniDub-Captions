1
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,400
Heeeyaah!

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,433
Hurggh!

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,400
I think it would be a
good idea if you'd let me
run in front of you now.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,266
e-eh...
Sure. If you insist.

5
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:10,107
Rrrgh!

6
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:12,607
Huah!

7
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:18,774
You sneaky piece of crap,
that hurt!

8
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:21,974
How dare you interfere
and cut my leg off!

9
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:25,674
I'll gonna kill you,
you damn insect!

10
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:28,441
Hunh!

11
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:35,841
Oh good.

12
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:43,941
That first one was bad...
It felt like a fly buzzing
around me.

13
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:48,774
But If you're going to hit me,
why don't you do it with all
your strength, maggot?

14
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:53,741
You're the pest here...
and it's time to swat you!

15
00:03:27,547 --> 00:03:29,714
I won't describe what's
inside the Garganta.

16
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:32,814
To find the World of the
Living, go the opposite way.

17
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:35,147
Right.

18
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:41,547
Just make sure you're aware
of each step you're taking.

19
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:47,047
One mis-step inside and
you'll wind up in an unknown
space between the World of
the Living and Hueco Mundo,

20
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:49,114
and there will be
no way to get back.

21
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:53,447
But, that might be very
entertaining for me to watch.

22
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:57,747
What's the matter?

23
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:00,381
Well, come to think of it,

24
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:05,621
when Kisuke saw us off,
I remember he was talking
down to us, just like
you're doing right now.

25
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:23,387
So?

26
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:26,787
Since you're the second person
to become Chief of Research and
Development, you must have been
his apprentice or something.

27
00:04:27,654 --> 00:04:29,387
The two of you are very similar.

28
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:31,821
How dare you!

29
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:32,887
Bye now!

30
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:37,554
Lieutenant Isane...

31
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:39,654
We'll be back soon.
Take care of them.

32
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:41,687
I will, Captain Unohana.

33
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,821
Ichigo...

34
00:04:53,387 --> 00:04:55,887
Quite fearless.
He has my interest.

35
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:59,021
Oh, I've got plans for you,
Little Ichigo.

36
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:01,954
Master Mayuri...

37
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:06,961
At first, I thought it might be
interesting to trap him in the
Garganta... But forget it.

38
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:12,427
When this battle is finally
over, I'm going to take my time
putting some real fear into him.

39
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:16,927
As awful as this battle is going
to be for him, it's going to
seem like a walk in the park,

40
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:18,594
...after I'm done.

41
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:21,627
Let me think about it,
Master Mayuri.

42
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:23,727
I'll come up with a plan.

43
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:37,627
What a surprise,
You're pretty tough
for a filthy maggot.

44
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:40,727
Big talk for a scrawny bug!
Take this!

45
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:49,961
Heh heh heh, Can't
fight back anymore?

46
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:52,694
Give it up, It's over.

47
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,627
I'll crush you!
Like the bug you are!

48
00:05:57,761 --> 00:05:58,561
Huh??

49
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:03,767
Rgh!
Auuugh!

50
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:06,601
Damnit! You cut off two of my
fingers!

51
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,701
That was a really cheap shot!

52
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:09,734
Huh??

53
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:19,601
Argghh!

54
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:22,667
Not done yet!

55
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:29,801
<i>[fighting]</i>
<i>Hee-yaa!</i>
<i>Dyaahh!</i>

56
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,501
<i>You damn bug!</i>

57
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,967
<i>[fighting]</i>
<i>Huwah!</i>
<i>Gyah!</i>

58
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:37,301
Why did you stay behind,
Mayuri Kurotsuchi?

59
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:43,234
Odd. My whereabouts don't
seem like something you
would even take the time
to concern yourself with.

60
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:49,601
I keep thinking, there
should be many more things
of interest to you in the
World of the Living.

61
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:54,401
So why stay here?
Unless of course you're
plotting something?

62
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:57,667
Ah, We're very
suspicious, aren't we?

63
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:00,334
Don't worry so much.

64
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:03,774
When all is said and done,
you'll see that I'm not
planning anything that
will scare you.

65
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:11,474
Actually, at the moment,
in case you're wondering,

66
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:14,641
I've discovered that the
corpses over here are
more interesting.

67
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:16,907
That is really all
there is to it.

68
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:22,541
Once the battle in the World
of the Living is over,
someone will open up a
Garganta from the other side.

69
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:28,674
By then I should be finished
with my work here and be able
to use that Garganta to go to
the World of the Livin
g,

70
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:31,741
where I'll take time
examining each of the corpses.

71
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,441
Well, what is it?

72
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:40,774
What is it??

73
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:43,541
How many times must
I ask you to speak?

74
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:46,307
If you have something to say,
say it and be done!

75
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,507
HM?

76
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:50,607
Well...

77
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:54,807
I never would have expected
you to say such a thing...

78
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,874
or make such
an assumption.

79
00:07:57,841 --> 00:07:58,841
Like what?

80
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:00,707
You know very well.

81
00:08:02,707 --> 00:08:08,114
<i>You believe sending Ichigo</i>
<i>Kurosaki to the World of the</i>
<i>Living will end that battle.</i>

82
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:19,447
On top of that, it
sounds like you believe
the boy will ultimately
be victorious.

83
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:20,481
Huh?

84
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,214
That's nonsense.

85
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:31,547
Total nonsense.

86
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:36,314
I never expected that
you would make such
absurd assumptions,
Captain Kuchiki.

87
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:46,814
<i>Almost there! Hang on, guys!</i>

88
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:51,547
<i>Ichigo...</i>

89
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:56,481
I have been meaning
to ask you something.

90
00:08:56,581 --> 00:09:02,421
I heard that you had
encountered Sosuke Aizen
once before, at Sokyoku
Hill, Is that correct?

91
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,587
You heard right.
What about it?

92
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,487
What did you think?

93
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:11,454
There was only one
thing to think.

94
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:13,321
The guy had
monstrous strength.

95
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:49,454
I was completely helpless.
He didn't even use his Shikai.
It was a one-sided encounter.

96
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:55,754
Wait a minute, are you
absolutely sure he didn't
use his Shikai when he
was fighting you?

97
00:09:56,787 --> 00:09:57,687
Yeah.

98
00:09:58,521 --> 00:09:59,621
That's really good.

99
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:00,487
Huh?!

100
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:07,261
The fact that you seemed so
weak, he didn't need to use
his Shikai, is now actually
your greatest advantage.

101
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:08,261
Huh?!

102
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:13,461
There are some things I need to
fill you in on, Ichigo.

103
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:19,294
<i>At the moment, you are</i>
<i>probably the only person in</i>
<i>the World of the Living,</i>

104
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:25,561
<i>the Soul Society, and</i>
<i>Hueco Mundo, who can</i>
<i>fight Sosuke Aizen...</i>
<i>and actually defeat him.</i>

105
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:27,727
What do you mean?

106
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,261
I'm going to tell you about

107
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:34,561
the power of his Zanpakuto,
which is called Kyokasuigetsu,

108
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:36,694
...and the requirements
to activate it.

109
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:57,861
<i>This is my</i>
<i>Zanpakuto,</i>
<i>Kyokasuigetsu.</i>

110
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:00,694
Its ability is
perfect hypnosis.

111
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:07,768
Impossible! It couldn't change!
Kyokasuigetsu has always been a
running-water-type Zanpakuto...

112
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:13,001
It uses the diffused reflection
of mist to confuse enemies into
attacking each other!

113
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:16,501
<i>You yourself explained to</i>
<i>us exactly how it worked,</i>
<i>Captain Aizen!</i>

114
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:22,634
And we saw it with our own eyes!
You specifically gathered all
the lieutenants together because
you wanted to demonstrate it!

115
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:25,068
<i>I see now.</i>

116
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:28,568
Your demonstration
was actually the
hypnosis ritual.

117
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:29,934
You're catching on quickly.

118
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:37,634
Complete hypnosis controls all
five senses and is able to cause
every dimension of a target,

119
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:43,501
including its form, shape, mass,
feel, and smell, even its vocal
patterns and the way it tastes,

120
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,568
to perfectly replicate
that of an enemy.

121
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:49,901
In other words, it
is possible for me
to make a fly appear
to be a dragon,

122
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,701
...Or a marsh,
a flowerbed.

123
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:56,134
And all I need to do
to activate it...

124
00:11:56,234 --> 00:12:01,101
is simply show my
enemies my Zanpakuto's
Kanzensaimin release.

125
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:05,808
The power of my
Zanpakuto is limited
only by my mind,

126
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:08,574
because whoever
lays their eyes
on it, even once,

127
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:12,908
will be hypnotized into
doing my bidding whenever I
release my Kyokasuigetsu.

128
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:18,308
Anyone who sees it?
Just once?

129
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:19,574
That's right.

130
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,741
All of us who
make up the
Thirteen Court
Guard Squads,

131
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:28,341
<i>Kisuke Urahara's people,</i>
<i>with whom you are acquainted</i>
<i>in the World of the Living,</i>

132
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:33,908
And even Sosuke Aizen's
subordinates, the
Arrancars and the Espadas,

133
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:41,674
Everyone who is even remotely
involved in the battles in
the World of the Living, has
seen Aizen's Shikai.

134
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:48,041
Everyone, that is,
except for you, Ichigo.

135
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:54,041
You possess Spiritual Pressure
equal to a Captain,

136
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:57,674
And you have not seen the
Kyokasuigetsu's Shikai.

137
00:12:57,774 --> 00:13:01,774
So as long as I don't see
Aizen's Shikai, I won't fall
under his perfect hypnosis?

138
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:04,248
That's right.

139
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:08,648
Keep in mind, your advantage is
very important in this battle.

140
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:14,581
But you have to maintain
that advantage.

141
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:18,781
If you do anything to
lose it, you will become
vulnerable, and the
battle cannot be won.

142
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:24,714
Listen to me. No matter what
happens in this confrontation
from here on out,

143
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:27,648
you must not look at
Sosuke Aizen's Shikai.

144
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:29,614
<i>Do you understand?</i>

145
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:32,581
Got it.

146
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:34,681
Thank you,
Captain Unohana.

147
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:40,781
I'm glad you explained all
of that to me before I have
to meet up with him again.

148
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:45,448
If I'm the only one who can do
this, then my path is clear.

149
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:48,814
This time...I'll defeat Aizen!

150
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,348
Rrgh.

151
00:13:53,314 --> 00:13:54,548
You're pretty slow!

152
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:04,554
Hey, maggot, that gets me itchy.

153
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:06,421
Is that the best you've got?

154
00:14:11,754 --> 00:14:13,588
Heeeo~

155
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:16,888
YARRGHHH!!

156
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:25,721
Wow! I see his
personality isn't
the only thing
that's brutish.

157
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:30,354
He's also got some brute
strength, to be able to
flip that giant body over.

158
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,521
That hurt. Damnit!

159
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,554
You're starting to piss me off!

160
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:39,288
You're like a
pesky mosquito!
You damn bug!

161
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:41,754
Guess I'll have to squash you!

162
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:43,488
Heh!

163
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:49,621
<i>[fight yells from both]</i>
<i>Heeyah! Augh! Raugh! Yaah!</i>

164
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:53,621
If he's going to defeat him,
I wish he'd get it over with
quickly, for heaven's sake.

165
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:57,621
I'm on pins and needles!
I'm dying to dissect
that big Espada.

166
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:00,321
Huh?

167
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:01,354
Haugh!

168
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:12,828
Oh, great! It appears I'll be
dissecting the Squad Eleven
Captain, instead of that big
bruiser I was so excited about.

169
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:17,361
But That should be enjoyable
too, just less to cut up.

170
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:27,194
How bad does it
look, Isane?

171
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,628
Real bad. But I'll handle it.

172
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:32,628
Please
save them.

173
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:33,428
I will.

174
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:39,594
Ichigo...

175
00:15:46,494 --> 00:15:47,461
Ah...

176
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:53,261
<i>Listen, Ichigo...</i>

177
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:54,594
Huh?

178
00:15:55,794 --> 00:15:57,494
How about you let me run in
front of you for a little while?

179
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:02,161
Ah No, I'm all right. If
you're worried about me using
up my Spiritual Pressure...

180
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,401
don't be,
I'm doing just fine.

181
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:08,568
<i>Ichigo I think it would a</i>
<i>good idea if you'd let me</i>
<i>run in front of you now.</i>

182
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:12,534
e-eh...
Sure. If you insist.

183
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:15,401
Sorry about that.

184
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,068
No worries.

185
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:26,501
Wow! The path looks so
nice when it's laid out by
a Captain's Spirit Energy.

186
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:30,434
Mine'd be nice too If I
were in good condition.

187
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:36,201
What are you talking about?
Don't you know that you and I
have similar Spirit Energy?

188
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:37,234
Huh?!

189
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:40,734
From what I can see, your wounds
have already healed up.

190
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:48,301
But you'd be making a mess even
in your best condition. Your
sloppy Spirit Energy is not
suited to this sort of task.

191
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:52,301
That's not true!
I'm- I'm just not
recovered yet!

192
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,768
That's the problem.
I know I could do
better if I were.

193
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:59,268
You must be day-dreaming!
Although I have to say,
you look to be wide awake.

194
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:05,674
Hold on! Don't you think you're
being too hard on me? I'm not a
day dreamer This is very real!

195
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,708
Let me point out to you,
In case you missed it,
I only have one sleeve!

196
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:13,408
<i>When I release my Bankai,</i>
<i>my robe transforms.</i>

197
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:27,074
<i>It seems this different robe</i>
<i>is a part of my Bankai.</i>

198
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,474
Uh..?

199
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:37,308
However, when Isane
was healing my wounds,
Only part of my robe
got fixed.

200
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:44,541
<i>When Orihime healed me</i>
<i>before, my robe was</i>
<i>completely restored.</i>

201
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,608
<i>So I asked Isane</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

202
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:56,274
She said she discovered she
can heal wounds quickly, but
it takes her a while to revive
a person's Spirit Energy.

203
00:17:56,841 --> 00:18:01,474
I was in a big hurry.
Rukia and the others
were in trouble, and I
couldn't stay to finish.

204
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:04,614
I left before having all of
my Spirit Energy restored.

205
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:08,581
So this is it. This is all the
Spirit Energy I have right now.

206
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:13,414
See? If I were at my best,
I could do better.

207
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:19,214
Impossible! His robe is less
than half of what it usually is.

208
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:23,248
<i>This is not what I</i>
<i>expected to hear.</i>

209
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:26,181
<i>If he only has half of his</i>
<i>Spirit Energy, that's bad.</i>

210
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:31,014
<i>I was under the impression</i>
<i>that his level was equal to a</i>
<i>Captain's, and it needs to be.</i>

211
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:38,548
<i>Ichigo.</i>

212
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:39,648
Hm?

213
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:41,548
I think you should run
in front of me now.

214
00:18:43,214 --> 00:18:47,181
I'm going to try to restore your
Spirit Energy as best I can
while we're moving along.

215
00:18:48,414 --> 00:18:52,714
On the run? While
we're in motion?
You're able to do that?

216
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:59,014
Yes, I am. When healing with
Kido, we start by restoring
one's inner Spirit Energy...

217
00:18:59,214 --> 00:19:04,921
Then the restored internal
Spirit Energy is combined
with the healer's external
Spirit Energy,

218
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:06,954
which causes the whole
body to be repaired.

219
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:08,021
Ah.

220
00:19:10,254 --> 00:19:14,954
As it turns out, restoring
missing Spirit Energy in a body
that has been healed is quite
easy. I've done it many times.

221
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:18,188
Now. Ichigo... To the front.

222
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:20,021
Okay.

223
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:25,988
<i>If what I am sensing</i>
<i>is really only half of</i>
<i>his Spirit Energy...</i>

224
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:35,421
Then if I restore him, There's
a very good chance he could be
the advantage we need!

225
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:42,654
<i>The one with enough</i>
<i>power to end this battle!</i>

226
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,421
I've got you!

227
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:54,888
I don't think so, maggot!

228
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:56,488
Urrghhh!

229
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:58,988
Yahh!

230
00:19:59,621 --> 00:20:02,288
Go on, get away from me!

231
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:09,494
Bastard! That hurts!

232
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:11,828
Try this!

233
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:14,561
Raaauggh!

234
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:20,294
That was my leg,
you creep!

235
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:21,261
Ahh!

236
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,561
Last one!

237
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,461
Thank goodness!

238
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:34,528
I was getting so tired of
all this waiting around
that I almost fell asleep!

239
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:37,128
But it looks like
now I can begin
dissecting.

240
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:39,928
Prepare to
dissect, Nemu.

241
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:41,861
Yes, Master Mayuri.

242
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:51,028
Hmpf! He finally went down.

243
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:52,294
He was pretty tough.

244
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:55,228
Hey big guy, are you really done
now?

245
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:56,094
[kick]

246
00:20:58,261 --> 00:20:59,261
Tch.

247
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:02,328
Hey! Byakuya Kuchiki!

248
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,334
Looks like this
guy's had it!

249
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:06,201
I'm going to let you
handle the rest.

250
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:09,168
I don't understand
what you mean by that.

251
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,934
What are you stupid?

252
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:14,001
I figure you must be bored
from standing around
watching all this.

253
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:18,001
So I'm letting you take
care of finishing him off.
You'll be the clean-up crew.

254
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:24,901
I see. You're telling me to
tidy up after you by taking
care of your unfinished
business, is that it?

255
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:26,801
Just who do you think you are?

256
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:28,134
S'cuse me?!

257
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:33,834
I don't like finishing off
those who are weaker than I am.
Stop complaining and just do it!

258
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:37,334
I refuse. Clean
up your own mess.

259
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:41,201
I think this type of
dirty work is more suited
to a brute like you.

260
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,168
Huh.
Is that so.

261
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:46,868
Ah!

262
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:49,201
Huh?

263
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:50,768
Hm?

264
00:21:51,534 --> 00:21:53,968
Damn! Damn!

265
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:56,401
DAAAAAAMN!

266
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,599
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Capt. Unohana, your healing</i>
<i>powers are amazing!</i>

267
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,799

<i>Why, thank you so much.</i>

268
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,666

<i>Captain?</i>

270
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,599
<i>[Unohana]</i>

<i>mention anything about</i>

271
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:59,599
