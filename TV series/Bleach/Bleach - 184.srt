[theme song]

2
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,942
NARRATOR: Ichigo and Rukia
entered the Soul Society,

3
00:01:51,975 --> 00:01:54,775
disrupting Rurichiyo's
wedding to Shu Kannogi,

4
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:58,342
but were quickly surrounded
by Soi Fon and Squad 2.

5
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,108
Shu helped them escape by
posing as their hostage,

6
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:03,475
but this turned them
into fugitives on the run

7
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:05,442
from the Soul Reapers.

8
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:06,675
-What a surprise.

9
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,008
I must say we never thought
we'd run into you here.

10
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:16,542
NARRATOR: Shu intervened and
revealed to Captain Amagai

11
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:18,542
his reasons for helping Ichigo.

12
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:22,142
The captain then agreed to
help Ichigo to free Rurichiyo.

13
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,342
Meanwhile, the 13
Court Guard Squads

14
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,708
were perplexed by the news of
Ichigo becoming a fugitive.

15
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:30,108
In the meantime,
Lieutenant Izuru Kira

16
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:32,208
entered the Kasumioji
grounds and found himself

17
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:35,242
battling for his life
against savage assassins.

18
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:38,108
Izuru searched for Third
Seat Makoto Kibune,

19
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:40,642
but instead, came across
Rurichiyo just in time

20
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:42,275
to see her being carried off.

21
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:44,575
Even though Izuru fought
admirably and defeated

22
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,808
all the assassins, he soon
faced an even greater threat--

23
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:50,942
Makoto's true nature.

24
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:52,908
-[groan]

25
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,242
-What a shame.

26
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:03,042
Just like always,
you're too slow.

27
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:06,442
I'm afraid the princess
is long gone by now.

28
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:08,775
Sorry, Lieutenant Kira.

29
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:13,808
-So all of this madness--
it's your doing?

30
00:03:13,842 --> 00:03:15,308
Third Seat Kibune.

31
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,642
[footsteps]

32
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:35,775
-Team 1 will cover from
here to Section Five East.

33
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,908
Team 2 to Section Eight South.

34
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:40,975
Team 3 go from Section
Four West to Fifth Street.

35
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:42,808
And Team 4 goes to
Section Three North.

36
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:44,775
-Sir, what about
Section Two North?

37
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,908
Central Street?

38
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:46,742
-No need.

39
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:49,042
That's Squad 8's jurisdiction.

40
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:51,475
-But that's near Team
4's assigned section.

41
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:53,375
Wouldn't it be best
to overlap them?

42
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:54,542
-Follow orders.

43
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,308
Moving outside your
jurisdiction will just

44
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:58,008
get you in trouble
with the other squads.

45
00:03:58,042 --> 00:03:58,942
-Yes, sir.

46
00:03:58,975 --> 00:03:59,942
-Get moving!

47
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:13,975
-Within the Seireitei,
the chaos has

48
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:17,642
been contained, thanks to the
work of the Punishment Force.

49
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:21,208
Each squad's deployment to their
assigned section is complete.

50
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:23,542
Our net is spreading quite
wide in this manhunt.

51
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:35,642
-I'll be.

52
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,308
I can't believe you're
still hanging around.

53
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:40,042
-Shunsui?

54
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:41,708
What are you doing here?

55
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:43,842
-I suppose you could
say our squad just

56
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,342
isn't fully ready to deploy yet.

57
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,542
What's with you?

58
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:49,475
You're looking pretty glum.

59
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:52,142
-I just had another talk
with Head Captain Yamamoto,

60
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:53,942
but it's no use what I say.

61
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:56,808
He refuses to take any action.

62
00:04:56,842 --> 00:05:01,275
-Yeah, that old man Yama
can be a stubborn one.

63
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:02,942
-I just don't understand.

64
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:06,042
Is there a reason the
Kasumioji clan is off limits?

65
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:07,308
-Hm.

66
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:11,442
I did some research of my
own, but got zero results.

67
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:13,042
It seems they don't
want outsiders

68
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:14,742
looking into their business.

69
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:16,175
-What do you mean?

70
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,542
-They're high ranking
nobles, yet they rarely

71
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:20,708
present themselves in public.

72
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:24,342
And their clan certainly didn't
associate with Central 46

73
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,208
that much, either.

74
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:30,208
But that Ichigo
is something else.

75
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:33,208
Trouble likes to follow
him wherever he goes.

76
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:34,908
-That's no laughing matter.

77
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:37,075
Imagine if we're
attacked from the outside

78
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,008
while this is going on.

79
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:41,008
-Oh, we'd be fine.

80
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,775
Squad 12 is on it.

81
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,308
Seems like Captain
Kurotsuchi isn't exactly

82
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:47,442
eager to get involved
with the mess going on

83
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:51,775
within the Seireitei, so I'd
say we're covered pretty well.

84
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:53,775
It's probably best
we just concentrate

85
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:55,975
on taking care of
our own duties.

86
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:57,242
Don't you agree?

87
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:57,742
-Sure.

88
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:11,608
-Oh, a Hell Butterfly.

89
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:15,708
-Hm.

90
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:16,908
-Any news?

91
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:19,075
-It appears that while
Izuru was chasing Makoto,

92
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:20,242
he found Princess Rurichiyo.

93
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:21,008
-What?

94
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,208
Izuru found her?

95
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:24,242
-So where is she?

96
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:26,542
-He saw her at the
Squad 3 barracks.

97
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:29,875
-Then that means--

98
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:30,875
-That's right.

99
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:32,908
This fits with what
we've suspected.

100
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:36,608
Makoto is somehow
involved in all this.

101
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:40,342
-That's unfortunate, but you'll
have to deal with him later.

102
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,242
We've gotta save Rurichiyo.

103
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:44,008
-Yes, of course we do.

104
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:46,875
Especially because my squad
is responsible for this.

105
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:48,608
Hurry, come this way.

106
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:49,942
-Huh?

107
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:52,608
But Squad 3's barracks are
located straight ahead of us.

108
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:55,342
-True, but by going
this way, we'll

109
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,975
pass through the section
assigned to Squad 9.

110
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:00,508
-So now squads are
assigned to sections?

111
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:04,475
-It was done to better organize
the 13 Court Guard Squads.

112
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:07,475
But there's a little space in
between each of their assigned

113
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:08,742
sections.

114
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:10,842
This will help us
avoid confrontation.

115
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:11,342
-Right.

116
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,275
Sounds good.

117
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:12,975
-Then let's go.

118
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:18,908
-Hey, Kenny.

119
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:22,075
Now that he's a fugitive,
aren't you gonna go after Ichi?

120
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:22,775
-No way.

121
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:24,542
-Why not?

122
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:26,942
-I don't feel like it.

123
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,742
-Oh.

124
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:32,108
I heard that you were there
during Captain Amagai's

125
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:32,675
examination.

126
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,175
Is that true?

127
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,775
-Yeah.

128
00:07:35,808 --> 00:07:38,142
-If he's on the run
with Ichi, don't you

129
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:40,942
think they'd say you're
responsible for that?

130
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:44,308
-I was tricked into
doing it by the old man.

131
00:07:44,342 --> 00:07:47,408
I don't care either
way about that guy.

132
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:47,908
-Oh.

133
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:02,475
-Captain Amagai!

134
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:04,775
I take it you've
received Izuru's message?

135
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:05,842
-Yes, sir.

136
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,008
-Can you clear up
what's going on, sir?

137
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:09,142
-I'll explain later.

138
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:11,475
Now we need to get to
the fighting arena.

139
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:17,108
-Sir

140
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:18,775
-Hey, Captain!

141
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:21,642
-Those guys!

142
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,108
-They were carrying someone!

143
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:24,208
-Could it be Rurichiyo?

144
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:24,908
-We'll find out.

145
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:27,042
Rukia, look after Shu.

146
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:27,842
-Hold on.

147
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,208
I'll come too.

148
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,508
-Huh?

149
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:34,375
-Aida, Inose, Kano, I want
all of you to go find Izuru.

150
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:35,542
-Yes sir.

151
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:38,108
-Rukia, follow after
us with Sir Kannogi.

152
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,842
-Sir.

153
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,475
-Let's go, Ichigo.

154
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:41,975
-OK.

155
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:54,742
-It was you after all,
Third Seat Kibune.

156
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:56,808
-So you fended off their attack.

157
00:08:56,842 --> 00:08:59,608
I guess that's to be
expected, Lieutenant.

158
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:02,542
Well, it almost worked.

159
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,208
I supplied each of them
with a scaled down version

160
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:07,408
of a bakoto.

161
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:11,642
But even that seems to have
been too much for these men.

162
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:12,808
-I see.

163
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:16,208
You're with the Kasumioji clan.

164
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:20,042
--[laughing] That's
quite an assumption.

165
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:20,975
I've heard enough.

166
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:22,242
It's time for you to die.

167
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:37,975
-Lieutenant!

168
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:43,908
-Third Seat Kibune?

169
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:46,142
-Why are you fighting?

170
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:48,775
-This just doesn't make sense.

171
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:50,475
-Where's Captain Amagai?

172
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,942
-He's with Ichigo Kurosaki.

173
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:53,975
They've both gone
after the princess.

174
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:55,108
-That's good.

175
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:56,575
The butterfly made it.

176
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,242
-But sir, what is going on here?

177
00:09:58,275 --> 00:10:00,775
-Stay back!

178
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,842
Makoto Kibune is our enemy!

179
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,308
-Huh?

180
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:05,742
-You can't mean that.

181
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,742
-Third Seat Kibune, is
what Lieutenant Kira's

182
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,075
saying about you true?

183
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,642
-You better convince
us he's wrong,

184
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:13,708
or you'll be in
a lot of trouble.

185
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:18,575
--[laughing] You small
fries can be so confident.

186
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:19,675
-What?

187
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,575
-I guess I might as
well kill all of you.

188
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:23,342
Rampage, Reppu!

189
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,675
-You three, get out!

190
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,175
-Huh?

191
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:31,975
-Too late.

192
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:41,608
-Now raise your head, Wabisuke!

193
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:55,508
-You're through.

194
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:56,875
Your dull edged
sword is completely

195
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,142
useless against my Reppu.

196
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:09,375
-Huh?

197
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:12,642
Why, you-- what did you do?

198
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:16,675
-My Wabisuke doubles the weight
of any object it touches.

199
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,875
Weight will be added
with each strike.

200
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:21,508
Now your Reppu weighs
six times as much.

201
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,708
Since your weapon is
now too heavy to lift,

202
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:26,975
it is now worthless to you.

203
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:30,008
Makoto, it's time for the truth.

204
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:31,775
Just what are you up to?

205
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:35,475
What's your motive for working
with the Kasumioji clan?

206
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:39,408
I demand to know what has
been going on with this clan.

207
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:42,742
-Whatever the Kasumioji
clan is and whatever it does

208
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:44,275
is over your head.

209
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:47,342
But they do possess
tremendous power.

210
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:51,908
All I want is to use that
power to become even stronger,

211
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,908
until I am the strongest
Soul Reaper ever!

212

[laughing]

217
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:43,921
-Such intense power.

218
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:46,921
Not even Wabisuke can
stop that massive force.

219
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:51,688
-What's wrong, Lieutenant?

220
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:53,088
Where are you?

221
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:56,554
Don't tell me you're dead.

222
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:57,054
Hm.

223
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:09,288
IZURU (VOICEOVER): Makoto's
Zanpakuto is too strong.

224
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:18,721
This isn't good.

225
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:21,788
-Look, I know
you're still alive,

226
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:24,488
and hiding just won't work.

227
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,821
Come out and face your fate.

228
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:30,354
Do it and I promise
you a swift death.

229
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:32,788
Die like a man
instead of a coward.

230
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:37,054
After all, your powers are
no match for what I possess.

231
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:38,721
IZURU (OFFSCREEN):
Third seat Kibune.

232
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:39,221
-Hm?

233
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,154
Come out, Izuru Kira.

234
00:13:46,988 --> 00:13:48,521
IZURU (OFFSCREEN):
You said you wanted

235
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:50,921
more of Kasumioji's
power, didn't you?

236
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:57,654
From what I saw, you already
possess more than enough power.

237
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:03,288
-Show yourself.

238
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:04,521
Where are you, coward?

239
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:09,788
IZURU (OFFSCREEN): You've
been given so much power.

240
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:11,588
Why not use it for good?

241
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,588
-Did you say given?

242
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:18,988
Do you have any
idea how much I had

243
00:14:19,021 --> 00:14:22,454
to sacrifice to attain my Reppu?

244
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,321
You have no idea the cost!

245
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:29,854
There you are!

246
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:39,754
-Hado Number 31, Shakkaho!

247
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,121
-[growling]

248
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:01,621
-Reppu!

249
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:02,454
-Too slow!

250
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:12,321

00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:38,188
-Ha!

-[groaning]

255
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:49,654
-He grew stronger.

256
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:50,654
But how?

257
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:11,121
-How dare you challenge me?

258
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:11,621
-Makoto.

259
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:24,854
-[pained groaning]

260
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:35,588
-What is that thing?

261
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:40,288
-What, you ask?

262
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:44,088
This is my very special bakoto.

263
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,354
-Bakoto?

264
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:46,554
-Yes.

265
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,621
The Kasumioji clan, using
their secret technique,

266
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:52,088
created this great sword.

267
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:55,654
It has vicious
spiritual pressure.

268
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:59,954
Like the ones those
assassins had.

269
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:01,521
-That's where you're wrong.

270
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,954
Their swords filled in for
their lack of fighting skills.

271
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:06,754
Those assassins
were so feeble, they

272
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:08,821
couldn't even use a Shikai.

273
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:11,854
But this bakoto utilizes
my spirit energy,

274
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:14,321
which means it can
grow endlessly.

275
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:17,654
Your cheap techniques
will not work against me.

276
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:20,888
-Why would you want to
possess such a weapon?

277
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:22,754
-Why, you ask?

278
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:23,421
It's simple.

279
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:26,188
To have power.

280
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:27,488
-Power?

281
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:28,688
-That's right.

282
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:30,354
Sheer power.

283
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:31,521
It's all about power.

284
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:42,788
I always did have power,
but for some strange reason,

285
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:44,454
no one chose to recognize it.

286
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,654
MAKOTO (VOICEOVER): Back when
I was attending the Soul Reaper

287
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:59,421
Academy, I was always at the
top of my class academically.

288
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,788
But during all my
years of study,

289
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:06,221
I never received a call to
join the 13 Court Guard Squads.

290
00:18:06,254 --> 00:18:09,021
-Why haven't I been asked to
become a part of the 13 Court

291
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,154
Guard Squads?

292
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:12,354
When other classes
graduated, all their high

293
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:14,021
ranked students
got in, and I just

294
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:16,021
graduated the best in my class.

295
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,921
-You are indeed a high
achiever, young man.

296
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:21,521
But that's not the
only qualification

297
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:23,221
for being accepted.

298
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:25,421
Rather than focusing
on what you have,

299
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,888
reflect instead
on what you lack.

300
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,321
-[growl]

301
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:39,609
-I swear to see to it
that I lack nothing!

302
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,842
I will be strong!

303
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,476
MAKOTO (VOICEOVER):
Instead of allowing

304
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:46,076
myself to wallow in
days of idleness,

305
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:49,442
I continued to train
painstakingly for years.

306
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:51,409
Finally, I attained
a Shikai, and was

307
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:54,142
accepted into the squad.

308
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:57,809
No matter what the
situation, I proved myself.

309
00:18:57,842 --> 00:19:00,676
I killed more
Hollows than anybody.

310
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:01,176
But--

311
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:10,676
My fighting style became
an issue with the others.

312
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:14,409
Instead of being praised, I fell
out of favor within my squad.

313
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:17,509
I faced the real chance of
being banished from the squad

314
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:18,709
altogether.

315
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,309
-Why would you sacrifice
your fellow squad members?

316
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:24,609
-Because they lack the
power to achieve greatness.

317
00:19:24,642 --> 00:19:26,342
-It is the
responsibility of those

318
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:29,176
who have power to save
those of us who do not.

319
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,542
-[growl]

320
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:34,176
MAKOTO (VOICEOVER):
Though I did manage

321
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:38,309
to avoid being discharged I was
still sentenced to probation.

322
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:41,142
And so my chances to ever
become a seated officer

323
00:19:41,176 --> 00:19:43,742
were effectively
over, and I was forced

324
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:46,709
to watch other less skilled
members move up the ranks.

325
00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:48,909
I'd lost my station
within the squad,

326
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:52,709
and finally received orders to
join the Expeditionary Unit.

327
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:55,676
In my despair, I stayed
with the Expedition Unit

328
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:59,076
and continued killing Hollows
to prove my worth to those

329
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:00,409
who didn't recognize my talents.

330
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:11,742
And then finally, I
encountered this awesome power.

331
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:20,676
-[groaning]

332
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:25,176
[screaming]

333
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:48,642
MAKOTO (VOICEOVER): With
this power I now hold,

334
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:51,209
no one will ever be
able to ignore me again.

335
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:56,042
-But it's not enough!

336
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:57,542
I will have more!

337
00:20:57,576 --> 00:21:00,109
I now hold here the
key to great power!

338
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:11,476
Possessing such absolute power
will force every Soul Reaper

339
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:15,342
to respect me and
bow down to me!

340
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:17,309
-His whole being.

341
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,142
That sword has
fully consumed him.

342
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:21,642
-Look at you, Izuru.

343
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:24,309
People like you who have
no real ability, yet

344
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:26,009
still get promoted
to Lieutenant.

345
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:30,276
It's your kind I
exterminate from this world.

346
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:32,576
Your weakness is a crime.

347
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:34,476
A sniveling toad
like you doesn't

348
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:36,476
deserve to have
what you possess.

349
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:38,276
When the last
captain went berserk,

350
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:41,376
you couldn't even stop him.

351
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:44,709
Powerless people like you don't
deserve to stand above me!

352
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,276
Your life's done!

353
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:01,609
Here's the killing blow!

354
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,197
[theme song]

355
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:49,432
SHUNSUI (VOICEOVER): Old
man Yama just won't quit.

356
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:51,765
He keeps sending request
for me to deploy my men.

357
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:52,632
UKITAKE (VOICEOVER):
So much for getting

358
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:53,965
to see how things play out.

359
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:54,899
SHUNSUI (VOICEOVER):
I'm out of excuses

360
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:56,399
to hold off their deployment.

361
00:23:56,432 --> 00:23:57,665
UKITAKE (VOICEOVER):
How about we tell them

362
00:23:57,699 --> 00:23:59,032
they just left a moment ago?

363
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:01,032
SHUNSUI (VOICEOVER):
[laughing] if he calls,

364
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,565
I'll just put him on hold.
