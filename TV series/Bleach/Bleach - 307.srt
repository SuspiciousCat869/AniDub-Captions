Wauugh!

6
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:23,638
But you don't deserve to
learn anything with that
half-hearted resolve!

7
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:25,838
Haaah!

8
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:32,372
Since you won't
teach me willingly,

9
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,205
Guess I'll just have to
force it out of you!

10
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,205
Haaaaa!

11
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:51,572
Finally, I can
ask you directly.

12
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:56,705
Tell me. Why did you choose
to go to work for Aizen?

13
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:06,372
Hm?

14
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:10,338
Is that really what
you want to know?

15
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:11,038
Huh?

16
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:15,405
That's a shame.
You really should've
stayed where you were.

17
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:24,572
Oh, Rangiku.

18
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:30,505
You're a pain.

00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:43,605
<i>It's his sword.</i>
<i>Something's different!</i>

21
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:53,238
Now allow me to
test you out!

22
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:54,905
I'm ready!!

23
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:57,005

Whoa! Wait! So you
two have been awake?!

34
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:06,205
Get this, he was busy
charging up his phone.

35
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:07,872
Sorry!...

36
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:10,705
But I think I'm good to go now.
I borrowed a charger
from the corner store.

37
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:14,138
"Borrowed"!?
Ya mean you stole it?

38
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:17,405
Hey, don't get
so technical.

39
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:20,605
It was an emergency and
the clerk was asleep so
I couldn't pay him.

40
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:24,172
Well, I see your point,
but go pay him later.

41
00:05:25,272 --> 00:05:26,805
I also grabbed us some
food to tide us over!

42
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:28,105
Huh!?

43

<i>Wow!</i>

45
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:33,005
I got some beef jerky, too.

46
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:36,038
If you want something salty,
you could eat that.

47
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,572
So I take it this is what
you eat most of the time?

48
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:43,772
It figures you'd like
really processed stuff.

49
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:44,338
Huh?

50
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:48,372
No way. Ever since middle
school, I've only been
eating home-cooked meals.

51
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:51,472
What? But I thought
your family was...

52
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:56,638
I made it work.
There are plenty of girls
out in the world who are
really good at cooking.

53
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,005
You just gotta know
how to find them,
and then they'll feed you.

54
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:00,605
Augh!

55
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:04,772
That's right. You're one of
those kinda guys aren't you?

56
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:07,238
Isn't that annoying!?
I hate that he treats
women like that!

57
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:11,072
Makes you wish you hadn't
come looking for him right?!
I mean really! Right?! Right?!

58
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,172
Stop touching me!
I agree.

59
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:16,272
[Tatsuki]
So, have you heard
what's going on?

60
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:18,505
Keigo kinda filled me in.

61
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,105
He said the situation's
pretty serious.

62
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:24,605
That there's some dangerous
guy who's coming to kill us.

63
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:26,272
So I got these.

64
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:28,005
Huh?

65
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:30,038
Stun guns
for everyone!

66
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:32,338
Where'd you get
those from?

67
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:38,505
[Tatsuki]
Forget I asked!
Stuns guns aren't
gonna stop him.

68
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:40,838
This guy can put us
out of action just
by coming near us.

69
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:46,438
He turned Don Kanonji's
staff from wood into dust
just by touching it.

70
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,138
Call it a "cane".
Not a staff!

71
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:53,838
He's really that powerful?
And he's not human?
Oh well, forget these things.

00:06:57,272 --> 00:06:57,805

Well of course I'm in

going on here!

How can you all be so
cool and calm right now?

not telling me everything.

Fine! But you're gonna
tell me what you do
know about this later!

89

Hey! We gotta move!!

90
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:56,372

to the alleys!

after us?

"How'd he find us"?

97
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:19,972
[Aizen]
I didn't.

98
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:23,638
I just decided to
stop pretending I
was looking for you.

107
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:02,338

It just might get
through to this guy!

I let you know that the
very first time I met you.

155
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:33,105
<i>I'm a snake.</i>
<i>My skin and blood are cold.</i>
<i>I have no heart</i>

156
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:36,605
<i>I slither, looking for prey</i>
<i>with the tip of my tongue.</i>

157
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:40,838
<i>I swallow everything whole.</i>

158
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:46,138
That's the sort of
creature I am.

159
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:50,338
<i>[Don Kanonji]</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

160
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:52,138
Quit with the gawking,
ya goofballs!

161
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,105
You kids can't
be standing here
flat-footed!

162
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:55,438
This is our
chance to move!

163
00:12:56,072 --> 00:12:58,372
Yeah, he's right!
Let's get the
hell outta here!!

164
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:05,905
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>Oh my.</i>

165
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:09,772
I'm tired of them.
Catching mice is
so boring.

166
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,238
What will you do with them
after you kill them?

167
00:13:14,972 --> 00:13:18,338
I'll hang their corpses on
the outskirts of town,
where they'll be easily seen.

168
00:13:20,205 --> 00:13:23,038
Then I'll get to work
on creating the Ouken.

169
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,005
Sounds good to me.

170
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:30,638
Since that's the case,

171
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:35,972
I'll take care of killing them.
It'll be so much fun.

172
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:39,205
Gin...

173
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,126
Sounds good to me.

174
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:06,559
<i>Since that's the case,</i>

175
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:10,693
I'll take care of killing them.
It'll be so much fun.

176
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:13,326
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>Gin...</i>

177
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,126
(Surprised Gasping for Breath
reax as he is mortally Wounded)

178
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,426
[Gin]
There is only one way to avoid
the power of your Kyokasuigetsu.

179
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,059
<i>And that's to touch its blade.</i>

180
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,459
But it must be done before
its powerful influence puts
one into complete hypnosis.

181
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:44,526
It took me decades of gaining
your trust, just to get that
single fact out of you.

182
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,059
Tch!

183
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,026
[Gin]
In all 13 Court Guard Squads,
not a single person was aware
of that.

184
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,993
But it seems all of them were
quite confident they'd be
able to kill you, Captain.

185
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:01,393
Watching them made
me very nervous.

186
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:03,859
[gasp]

187
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:09,293
The only one who can kill you,
Captain Aizen, is me.

188
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:13,726
I knew that.

189
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:17,793
I brought you here with
me knowing exactly what
your objective was.

190
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:23,126
Because I was interested
in what technique you'd
use in trying to kill me.

191
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:30,659
But I'm disappointed in
you, Gin. Did you honestly
think you could kill me
with something like this?

192
00:15:30,693 --> 00:15:31,959
No, I didn't.

193
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,193
You see this?

194
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,626
There's a tiny piece missing.

195
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,959
Just now, I left a bit of my
blade inside you, Captain.

196
00:15:49,326 --> 00:15:50,193
What?!

197
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:56,293
As for my Bankai's power,
I know I explained it to
you before, right?

198
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,259
Well sorry,
but I lied about it.

199
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:04,559
<i>It doesn't extend</i>
<i>as long as I said.</i>

200
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:06,959
<i>Nor does it extend as</i>
<i>fast as I told you.</i>

201
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,259
<i>However...</i>

202
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:13,693
When it extends and
contracts, It turns to
dust for just an instant.

203
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:15,926
Also,

204
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:20,993
<i>Inside the blade, there is a</i>
<i>powerful poison that dissolves</i>
<i>and destroys cells rapidly.</i>

205
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:22,826
Tch!

206
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:26,626
From the look on your face,
I see you understand.

207
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:31,093
<i>When I was pulling my sword</i>
<i>back out of your chest,</i>

208
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:34,493
<i>I left a fragment of my blade</i>
<i>inside of your heart.</i>

209
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:38,426
<i>You see, that tiny chunk of</i>
<i>metal didn't turn to dust.</i>

210
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,093
Gin!

211
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,793
If you want to say something,
I suggest you say it quickly.

212
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:47,993
But no matter what you say,
you're going to die very soon.

213
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,826
Kill'em,
Kamishininoyari.

214
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:54,693
Gin! Damn you!

215
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,393
You'll die with a hole
through your heart.
Isn't that what you wanted?

216
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:19,959
Huh?

217
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:38,959
Gin...

218
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,593
Gin!

219
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:52,259
[panting]

220
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:10,193
It's over... It's over now.

221
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,493
[explosion]

222
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,393
Yaahhh!!

223
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:40,126
Whoa! What is that?!

224
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,859
I have no idea!

225
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:05,193
It's really hopeless!
We're all going to die!!

226
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:07,159
Hold on!
Keep it together!

227
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:08,993
What could it be!!?

228
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:10,359
Heck if I know!

229
00:20:10,393 --> 00:20:12,493
All I do know is it's
something really bad!!

230
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:44,826
I always win, Gin.

231
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:50,226
Even without it being
inside me, that Hogyoku
that you took from me,

232
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:56,059
Still belongs to me.

233
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,093
What the hell's happening?!

234
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:38,893
<i>He's the one!</i>

235
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,659
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>He's in charge,</i>
<i>he's the boss.</i>

236
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:54,093
<i>So... I'll kill him!</i>

237
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:51,586
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>If tomorrow, you were to</i>
<i>turn into a snake and you</i>
<i>began devouring humans,</i>

238
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:55,052
<i>If with the same mouth,</i>
<i>you told me you loved me,</i>

239
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:58,186
<i>Would I still be able</i>
<i>to say "I love you" the</i>
<i>same way I do today?</i>
