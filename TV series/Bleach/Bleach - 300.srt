1
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:11,200
Hado Number 91, Senjukotentaiho!

2
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,633
Wha-? What in the world...
...is that?

3
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:08,492
<i>Tell you what.</i>
<i>I'll demonstrate it for you.</i>
<i>All thirteen kilometers of it.</i>

4
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:11,425
Bankai,

5
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,025
Kamishininoyari.

6
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:33,625
Hyahhh!

7
00:02:48,392 --> 00:02:49,658
What's wrong, Aizen?

8
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:52,792
Is it my imagination,
or are you getting slower?

9
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:54,325
Perhaps you've
reached your limit.

10
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:58,358
Well now that I think about it,
you may be right about my speed.

11
00:02:58,392 --> 00:03:00,292
I may have actually
reached my limit.

12
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:03,192
My limit as a Soul
Reaper, that is.

13
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:22,225
That was a very nice move there.
Fascinating just how effective
sheer luck can be.

14
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:24,925
You're stupid to
think that was luck!

15
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:30,625
Sorry about all this, Captain
Aizen. I hope I didn't interrupt
your conversation.

16
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:33,092
It's all right.

17
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:39,192
I had pretty much finished
explaining myself.

18
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:45,692
It doesn't matter if you
understand what it is.
You can't escape its influence.

19
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:51,325
You're feeling it now, even as
you try to resist its will.

20
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:55,592
It has the power to destroy
the wall that separates those
beings who are gods...

21
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,125
...from those who are not!

22
00:04:07,358 --> 00:04:08,492
So you've come,

23
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,458
<i>Kisuke Urahara!</i>

24
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,992
Where did he come from?

25
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:43,192
Well now, it's been
a while, Aizen.

26
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:48,925
A hundred years or so?

27
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,825
Since we last crossed paths,

28
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:05,558
You seem to have adopted
quite an interesting look.

29
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,225
As you know, everything in
the process of evolving
tends to look ugly.

30
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:20,092
An odd response.
Who said anything about ugly?

31
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:25,725
I see. You've fused
yourself with the
Hogyoku haven't you?

32
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,625
I wouldn't say 'fused'.

33
00:05:29,758 --> 00:05:32,025
It's more along the
lines of 'subjugated'.

34
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:36,125
I've Subjugated the Hogyoku
you could not control.

35
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:45,458
You're right, my friend.
I couldn't control it...
at the time.

36
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:47,892
At the time?

37
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:52,892
That's a very interesting
remark, Kisuke. Except,

38
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:56,958
I don't believe there's even
the slightest shred of truth
behind what you're implying.

39
00:05:57,392 --> 00:05:58,325
I'll prove it.

40
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:01,592
[gasp]

41
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:05,492
Get out of there, Kisuke!

42
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:10,658
I'm certain that if you had the
power to control the Hogyoku,
you would have done so by now.

43
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:14,458
[baloon inflate & pop]

44
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:15,392
[gasp]

45
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:20,158
Rikujokoro!

46
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:26,525
Hmh.

47
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:32,225
Now that I think about it,
Yammy's battle records
contained an entry that
listed such an item.

48
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:42,358
Wah-ha ha ha ha!

49
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:45,058
I'll tell you what that was!

50
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:46,958
It's called a Bala!

51
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:50,758
A Bala is a projectile
of spiritual energy!

52
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:53,192
<i>It's not as</i>
<i>strong as a Cero.</i>

53
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:57,292
Doesn't need the power,
It's twenty times faster!

54
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:04,192
[sing-song]
Lord Aizen'll
be terribly ma-ad!

55
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:05,058
Huh???

56
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,392
Rrgh!

57
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:13,725
Alive?! But how?!

58
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,458
You're asking if
I'm still alive?
Is that it?

59
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,825
The answer is right here.

60
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:23,225
Huh?

61
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,358
What??

62
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:34,025
A portable gigai!

63
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:38,058
Very good.

64
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:40,892
I let my guard down,
never figuring you'd
resort to such trickery.

65
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:49,558
So what is it you're planning
to do now, after trying to tie
me up with such a weak Bakudo?

66
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:52,792
Such a weak Bakudo, really?

67
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,225
Well then, let's see
how many you can take.

68
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:59,692
Bakudo Number 63!
Sajosabaku!

69
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:05,925
Bakudo Number 79!
Kuyoshibari!

70
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:15,325
Beyond the end of a
thousand hands, the hand
of darkness, out of reach.

71
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:19,892
The archer in heaven
that goes unseen.
Road that lights the way.

72
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:23,425
Wind that ignites the embers.
Converge where I point.

73
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:28,258
Bullets of light, bodies
of eight, rays of nine,
paths of heaven,

74
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:31,858
treasures of speed,
wheels of immensity,
and cannons of gray.

75
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:34,458
The bow is drawn
and fades in light.

76
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:40,125
Really, do you think I'd
let you use such a Kido?
I can easily break free.

77
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:40,858
Too late!

78
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:44,725
Hado Number 91,
Senjukotentaiho!

79
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,092
That's incredible!

80
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:12,758
That's too bad, Aizen.

81
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,358
When you went and
embedded the Hogyoku,

82
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:20,825
It appears you really did let
your guard down, and now,
you have to pay the price.

83
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:22,258
Exactly as I thought.

84
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:22,958
[gasp]

85
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:24,692
Too slow!

86
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,625
I did let my guard down. But at
this point, there's no longer
any reason to be on guard.

87
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:36,858
I can feel the power.

88
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:41,158
Back in the Soul Society,
I realized that no-one could
compare to my capabilities.

89
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:46,092
But now that I have
subjugated the Hogyoku,
I have surpassed even that
performance potential!

90
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:49,525
No matter what you attack
me with, it will fall short.

91
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:55,292
At this point, I have
no intention of dodging
any of your Kido, even
at the nineties level.

92
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:57,192
You've got it wrong.

93
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:03,425
Standing up to my Kido
isn't what I meant by
'letting your guard down'.

94
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:07,592
The old you would have never
attempted to attack me twice,

95
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,825
without first thoroughly
thinking it through.

96
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:20,925
What's happening?

97
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,158
You've been sealed.

98
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:33,658
I've sealed all the
outlets for Spirit Energy.

99
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:36,625
You know, the ones that
are on the wrists of
every Soul Reaper.

100
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:37,825
[gasp]

101
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:40,292
With no outlet for the energy,

102
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:45,092
you'll be incinerated
from the inside by your
own Spirit Energy.

103
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,892
[fright breaths]

104
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:18,792
Did you defeat him?!

105
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:20,258
It's not over yet.

106
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,225
It would be child's
play if that were all
it took to defeat him.

107
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:29,925
We could laugh him off as
some kind of odd monster.

108
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,825
He'll break out of
that trap in no time.

109
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:00,925
Wh---?

110
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,425
What in the world...
is that?

111
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:31,725
You used a nineties-level
Kido as a decoy to lure
me into attacking.

112
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:36,958
And you used a spell you
developed, to incinerate
me from the inside.

113
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:41,758
It was a bold plan,
and it almost worked.

114
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,825
If it hadn't been me who
subjugated the Hogyoku,

115
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:47,225
this battle would probably
have been over by now.

116
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:54,292
But unfortunately for you,
the Hogyoku you created,
exceeds even your ability
to understand it.

117
00:12:56,725 --> 00:13:01,692
<i>As a result, the technique you</i>
<i>created in anticipation of</i>
<i>battling me, is a failure.</i>

118
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,692
<i>It has no effect on me.</i>

119
00:13:23,658 --> 00:13:27,225
Your spell didn't work,
so now you're coming at
me with your sword?

120
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,292
As you wish.

121
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,780
Rgh!

122
00:13:58,913 --> 00:14:00,613
Rrraah!

123
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:25,613
What nonsense is this?
Do you really think
these chains will hold me?

124
00:14:27,247 --> 00:14:28,347
Hyahhh!

125
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,147
You...!

126
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:33,880
<i>...Yoruichi!</i>

127
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:36,680
HaaaAAAA!

128
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:15,280
Did it work?
Is he unconscious?

129
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:17,980
Look out, Yoruichi!
Get out of there!

130
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,247
What's the matter?
You're not done
already, are you?

131
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:40,880
You'd better make your
next move quickly.

132
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:44,313
I plan to crush your
compatriots, one at a time.

133
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:46,380
Until none of them
are left standing.

134
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:53,380
The number of methods you
contrived to defeat me,

135
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:57,313
<i>are proof of your imagination</i>
<i>and strength of will.</i>

136
00:15:58,947 --> 00:16:05,280
At the same time, they
represent the desperation
you're feeling as you try to
overcome my superior power.

137
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:09,847
As you're about to find out,
there's no way you can stop me.

138
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,680
But feel free to mount
your next attack.

139
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:17,913
<i>Kisuke Urahara,</i>

140
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,413
<i>Yoruichi Shihoin,</i>

141
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,647
and of course,

142
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:25,880
Isshin Kurosaki.

143
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:47,480
Well, this presents
a problem.

144
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:48,113
Hm?

145
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:53,813
This iron armor was
specially constructed,
and made for use
against Hierro.

146
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,147
I didn't think it could
be destroyed so easily.

147
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,480
Hmm, what are you saying?
From your tone, you're
implying that it's my fault.

148
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:05,413
No! You're not to blame,
I didn't mean it like that.

149
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:10,147
Yes you did, mister!
You're trying to say
it's my fault, because
I let my guard down!

150
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,480
Huh??

151
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:15,647
Well, listen to me!
You didn't put enough thought
into this armor when you
originally constructed it!

152
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,380
Which means it's all your fault
for not being imaginative
enough when you conceived of it
in the first place
!

153
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:23,547
Okay, I get it!
It's all my fault!
Take it easy!

154
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,980
[Aizen]
I see.

155
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:30,513
Hm?

156
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,180
You overlook the fact that
your leg still remains intact
after being hit by me.
It proves they are special.

157
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,280
You're talking
about my legs?

158
00:17:39,313 --> 00:17:39,980
[snort]

159
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,313
Huh?! What's so
funny, smart-ass?!

160
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:43,947
Dammit, you
hurt my nose!

161
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,813
There's no need
to make a scene.

162
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:55,847
It's meaningless to argue
over whether or not the
armor is adequate.

163
00:17:57,313 --> 00:18:00,847
If a single swing was enough
to make one piece disappear,

164
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,513
then three more swings
should be enough to
destroy it completely.

165
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:07,513
He took the bait.

166
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:08,747
Just like you thought.

167
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:11,047
Are you good to go?

168
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:13,247
Who do you think you're
dealing with here?

169
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,913
All I have to do is
hit him with something
besides my left leg.

170
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,213
Huh??

171
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:26,413
Don't lose your balance!

172
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:27,080
Gh!

173
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,380
Hyaahh!

174
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:56,147
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>Watch yourself.</i>

175
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,647
Your back and neck
are wide open.

176
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,013
Psyched you out,
didn't I?

177
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:02,547
I was just
messing with you.

178
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:06,213
How 'bout we take
a little break?

179
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,480
What?! What are you
talking about?!

180
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,380
Take a load off.
Let's watch the action.

181
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:19,813
Haaaa!

182
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:24,413
It's useless.

183
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,647
You're wasting your time.

184
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:33,647
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>They won't defeat him.</i>

185
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:39,213
I've been working
with Captain Aizen
for a long time now.

186
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:41,580
But I've never seen him
as effective as this.

187
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,247
Of course I didn't know he
had fused with the Hogyoku,

188
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,747
which may have given him a
whole new level of power.

189
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:51,480
You probably don't realize
it yet, but there's nothing
you can do to stop him.

190
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:58,547
<i>He's going to kill all of</i>
<i>you, no matter what you do.</i>
<i>It's only a matter of time.</i>

191
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:01,547
There's no way I'm
gonna let that happen.

192
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:06,247
That's no surprise. It's pretty
much what I figured you'd say.

193
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,947
There's no telling what
Aizen's capable of.

194
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,147
And he probably doesn't
need you, either, now
that he's this powerful.

195
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:18,913
Well, I have to admit,
I wasn't expecting you
to say that.

196
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,280
In fact, the way you said it,

197
00:20:22,313 --> 00:20:26,647
leads me to believe you
may not be expecting to
survive this battle.

198
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:30,813
<i>Maybe somewhere</i>
<i>deep inside of you,</i>

199
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,280
<i>you've given up any</i>
<i>hope of being able</i>
<i>to win this fight.</i>

200
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:35,280
Huh?

201
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:37,213
My, my.

202
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,313
Truly pathetic.

203
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:42,180
<i>I was hoping you'd</i>
<i>be better than that.</i>

204
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:46,213
<i>but I guess you really</i>
<i>are just a kid.</i>
<i>You're weak inside.</i>

205
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,613
I couldn't possibly let
Captain Aizen waste his time,
fighting a coward like you.

206
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:56,513
What're you doing?!

<i>That was so fast!</i>

Butorenjin!

210

212
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:36,713
Huh?

00:21:46,547 --> 00:21:48,080
Yaaah!

216
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:50,080
Way too soft.

217
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:52,980
<i>I'll be the one...</i>

218
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,080
<i>...who'll stop you!</i>

<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

224
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:53,918
[Yoruichi]
And after that, I have to get
rid of any clothing I'm wearing!
