You're mine!

00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:49,747

[shrieking]

00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:06,313
-I got a look at
that thing's face.

10
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,003
And it was Orihime's
dead brother.

13
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:31,403
-I just don't get it.

14
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:33,636
We did Orihime's
brother attack us?

15
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,003
-Not us, just you.

16
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:37,936
Judging from the last
time Hollow you killed,

17
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,636
I would guess there's a more
powerful Hollow behind this

18
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,003
that wants to consume
your spirit energy.

19
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:46,236
It probably has several
Hollows under it's control.

20
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,403
It knows where you are now and
is sending other Hollows here

21
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,570
to carry out its orders.

22
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:55,170
That would explain why Orihime's
brother has come to attack you.

23
00:02:55,203 --> 00:02:57,736
-Did you expect me
to kill him now?

24
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,003
There's no way I could do that.

25
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:00,570
-You have to do it.

26
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:02,603
You haven't got a choice.

27
00:03:02,636 --> 00:03:06,303
If you don't kill him he'll
wander around forever.

28
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,436
And he'll keep coming
after you again and again

29
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,436
until he gets your soul.

30
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,736
Wait, you aren't the
only one in danger.

31
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,670
-Who else would he want?

32
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:21,036
-Orihime, his sister.

33
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,103
-Wow, that was just the
best dinner, wasn't it?

34
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,403
-Yeah, it really was, thanks.

35
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,436
Have you got any dessert?

36
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,570
-I'm out of ice cream.

37
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:28,903
But I do have some bean
sprout and some eggplant

38
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:30,670
jelly we can pour over that.

39
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:32,203
-Ew, no thanks.

40
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:32,836
Huh?

41
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,036
Did you hear that?

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,736
[gasps]

43
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,036
-Poor Enroku fell down.

44
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,036
Oh my gosh, how'd you get
this big rip in your head?

45
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,036
[crash outside]

46
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,503

[crash outside]

48
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,236
-So then Hollows will
attack their own families?

49
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,003
-Brothers, sisters,
even children.

50
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,836
-So explain, why
would they do that?

51
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,636
-Hollows are fallen
souls, souls that were not

52
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,736
guided into the Soul
Society by a soul reaper.

53
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,503
Souls that were not
protected from other Hollows.

54
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:09,703
Abandoned, they fall
and lose their hearts

55
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:12,003
and become Hollows themselves.

56
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:14,536
Now that this Hollow has
failed to devour your soul,

57
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,670
I'm sure he will go
after his sister,

58
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:19,503
the person he loved the
most when he was alive.

59
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:22,336
Remember the bruise we
saw on Orihime's leg?

60
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,536
She said it was from
being hit by a car.

61
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,836
But I've seen marks
like that before.

62
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,236
That mark could only have
been left by a Hollow.

63
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,703
-So you think her brother's
already tried to kill her once.

64
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:35,536
And he's about to try it again?

65
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,603
-That's very possible.

66
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:51,939
[footsteps coming closer]

67
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:03,470
-What?

68
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,570
Is this blood?

69
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:05,236
[footsteps stop]

00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:13,670
-Uh, Orihime?

72
00:05:13,703 --> 00:05:14,170
Ah!

73
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,070
What happened?

74
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:22,270
And why am I bleeding?

75
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,670
[growling]

76
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:33,703
-Something's here.

77
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:35,870
But I--I don't see anything.

78
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:42,103
What's happening?

79
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:43,070
Who's there?

80
00:05:50,903 --> 00:05:51,803
-What's going on?

81
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:54,670
What is that-- that monster?

82
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:58,170
And what is it doing to Tatsuki?

83
00:05:58,203 --> 00:06:01,170
Who's that?

84
00:06:01,203 --> 00:06:02,670
That's me.

85
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:03,670
But how?

86
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:09,170
Where did this come from?

87
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:12,170
I--I can't breath.

I can't just sit here.

91
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:17,670
I've got to do something.

Are you OK?

-Ah!

00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:28,736
Get back!

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,403
Stay away!

98
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:31,970
-What are you screaming
about Tatsuki?

99
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:33,436
It's just me.

100
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,903
What's wrong?

101
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,803
-It's useless talking
to her now Orihime.

102
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:40,203
She can't hear us.

103
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:43,670
She can't even see us.

104
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,236
-Tatsuki!

105
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,636
Why not?

106
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,736
And how do you know my name?

107
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,070
-That makes me sad Orihime.

108
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:57,736
Have you forgotten my voice?

109
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,836
How could you?

110
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,603
It's me, can't you tell?

111
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:02,270
-What are you talking about?

112
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:06,670
-It makes me sad
Orihime, very, very sad.

113
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:13,570
-Huh?

114
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:16,336
-I am the one that
you're really after.

115
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,670
Leave her alone and fight me.

116
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,536
-Huh?

117
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:35,103
-Damn Tatsuki, how did you
get caught up in all this?

118
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:35,703
-Ichigo--

119
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:36,803
-Huh?

120
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:39,070
-Thank you for rescuing
us from that thing.

121
00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:40,636
But where did you come from?

122
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,770
-Whoa, hold on a minute.

123
00:07:42,803 --> 00:07:44,970
How in the hell can you see me?

124
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:46,003
Why shouldn't I?

125
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,170
-Soul reapers are spirit beings.

126
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:55,703
And as such, no ordinary
humans will be able to see you.

127
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:59,470
Only other spirit
beings can see you.

128
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:02,103
-Then she's-- that's right.

129
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:04,270
She's a spirit being now.

130
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:09,205
In other words, Orihime is dead.

Get up!

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:36,736
Ichigo!

140
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,236

Ichigo, no!

144
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:57,885
He's hurt.

145
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,385
I have to go help him.

146
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:00,352
Let me go.

147
00:09:00,385 --> 00:09:02,319
Let me go!

148
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:05,019
-Orihime, have you forgotten me?

149
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:09,019
-Sora?

150
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,319
Is that you?

151
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:21,352
-Ichigo, come on, get up.

152
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:22,385
-I'm trying.

153
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,852
-This is not going to be easy.

154
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:26,585
So where are you hurt?

155
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:27,685
-Like you care.

156
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,219
Forget about it, I'm OK.

157
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:31,252
-Good, because you've
got work to do.

158
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,052
Listen carefully.

159
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:33,185
-Huh?

160
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,485
-That Hollow may have
been her brother once.

161
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,985
But now it's nothing
but a monster.

162
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,619
You've got to stop it.

163
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:39,752
It has no heart.

164
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:41,652
So put aside all your
feelings and destroy it.

165
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,452
-Are you really
Sora, my brother?

166
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:50,719
-Yes Orihime, it's me.

167
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:52,719
-You're lying.

168
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:54,019
My brother was gentle.

169
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,852
He would never do these
things you're doing.

170
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:58,119
-I was so lonely.

171
00:09:58,152 --> 00:09:59,519
-Oh.

172
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:03,685
-You were beginning to forget
about me sister, a little more

173
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:07,052
each day.

174
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:10,585
After I died, you
prayed for me every day.

175
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:14,085
I watched you.

176
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:17,719
It was your prayers and your
thoughts that gave me peace.

177
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:22,585
It relieved me of my loneliness.

178
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:26,085
But after a year had
gone by things changed.

179
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:30,052
You became friends
with that girl.

180
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:31,419
-Huh?

181
00:10:31,452 --> 00:10:36,075
-And then, I saw that you began
to pray for me less and less.

182
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:40,485
Then, when you
entered high school,

183
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,552
you stopped praying
for me completely.

184
00:10:45,585 --> 00:10:48,719
That's why I was so lonely.

185
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,319
-Sora, you don't underst--

186
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,352
-Just listen to me Orihime.

187
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:59,352
If you still have even
a shred of love for me

188
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:02,019
you will not betray me again.

189
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:04,485
Do exactly as I say.

190
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,419
I will deal with him.

191
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:08,352
It won't take long.

192
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:12,785
I shall devour this soul
reaper and put an end to this.

193
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:13,285
-No!

194
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:14,452
Don't!

195
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:16,119
This doesn't have anything
to do with Ichigo.

196
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:17,385
Leave him alone.

197
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,419
It's not right for you to
hurt him just because--

198
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:21,352
-Shut up Orihime.

199
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:23,052
Don't tell me what's
right when it's

200
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:25,652
your fault I've
become this monster.

201
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,819
I should kill you first for
the way you've abandoned me,

202
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:32,719
for choosing this girl and
Ichigo over honoring my memory.

203
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:34,152
I'll kill you.

204
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:36,519
-No you won't, you freak.

205
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:39,885
[shrieking]

206
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:41,352
[wailing]

207
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:57,185
-Let me ask you something
captain overbite, Do you

208
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:59,785
know why Big Brothers
are born first?

209
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,552
There's a reason.

210
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:04,619
They're born first so
that they can look out

211
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:08,852
for their little brothers
and sisters and protect them.

212
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:09,985
-Ichigo!

213
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:13,119
-And here, you threaten
to kill your own sister,

214
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:17,619
even a dead man doesn't ever
have the right to say that.

215
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:18,719
-Shut up.

216
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:20,919
You don't know what
you're talking about.

217
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:23,252
Orihime is mine.

218
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,519
I was 15 when she was born.

219
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:29,519
And I raised her wen our
parents abandoned us.

220
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:32,585
To me she has been been more
like a daughter than a sister.

221
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:37,019
Orihime, come with
me now, back to when

222
00:12:37,052 --> 00:12:40,219
it was just you and
me, happy together.

223
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:44,685
If you'll come then I promise
I will spare these other souls.

224
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,119
-Wait, it's a trap.

225
00:12:46,152 --> 00:12:47,519
You can't believe him.

226
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:49,519
Because he doesn't have the
feelings of a brother anymore.

227
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:52,919
-Are you sure?

228
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:55,885
-That hairpin.

229
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,885
[laughing]

230
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:06,785
[laughing]

231
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,185
[laughing]

232
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,552
-I love you big brother.

233
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:31,519
-Brother?

234
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:38,319
-Brother!

235
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:38,885
-What is this?

236
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:46,619
-Orihime is mine!

237
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:54,819
-Orihime doesn't belong to
anyone, and least of all,

238
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:57,819
to you.

239
00:13:57,852 --> 00:13:58,319
Ah!

240
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,252
-Do it.

241
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,752
What are you waiting for?

242
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:34,519
-Orihime.

243
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:44,352
-Orihime, why did you do that?

244
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,785
-Sora, I had to save Ichigo.

245
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,985
Because this is all my fault.

246
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,119
The reason you're this
way, it's because of me,

247
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:56,885
because I begged you
not to leave me alone.

248
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,852
-(SOBBING) Sora, don't die.

249
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:00,819
Don't leave me
all alone brother.

250
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:02,319
You can't.

251
00:15:02,352 --> 00:15:05,285
You can't.

252
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:09,185
That's why you weren't
able to find peace.

253
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:11,919
And it's all my fault.

254
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,785
-Oh, Orihime.

255
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:16,252
-Since you died I've
always had the sense

256
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:18,452
that you were watching over me.

257
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,619
Because I'd asked you to.

258
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:23,752
Even yesterday, when that
car was about to hit me,

259
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:25,619
you protected me, didn't you?

260
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:28,285
I have this mark because
you pulled my leg

261
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:30,352
to get me out of
the way in time.

262
00:15:30,385 --> 00:15:32,319
That was you, wasn't it?

263
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:34,252
-That explains it.

264
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:37,119
-Then one day I realized that
if I kept depending on you

265
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:40,885
to stay by my side you'd never
be able to rest in peace.

266
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:47,052
But if I showed you that
my life was really happy

267
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:48,985
and that you didn't
need to worry about me

268
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,952
anymore you could pass on.

269
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:54,519
I never dreamed of it would
make you sad and lonely.

270
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:57,852
I would never want to
do that to you brother.

271
00:15:57,885 --> 00:15:58,352
-Orihime--

272
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:03,952
[screams]

273
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:06,085
-Rukia, What the hell's
happening to him?

274
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,919
-The part of him
that's still human

275
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:10,552
is fighting the
Hollow for control.

276
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:14,085
Evidently this one didn't
become a Hollow by choice.

277
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,285
He must've been taken over.

278
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:17,719
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Taken over?

279
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:18,785
By who?

280
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:21,119
-A soul that is devoured
by a strong Hollow

281
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:23,652
is manipulated by
that strong Hollow.

282
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:26,785
And that Hollow desires
your spirit energy.

283
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,785
So it took over this
poor soul planning

284
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:30,419
to use it to attack you.

285
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:33,285
It hoped that since you
knew this soul in life

286
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:36,252
you would hesitate to fight
him, which, in fact, you did.

287
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:40,719
Right now the brother's
soul is desperately

288
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:44,285
fighting that Hollow
for his sister's sake.

289
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,552
[sora moaning in hollow mask]

290
00:16:56,785 --> 00:16:58,419
-No.

291
00:16:58,452 --> 00:16:58,985
-Orihime!

292
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,885
-It's all right.

293
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,685
Fortunately, the
Chain of Fate is still

294
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,585
connected to her chest.

295
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,719
As long as it's attached
to her she will not die.

296
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:09,052
I need to treat her.

297
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:10,552
Stay back.

298
00:17:10,585 --> 00:17:12,852
The power of my Kido
should be able to save her.

299
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:21,452
-That hairpin she's wearing
was a present from you,

300
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:23,785
wasn't it Sora?

301
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,119
He told me that once.

302
00:17:26,152 --> 00:17:28,219
That's why she wears
it every single day.

303
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:47,652
What are you doing?

304
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:51,285
-I only have a short time before
the Hollow overwhelms me again

305
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:54,685
and changes me back
into a monster.

306
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:59,885
So while I'm sane and can still
think clearly, I'll end this.

307
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,119
-No, wait, don't do that.

308
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,985
-Ichigo.

309
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:04,152
It's all right.

310
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,019
He's made the right decision.

311
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,785
Once you become a
Hollow you can never

312
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,952
go back to what you were again.

313
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:12,019
Passing on is the
best thing for him.

314
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:12,952
-But Rukia--

315
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:14,485
-It's OK.

316
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,319
You'll learn that
exorcising a Hollow

317
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:19,652
is not the same
thing as killing it.

318
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:21,519
You're cleansing its
soul and allowing

319
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:23,752
it to enter the Soul Society.

320
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:27,285
That's why soul reapers
exist in the first place,

321
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,352
to help all souls find their
way and finally rest in peace.

322
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,185
-Wait.

323
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:42,852
I have to tell you something.

324
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:49,585
This hairpin,
remember the argument

325
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:53,319
we had about it the
day you gave it to me?

326
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:55,219
I said I didn't like
it because I thought

327
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:57,785
it didn't look grown
up enough for me.

328
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:00,185
I knew I hurt your feelings.

329
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:03,619
And you left without
saying anything else.

330
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:06,019
And it was the last
time I saw you alive.

331
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:11,785
So now I want to say what I
should have said to you when

332
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,519
you went off to work that day.

333
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:26,085
My brother, have a good day.

334
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,652
-Thanks Orihime.

335
00:19:55,452 --> 00:19:59,334
[sobbing]

336
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:11,581
-No way!

337
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:12,681
-Really.

338
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:14,514
What happened was a
Sumo wrestler with a gun

339
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,414
blasted a hole through the
wall into my room last night.

340
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:18,781
-Huh?

341
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:21,348
Please, Orihime, if you're going
to make up stories at least

342
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:22,914
make them sound realistic.

343
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:25,748
Like, maybe a pro wrestling
match spilled out of the ring.

344
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:26,314
[laughter]

345
00:20:26,348 --> 00:20:27,548
-She got you.

346
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:29,548
Don't listen to them Orihime.

347
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:31,314
I like your wild imagination.

348
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:33,114
-But it's not a made-up story.

349
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,081
I swear.

350
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:35,048
It really happened.

351
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:36,148
Right Tatsuki?

352
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,481
-Yeah, I remember
something last night.

353
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:40,448
-So that's what you
did yesterday, huh?

354
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:41,848
-Mm-hmm.

355
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:44,181
-Ichigo, what's with these
monsters and that big sword?

356
00:20:44,214 --> 00:20:47,014
And wah!

357
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,114
-Orihime, what
did you do to her?

358
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,681
Memory replacement.

359
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:52,581
I wiped out her memory
of the night's events

360
00:20:52,614 --> 00:20:54,414
and gave her a new one.

361
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:55,914
-Memory replacement?

362
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:57,948
-Unfortunately, there's
no way to predict

363
00:20:57,981 --> 00:20:59,981
what her memory will
be replaced with.

364
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:04,514
So tomorrow we'll find out what
she thinks happened tonight.

365
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:07,181
-You used the same thing
on my family the other day,

366
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:07,948
didn't you?

367
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:09,281
-That's right, I did.

368
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,681
What's wrong?

369
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:19,081
-I'm still not ready to actually
commit to this or anything.

370
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:21,248
I'm not so noble a
person that I can promise

371
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:25,381
to risk my life for a complete
stranger just like that.

372
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:29,381
On the other hand, though, I
could never just stand around

373
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:32,081
and watch while someone
else was being hurt.

374
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:35,648
So I'll help you.

375
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:39,281
At least, I will for now,
with this work of yours,

376
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:40,114
as a soul reaper.

377
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:49,648
-Good, I'm counting on you.

378
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,281
[theme music]

379
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,376
-Dear brother, thank
you for watching over me

380
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,910
all this time from
the spirit world.

381
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:03,276
I'll do my best to find
happiness in this life

382
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,743
so you don't have to worry.

383
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:06,376
-Orihime, the
show's already over.

384
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,576
You're messing up the
preview for the next one.

385
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,776
That's great.

386
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,543
And now we're out of time.
