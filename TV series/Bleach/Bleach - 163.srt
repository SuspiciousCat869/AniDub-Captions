NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

3
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:53,347
who was kidnapped by Sosuke
Aizen, Ichigo and his friends

4
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:56,075
snuck into Hueco Mundo,
the realm of the Hollows,

5
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:59,114
and infiltrated Aizen's
fortress, Las Noches.

6
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:01,580
In the battles that
followed, the Espada Nnoitora

7
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:04,995
defeated Chad, and Rukia
exhausted all of her strength

8
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:08,028
only to reach a draw with
the lethal Aaroniero.

9
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,761
Sensing that Rukia
was in danger,

10
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:13,095
Ichigo tried to rush
to her aid, but was

11
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:14,428
intercepted by Ulquiorra.

12
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:19,961
-You kidnapped her
and brought her here!

13
00:02:19,995 --> 00:02:21,761
I suspected that she
didn't come to Hueco

NARRATOR: When Ichigo
learned Ulquiorra

18
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:42,261
was responsible for
kidnapping Orihime,

19
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,661
he charged into
battle against him.

20
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,828
But Ichigo found
himself outmatched,

21
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:49,561
and a direct hit from
Ulquiorra's powerful Cero

22
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:53,161
caused him serious injuries.

23
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:55,261
ULQUIORRA: Was that it?

24
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:57,095
Finished, Ichigo?

25
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:58,561
-What?

26
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,061

You're the leader of

So it's very simple.

31
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:38,061
What I have to do is
defeat you in battle.

32
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:40,928
Then this war is
as good as over.

Kurosaki, it's pointless.

You cannot defeat me.

41

Even if you were lucky
enough to succeed,

42
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,695
there are three

looked like you were pretty
anxious to go outside,

out and open the door for you.

165
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:09,261
-(SHOUTING) Boo!

166
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:10,261
[shouting]

167
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:13,028
-You're such an idiot.

168
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:15,395
-Lord Aizen'll kill
you, you hear me?

169
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:16,595
He'll wipe you out.

170
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:19,595
There won't be a trace of
you left when he's done.

171
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:21,028
[scream]

172
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:27,395
-What morons.

173
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:29,595
Like Aizen would give
two cents for a couple

174
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:32,261
of worthless pissants like you.

175
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:36,695
-Why are you doing this?

176
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:38,495
-Returning the favor
for my left arm.

177
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:53,628
-What?

178
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:55,395
-Don't act so shocked.

179
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:58,495
Did you think I came
here just to save you?

180
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:00,861
Stupid girl.

181
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:02,995
Now that I've repaid
my debt to you,

182
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:06,195
you have no excuse
to turn me down.

183
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:07,595
Just a small favor.

184
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:09,895
There's something I need
you to help me with.

185
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:16,795
[shouting]

186
00:11:21,795 --> 00:11:24,695
[wailing]

187
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:26,195
FRACCIONES: Why?

188
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:29,161
Medazeppi's been killed.

189
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:29,828
Medazeppi!

190
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:33,128
I can't believe it!

191
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:34,261
No!

192
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,595
-Well, there sure are a
lot of them down there.

193
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:40,195
I can't tell how powerful each
one is individually, though.

194
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:41,228
PESCHE: Uryu!

195
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:42,061
Psst!

196
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:43,095
Hey, Uryu!

197
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:44,695
How's it looking out there?

198
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:45,895
Are they impressed?

199
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:48,928
Are they trembling in fear
at your very appearance?

200
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:50,895
URYU: Could you please
stay out of this?

201
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:52,328
Every time you
stick your nose in,

202
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,361
you stir up too much excitement.

203
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:55,761
-What a rude thing to say!

204
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:58,961
I never stir up excrement,
with or without my nose.

205
00:11:58,995 --> 00:11:59,795
Oh, wait.

206
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:01,295
You said excitement, didn't you?

207
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:01,795
-Huh?

208
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:05,261
[shouting]

209
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:06,761
-We must destroy.

210
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:08,261
[shouting continues]

211
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,761
FRACCION: Kill him!

212
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:13,728
[shouting continues]

213
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:22,161
-Be quiet, everyone!

214
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:23,561
-Huh?

215
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:26,661
SZAYELAPORRO: Our guest looks
like he wants to say something.

216
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,961
Out of politeness, the least
we can do is hear him out.

217
00:12:29,995 --> 00:12:31,561
-Thanks a lot for
your good manners.

218
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:38,928
Listen, I'm sorry to
be so abrupt with you,

219
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:40,928
but I need to find
out something.

220
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,728
Tell me, are you an Espada?

221
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:49,195
-Very perceptive of you.

222
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:52,295
As a matter of fact, I'm
Espada number eight, also known

223
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:56,228
to my colleagues as
Szayelaporro Granz.

224
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:58,461
-Number eight, you say?

225
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,861
Well, that's a relief of sorts.

226
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:03,128
At least you're not
number one or two.

227
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:05,961
-I see your point.

228
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:08,028
You can relax, if you wish.

229
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:11,328
But the fact is I'm
still stronger than you.

230
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:14,495
Speaking of which,
exactly who are you?

231
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,495
-I'm Uryu Ishida,
and I am a Quincy.

232
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:22,795
--[delighted laugh]
How fascinating.

233
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:25,428
You're the one who defeated
that moron, Cirucci!

234
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:26,761
[laughing]

235
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:36,428
-Huh?

236
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:40,861
--[laughing] What
incredible luck.

237
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:43,828
I get a Bankai
user and a Quincy.

238
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:45,461
What could be better than this?

239
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:50,395
[laughing] If I were Yammy,
I'd be jumping up and down,

240
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:52,428
screaming "Que suerte!"

241
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:56,595
[laughing]

242
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:57,595
[gasp]

243
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,261
-Yes, I agree.

244
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:02,328
I don't know who Yammy is,
but I feel lucky as well.

245
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:04,861
I get the pleasure of fighting
someone who thinks he's smart

246
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:07,728
but leaves me plenty of
opening so I can take my time

247
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,128
and fire an accurate shot.

248
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:18,395
[choking]

249
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:32,134
I get the pleasure of fighting
someone who thinks he's smart

250
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:35,034
but leaves me plenty of
opening so I can take my time

251
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:36,368
and fire an accurate shot.

00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:38,834

-You ignorant fool.

262
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,401
Did you think your
measly little arrow

263
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:48,434
was actually going
to take me down?

264
00:15:48,468 --> 00:15:51,634
What did you think occurred,
that you'd pierced my body

265
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:57,434
and ran me through,
is that it? [laughing]

266
00:15:57,468 --> 00:15:58,434
Come on, now.

267
00:15:58,468 --> 00:15:59,934
Didn't you think
something was wrong

268
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:03,568
when I revealed that I knew
who you'd fought against?

269
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,668
I've just been toying with
you because I've already

270
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:08,901
finished analyzing all of
your strengths and weaknesses.

271
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,768
You're done, Quincy.

272

-What happened?

275
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:35,701
Why am I still--

276
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:36,401
LOLY: It was her.

277
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:42,901
She did it.

278
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:56,934
-Heal all of those injuries
you have on your face.

279
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:03,701
I want you to get
rid of them now.

-Hey.

282
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:24,834
-What?

283
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:27,068
Wait a minute, what are
you going to do to me?

284
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:30,334
-Ayame, Shun'o--

285

-What the hell are you doing?

286
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:33,701
Don't touch me.

No.

No way.

00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:43,934
(VOICEOVER) What the hell?

293
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:45,401
What's going on?

294
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:47,268
What is she?

295
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,301
It's impossible!

She's-- she's a monster!

URYU (VOICEOVER): The
strength behind my arrows

299
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:16,168
is getting weaker.

300
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:16,668

Huh? (VOICEOVER) You're
getting weaker by the minute.

305
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:40,884
What the--

306
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:49,068
Damn!

307
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:06,268
-Well, I think I had better
do some fine tuning here.

308
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:11,468
[laughing] It should be amusing
to see how he handles this.

00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:18,068
What's going on with Uryu?

312
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:19,834
As powerful as he
is, he should be

313
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:22,968
able to easily finish these
guys off with his weapon.

314
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:24,434
Huh?

315

If he keeps this up, he's
going to get us both killed.

-Oh no.

about to disappear.

doing nothing.

Find some way to defeat him.

your specialty was

00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,601
finding the enemies' weak spots.

331
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,534
Now would be a good
time to prove it!

332
00:21:30,568 --> 00:21:33,068
There must be some way to
turn this fight around.

-I do have a way
to beat these guys.

335
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:41,601
You want to try it?

336
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,501
-Hmm.

337
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:45,901
Sure, I'm in.

338
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:49,534
But first, I got a
little favor to ask.

339
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:51,668
See if you can manage
not to screw this up.

340
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:52,868
-Don't worry.

341
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:55,268
It'll work, as long as you
don't make any mistakes.

URYU: What should we do, Renji?

345
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,863
RENJI: I'm going to slam
them with my spirit energy.

346
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,263
URYU: But we're outmatched.

PESCHE: Are you
suicidal or what?

348
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:55,230
URYU: You've planned
this out, right?

349
00:23:55,263 --> 00:23:56,230
RENJI: Hell, no.

350
00:23:56,263 --> 00:23:57,596
I'm flying by the
seat of my pants.

351
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,963
URYU: You're gonna
get us all killed.

352
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:00,830
PESCHE: In the interest
of self-preservation,

353
00:24:00,863 --> 00:24:04,363
can we work together, boys?
