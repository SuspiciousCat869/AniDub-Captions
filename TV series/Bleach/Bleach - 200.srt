00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:51,561
NARRATOR: Under orders
from Genryusai Yamamoto,

3
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:53,961
the captains of the
13 Court Guard Squads

4
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:57,527
came to Hueco Mundo to rescue
Ichigo and his friends who

5
00:01:57,561 --> 00:02:00,261
had been defeated by
the powerful Espadas.

6
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:03,494
Without hesitation, each
captain flung themselves

7
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:06,027
into battle against the Espadas.

8
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:09,227
In defense of Uryu and
Renji, Mayuri Kurotsuchi's

9
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:11,761
took on the Espada Szayelaporro.

10
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:14,161
Although his opponent
had taken Nemu hostage,

11
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:18,294
Mayuri swallowed him using
Konjiki Ashisogi Jizo.

12
00:02:18,327 --> 00:02:21,061
Mayuri thought he had
destroyed the powerful Espada,

13
00:02:21,094 --> 00:02:24,227
but it turned out
Szayelaporro was still alive.

14
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,294
It was soon revealed
that Szayelaporro

15
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:29,494
had revived himself by invading
the body of his captive, Nemu,

16
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:31,094
and sucking out her Reishi.

17
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:31,994
-How delightful.

18
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:38,861
Really, such an
amusing little power!

19
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:41,127
It tickles my fancy.

20
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,161
And is that's all you've got?

21
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:52,561
Well, I suppose this means you
have no other hidden power.

22
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:55,494
In that case, why
don't we move along?

23
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:58,261
I'd like to use you as a
test subject for a new drug

24
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,927
I've developed.

25
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:05,027
There's no need to
put up your defenses.

26
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:12,394
The drug I'm testing is
(SLOWLY) already inside you.

27
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:13,361
-What?

28
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:14,827
His voice.

29
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,794
What the--

30
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:18,561
NARRATOR: In
appropriating Nemu's body,

31
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:20,494
Szayelaporro had been
tricked by Mayuri

32
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:22,527
and drugged without
his knowledge.

33
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:24,994
The drug was a
superhuman potion which

34
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:27,194
appeared to make
Szayelaporro perceive time

35
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:28,861
at an extremely slow pace.

36
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:31,394
It made instantaneous
movements appear

37
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:33,861
as though they had
actually stopped.

38
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:39,894
-Now, then, this sword, does
it appear to have stopped?

39
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:42,461
With what's coursing
through your veins,

40
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:45,494
one second will
feel like 100 years.

41
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:47,294
Take this sword, for instance.

42
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,961
As I move it closer to you,
your superhuman alertness

43
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:53,694
makes the movement
appear agonizingly slow,

44
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:57,861
as if it will take several
centuries to reach you.

45
00:03:57,894 --> 00:03:59,994
It's delightful.

46
00:04:00,027 --> 00:04:04,027
But while your senses are
sped up to superhuman levels,

47
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:08,861
your non-superhuman body
will fall painfully behind.

48
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:13,694
In fact, your body cannot
possibly keep up with

49
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:16,927
the incredible amount of data
your sharpened senses are

50
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:18,161
sending it.

51
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:27,327
Well, we're in no
hurry, I suppose.

52
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,927
Yes, take your time.

53
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:33,027
Enjoy the everlasting
agony of my sword

54
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:35,061
slicing through your heart.

55
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:39,294
Savor it till your
blood turns to dust.

56
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:41,827
For now, I bid you adieu.

57
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:45,527
You'll be seeing me
again in about 100 years.

58
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,661
SZAYELAPORRO (VOICEOVER):
It's been so long.

59
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:57,527
How many years?

60
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:03,961
How many decades have come
and gone since he-- no, wait,

61
00:05:03,994 --> 00:05:06,161
it's been longer than that.

62
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:08,294
It's been centuries.

63
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:12,727
I know this much, an immense
amount of time has passed.

64
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,894
How long will it take?

65
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:18,727
When will the sword go
ahead and pierce my heart.

66
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:22,927
This waiting is unbearable.

67
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:28,194
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry, hurry.

68
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,094
[heaves]

69
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,927
Hurry up and kill me!

70
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,294
-The perfect being, you said?

71
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:49,594
Well, I have to tell you the
honest truth as I see it.

72
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:52,694
In this world, nothing
perfect exists.

73
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:59,061
It may be a cliche after all,
but it's the way things are.

74
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:01,161
That's precisely
why ordinary men

75
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,261
pursue the concept
of perfection.

76
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:03,961
It's infatuation.

77
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:10,061
But ultimately, I
have to ask myself,

78
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:12,927
what is the true meaning
of being perfect?

79
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:15,961
And the answer I came
up with was nothing.

80
00:06:15,994 --> 00:06:19,261
Not one thing.

81
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:23,061
The truth of the matter
is, I despise perfection.

82
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:27,027
If something is truly
perfect, that's it!

83
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:31,827
The bottom line becomes there
is no room for imagination.

84
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:35,994
No space for intelligence
or ability or improvement.

85
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:38,327
Do you understand?

86
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:41,127
To men of science,
like us, perfection

87
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:44,961
is a dead end, a
condition of hopelessness.

88
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:48,427
Always strive to be better than
anything that came before you,

89
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,827
but not perfect.

90
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:54,461
Science has agonized over the
attempt to achieve perfection.

91
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:56,794
That's the kind of
creatures we are.

92
00:06:56,827 --> 00:07:00,127
We take joy in trying to
exceed our grasp, in trying

93
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:03,427
to reach for something that,
in the end, we have to admit

94
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:06,661
may, in fact, be unreachable.

95
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:10,294
In other words, you may
think that we operate

96
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:12,427
on the same level,
but you are wrong.

97
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:14,494
The moment you started
talking about perfection,

98
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:16,661
you embraced that
impossible concept

99
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:20,294
and had already lost to me.

100
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:25,794
That is, of course, if you are
indeed a scientist at all--

101
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:26,794
-[gasps]

102
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:39,727
Huh?

103
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:41,527
Wait a second.

104
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,027
Don't you have a problem?

105
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:44,494
Your Zanpakuto is broken.

106
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:48,761
-Heh, it's not broken like that.

107
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:50,927
I broke it myself.

108
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:53,161
-What's the difference?

109
00:07:53,194 --> 00:07:56,761
-As long as the hilt remains,
it can be reconstructed.

110
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:59,227
And really, the
sword deserved it.

111
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,927
It's a fitting punishment after
it disobeyed my instructions.

112
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:19,894
Nemu, get up and come here.

113
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:22,427
Nemu!

114
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,827
NEMU: Tch.

115
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:25,694
-Good grief.

116
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:27,694
She's becoming more
trouble than she's worth.

117
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:37,494
-Huh?

118
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:38,661
What's he up to?

119
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:39,827
Is he reviving her?

120
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:42,661
NEMU: [moaning]

00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:44,561

[sighs]

127
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:04,261
RENJI AND URYU: She
came back from the dead!

128
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:04,894
-What?

129
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:05,994
We were watching.

130
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:08,861
How in the world
did you do that?

131
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:10,161
-Unbelievable!

132
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:11,594
You couldn't
understand something

133
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:13,927
this obvious happening
right in front of you?

134
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:15,027
What idiots!

135
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:16,727
-Don't turn this back on us!

136
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:17,661
Admit it.

137
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:18,727
You did something
to her just now,

138
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,194
and you couldn't even
show the audience!

139
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,894
-What are you talking
about, you Neanderthal?

140
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:26,094
I never do anything that isn't
suitable for family viewing.

141
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:27,961
Get your mind out of the gutter.

142
00:09:27,994 --> 00:09:29,794
[both grunt]

143
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:30,594
-Humph.

144
00:09:30,627 --> 00:09:31,927
Never mind.

145
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:34,894
I've learned from experience,
describing my techniques

146
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:38,061
to ordinary people is just
a complete waste of time.

147
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:40,827
-So then, you refuse
to explain yourself?

148
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:43,127
[coughs]

149
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:45,294
-Are you all right over there?

150
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:47,427
Try not to get so excited.

151
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,394
-What?

152
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:49,927
What are you talking
about excited?

153
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:51,894
I have every right to
get upset about something

154
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:53,894
as blatant as what we observed.

155
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,727
I was simply standing
up for public decency!

156
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,094
Whose side are you on?

157
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:59,294
-On yours.

158
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:01,094
I'm just saying that even
though the poison has

159
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:03,861
gone from our systems, our
organs are still crushed!

160
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,494
We have to be careful, or
we'll injure ourselves.

161
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:09,027
-But the way you said
it wasn't very clear.

162
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:10,094

329
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:48,098
You don't know what
you're talking about!

330
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:51,598
Dodging an attack is nothing
more than a fighting instinct.

331
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,265
The natural reaction
developed from years

332
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:55,432
of hand-to-hand combat.

333
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:57,532
But it changes nothing!

334
00:18:57,565 --> 00:19:01,332
No matter what you do,
your sword cannot cut me.

335
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:04,232
That's why you are doomed
to lose this battle!

336
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,932
[pants]

337
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,132
KENPACHI: There are many
different personalities

338
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:15,432
within the Soul Society.

339
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,565
I've come across
annoying guys like you

340
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:25,198
before who say they
can't be cut by my sword.

341
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:27,798
But guess what?

342
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,098
-[gasps]

343
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:33,232
-In all this time, I
haven't met a single person

344
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:35,698
whose eyes and throat
can't be speared!

345
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:38,665
-Ugh!

346
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:39,665
[both gasp]

347
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,947
-How many times are
you going to make

348
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,014
me say it until you believe me?

349
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:09,514
-[gasps]

350
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:14,780
-No matter how much you
try, I cannot be cut!

351
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:15,280
-Kenpachi!

352
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,547
-Hah, I guess you can't
understand it, can you?

353
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,514
How can someone still be
alive after you've just

354
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:39,380
run a sword through their head?

355
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:44,380
Isn't that what's going
through your head?

356
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:46,314
[laughs]

357
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:53,647
Well, here's your answer.

358
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,147
-Bastard!

359
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,614
I can't believe this.

360
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:04,947
-Surely, no one
could survive when

361
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,414
their head's been run
through with a blade.

362
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:13,247
But just look at
me, I'm still alive.

363
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,980
Have you figured it
out, Soul Reaper?

364
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:18,380
Your sword didn't
pierce my head.

365
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:20,347
Oh no, not at all.

366
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,280
It simply passed
through my head.

367
00:21:27,214 --> 00:21:29,147
Now, do you understand?

368
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,714
You can't defeat
me, Soul Reaper.

369
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,514
You don't have the power!

370
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:36,580
You might as well give up.

371
00:21:36,614 --> 00:21:37,080
-Yeah.

372
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,456
[theme music]

373
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:19,544
PESCHE: We have to
go save master now.

374
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:20,544
DONDOCHAKKA: We can't.

375
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:22,211
I hear there's a
beast threatening her.

376
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:23,744
PESCHE: What do
you mean a beast?

377
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:24,878
DONDOCHAKKA: He's a
spiky-haired warrior

378
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,444
with scars and a
threatening gaze.

379
00:23:26,478 --> 00:23:27,678
PESCHE: He's our ally.

380
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:30,111
DONDOCHAKKA: Tell me,
is he really our ally?

381
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:33,644
PESCHE: I wouldn't
stake my life on it.
