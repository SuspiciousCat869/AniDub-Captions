-Your the fourth?

00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:11,245
-Ichigo Kurosaki,
it's pointless.

5
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:15,278
You cannot defeat me.

6
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:17,978
Even if you were lucky
enough to succeed,

7
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:20,045
there are three
Espada ranked above me

8
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:24,545
who are much stronger than I.
Try as many times as you like.

9
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:36,611
The results will
always be the same.

10
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:42,511
It appears that I have
grossly overestimated you.

11
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:45,578
Your development didn't
meet my expectations.

12
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:52,978
[roaring]

13
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,978
-A waste of time.

14
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:03,711
Oh, no!

15
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:07,578
That weapon's
about to disappear.

-Don't stand around
doing nothing!

19
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,278
Find some way to defeat him!

20
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:19,078
I always thought
your specialty was

21
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:20,878
finding the enemy's weak spots.

22
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,811
Now would be a good
time to prove it!

23
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:24,911
There must be some way to
turn this fight around!

24
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:32,345
-I do have a way
to beat these guys.

25
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,245
You want to try it?

26
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:35,045
-Hmm!

27
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:38,245
Sure, I'm in.

28
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:42,111
But first, I got a
little favor to ask.

29
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:44,311
See if you can manage
not to screw this up.

30
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:47,511
-Don't worry, it'll work as long
as you don't make any mistakes.

31
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,278
Renji.

32
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,545
-Hmm?

33
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:10,811
-Tell me, how many
seconds can you stall him?

34
00:04:14,945 --> 00:04:17,211
-20 seconds would
be a generous guess.

35
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:19,078
I'm sorry it can't be longer.

36
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:20,878
-I understand.

37
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:22,411
That's more than enough.

38
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:24,045
Let's go!

39
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:25,511
-Everyone stay back.

40
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:27,278
No one interfere with us.

41
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:30,678
This should be
fascinating, an opportunity

42
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:33,845
to see with these two pathetic
creatures and their puny brains

43
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:36,078
are capable of in their
wretched condition.

44
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:44,811
-Ahhhh!

45
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:46,645
Uhhhhhh!

46
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:49,011
Ahhhh-- oh!

47
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:53,278
Wait a second.

48
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:55,411
That doesn't hurt at all.

49
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:58,178
That knucklehead Uryu,
going off on his own.

50
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:00,311
How can I play the
goofy comedic character

51
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,511
without a straight man?

52
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:03,445
Take a look at what I just did!

53
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:05,945
I fell on my butt because
I was always like this,

54
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:07,345
not because I was playing dumb.

55
00:05:07,378 --> 00:05:09,645
I'm a natural comedian!

56
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:12,878
[growling]

57
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:15,211
I seemed to have fallen
into the middle of something

58
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:16,378
very strange.

59
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:18,078
I don't know what's
going on, but nobody here

60
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:19,145
looks to friendly.

61
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:20,411
Is this bad?

62
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,211
It isn't good.

63
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:22,878
I definitely think it's bad!

64
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:33,945
That's-- Dondochakka!

65
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:36,645
He must have come down
here with Renji, but what

66
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:38,211
the heck happened to him?

67
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:40,911
Could he have ended up
in that amusing pose

68
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:44,245
just because he got
mixed up in this battle?

69
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:45,378
Damn it!

70
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,311
That idiot is officially
not my friend anymore.

71
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:51,011
I'm going to cry! [sobbing]

72
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:52,811
But still, I found him.

73
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:55,145
I can't leave him
stuck in there.

74
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:58,445
Please nobody notice me.

75
00:05:58,478 --> 00:05:59,845
Please!

76
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:02,078
-Did you hear a
rustling sound just now?

77
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,278
-Come to think of it, I did.

78
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,111
-It's all right, Pesche.

79
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:07,011
You can do this.

80
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:09,711
No one will notice you at all.

81
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:10,545
Huh!

82
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,445
Not that people don't notice me.

83
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:14,678
I have a sparkling personality.

84

--[together] Could it
have been a cockroach?

-Oh, no!

87
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:22,445
Those cockroaches
scare me to death.

88
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:24,378
-But you're as big as a house.

89
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:26,045
FRACCION: It doesn't
matter how big I am.

90
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:27,078
They can fly!

-Flap flap flap flap flap!

antenna, they move!

-Twitchy twitchy.

00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:36,145
FRACCION: And their
butts, they're all shiny.

95
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:38,111
I hate 'em!

96
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:41,611
Disgusting cockroaches!

-Be quiet!

98
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:44,211
This is not the
time for whining.

99
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:46,078
-They haven't noticed me at all.

100
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:47,445
That's kind of
disappointing when

101
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:48,845
you stop to think about it.

102
00:06:48,878 --> 00:06:50,478
I'm feeling neglected.

103
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,378
Maybe if they
notice me a little,

104
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,378
I mean, just a tiny little bit.

105

00:06:58,445 --> 00:06:59,445

108
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:02,911
-You got out by yourself!

109
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:05,678
-Wha-- wha-- wha--
where are you, Pesche?

110
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:07,611
Oh, Pesche, did you
come here to save me?

111
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:08,278
It was terrible!

112
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:08,745
-Yeah!

113
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:09,311
Shhh!

114
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,111
-Oh, the horror!

115
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:11,445
I was terrified.

116
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:12,545
Terrified, Pesche!

117
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:14,678
-Stupid Dondochekka,
hold down the volume.

118
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:17,011
If they discover us, they'll
squash us like cockroaches.

119
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:17,945
Be quiet!

I'm telling you to shut up!

123
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:22,611
That was your last warning.

124
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:23,945
How was that, buddy boy?

125
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:24,945
Hurts a bit, doesn't it?

126
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,145
I'm an expert on butts.

127
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:28,045
Mine just about cracked in
half a little while ago.

128
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:30,711
If it had broken, I'd give
you one butt cheek. [laughing]

129
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:31,845
One butt cheek!

130
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:33,678
-Pesche, it might be a
good idea to try quiet.

131
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:38,011
-[together] Noooooo!

132
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,945
-Don't kill us!

133
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:47,878
-Nice!

134
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:48,878
Huh?

135
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:50,345
What was that?

136
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:04,145
-I was wondering what
you were planning to do.

137
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:08,045
As I expected, brute force
is your only options.

138
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:15,345
What a fool.

139
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:33,045
What do you think you're doing?

140
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,745
Unfortunately for you, I'm
not into this sort of thing.

141
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:38,445
-A ring of heat beyond all
of the seas in reverse.

142
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:38,945
Take steps--

143
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:39,878
-What's that?

144
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:41,411
Talking to yourself now?

145
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:42,711
Huh!

146
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:44,545
-There's no doubt there's a
big difference in strength

147
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:47,278
between you and me
with only my Shikai.

148
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:48,945
Frankly, I don't
think I have a chance

149
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:53,945
of winning the fight,
not when we're so close.

150
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:56,311
But I think
nonetheless that even

151
00:08:56,345 --> 00:08:58,011
if the difference in
our powers is great

152
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:02,311
and there is no comparison
in our strength,

153
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:03,811
you're going to
find it pretty damn

154
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:06,045
painful if you get
hit point blank.

155
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,711
I was always lousy at Kido.

156
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:10,311
I would get scolded
for losing control

157
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:12,878
and having my spells explode.

158
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:14,111
You're pretty arrogant.

159
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:17,478
Let's find out for sure
who's tougher, you or me.

Hado 31 Shakkaho!

Damn you!

You lousy Soul Reaper!

165
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:44,045
Do you know who
you're dealing with?

166
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:45,045
Huh?

When Rengi attached,
you moved away from him

00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:53,078

distance between you.

If you are attacked
you, change your stance,

-It's called Sprenger.

197
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,578
It destroys everything
within the pentagram

198
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:49,111

of the Ginto and the Seele

200
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,678
Seele Schneider has the ability
to store Reishi in its hilt.

201
00:11:55,711 --> 00:11:57,411
It absorbs Reishi
that is released

202
00:11:57,445 --> 00:11:59,845
by an enemy in a fight.

203
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:06,378
I can use that Reishi to

I used it to draw

Then by adding a drop of
the compressed spirit energy

from my Ginto, I can

208
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:21,511
It's powerful, but
it's difficult to use

332
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:32,278
-Who did this?

333
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:34,745
-Grimmjow.

334
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:37,645
-He's got a style of fighting
that is his, and his alone.

335
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:40,145
It's very particular to
him, like a signature.

336
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:42,112
But I doubt he's aware of it.

337
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:43,878
-I see.

338

GRIMMJOW: When he finds
prey who catch his eye,

339
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,478
he stabs them in the same
spot where his own hole is.

340
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:59,145
I'm going to teach him something
about the nature of punishment

341
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:01,145
for taking someone else's prey.

-Shut your mouth, girl!

347
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:28,745
If you have time to make a fuss,
then just heal him already!

348
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:31,278
-What the-- Grimmjow!

349
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:33,278
Why are you with Orihime?

350
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,978
-Shut up, Ichigo.

351
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:36,178
She's healing you, all right?

352
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,912
And when you're
completely healed,

353
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:40,345
you and I are going
one-on-one, Soul Reaper.

354
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:41,978
-It can't be true.

355
00:21:42,012 --> 00:21:44,212
Is that the only reason
you want him to heal?

356
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:45,578
-Quit all your complaining.

357
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:49,012
If it wasn't for me letting you
save his life, he'd be dead.

358
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:51,412
Now get to work!

359
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:52,345
Hurry!

360
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,645
Ulquiorra will
catch on to what's

361
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:55,912
happening sooner or
later and come back.

362
00:21:55,945 --> 00:21:59,745
And before he does-- uh!

didn't know you healed yourself

I've prepared Fraccion in
a variety of ways, Western

Japanese, and Chinese
styles, all my favorites.

curry flavored one!

give it a rest.
