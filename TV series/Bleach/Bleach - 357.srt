1
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,429
Hyaahh!

2
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:00,637
Ginjo!

3
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:02,238
Huh?!

4
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:05,341
Raaaghh!

5
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:08,278
Yaaagh!

6
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,698
You have done it. It's complete.

7
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:30,612
"Complete"?

8
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,049
Yes. The moment Fullbring is
completed, someone has to take a risk

9
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,820
in order to contain the massive explosion
of energy that's produced by it.

10
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:41,956
Ginjo...

11
00:02:43,258 --> 00:02:47,362
Hey, sorry. I know I was a
bit cheesy as a bad guy.

12
00:02:48,663 --> 00:02:52,066
Welcome to X-cution.
Now you're one of us.

13
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:59,107
[alarm bell]

14
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,142
[Orihime]
Nnggh... Nmm...

15
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:20,361
[humming]

16
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:21,629
Hm!?

17
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,265
[Ichigo] [straining]
Whu... ONE...

18
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,800
One Hundred!

19
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:27,802
Agh!

20
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:29,871
I'm done! That's my limit!

21
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:32,006
I can't even do one more!

22
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:35,276
You gotta be kidding!

23
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:37,612
What, you're worn out already?

24
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:39,647
What d'ya mean "already"?!

25
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:42,950
Just how many sets of a hundred pushups
are you really expecting me to do?!

26
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:45,153
That was only your
fourteenth set.

27
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:48,022
Only fourteen hundred?
Are you crazy?!

28
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:50,224
Are you trying to turn me
into a body builder?!

29
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:53,194
Nobody ever becomes great
without stepping up a little.

30
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:56,998
"Pushing out one more set can keep
a guy from becoming a pushover".

31
00:03:57,265 --> 00:04:01,102
Really?! Where the hell did you get that?
Off the back of a cereal box?

32
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:06,007
What if I did? I'm tryin' to turn a
medium like you into an XL like me.

33
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:08,109
Buh?? Since when do you
care about my size?!

34
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:10,211
The fact that you're
sounding like some obessed

35
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:12,013
stalker is kinda
givin' me the creeps!

36
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:16,684
It's great to see
Ichigo working so hard.

37
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:17,618
[knock]

38
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,620
Coming in!
[gasp]

39
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:22,824
Shouldn't you wait for someone
to answer before barging in?

40
00:04:22,857 --> 00:04:23,691
Oh shut up.

41
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,229
Here, I brought you a
hot dog for breakfast.

42
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,633
Ah! Wait! It might be fun for us
to eat together, don't you think?

43
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:36,304
I already ate some donuts and eating
with you wouldn't be fun, so no.

44
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:38,272
Oh... okay bye!

45
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:41,309
[sigh] Oh well.

46
00:04:43,277 --> 00:04:45,680
It seems all Riruka
ever eats is donuts.

47
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:53,154
There. You're done loading.

48
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:56,724
Well we'd better get going.
Thanks Yukio!

49
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:59,293
Hey, it's no big deal.
I do this all the time.

50
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,599
[Orihime]
C'mon Chad, we'll be late.

51
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:07,635
How's Ichigo?

52
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:09,837
He's not going
to school today.

53
00:05:09,871 --> 00:05:14,208
Mr. Ginjo said he completed his Fullbring
but he still has a few kinks to work out.

54
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:16,878
Then I suppose he'll be
all done by tonight.

55
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:25,586
So Chad. You've decided to
come back to school, huh?

56
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,188
What changed your mind?

57
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:34,929
I guess you just really missed
all those math tests huh?

58
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:36,264
Heh...

59
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:40,735
If Tsukishima's goal is keeping
Ichigo's powers from returning,

60
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:45,039
Then what was his purpose in attacking
you and going after Ichigo's family?

61
00:05:46,274 --> 00:05:49,010
Seems like that might have
been counterproductive.

62
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:52,647
Maybe he was trying to
corner Ichigo on purpose,

63
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,882
so it would force him
to master Fullbring.

64
00:05:55,082 --> 00:05:56,083
Hm?!

65
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:58,352
Why would he do that?

66
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:02,223
Hard to say, but there has to be
some reason he acted the way he did.

67
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:06,894
I think the key to answering
that question lies in one thing.

68
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:09,831
This is about
Tsukishima's powers.

69
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:14,001
Have you noticed anything different
since the day you were attacked?

70
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:18,005
Yeah. Remember what I
tried to explain to you?

71
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:22,176
How I said it suddenly felt like
Tsukishima was part of my old memories?

72
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,314
Somehow he was able to make me believe
that he and I are very close.

73
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:29,884
There are times I even find
myself thinking of him fondly!

74
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:31,886
I see.

75
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,957
That tells me that we can't just
leave things the way they are.

76
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:40,962
I suggest we carefully go
over everything that's happened to us so far.

77
00:06:42,697 --> 00:06:43,798
I agree.

78
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:47,735
Hey, hi there!

79
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:49,704
Huh. You're not here.

80
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,808
You go and put me through all this trouble
and then disappear without a single word.

81
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:57,678
I'll bet you're just an airhead that
all the boys fuss over for no reason.

82
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:05,186
Hmm?

83
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:08,122
[Orihime] Dear Riruka, Breakfast
was delicious. Thank you so much!

84
00:07:08,155 --> 00:07:10,324
PS-Let's have donuts
together again.

85
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:13,761
Ugh, stupid airhead.

86
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:21,702
So, how's Ichigo doing?

87
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:26,040
Good. He's doing well. He'll be a
complete Fullbringer by tonight.

88
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:27,842
Oh yeah?

89
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:31,779
Oh I gotcha.
You really don't care.

90
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:36,817
No, that's not it. Don't you think Mr.
Tsukishima will sense he's ready too?

91
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:41,589
Sure. I suppose he'll start
making some kinda move soon.

92
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:43,891
[Yukio] What do you mean START
making some kinda move??

93
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,594
Yukio.
Let me out.

94
00:07:47,695 --> 00:07:48,863
[sigh]

95
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:54,101
Isn't Ichigo who Tsukishima's
really after here?

96
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:58,739
His last attack made it obvious.
Even I knewwhat was going on then.

97
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,677
And before that, lots of strange things kept
happening around Ichigo,

98
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,012
and they all seemed to
be Tsukishima's doing.

99
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:09,951
So saying he's starting to move is wrong.
He's already made some moves.

100
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:14,155
What's wrong??

101
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:18,726
I gotta question. Why do women
always have to nitpick everything?

102
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,627
Chauvinist!

103
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,329
Oww! Gahh!
Why'd ya do that?!

104
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:23,998
It's safe to say you just
got what you deserved.

105
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:24,865
Hmf!

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,835
Hmf! All right.

107
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,772
So far Tsukishma's only been
playing with Ichigo and

108
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,674
putting up this front that
he's not that dangerous.

109
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:38,813
But now, Ichigo's Fullbring
is about to become complete.

110
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:43,050
This time his approach
will be much more serious.

111
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:46,020
You think so?!
Hey wait...

112
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:50,124
So how 'bout finally explaining what you
think he wants with Ichigo's powers?

113
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:51,692
Who knows?

114
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:53,260
What DO you
know then!?

115
00:08:53,928 --> 00:08:56,897
Listen, this won't be a
walk in the park for him.

116
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:59,133
Ichigo's Fullbring
will be tough to beat.

117
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:04,238
And Tsukishima's too smart to go after
Ichigo directly. Not now at least.

118
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:07,608
Instead, he might try
to isolate Ichigo, by

119
00:09:07,642 --> 00:09:10,144
eliminating anyone who
would try to protect him.

120
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:13,881
If what you're saying is true, then
all of us are in danger as well.

121
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:15,049
That's right.

122
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:16,884
We are.

123
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,321
Though I would expect that
the people closest to

124
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:22,056
Ichigo are at the highest
risk of elimination.

125
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:22,990
Orihime!

126
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:24,625
Morning Tatsuki!

127
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:26,360
Good to see you
back, Chad.

128
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:27,628
Mmm.

129
00:09:27,862 --> 00:09:29,864
Hey stranger!
Where ya been?!

130
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:31,232
You haven't been to
school in almost a--

131
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:32,199
Whoaa!

132
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,200
Are you okay?

133
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,069
[laughing]
I'm solid as a rock.

134
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:38,139
'Course I've been keeping my eyes
open for an Ichigo sighting.

135
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:40,307
Ichigo said he wouldn't
be here today.

136
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:43,611
What?! So how is it that
you know Ichigo's business?

137
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:47,882
He told both of us. He's doing his
best to get himself together.

138
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:51,118
He told you that?! What's he gotten
himself involved in this time?

139
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:51,719
Move it.

140
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:52,594
Don't touch me!

141
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:54,088
Try minding your own
business, ya big Snoop.

142
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:56,257
[bell]
C'mon or we'll be late!

143
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:59,160
Orihime,
let's go!

144
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,964
[Riruka] Wait! So those
two might be targeted?!

145
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:06,300
Why did you let
them leave today?!

146
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,135
What could we do?!

147
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:11,605
We can't just lock them up here just
because it's convenient for us.

148
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:13,908
I expect they
can handle it.

149
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:17,645
If they want to help Ichigo, they're bound
to check out Tsukishima themselves.

150
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:18,713
Huh?

151
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:21,282
But right now, we can't
afford to help them.

152
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:25,219
It's pointless for us to even try to
figure out what Tsukishima is up to.

153
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:29,223
We must stay here
to reach our goal.

154
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,693
And protect Ichigo, no
matter what that costs us.

155
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,028
How can you say that?!

156
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:37,298
I'm sorry, but that's
all we can do now.

157
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:39,867
Yukio,I'mgonna
getsomesleep.

158
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,635
[Yukio] Sure, I'll
take care of things.

159
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:43,003
Hrmmmpf.

160
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:47,742
[Chad]
Orihime!

161
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:49,744
[giggle]

162
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:52,012
How'd it go?

163
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:55,216
I checked the whole school for
traces of Spirit Energy.

164
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,619
But I didn't sense any of it
coming from anyone else around.

165
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:03,357
I see. That means it was only from
Tatsuki and the boys then, huh?

166
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:05,826
Yeah, you're
probably right.

167
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,297
those three definitely came in contact with
someone who possessed strong spirit energy.

168
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:13,734
I can't prove it, but it
felt like it was Tsukishima.

169
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:16,704
Oh no! You think he could
have done something to them!?

170
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:20,341
It's all right. Nothing really
seems to be different about them.

171
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:26,147
They're fine. But I'm pretty sure we're
gonna find him somewhere near Ichigo.

172
00:11:26,747 --> 00:11:29,250
[gasp] So Mister
Tsukishima's close!?

173
00:11:31,752 --> 00:11:32,853
[exhale]

174
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:34,722
Uh?

175
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:35,756
Ah!

176
00:11:37,124 --> 00:11:37,892
[Chad]
What is it?

177
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:41,128
Ah! Uh-nothing.

178
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:41,996
Let's go!

179
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:43,097
Okay.

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,201
What was that?

181
00:11:48,068 --> 00:11:49,270
Strange.

182
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:01,816
[chuckle]

183
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:16,190
[whisper] What's with that girl?

184
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:18,326
Beats me. She's
looking for someone.

185
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:22,196
Ugh! I can't see anything
with these sunglasses on.

186
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,334
That girl's turning into nothing
but a giant pain in the butt.

187
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:28,403
You're acting silly.
Be nice to her.

188
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:31,806
C'mon! you won't admit it, but you
really care about "that girl."

189
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,741
[all snickering]

190
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:37,478
You're all dead wrong! I only came
over here to buy some donuts!

191
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:40,648
It just so happens I passed by the
school where Chad and that girl go,

192
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:43,718
so I thought maybe I'd check things
out for a bit, and check to see--

193
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:44,752
Wha-!!?

194
00:12:44,786 --> 00:12:47,321
Did I just overhear you say
"Chad and that girl"?

195
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:51,292
What?! And just who are you?
And why would you care?

196
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:54,729
By "that girl," did you
mean Orihime Inoue?

197
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:57,598
I might've meant that.

198
00:12:57,765 --> 00:13:01,803
Okay sure I came to see her. So do you
know where she and Chad might be?

199
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:03,371
They've already left.

200
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:06,240
Huh? So where've
they gone off to?

201
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:07,909
I don't know what you
want with them, but I'm

202
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:09,677
not telling someone
like you where they--

203
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:14,549
Just tell me. This
is really important.

204
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:19,520
Thank you
very much.

205
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:21,622
Chad!

206
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:23,157
Well?

207
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:24,392
What'd they say?

208
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:28,596
Big news. Uryu was told he couldn't
be released from the hospital yet.

209
00:13:29,163 --> 00:13:30,798
But he left at noon anyway.

210
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:32,834
I see.

211
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:36,471
I'll try
calling him.

212
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:37,839
Good.

213
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:42,877
[comical crash]
Agh!

214
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:45,213
Oww my head!

215
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,380
[Orihime]
Riruka!?

216
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:47,615
Huh?

217
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,218
What're you doing way over
on this side of town?

218
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:52,153
Uh! It's not what
it looks like!

219
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,789
I only came over here to
buy myself some donuts!

220
00:13:54,822 --> 00:13:56,357
At the hospital?!
At the hospital?!

221
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,125
They have great ones!
You'd never guess it!

222
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,862
But never mind that!
What are you two doing here?!

223
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:03,664
We just stopped by here
to visit our friend!

224
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:06,667
So you were visiting
Uryu Ishida?

225
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:07,869
Uh!

226
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:09,203
I see!

227
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:12,473
So you two are racking
your little brains

228
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:14,242
trying to figure out
what Tsukishima's up to.

229
00:14:15,243 --> 00:14:16,477
Why do you
think that?

230
00:14:17,211 --> 00:14:19,814
Don't try to fool me!
You already know.

231
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:24,151
Tsukishima's been making contact
with some of Ichigo's friends.

232
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:27,321
You think I don't know
what's going on around here?

233
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,724
We weren't trying
to hide anything!

234
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:33,628
But Ichigo's been working
so awfully hard, we thought

235
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:35,463
we'd lend him a hand and do
some investigating ourselves.

236
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:36,898
Wait! How stupid are you?!

237
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:40,368
This guy is a monster!
Didn't Ginjo tell you?!

238
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:42,870
Tsukishima...

239
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,705
is the kinda guy who had
no remorse after killing

240
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:46,407
that Substitute Soul
Reaper and his allies!

241
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,776
And you're trying to investigate
this shark by yourselves?!

242
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:50,745
You guys are in way
over your head here!

243
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:53,848
Yeah, you're right.

244
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,919
My powers really aren't that strong.
And I'm not

245
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,388
sure anything I could
possibly do would help him.

246
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:04,325
But I do know that Ichigo
has always protected me.

247
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:07,628
It may not make sense to you,
but if he's in danger,

248
00:15:07,662 --> 00:15:10,531
I will do everything in
my power to protect him.

249
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,570
Even if it's only a little bit,
I have to try.

250
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,339
[gasp] Um!

251
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:19,774
What's going on?

252
00:15:21,242 --> 00:15:22,910
Nothing.
It's all good.

253
00:15:23,744 --> 00:15:27,615
Well, regardless, the last thing you
want to do is track down Tsukishima.

254
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:29,850
There!
I've warned you.

255
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,519
Uh, Riruka!

256
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:34,322
Thanks for that.

257
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:37,658
I don't get you at all.
You creep me out!

258
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:42,697
[Uryu] [over phone] Hi this is Uryu.
I'm not available right now.

259
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,466
please leave a message at the tone,
and I'll get back to you.

260
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:47,835
He's not answering.

261
00:15:48,536 --> 00:15:51,405
Why don't we start heading back to
where Ginjo and the others are.

262
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:55,376
If we keep calling we should be able
to reach Uryu before it gets dark.

263
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:58,412
We'll come up with a new plan
after we all talk it through.

264
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:05,386
Like Riruka said earlier, going after that
guy by ourselves is way too much of a risk.

265
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:14,228
Chad?

266
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:14,682
Hunh!?

267
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,663
Is something wrong?

268
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:20,768
No, nothing.
Everything's fine.

269
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:22,269
[sigh]

270
00:16:23,738 --> 00:16:27,174
We need to come up with some other way
for us to learn more about Tsukishima.

271
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:28,542
[gasp]

272
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:30,711
[Chad]
Sushigawara?

273
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:34,815
Isn't he that little punk guy you told me
was with Tsukishima when you were attacked?

274
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:36,784
I guess he might
know something about

275
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:39,186
Tsukishima's power, but
he's also a Fullbringer.

276
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,621
So he could be dangerous.

277
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:41,689
Maybe. But...

278
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,796
He really didn't come
across as that strong.

279
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:51,866
[Orihime]
What's this?

280
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:55,636
[Chad] If he said he was from Miyashita
High School, then this is it.

281
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,605
I don't like the vibe
I'm getting here.

282
00:16:57,872 --> 00:16:59,774
Hello!
Excuse me!

283
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:01,809
[Orihime] We're here
looking for someone.

284
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,346
Huh?! And who the hell are you?

285
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,881
Huh?
Heh heh!

286
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:10,885
Hey! You don't belong here!
- The matter, you lost?

287
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:12,586
What you doing here anyway?
- Heh heh heh heh.

288
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,555
Jeez, what're
those two doing?!

289
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:17,258
I warned them looking for
him would lead to trouble.

290
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:23,297
Great! If they go and cause a big scene,
Tsukishima'll be sure to notice them.

291
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:25,199
Yes, I will.

292
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,868
What are you
doing out here?

293
00:17:31,272 --> 00:17:32,406
Riruka.

294
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,210
[terrified breaths]

295
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:38,412
Haugh!

296
00:17:41,248 --> 00:17:42,850
Get back here,
dammit!

297
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:44,685
What in the world
just happened?!

298
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:46,887
Guess they weren't in the
mood for conversation!

299
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:52,760
[panting]

300
00:17:57,798 --> 00:17:59,734
You were right,
they wouldn't listen.

301
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:02,536
Sorry, it seemed like a
good idea at the time.

302
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:04,371
Don't worry about it.

303
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:06,607
It's too bad, we
didn't learn a thing.

304
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:07,742
Mh!

305
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:09,610
What's wrong?!

306
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:16,450
So as for Mr. Tsukishima, just when
exactly did we become friends with him?

307
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:18,686
What're you talking about?

308
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:23,224
Didn't we go with him to the
Soul Society to rescue Rukia?

309
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:24,273
Uh?

310
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:26,827
Hold on, that
isn't right.

311
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:27,795
Orihime!

312
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:31,332
I know. Something's
changed in me.

313
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,234
[Tsukishima]
Shall I tell you what?

314
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:33,868
[gasp]
[gasp]

315
00:18:41,175 --> 00:18:42,243
Hello there.

316
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:45,746
Riruka was telling me that
you've been looking for me.

317
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:48,816
What do you want?

318
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:52,286
Tsukishima! You hurt
her, didn't you?!

319
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:53,754
I did.

320
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:02,797
But there's nothing
to worry about.

321
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:04,832
It was all in the plan.

322
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,901
Raaggh!

323
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:19,880
How impressive!

324
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,350
In such a very short time, you
increased your power ten fold.

325
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:25,452
I did it to defeat you!

326
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,621
Haaaa!

327
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:34,128
Oh,soYukio
helpedyou.

328
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:36,897
I thought all he did was
play video games by himself,

329
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:39,733
but it seems now he's learned
how to play with others.

330
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:45,873
Shitenkoshun!

331
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:49,777
Ngh!

332
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,181
Chad!
You alright?!

333
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:55,516
Yeah. I'm doing fine!

334
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,718
I think we can beat him
with just the two of us!

335
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,367
Not bad. You might be
quite useful to me.

336
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:15,436
Like hell I will!

337
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:23,177
[gasp]

338
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:30,417
No you don't! Brazo
Izquierdo Del Diablo!

339
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:47,735
Now, Orihime, do it!

340
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,704
Tsubaki!

341
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:52,673
[chuckle]

342
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:53,540
[gasp]

343
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,749
There! Mr. Bunny is done!

344
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:06,453
[Tsukishima]
Orihime.

345
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:07,521
Oh? Hah!

346
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:10,124
Were you waiting
for me again?

347
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:12,326
[laughing]

348
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:14,561
How did?

349
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,532
What is it?!
What's wrong?!

350
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,870
I don't know why this
is happening to me...

351
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,737
Orihime!

352
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:27,608
Well, I suppose it's about
time for you to wake up.

353
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:30,277
So now, who am I?

354
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:31,645
[gasp]

355
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,547
Auugghhhh!

356
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:35,416
[Chad]
Damn you!

357
00:21:37,484 --> 00:21:40,187
You bastard! Just what
did you do to her?!

358
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:42,523
What did I do?

359
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,859
The same thing I did to you.

360
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:47,328
[gasp]

361
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:56,170
[freaking out grunts]

362
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:58,172
Aarrgghhh!

363
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:07,915
Tsukishima
[chuckling]

364
00:23:46,788 --> 00:23:49,791
[Kugo] Okay, Ichigo! Show everyone
your completed Fullbring power!

365
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:51,826
[Ichigo]
Huh? Wait, why should I?

366
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,429
[Kugo] You've become stronger.
Admit it, aren't you curious too?

367
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:57,131
[Ichigo] Not really. I don't feel
like showing it off right now.

368
00:23:57,365 --> 00:24:01,035
[Kugo] [whining] But I want to see it
right now! Show it to me! Pretty please!
