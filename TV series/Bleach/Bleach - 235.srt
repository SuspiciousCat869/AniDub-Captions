1
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:14,800
The Zanpakuto, Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:20,133
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:23,133
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:27,800
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul Reaper.

5
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,633
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:27,907
Impressive.

7
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:35,674
Enlisting him will
be no easy task.

8
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:43,874
You're not too bad.

9
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,874
I am not here to play
with you.

10
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:53,674
Now prove to me that you
are Ichigo Kurosaki's true
power. Don't waste anymore
of my time.

11
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,807
Let's have some fun.

12
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:06,807
Damn it. What now? Why
the hell do these two have
to do this in my inner world?!

13
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:17,041
Our Zanpakuto can be lost
forever?

14
00:03:17,074 --> 00:03:19,974
Yes, they can.

15
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:25,707
Under normal
circumstances, a broken
Zanpakuto would regenerate
once its master fully heals.

16
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:32,207
However, our Zanpakuto
have left our bodies and
now exist as an entity
that is completely

17
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:33,441
independent from us.

18
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:37,941
Meaning, the rules may
have changed from what
they once were.

19
00:03:37,974 --> 00:03:42,207
Let me get this straight,
Jushiro. You're thinking that
killing those manifestations

20
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:44,874
could lead to us losing
our Zanpakuto?

21
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:47,074
Hmmm...

22
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:53,707
While that thought sounds
pretty logical, we have no
actual proof. I would sure hate
to jump to the wrong conclusion.

23
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:57,941
Well, that's true...
However...

24
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:06,807
The thing that worries me the
most, is if we were to confront
our Zanpakuto with such a
question in mind,

25
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:09,741
would we even stand
a chance against them?

26
00:04:22,374 --> 00:04:23,874
Ready, Renji?

27
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:46,941
Hm, not good. I gotta say,
monkey, I thought he'd be much
better than that. Pretty weak.

28
00:04:47,874 --> 00:04:52,874
There's no need for that
attitude. We can't have him
throwing in the towel just yet.

29
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:02,707
Hey! Look! He got up!
He's standing up!

30
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:06,174
Knock it off! Don't
overreact, you little
brat.

31
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:10,907
Oww! You don't have to
hit me you fat-assed
freak!

32
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:16,207
Why, you-- shut the
heck up, you pervo!

33
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:19,807
Shut it! I said shut
it or I'll shut it for
you!

34
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,874
That's enough, you two!

35
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:28,941
Don't argue with each other
like that! I'm the one you're
fighting here.

36
00:05:33,174 --> 00:05:36,874
You really don't
understand anything, do
you?

37
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:37,941
What's that?

38
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:46,141
Here's the deal. We feel
like we're just wasting our
time battling against a
weakling like you.

39
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:51,674
Boom! There ya you go!
The big-assed broad said
it!

40
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:53,841
<i>I told you two to stop it</i>
<i>already!</i>

41
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:58,374
What's with you? You
keep calling me names and
treating me like I'm
second rate. What's

42
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,974
behind the two of you
acting like that?!

43
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:04,741
There's a lot
behind it.

44
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:07,241
It's our true instinct.

45
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:10,674
What the hell's that
mean? Now you're not
making any sense.

46
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:12,441
<i>We don't want to</i>
<i>be weak.</i>

47
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:14,141
Hm!?

48
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:19,107
As he said, we refuse to
be weak. We want to be
stronger.

49
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:25,841
And we've grown tired
of your weakness. We now
wish to leave you. And
that is all.

50
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:29,874
That's it! Just
keep talkin'!

51
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:37,407
Roar! Zabimaru!

52
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:41,007
Uh!??

53
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,974
So just how do you intend
to fight us? Well, Renji?

54
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:58,807
So the only defense left
for you is running away?!

55
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:07,641
Damn! He's anticipating
almost every move I make!

56
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:13,807
Do you think it's wise
to rest in a spot that's
so open for attack?

57
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:25,074
So you run away and hide
then attack me from the
shadows? You fight just as
dirty as you look!

58
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:31,407
Fight dirty?
What's wrong with that?
Does it matter in a life
or death situation?

59
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:36,007
I prefer to look my
opponent in the eye.

60
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,174
You think I care how you
fight!?

61
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:45,074
I am a Zanpakuto whose
sole aim is to harvest as
many lives as I can.
I have no interest in

62
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:47,741
how my master fights.

63
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:51,907
I was under the impression
that you and I had an
understanding.

64
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:57,041
Through communication,
we formed a relationship
where we were a synergistic
unit.

65
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:14,041
I can't say I know
about other Zanpakuto!
But I know who I am. I
exist to reap lives! That

66
00:08:14,074 --> 00:08:18,241
was the only thing I was
responsible for in this
relationship.

67
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:22,907
Is that so? Then you
have left me no choice.

68
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:27,141
If killing you means losing
my Zanpakuto, then so be it.

69
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:31,874
I just realized
something. I don't
like you!

70
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:35,207
That's fine with me...

71
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:37,774
I feel the same...

72
00:08:49,274 --> 00:08:50,407
His speed.

73
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:56,207
His power.

74
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:04,874
This feels so good. It's
been quite a while since I've
used my power without holding
back.

75
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:08,107
He acts on pure instinct.
There are no mistakes.

76
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:19,141
He is overpowering
him!

77
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,741
Come on out,
Zanpakuto!

78
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:26,107
I know there's more to
you than that!

79
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:34,841
Impressive. I didn't
anticipate that you would
be so capable.

80
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:38,641
It's true. You are
a hollow.

81
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:47,374
Thanks to Zangetsu being
released from Ichigo
Kurosaki, you were left
to run free inside of him.

82
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:51,441
If you're his Inner
Hollow, that helps
explain the strange
transformation that

83
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:53,941
Ichigo went through at
that time.

84
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:55,041
Am I right?

85
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:59,307
And so what if you
are?

86
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:01,274
I have one more thing to
say...

87
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:06,974
Now that I know the
secret behind your tricks,
it's clear there's no need
for me to waste anymore time.

88
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:17,807
Zanpakuto and Soul Reapers
come together through
communication and synergy.

89
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:24,141
But now I see there are
exceptions to this. Like
you. Some forces must remain
suppressed.

90
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,374
You are a very interesting
subject.

91
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:33,107
Hey! I let you speak
your mind and you go
putting me down like
that?!

92
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:36,274
Did you just say that he's
been keeping me suppressed?

93
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:38,907
<i>Am I wrong?</i>

94
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:41,741
Oh yeah, dead wrong!

95
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,874
Then explain it to me.

96
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:46,141
Now, why should I do
that for you?

97
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:49,774
Besides, what's got you
so interested in Ichigo?

98
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:54,141
You're sure curious about
us both! So what's your
game here?

99
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,741
You'll know in time.

100
00:10:57,774 --> 00:10:59,107
Oh yeah?

101
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:02,907
Well I don't know or care
what you're planning, but
listen up...

102
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:05,841
You won't get your way!
Not with me here.

103
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,907
I'll devour Ichigo and then
take control of this body!

104
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:12,107
You see, that is
my true instinct.

105
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,107
I see.

106
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:21,307
So you're saying you
intend to stand in my
way. I have no choice,
then.

107
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:24,341
I'll wipe you out from
this existence.

108
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,207
Nice try!

109
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,674
Roar!

110
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:50,941
Roar!

111
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,974
Hey, you coward!

112
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:12,741
Hm? Wow. Weakling, coward.
What the hell have I done to
earn all of these fancy
nicknames you're giving me?

113
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:17,941
I call you a coward because
you are one. It's the only
way to describe you.

114
00:12:17,974 --> 00:12:20,241
I've had enough.
I quit.

115
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:21,341
Hey!

116
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,041
You still need to remain
focused.

117
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:26,274
And why should I?!...

118
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:30,274
Even with all we've done
to get him to fight us,
he won't get serious!...

119
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:32,807
This whole thing is no
fun at all!

120
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:44,374
Have you forgotten that
we know everything about
you?

121
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:48,241
Like that the time you
gave up something that
was very dear to you.

122
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:52,807
We saw how desperately
you tried to get it back.
You fought for it, then.

123
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,774
Yet in spite of what you
did, you still don't have
confidence in yourself.

124
00:12:57,407 --> 00:13:02,374
Perhaps killing your
precious friend and
holding her severed head
in front of your face

125
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:08,274
will finally get you to
be serious? Will that force
you to take this seriously?

126
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:10,207
Bastard!

127
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:21,741
We can see you're
angry... But we also
know just why you can't
find the guts to kill us.

128
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:24,974
And that's why I say
you're weak.

129
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:42,835
Well! I think you've
finally gone and done it.

130
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:47,835
It doesn't matter. He wasn't
even half the man we had
wanted him to be.

131
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,002
Let's go, he's
hopeless.

132
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:54,135
<i>Hold it! Where do you</i>
<i>think you're going?</i>

133
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:04,268
Looks like he still
wants to fight.

134
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:11,268
You're not leaving until
you've beaten me.

135
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:17,035
We're through with you. You
do not have the will to
fight us.

136
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:19,935
We know you better than
anyone, right?

137
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:25,235
Let's say you fight
us and you defeat us.

138
00:14:25,268 --> 00:14:29,968
You will have won, but
what if beating us means
you'd lose your own
power? But what if that

139
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:34,868
I bet that's the explanation
for why you're afraid to attack
us. Isn't that right?

140
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:39,402
Unfortunately, we don't
know what would happen
either.

141
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:44,335
We now exist completely
separate from you. So I
wouldn't be surprised if
we are

142
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:47,802
now capable of dying,
just like you Soul
Reapers.

143
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:55,935
Renji. You refuse to
make the decision to
destroy your Zanpakuto.
In other words,

144
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:59,902
You cannot bring yourself
to destroy us... Am I wrong?

145
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:05,635
Can you really blame me
for calling you a weakling?

146
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:10,002
True strength is not
just about having the
ability to fight.

147
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:22,802
What's the matter? That
all you got?

148
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:40,768
You know, with you fighting
that slow, your chances of
getting to me aren't that
good!

149
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:44,335
Yes, I'm aware. But
not concerned.

150
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:53,802
Not sure what you have
up your sleeve, but--

151
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:56,168
What's this?!

152
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,702
Can't move!

153
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,768
What's the matter? That
all you got?

154
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:13,068
D-damn you! Shut up!

155
00:16:14,868 --> 00:16:16,835
This is what happened
to me.

156
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:20,902
What is that?

157
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:26,102
Could that be...
how he--

158
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:39,702
You are nothing but a
hollow.

159
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:46,068
You do not possess the
power that I am seeking.
Therefore, you are expendable.

160
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:55,235
It hurts. What am I
gonna do?

161
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:58,835
I am too weak.

162
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:00,968
Is this the end
for me?

163
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:05,768
All this time... what
have I been doing?!

164
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:07,635
Do something!

165
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:17,768
After all this time, my
own Zanpakuto has deserted
me! What should I do?!

166
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:31,335
It hurts. It really
hurts. I think I
understand now.

167
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:37,768
The pain is not coming
from my injuries. It
is my life force as a
whole that is diminished.

168
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:44,002
He's beat. So what now?

169
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:48,602
Go ahead. Just
finish him off.

170
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:10,935
So in the end, I didn't
change at all. I kept
boasting about becoming
stronger, but all I did

171
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:14,768
was move forward without
actually thinking. Is
that it?

172
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:20,102
What about Ichigo?

173
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:26,368
Ichigo has told me, the only
reason he fights is to protect
others. That's what makes
him strong!

174
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:32,235
But what about me? What do
I have? What do I fight for?

175
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:53,102
Damn you.

176
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:57,835
That's it. I can't just let
you take what you want.

177
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:09,102
Hmm... he escaped my
spell in such a short
time. How is this possible?

178
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:13,635
Why are you protecting
me? Why would you do that
for me?!

179
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:16,035
Do you really
need to ask?

180
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:22,802
It's who I am. And
obviously you're a
part of me. It's as
simple as that.

181
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:26,702
Oh great, more
of your arrogance.

182
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:32,168
Now that Zangetsu has
disappeared, I don't
know what you plan on
doing with me .

183
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:38,668
And I don't know what
to do with myself either.
But one thing must be
done.

184
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:40,835
And done now. You
know that, right?

185
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:43,602
You're such a pain
in the ass.

186
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:49,035
What an interesting sight,
this is. You're choosing to
protect the hollow?

187
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:52,835
What the hell's so strange?
So what if he's a hollow?

188
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:56,835
All that matters at this
moment is that he's a part
of me.

189
00:19:57,135 --> 00:20:00,902
I'm good with that because
I'm the guy in charge here.

190
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:04,802
But I don't intend to let
you get away with whatever
the hell you want.

191
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:09,835
Ichigo Kurosaki. Just
what exactly are you?

192
00:20:10,068 --> 00:20:16,002
What you described is
hardly the relationship between
a Soul Reaper and a Hollow.

193
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:18,802
Listen to
me, Muramasa.

194
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:20,935
You're wrong
about one thing.

195
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:25,868
You haven't realized this, but
I'm not a Soul Reaper. I'm
a human!

196
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:37,935
You intend to push me out
of this world by using your
own will?

197
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:40,802
I must say...
you are unusual.

198
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:52,802
Huh?

199
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:00,835
Where were we?

200
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:11,935
You may have been right
about me being weak. I
had forgotten.

201
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:16,935
But my mindset's
different now. I don't
have the time to waste
arguing about stupid

202
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:18,702
things like that.

203
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,702
Stupid, you say?

204
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:24,902
I only want to become
stronger. That's all.

205
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:32,802
I will regain control.
I will find a way reunite
with Zangetsu.

206
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,902
Even if I have to
destroy him.

207
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:39,302
There is still someone
that I must surpass in
battle.

208
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:43,235
That is why I have this
goal to become even
stronger!

209
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,702
Facing the two of you is
what reminded me of that!

210
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:50,202
This is a choice that
I've made.

211
00:21:50,235 --> 00:21:52,935
And I know in order to
achieve that goal...

212
00:21:52,968 --> 00:21:55,935
I can't afford to
lose! I must win!

213
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,902
Roar! Zabimaru!

214
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:07,835
Come on!

215
00:23:49,324 --> 00:23:50,924
What are you doing?

216
00:23:50,957 --> 00:23:54,657
<i>You just said to "Roar,</i>
<i>Zabimaru."Isn't that</i>
<i>right, Snake Boy?</i>

217
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,424
<i>Yeah-you told us, so we</i>
<i>roared. Want us to roar</i>
<i>again?</i>

218
00:23:58,457 --> 00:23:59,490
No!

219
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:00,790
<i>[roaring]</i>

220
00:24:00,824 --> 00:24:01,690
Please
shut up!!!
