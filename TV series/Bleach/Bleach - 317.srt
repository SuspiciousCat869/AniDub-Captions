00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:02,509
[Shunsui]
Hey there Captain
Hitsugaya! What's up?

2
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:04,809
Hi Shunsui, Jushiro.

3
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:06,442
It's been awhile.

4
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:08,975
Something happen today?

5
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:11,842
No, just reporting in here.

6
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:16,009
I was being grilled on
the cleansing progress
in the Tenkai zone.

7
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,275
Oh, that should be
all finished by the
end of today.

8
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:19,875
What?!

9
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,075
That's what Nanao said in
the report she sent me.

10
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:28,475
That Rangiku! She knows
she should be including that
in her report as well!

11
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,609
Sorry, but can you please
pass on that update?

12
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:33,842
Umm...

13
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,109
He's pretty
worked up.

14
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:37,642
I think it's nice.

15
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,109
Seeing our own getting
angry or laughing about
little things...

16
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,109
It's a sign that
things are getting
back to normal.

17
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:47,875
That's true.

18
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:59,009
[relaxing exhale]
Ahh.

19
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,975
I'm all done over
here, Nanao.

20
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:06,509
Well now, that means we've
completed our share of the
cleansing. Very nicely done.

21
00:03:06,742 --> 00:03:08,909
Ah! I am worn out.

22
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,742
Who'd have thought we'd
be putting up barriers
over such a big area.

23
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,842
This work certainly
had to be done...

24
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,209
And after such a huge project,
I really expected this,

25
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:22,142
I mean swapping the Soul
Society with Karakura Town!?

26
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:28,409
Heh, but what I didn't expect
is that you and I would be
doing this kind of painstaking
work for an entire month.

27
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,009
A month already?

28
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:33,442
Rangiku...?

29
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,309
Ah!

30
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,342
Are you feeling
all right?

31
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,542
Of course! So Nanao, since we've
finished with all our work here,
what do you say the two of us
reward ourselves just a little?

32
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:45,575
[chuckle]

33
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:46,275
What?

34
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:51,009
Oh nothing. It's just nice
to see you acting like your
old lively self again.

35
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,309
Really? I've been--

36
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:54,642
Really depressed!
I know, I've seen you!

37
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,942
[laughs]

38
00:03:57,975 --> 00:03:59,275
[phone rings]

39
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:00,142
Oh!

40
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,109
Hi! Rangiku, here.

41
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:05,509
Rangiku, you idiot!

42
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:08,075
Do you know how many times
I tried to call you?!

43
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:11,742
<i>Explain to me why I</i>
<i>haven't been receiving</i>
<i>any reports from you!</i>

44
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:15,409
I'm sorry, sir!
I was too busy
working all this time.

45
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:19,975
We finally finished our
assignment, so Nanao and I
were about to take a break
and go out for some--

46
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,675
Get back here right now!

47
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:26,409
Aww come on, sir!
All work and no fun
affects our morale!

48
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:28,909
<i>Right now, we can't have</i>
<i>you two taking time off!</i>

49
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:30,475
<i>It's always like this!</i>
Well, let's go back.

50
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,742
<i>Why do you do this to</i>
<i>me every single time?</i>

51
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:33,842
Everyone's waiting for us.

52
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,842
[sighs]
Aww...!

53
00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:49,542
Geez! What's up with this
passageway? It's creepy!

54
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:53,575
True. But it is the designated
path for us to use.

55
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:56,075
[sigh]

56
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,242
Huh?

57
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:02,275
<i>[Rangiku]</i>
<i>Nanao...</i>

58
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:04,275
Yes? What's wrong?

59
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,942
Tell me, do you sense
anything strange here?

60
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,575
What's strange?!

61
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,475
You don't mean some...?

62
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,042
D'ah!
Huh!?

63
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:14,975
Ah!

64
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:19,342
What's going on here?!

65
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:33,275
Well, we're back!

66
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,709
My Rukia how
I've missed--!

67
00:05:35,742 --> 00:05:37,175
Umph!

68
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,875
Kon, I told you not to
leave the room, didn't I?

69
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:45,475
Bug off! You are not stopping
me from giving Rukia her
daily hug, ya rat!

70
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:46,675
Hug?!

71
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:50,742
Damn right! The feeling
of her kick shifting
my cotton stuffing...

72
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:54,009
It's such a magical
moment of ecstasy!

73
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:55,209
You could never
understa--

74
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:56,075
Ack!

75
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,509
You're right, I don't!

76
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,842
[klaxon]
Hollow! Hollow! Hollow!

77
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,709
Man! They keep popping up
every minute don't they?

78
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,175
That's how it is.

79
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:07,275
<i>[Kon]</i>
<i>Hey wait! I'm</i>
<i>not done yet!</i>

80
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:08,375
Mmhglf!!

81
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,809
Agh!
Whoa!
Oof!

82
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:20,675
We'll be gone for awhile.
Try to behave yourself, Kon.
Okay?

83
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:22,075
You too Chappy.

84
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:23,475
Aye-aye, Sir!

85
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:27,342
Wait a minute Ichigo!
So what am I to you anyway?

86
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:29,575
Huh? Why bring that up now?

87
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,609
You're always using me
when it's convenient!

88
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,475
I'm not just your
substitute, you know!

89
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:37,575
What're you getting at?!

90
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:39,242
<i>Ichigo, we have to go!</i>

91
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:42,709
Right! Anyway, keep an eye
on things while we're gone!

92
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:46,242
Hey! Sheesh!

93
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,775
Y'ever feel like
tellin' them ta--?

94
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:50,942
La-la laaa!
La! la la la!

95
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,375
[exasperated sigh]
ughhh!

96
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,875
Whatta buncha--
Hnh?!

97
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:08,842
Ichigo! A Senkaimon
just opened nearby.

98
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:11,775
Really? Does it have
something to do with Hollows?

99
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:13,109
Not sure.

100
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:16,642
Well, we'll handle
that later!

101
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:18,909
<i>[Orihime]</i>
<i>Ichigo! Rukia!</i>

102
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,642
Need any help?

103
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:21,609
We've got it!

104
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:28,375
Isn't that something?
Ichigo sure has been
doing a lot better lately.

105
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:32,142
Yeah. I think it's 'cuz Rukia
stayed here to assist him.

106
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:35,975
So Ichigo hasn't had to use
much of his Spirit Energy.
That's good.

107
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:37,542
Hm.

108
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:43,609
<i>[Akon]</i>
<i>You are concerned about</i>
<i>Lieutenants Matsumoto</i>
<i>and Ise...?</i>

109
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:49,142
Yes. I haven't been able
to reach either of them
since yesterday when they
said they were returning.

110
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,342
I'd like to check to see
if there's any record of
them passing through the
Precipice World.

111
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:57,275
Understood, no problem.
Give me a minute,
all right?

112
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:02,409
Hey, Inaba! Bring me the
Precipice World traffic log.

113
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,142
Yes sir.

114
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:08,309
I agree that it is rather odd
that you haven't heard from
either of them in so long.

115
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:09,375
Here you are, sir.

116
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:11,175
Well then?

117
00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:15,142
Ahem! We're looking for
Lieutenants Matsumoto
and Ise, that correct?

118
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:19,942
Well, at this time, we have no
record that they returned from
the World of the Living.

119
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:22,542
Perhaps they haven't
passed through the
Precipice World yet.

120
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:24,009
But they had to!

121
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:28,309
This is all starting to get
pretty strange, if you ask me.

122
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,642
[Kon as Ichigo]
It was right around here,
that I sensed something odd.

123
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:40,009
But there's nothing here.

124
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:48,342
Well, instead of wasting
my free time doing this,
I think I'll go find me
some beautiful babe.

125
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:50,875
Whaauauauaua!

126
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:51,942
Ooff!

127
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:55,642
Oww-ee-ah! What the
heck tripped me?

128
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:59,642
Whaat?!! Huh?

129
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:01,342
Nng!

130
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:08,542
Whoa! What's a girl doing
lying here all n-n-naked?

131
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,842
Wait, never mind that.
Is she alive?

132
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,842
[gulp]

133
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:15,942
Hey you!

134
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:16,809
Hnh?

135
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:18,209
Just what do you
think you're doing?!

136
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:20,009
It's not how it looks,
I was just--!

137
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:21,975
[nervous laughter]

138
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:26,142
Hey! Help!
This guy's
a pervert!

139
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:28,042
Yaaahhh!
Wait you're making
a mistake!

140
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:31,342
<i>Come on, lady!</i>
<i>I--Uggh...</i>

141
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,709
The situation is
becoming clear to me.

142
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,442
What do you think,
Captain Kurotsuchi?

143
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:41,209
Well, if their entrance wasn't
recorded in the traffic log,

144
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:43,909
then they both must still be
in the World of the Living.

145
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,409
But that doesn't make
any sense to me, sir.

146
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:49,209
If they stayed there,
we would've heard
from them by now.

147
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:53,142
Could they of had some
sort of accident in
the Precipice World?

148
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:58,075
Our Research and Development
Department monitors the
Precipice World 24 hours a day.

149
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:00,742
Are you really suggesting
that we missed them?

150
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:01,975
Yes.

151
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:03,575
Ha! What?!

152
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:06,575
So you're going to blame
your subordinates' lack
of training on me!?

153
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:08,075
Hey, Hold on.

154
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,775
We've gotta work together.
We'd like to confirm that
the both of them are safe.

155
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:17,042
Excuse me Head Captain,
but I have timely news
to share.

156
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,742
Lieutenants Matsumoto and
Ise have just arrived and
wish to report in.

157
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:22,242
They're here?!

158
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:29,142
Rangiku! What the hell
were you doing for the
last twenty four hours?!

159
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,442
Huh? What's the problem?

160
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:33,842
[Mayuri]
This is turning
into a farce.

161
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:37,842
Nanao, where'd
you go off to on
your way back?

162
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:43,442
Nowhere. We did as ordered
and came straight back here
after completing our mission.

163
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:47,742
Exactly! You were
screaming in my ear just
a few hours ago, Captain!

164
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:48,709
Whaa?
Wha?
Huuh?

165
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:50,142
A few hours?!?

166
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:53,075
Yes, almost exactly
three hours.

167
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:57,775
Well that means,
the time axis is
out of sync.

168
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,742
So it does seem,
something has gone wrong
in the Precipice World.

169
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:05,375
[grumble]
Hng! Ghhh...

170
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:08,875
Then I am calling a Captains'
Meeting immediately.

171
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:13,342
Captain Kurosuchi, report.

172
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:18,609
Well, after a detailed
study of the data from
within the Precipice World,

173
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:24,575
I have discovered that a
"stretching of time" gap has
formed between the World of the
Living and the Soul Society.

174
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,109
And this gap is continuing
to grow even larger.

175
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:34,075
So at this rate, within the
next day or so, we will no
longer be able to intervene
in the World of the Living.

176
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:38,909
Captain Kurotsuchi,
is there any way to
stop that gap from expanding?

177
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:44,342
Of course there is!
An adjustment can be
made immediately.

178
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,909
But I'm more worried
about the cause.

179
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:51,242
I would like to do a
detailed survey of the
Precipice World first.

180
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,542
<i>[Yamamoto]</i>
<i>Very well.</i>

181
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:57,442
Regarding to this latest
incident, I appoint Squad
Twelve Captain Mayuri Kurosuchi

182
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:00,475
to be in charge of organizing
and conducting the survey.

183
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:03,809
<i>[Yamamoto]</i>
<i>I also order Squad</i>
<i>Eleven Captain Zaraki</i>

184
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:07,275
<i>to provide security</i>
<i>within the Precipice</i>
<i>World for those involved.</i>

185
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,142
What?

186
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:13,075
Tch! But why should I
get saddled with such a
bothersome assignment?

187
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:15,075
I should be the
one complaining!

188
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,242
Can a barbarian like you
even provide security?

189
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:21,175
You might just trigger
a catastrophe instead.

190
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,475
Good idea.
would you like me
to start with you?!

191
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:25,375
Tch.

192
00:12:26,242 --> 00:12:28,275
Enough! That is an order!

193
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:29,575
Hmf!

194
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:31,542
Hrrm.

195
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:34,675
<i>[Yamamoto]</i>
<i>I also order Squad Six</i>
<i>Captain Byakuya Kuchiki</i>
<i>and Lieutenant Abarai,</i>

196
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,409
<i>as well as Squad Ten</i>
<i>Captain Hitsugaya</i>

197
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:40,342
to assist Captain Kurotsuchi
in his field survey.

198
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:44,042
And you will all work together
cooperatively. Dismissed!

199
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:49,675
Ehhh...
Ooh!
Hee.

200
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:50,575
So...

201
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:52,475
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Who is this girl?</i>

202
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:53,775
[Kon]
Uh, I don't know.

203
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:56,175
But she's a big problem.

204
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,009
If she's a problem,
then why the hell did
you bring her here?!

205
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:03,042
How should I put this?
I guess it just
happened this way?

206
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,709
Things never
"just happen"!

207
00:13:05,142 --> 00:13:06,275
Wait! No don't!

208
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:12,142
Kon, what have
you done here?!

209
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:15,575
Nothing, Zip!
I haven't done
anything at all here!

210
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:18,609
I found her unconscious,
she was just like that!

211
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:19,509
Ichigo...

212
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:20,775
Hm? What is it?

213
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:23,642
I don't sense anything
from this girl.

214
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:24,809
Huh?

215
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:30,342
Even if someone
lacks Spirit Energy,
I would still sense
something if she was human.

216
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:35,109
But this girl's
really different.
I don't even sense
her existence.

217
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:39,809
Kon! Where exactly
did you find this
girl anyway?

218
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:43,009
Lying there in that
parking lot down on Third.

219
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:44,175
I knew it.

220
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:45,142
Hnh?

221
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:47,275
That's where the
Senkaimon opened earlier.

222
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,242
Then is she
a... Gigai?

223
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:51,042
I dunno.

224
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:55,675
Anyway, I'm sending a report
about this to the Soul Society.

225
00:13:58,675 --> 00:13:59,709
<i>[Hiyosu]</i>
<i>Hmm?!</i>

226
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:05,042
Hey Akon. We just got an
inquiry from Rukia Kuchiki
of Squad Thirteen here.

227
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,275
Ignore it!
Not right now.

228
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:10,042
Aww come on.
Come take a look at it.

229
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:11,309
Huh?

230
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,275
Alright,
so what is this?

231
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:15,375
Excuse me, sir.

232
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:17,942
Ah, Inaba!

233
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:21,075
A group of officers needs
to enter the Precipice
World to do a survey.

234
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:23,075
Would you
mind showing
them the way?

235
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:25,275
Of course, understood sir.

236
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:28,709
[Hiyosu]
Hey, we've established
communication with
Captain Kurotsuchi.

237
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,775
What took you so long?!

238
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:34,375
[Akon]
Sorry about that, we had
trouble making adjustments.

239
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:36,209
How do things look?

240
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,309
Figured out
what's going on?

241
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:43,675
Hnh! As I suspected,
the cause of the
problem was man-made.

242
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:47,375
Ha ha! Oh, Kenny!
Being here's a lot of fun!

243
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:48,209
Hunh?

244
00:14:49,342 --> 00:14:50,975
More importantly,
are all the
others ready yet?

245
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:53,709
Ooo! It's so gooey!
<i>Yes, sir. They're</i>
<i>about to enter now.</i>

246
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:55,175
Gzhhh!

247
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:56,909
STOP IT!

248
00:14:56,942 --> 00:15:00,142
Even with things as they are,
the Restrictive Current still
reacts to Spirit Bodies!

249
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:03,542
I couldn't care less if you
fools turn into space-time dust!

250
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:05,842
But I won't allow you to
interfere with my survey.

251
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:09,042
Hnh! "Won't allow us", eh?
Try me!

252
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,442
Oh my. It appears
you're too stupid
to understand me.

253
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:14,375
[spirit explosion]

254
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:16,709
Sir! There's something coming!

255
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,076
You've returned!

256
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,143
What's wrong?

257
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,610
We suddenly lost all
communications with the
Precipice World sir,

258
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:47,843
and since then, a state of
emergency has been declared!

259
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:49,876
[Toshiro]
What about Captains
Kurotsuchi and Zaraki?

260
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,710
<i>We... haven't</i>
<i>heard from them...</i>

261
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:52,776
<i>Where're you going, sir?</i>

262
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,310
To Squad 1.

263
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,510
We found something important
in the Precipice World that
we need to report.

264
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:03,143
[Jushiro]
So, you're saying when
you arrived there,

265
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:05,876
you didn't meet up with
Captain Kurotsuchi and
the others?

266
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,576
That's right.

267
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:09,110
[Yamamoto]
What are you here
to report, then?

268
00:16:12,676 --> 00:16:17,210
We found this near the area
where we were supposed to
rendezvous with Captain
Kurotsuchi's group.

269
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,210
I'm not sure, but perhaps it's
connected to this incident.

270
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:21,076
This is...!

271
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,376
I believe this warrants
further investigation.

272
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,043
Hmm.

273
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:30,910
<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>Take Ichigo with you?</i>

274
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:35,176
Yes. I received orders
from the Department of
Research and Development,

275
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,676
to appear before them
with the Substitute
Soul Reaper.

276
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:43,143
I've never received an
order like that before,
so I tried contacting them
again to try to confirm it.

277
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,643
And your communication
failed. That does seem
strange, doesn't it?

278
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,343
By the way, has the girl
Kon found unconscious
woken up yet?

279
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:59,043
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>She's still asleep. I was</i>
<i>hoping to ask her some</i>
<i>questions, But I don't know.</i>

280
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:05,976
So hey, I think I'm
gonna head to the Soul
Society with this.

281
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,743
Right now, I wouldn't
recommend doing that.

282
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,776
Hnh?

283
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:14,643
The reason I say that,
is 'cause Yoruichi went
there a few days ago.

284
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:19,710
She was supposed to return
here right away, but we
haven't heard from her since.

285
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:24,710
In your current state,
I'd say it's not too wise
to go there right now.

286
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:27,310
[chuckle] You worry too much.

287
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,143
I have to go.

288
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:31,110
Mmm.

289
00:17:31,743 --> 00:17:34,110
Hm! Well then, fine.

290
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,276
Just one last thing.

291
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:50,943
At this moment in time,
your Spirit Energy is
pretty stable.

292
00:17:50,976 --> 00:17:53,210
But soon it's going
to start to decrease.

293
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,776
Right.

294
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,843
<i>And, the more you overexert</i>
<i>yourself, the sooner the day</i>
<i>will come when you lose your</i>
<i>Spirit Energy completely.</i>

295
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:05,276
Don't forget to keep
that fact firmly in mind.

296
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,410
Yeah. I got it.

297
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,876
Both of you please,
be careful out there.

298
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,576
What is it?

299
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,810
Something's not right.

300
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:30,743
How so?

301
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,776
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>Haven't you noticed?</i>

302
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,576
<i>There's not a trace</i>
<i>of Spiritual Pressure</i>
<i>around here.</i>

303
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,076
Not a trace?

304
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,343
[Rukia]
Think about how many Soul
Reapers come and go through here
every day. And yet...

305
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,343
Let's see now.

306
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:48,243
That's 'cause that Cleaner
thingie comes through and
cleans up all of it !

307
00:18:48,276 --> 00:18:49,610
That can't be why.

308
00:18:50,243 --> 00:18:53,610
<i>Remember? Aizen destroyed the</i>
<i>Cleaner over a month ago.</i>

309
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:59,143
Ohh. That's right.

310
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:01,476
Hnh?

311
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,910
Anyway, let's get out
of here quickly, okay?

312
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:04,976
Right.

313
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,810
Huh?

314
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,576
Hey, Rukia!

315
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,543
What now?

316
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,043
<i>It's coming...</i>

317
00:19:16,776 --> 00:19:18,876
Just what are you
talking about?! Ah!

318
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,943
[panicked]
Yaah! The Cleaner!

319
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:26,576
I thought you said
it was gone?!

320
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:29,410
I never thought it would
regenerate so fast!

321
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,976
So how long does it
normally take?!

322
00:19:33,276 --> 00:19:35,310
Honestly... I don't know.

323
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:36,910
Are you kidding me?!

324
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:43,576
Damn! My Combat Pass...!

325
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:47,110
Never mind that!
Just keep running Ichigo!

326
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,610
Bankai!

327
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:07,010
Hyaaaaah!

328
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:15,476
Ichigo! You all right?

329
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,110
Oh yeah. I'm fine.

330
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:18,476
Hnh.
[faints]

331
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,743
Hey! What's wrong?! Ichigo!!

332
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:37,410
The more you overexert yourself,
the sooner the day will come
when you lose your
Spirit Energy completely.

333
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:39,543
Egh.

334
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:40,743
Damn it.

335
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,010
Ngh. Crap, that sucked.

336
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,512
[Toshiro]
Hold it!

337
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,212
Hm?

338
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:52,376
<i>Toshiro!</i>

339
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,276
Hey, have you seen Rukia?
She should be arou--

340
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,176
Don't move!

341
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:56,843
Huh?

342
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,410
Throw down your sword, now!

343
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,276
What's going on?
What the hell's
up's with you?!

344
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,443
My duty is to take you in
as a material witness!
Stop resisting!

345
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:17,110
I'm a material witness?!
What the hell d'ya mean?!

346
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,576
[gasp]

347
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:20,910
Byakuya!

348
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:25,776
This isn't personal.
We're not doing this
because we want to, Ichigo.

349
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,676
Ichigo Kurosaki.
We hereby place
you under arrest.

350
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,043
Thank you for
waiting so
patiently.

351
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,810
Now then, shall we go?
Heh.

352
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:49,958
[Ichigo]
Hold on! We start a new story
arc, and the first thing we do
is arrest the lead character?!!

353
00:23:49,992 --> 00:23:51,625
<i>[Byakuya]</i>
<i>Calm down, Ichigo Kurosaki.</i>

354
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:53,592
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Byakuya!</i>

355
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,558
[Byakuya]
Don't concern yourself, we'll
fill in your spot while you're
away in confinement. We promise.

356
00:23:56,592 --> 00:23:57,758
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>This is all wrong!</i>

357
00:23:57,792 --> 00:23:59,292
<i>[Chad]</i>
<i>Just leave it to us.</i>

358
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:00,725
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Wait! You too Chad?!</i>
