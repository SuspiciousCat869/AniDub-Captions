1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,800
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,533
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:23,200
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:29,233
The Zanpakuto is born with
its Soul Reaper, and dies
with its Soul Reaper...

5
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:32,333
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,325
What's this about? What
the hell happened to
Muramasa?

7
00:02:30,558 --> 00:02:37,058
[screaming]
My body! It's
burning up!

8
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:42,592
I must withstand
this pain!

9
00:02:44,558 --> 00:02:46,025
Koga...

10
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:50,692
Koga... Koga...

11
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:56,858
Koga!!!

12
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:05,325
Getsugatensho!

13
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:11,625
Those Hollows were
trapped inside of him!
How's that possible?!

14
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,758
The only thing I can
imagine is that he's
been absorbing them.

15
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:17,892
And now he's unable
to suppress all of
their Spirit Energy!

16
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:22,692
He's put his very
existence at risk for
the sake of his master.

17
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:26,092
He's even exceeded his
own limitations.

18
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:30,092
Right now, he's only
retaining this state
through sheer willpower.

19
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:34,492
Ko... ga....

20
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,558
What's happening?!

21
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:48,792
Amazing...

22
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:58,325
Ichigo. It looks like
Muramasa's attracting all
the Hollows in this area!

23
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:01,925
Damn. We can't allow that
to happen. I'll have to put
a stop to it.

24
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:06,158
Getsugatensho!

25
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:20,292
Uryu?!

26
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:25,858
Nothing personal, Ichigo,
but it seems to me, in a
situation like this, my
bow and arrows are going

27
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:28,625
to be more effective than
your single sword.

28
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:32,025
It's about as handy as
a can of bug spray.

29
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:33,292
Take that back!

30
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:36,492
Ichigo! Rukia!
We've come to help!

31
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:38,992
Chad! Orihime!

32
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:47,025
Santenkesshun!

33
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,192
Good job, Orihime!

34
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:01,292
Damn! This doesn't look
good for Muramasa.

35
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:42,258
How?

36
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,858
It can't be...

37
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:47,758
I won't...

38
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,825
...let them beat me!

39
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,825
Come to me... Muramasa!

40
00:05:54,225 --> 00:05:56,192
What's happening?

41
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:58,525
Answer me, Muramasa!

42
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:11,858
Why won't you respond?
Your master's calling
you!

43
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:16,025
Mura... masa!

44
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,458
This is over.

45
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,792
I agree. If not for his
extraordinary power,

46
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:43,392
I doubt he would have
deluded himself into
attacking the Soul Society.

47
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:47,425
It was the fate of a
weak-hearted man,
consumed by his ambition.

48
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:51,092
Instead of a blessing,
his power became a
destructive curse.

49
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:57,158
Hmpf! He was the exact
opposite of you, who
willingly allowed himself
to be branded a traitor,

50
00:06:57,192 --> 00:07:02,225
in order to head off a
threat that could have
destroyed the Soul
Society.

51
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:05,592
Now you can finally
reclaim a place of honor
among your peers.

52
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,825
You can hold your
head up high again.

53
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,592
Senbonzakura,
you talk too much.

54
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:22,025
What's going on up
there?!

55
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,858
The Hollows are being
drawn into him!

56
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:19,725
Wait a minute! Is
that... Muramasa?!

57
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:22,925
He seems to have become
some kind of Arrancar!

58
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:32,892
A Zanpakuto is of one
mind and one body with
its Soul Reaper master.
It attaches itself to the

59
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:36,125
soul of its master and
co-exists with him.

60
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,758
Are you saying Muramasa
needed a source of energy
to replace his Soul
Reaper master, if he

61
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,692
wanted to maintain his
physical form?

62
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:47,625
Yes, he had to take in
all those Hollows, if he
was to have any chance of
holding on to his body.

63
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,592
You mean that was what
deflected my barrier before?

64
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:08,692
It shows you how deep and
obsessive his devotion to
Koga was. Exactly what you
would expect of a Zanpakuto

65
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:14,125
for his master. It must
have been horrifying for it
to end with such anger and
betrayal.

66
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,425
But, why?

67
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:34,858
You've become nothing
more than a hindrance to
me. I don't need to use a
pathetic, unstable sword

68
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:38,392
like you. My power
alone's enough.

69
00:09:39,258 --> 00:09:41,658
A Zanpakuto is merely a
tool...

70
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:53,325
Damn!

71
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:04,692
If we don't do something,
Karakura town is going to
be enveloped by his Spirit
Energy!

72
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:06,692
We have to stop him!

73
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,258
Get ready!

74
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,725
He's too fast!

75
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:18,858
He's in such pain.

76
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,658
I can feel his
loneliness.

77
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:31,558
He so desperately reached
out to his master, only
to be abandoned.

78
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:34,092
It broke his heart.

79
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:22,171
Byakuya!

80
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:25,438
I'm so glad
you're okay!

81
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,838
<i>Byakuya!</i>

82
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,605
Did you defeat Koga?

83
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:31,138
Of course. Were you
worried I was going to
lose?

84
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:35,271
Hm... Well, that was
always a possibility, I
mean, you do look pretty
beat up.

85
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,805
He's right. We need to
treat your injuries.

86
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:42,538
Never mind that.
Muramasa should be
our main concern.

87
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:49,738
I never expected him to
release a Cero. He has
completely transformed
into a Hollow.

88
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:06,705
I won't give in! Not to
the power of the Hollows!
I won't give in!

89
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,538
What's happening?

90
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:13,338
I'm not completely sure,
but it looks like he might
be fighting the Hollows
he absorbed.

91
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,105
This is wrong...

92
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:32,505
Orihime!

93
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:38,205
Listen to me! Stop this
right now! Don't fight
anymore!

94
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:42,371
I'm sorry, but the master
you're looking for no
longer exists!

95
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:47,171
It's no use, Orihime.
He can't listen to reason
in this state.

96
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:49,771
Not true.

97
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:54,171
I can feel it. He's
fighting. He hasn't been
completely possessed by
the Hollows yet.

98
00:13:54,838 --> 00:13:59,938
He's in a state of
despair, but he's fighting
desperately to maintain his
Zanpakuto identity.

99
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:01,138
Are you sure?

100
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:06,371
I won't give in. No
matter what, I can't
give in!

101
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:10,905
Ko... ga!

102
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:17,005
I can't believe he's
still searching for Koga,
after transforming into a
Hollow.

103
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:19,305
This guy is
determined.

104
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,505
Muramasa, you have to
stop this, it's useless.

105
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:26,571
You're only gonna cause
yourself more suffering.

106
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:29,938
Let go! Please end this
before it's too late!

107
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:36,638
I won't give in. I
won't! I won't give in!

108
00:15:03,338 --> 00:15:05,071
Move, Orihime, get
out of there!

109
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:23,405
You bastard!

110
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:30,671
That was very brave,
are you all right?

111
00:15:30,905 --> 00:15:32,738
I'm fine, thank you.

112
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:41,505
Can't we save him from
his pain? He's just so sad.

113
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:27,638
Getsugatensho!

114
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:09,571
Muramasa!!!!

115
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:29,705
Damn! The Hollows are
all swarming again!

116
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:33,005
Chad, let's split
up... We need to attack
them from two fronts!

117
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:42,671
El Directo!!!

118
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:51,105
Hado Number
Thirty-Three! Sokatsui!

119
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:57,038
Scatter...
Senbonzakura.

120
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:09,738
Muramasa!

121
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:20,605
Getsugatensho!

122
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:59,271
I won't... give in!

123
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:11,838
What the hell?

124
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:18,638
Unbelievable!

125
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:19,871
Ichigo!

126
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:27,205
That awful thing just
swallowed Ichigo right up.

127
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:28,771
Impossible!

128
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:38,771
What's happened?!

129
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:44,538
The spike in Spirit Energy
from all those Hollows has
caused the sky to break.

130
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:48,438
Orihime?

131
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:52,071
I have to save them. I
have to go in and save
Ichigo and Muramasa.

132
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,705
Don't be ridiculous,
it's dangerous!

133
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:55,971
Let me go!

134
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,138
This really isn't good!
A Garganta is opening.

135
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:27,438
And we're trapped!

136
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:30,205
We're gonna have to
do something fast!

137
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,605
Scatter...
Senbonzakura.

138
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:05,771
Tsuginomai Hakuren!

139
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:24,705
Sodeno... shirayuki.

140
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:30,671
I'm sorry it took so
long to find you.

141
00:21:32,371 --> 00:21:34,071
Sodenoshirayuki...

142
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:35,538
How are you here?!

143
00:21:36,571 --> 00:21:39,405
More importantly, you
should know I didn't come
alone.

144
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:42,038
Hey!

145
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:46,738
You didn't think we'd
let you have all the
fun, did you?

146
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,287
Wow! Zanpakuto are
incredible! There are so
many different types! There's
a cat and a snake...

147
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,453
<i>And a dog , too!</i>

148
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:56,220
You're right! It's so
cute!

149
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:59,053
<i>If it was were a little</i>
<i>smaller, I'd want it as a</i>
<i>pet!</i>

150
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:00,687
Come here, boy!

151
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,920
<i>I hate to tell you guys,</i>
<i>but that's actually</i>
<i>Captain Komamura.</i>
