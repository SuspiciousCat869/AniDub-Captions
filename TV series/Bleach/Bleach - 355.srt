1
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:54,255
[Izuru] Wait, did you say a
Special New Year's issue?

2
00:01:55,256 --> 00:01:57,091
That's right!

3
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,259
It'll show the Soul
Reapers conquering their

4
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,394
Squads' differences to
welcome the New Year!

5
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:00,495
[cheering]

6
00:02:00,528 --> 00:02:03,431
The next Seireitei bulletin
will be all about unity!

7
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:06,467
Hmm.
Right.

8
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:11,406
We'll hold a non-competitive Soul Reaper
event unlike anything they've ever seen!

9
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,475
And I thoughtfully decided
to put you in charge of it!

10
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:16,611
Huh? Why choose me for that!?

11
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:20,615
If you pull this off, I'll
give you a huge credit as the

12
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:22,450
chief planner of the whole
thing and a big editor byline!

13
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,651
Eh... Huh?

14
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,688
It's set, then!
Do a good job, Izuru!

15
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:28,623
Uhhh...

16
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,661
That's weird, I don't recall ever
saying "Yes" to taking this job.

17
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:39,300
Shuhei can be so
pushy sometimes.

18
00:02:40,234 --> 00:02:42,437
Well I'm just gonna
turn it down!

19
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,705
[Momo]
Turn what down?

20
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:44,372
Hm!

21
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:48,443
Whoa! Hi there, Momo!!

22
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:50,445
Boy, you really
look surprised.

23
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:51,446
What's going on?

24
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:53,448
Oh! It's uh, nothing.

25
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,684
So what were you saying you
were going to turn down?

26
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,554
Um... Well,
I was just...

27
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:02,457
Is it that serious?
You can tell me!

28
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,192
No, actually...

29
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:08,396
What an opportunity!
Why're you turning it down?

30
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,264
Well I--

31
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:13,101
Having the Squads put aside their
differences and get along is a great idea!

32
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:14,402
Well, it is, but--

33
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:17,438
Shuhei has given you this important
task because he trusts you!

34
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:20,174
That must make you feel like you're
pretty important, doesn't it?

35
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,143
Well I don't think
that's why he picked--

36
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:24,445
Hey now don't be shy!
You can do it!

37
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,749
You... You think so?

38
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:28,750
Um-hm!

39
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:30,551
[Nanao] Momo! We have to go!

40
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,587
Oh! I'll be right there!

41
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:35,389
Gotta go now, but good
luck with everything!

42
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,191
[giggle]

43
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:42,764
All right then.
I'll do it!

44
00:03:45,032 --> 00:03:48,369
[Izuru] All right, so to celebrate the
New Year and bring us closer together,

45
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,038
you'll all be flying
kites. Have fun.

46
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,673
Ready, and... !

47
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:53,649
[bang]

48
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:54,509
Fly kites!

49
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,354
This is such a
lovely idea!

50
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:10,324
Momo said she'd
be a little late.

51
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:13,194
Hope I can make this more
exciting before she gets here.

52
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:16,731
Captain, everyone else's
kites are flying so high!

53
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:19,233
But our kite isn't
doing nearly as well.

54
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:22,036
That's because you
made ours look like a

55
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,172
butterfly instead of
doing what I suggested,

56
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:26,607
which was to build more
of a conventional design.

57
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:29,577
Hey!

58
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,445
Whose kite is that?

59
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:34,148
Huh?

60
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:37,585
What exactlydo you think
you're doing, Shuhei?

61
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:39,520
Kite flying!
Is there a problem?

62
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:42,523
Well, aren't we supposed to
be the HOSTS of this event?

63
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:47,128
Don't forget this event's aim is to
have everybody get along, even us.

64
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,198
Hm. I guess you're right,
but it'd be really great if

65
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:53,167
you'd help make sure everyone
flying their kites has a good time.

66
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:55,203
That's what
I'm here for!

67
00:04:55,203 --> 00:04:55,736
D'ooh!

68
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:58,673
[Shuhei] Whoa! It's
really getting up there.

69
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,508
Hey!

70
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,511
[Ikkaku]
Whoa! He-ey!!!

71
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:06,414
Hisagi,
you bastard!

72
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:09,417
Oh, sorry pal! I'll
untangle 'em right now.

73
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:14,722
[Ikkaku]
Aaah! You broke my kite string!

74
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:17,592
You did that on purpose,
didn't you, jerk?!

75
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:21,128
Don't be silly, it snapped because
your string was too weak.

76
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,396
What was that!?!

77
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:25,600
I think what you're
really trying to say here

78
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,168
is that Squad Eleven is weak!
Is that it?!

79
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,303
Hey please guys,
let's calm down!

80
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:34,242
I won't stand for that either! he insulted
Squad Eleven's pride, plain and simple!

81
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:36,611
He was just talking
about a kite!

82
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:41,182
Well if that's the case, then why don't we
see whose kite flies higher, Yours or mine!

83
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:43,451
Let's go for it.
I'm Ready when you are.

84
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,186
Rrrgh!

85
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,588
All right,
let's do this!

86
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:48,456
Right!

87
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:51,359
Wait! Hold on you two!
let's just relax!!

88
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:55,263
You said you'd help things go smoothly
but now you've started an argument!

89
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:59,200
What? I'm helping by kicking
things up a notch! Don't worry.

90
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:00,601
Check out those two!

91
00:06:02,136 --> 00:06:04,205
Sentaro! Our Captain will always
be number one, isn't that right?!

92
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:05,640
He sure will be!

93
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,108
Huh?!

94
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,411
What a pain, but since
Captain Soi Fon might

95
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,046
yell at me I'd better
win this thing.

96
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:13,214
Huhh?!

97
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,118
See? I've really livened
things up around here!

98
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:18,619
This can't be happening...

99
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:20,521
[Rangiku] Out of my way!!
Coming through!

100
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:21,255
Huh?

101
00:06:22,123 --> 00:06:23,791
I'm giving kite-flying
my best shot!

102
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,393
I felt that shot...

103
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:27,395
[Shunsui] Are you
having fun down there?

104
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,296
Hnh?

105
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:29,730
Captain Kyoraku!

106
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:33,034
What a nice
relaxing time.

107
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:36,070
So then the two of
you aren't competing?

108
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:39,206
We're just not like
those pushy barbarians.

109
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:41,309
Oh man, tht's
music to my ears.

110
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:42,710
[all laugh]

111
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:46,113
[Marechiyo] Watch this, Madame Butterfly!
Cat kite bumping maneuver!

112
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:48,282
[Rangiku] Hey! What're
you doing to our kite?!

113
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:53,287
For starters, I'm gonna take out the
easy-to-knock-down women's kites first!

114
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:54,388
Rrrgh!

115
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:56,590
Marechiyo! You're nothing but
a cheap shotting bully!!

116
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,795
No I'm smart! All women are naturally
weaker, so it's a no brainer!

117
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:03,698
[Nanao] Hado Number Thirty-One!
Shakkaho!!

118
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,300
Wha-aa?

119
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,804
[Marechiyo] Oh no! The
Captain's gonna kill me!

120
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:14,075
[Nanao] Soyouthinkwomenare
tooweak,andeasyprey.

121
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:16,610
I can't believe you're stupid
enough to say that out loud!

122
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:18,646
You'll pay for your insults!

123
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,615
Way to go! Do it! Blast away!

124
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,417
Shakkaho!

125
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,657
[Kiyone]
Wow! It survived that blast!

126
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:32,026
Never mess with
Squad Thirteen!

127
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:34,462
That kite's made of fireproof
materials imported

128
00:07:34,462 --> 00:07:36,597
straight from America!
It's a juggernaut!

129
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,199
Nice going, Sentaro!

130
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:40,034
[both]
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

131
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,303
Wait a sec, what kind of
warped thinking would

132
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:43,738
prompt someone to make
a kite like that?

133
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:45,272
[bunch of guys cheering]
Yahhh!

134
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:46,674
Huh? What the hell?!

135
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:49,610
Oh yeah!

136
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,544
[proud laughing]

137
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:52,546
All right ya bastards,
let's let er' rip!

138
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:57,184
This is the Squad Eleven
Captain's kite!!

139
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,721
This kite-flying is becoming
quite a heated contest.

140
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,289
[Soi Fon] No you
don't, Madarame!

141
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:03,257
Hnh?!

142
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,459
Your lousy kite will
be no match for mine!

143
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:09,463
You'll never beat our
"True Lady Yoruichi" kite!

144
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:13,234
No-ooo!!

145
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:16,737
Now I'll... claw your...
eyes out!

146
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,241
It's no use... It's gotten
completely out of control... !

147
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:22,143
[Momo]
[scream]

148
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:24,478
Hey, that voice!
Is that Momo?!

149
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,550
What's going on, Izuru?! Why is
everyone fighting in a kite contest?!

150
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,419
Get me down from
here! Help!!

151
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:33,654
How the hell did Momo
get strung up there?!

152
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,189
I can explain it!

153
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:39,093
Momo showed up late for the event but
was ready to join in on the fun.

154
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,462
That's when she became an innocent
victim in the kite battle

155
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,397
between the Punishment
Force and Squad Eleven.

156
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:47,468
To add to her usual bad luck,
the rope that she grabbed

157
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:48,736
was attached to the kite
and before she knew it,

158
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,072
she was yanked skyward,
so that's how she got up there!

159
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,239
Noooo!

160
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:54,442
Thank you so much
for the info.

161
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:57,778
But we've gotta find a way to get
Momo down and back on the ground!

00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:00,047
Hnh?!

164
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,184
Hyaah!

165
00:09:03,651 --> 00:09:06,053
Daiguren Hyorinmaru!!

166
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,727
Hey! If that's how they're gonna play,
let's zap Ikkaku's kite together!

167
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,329

[Momo]
Aaahhh!

171
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:23,637
Shiro!!

172
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:29,043
Yahhhh!

173
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:35,483
Uh oh! Captain?!

174
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:36,717
What just happened?

175
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:39,687
Huh? Wait,what
was that wind?

176
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,056
Hey over there!
Don't get distracted!

177
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:43,657
Who me?!

178
00:09:43,691 --> 00:09:47,161
[Yachiru] Go, Baldy go! Go, Meow-Meow!
Do your best, you two!

179
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:52,733
Why?! Why won't anyone
just listen to me?

180
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,735
Raise your
head, Izuru!

181
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,470
Unh? Was that a joke?

182
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:59,206
Don't worry. I have a plan!

183
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,776
Use this secret weapon and you
can bring an end to all of this!

184
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,312
Uh? So! That'll do it?!

185
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:09,483
It's about time we settle this
contest once and for all!

186
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:14,054
No problem, I'll send your kite crashing
down with the next hit and we'll be done!

187
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:18,058
Haaaaaa!
Haaaaaa!

188
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,793
[together]
Pull!

189
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:29,136
I'll stop you both myself!

190
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,071
I have to end this mess.

191
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:34,141
Raise your head!
Wabisuke!!

192
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:39,547
Huh!?
Unh?!

193
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:43,284
Uh??

194
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:48,255
Huwaaaaaa!

195
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:51,525
Isn't that
where...?

196
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,027
I sure
hope not!

197
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:56,597
Guess I m.

[Yamamoto]
Ahem!

199
00:10:58,098 --> 00:10:59,266
Hnh? Yahh!

200
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:01,702
Uh...

201
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:05,506
Are you insane?!?

202
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:08,442
[Yamamoto] You ruined
my New Year's meal!

203
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,578
I'm going to burn
you into ashes!

204
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:11,478
[Izuru]
Yaaaagh!

208
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:23,224
I'm such a loser.

209
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:24,325
Heh...

210
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:36,809
[Rukia]
Sorry to make you wait, Renji.

211
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:38,844
[Renji]
No problem. Have a seat.

212
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,915
So, what is it you
wanted to see me about?

213
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:48,787
Hm.

214
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:51,690
Why don't you try
having a drink first!

215
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:53,225
Uh!

216
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:55,427
Isn't that bottle from
the World of the Living?!

217
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,296
Ah, don't be
so uptight.

218
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:06,371
[gulp]

219
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,978
Ahh!

220
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:15,848
Renji!

221
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:20,819
I asked you here, because I've
been asked to perform a dance.

222
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:26,558
I bet you're having trouble
getting the steps down,

223
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:28,794
so that's why you wanted
to talk to me, right?

224
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:31,697
I've already learned the
choreography but...

225
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:34,399
Here's what you
need to know.

226
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:37,803
The Celebration Dance is a
dance that Hisana once did.

227
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:42,474
And you must perform it perfectly, so
as not to embarrass the Kuchiki Clan.

228
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:45,344
I've been told that my sister
danced it quite beautifully.

229
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,282
I don't think I could
ever match her level.

230
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:55,921
Uh, in that case maybe I'm not
the one you want to talk to.

231
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:57,422
Uh!

232
00:12:57,823 --> 00:12:59,258
But what the hell!

233
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,793
Why don't you show me this
dance of yours anyway.

234
00:13:01,827 --> 00:13:03,962
You want to
see me dance?!

235
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:07,299
If I don't see it, how can tell
if you're good or bad at it?

236
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:08,934
I suppose you're right.

237
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:17,342
Whaddya think?

238
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:19,311
That was pretty
strange looking.

239
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:19,978
What?!

240
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,949
How dare you call it "strange-looking"
after asking me to show it to you!

241
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:26,618
Getting angry's not
gonna help anything!

242
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:27,686
Didn't you think it
was strange looking?

243
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:30,689
Uh... Yeah, I guess
I thought that too.

244
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:35,394
Hey, wow, cool! That sure is
one expensive looking kimono.

245
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:36,929
Yeah, it sure is!

246
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:39,464
This piece was painstakingly
made especially

247
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:41,700
for this dance over a
long period of time!

248
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:42,834
Hm!

249
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:45,270
Well if you get
the dance right,

250
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:47,506
there's really no need to
wear something that fancy.

251
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,707
Huh?

252
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,644
Rukia, what is this?

253
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:56,415
Oh, that's a book I've been reading
on dance for beginners. So?

254
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:57,382
I've got it!

255
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:00,552
All right, c'mon Rukia,
we're going out.

256
00:14:01,553 --> 00:14:03,589
No, I have to
rehearse my dance!

257
00:14:03,622 --> 00:14:04,723
[Renji]
Never mind that!

258
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,758
[Rukia]
Wait Renji, hey!

259
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:08,860
[Renji] Don't worry!
This won't take long!

260
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:15,300
We've come with
a request!

261
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,570
Okay Renji, what're we
doing at Squad Eleven?

262
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,440
You'll see. I've decided
I want to get stronger.

263
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:25,410
Whaaaa!

264
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:29,715
Quit your pathetic
slacking off, damn it!!

265
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:31,717
Listen up,
you guys!

266
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,684
[moaning]

267
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:34,419
There are no holiday
breaks for fighting!

268
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:37,422
If I catch you resting, I'll kill
you and toss you in the river!

269
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:40,692
So, what are you guys
doing around here?

270
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:43,495
Come on, let's get in
on the fun, Rukia!

271
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:44,963
And why would
we do that?!

272
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:48,233
Fighting both of you?
That'll be fun!

273
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,370
[Kenpachi beating up
Rukia and Renji]

274
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:53,505
[Renji]
Hellooo!

275
00:14:54,706 --> 00:14:57,609
So what have you got planned
to do here at Squad Ten?!

276
00:14:57,643 --> 00:14:59,845
Never you mind.
Just indulge me.

277
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:04,316
Oh hi, what brings
the two of you here?

278
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,952
Captain Hitsugaya's
not here right now.

279
00:15:06,952 --> 00:15:10,989
My! If I do say, You look especially
ravishing today, Lieutenant!

280
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:13,759
Huh?! Why're you talking
like that, Renji?

281
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:16,461
Did you come over here just to
make fun of me or something?

282
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:18,697
Why no!
Not at all!

283
00:15:18,697 --> 00:15:22,534
It's just that Rukia here wants to learn
the secret of your feminine charms!

284
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:23,969
Isn't that
right, Rukia?

285
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:24,836
Uh...!

286
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:26,271
Hmm?

287
00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:28,707
Wait, um! That's
not really true.

288
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:33,578
Well now, I understand, so your
femininity finally woke up huh!

289
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:34,813
It's not that! I...

290
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:36,715
Oh come on,
let's get started!

291
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:38,483
Hrrgh.

292
00:15:38,517 --> 00:15:40,886
Hey wait! After all I
went through to help!

293
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,488
I won't put up with you
wasting my time with games!

294
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:50,429
So how did
THAT look?

295
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:51,596
[quickly]
Oh that was great.

296
00:15:51,763 --> 00:15:52,564
What??

297
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,734
Don't say anything if you
weren't even watching me!

298
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:58,704
What exactly are you doing
on the floor, anyway?

299
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:02,374
What does it look like? I'm
practicing my New Year's calligraphy.

300
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:04,576
Why don't you go do
that at your own place!

301
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:07,579
Hey wait a minute, why
don't you give it a try?

302
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:08,580
Huh?

303
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:12,684
Doing calligraphy will calm your mind
and that'll help your concentration,

304
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:14,820
which might just
improve your dancing!

305
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,822
It could do that?

306
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:19,624
Maybe! It sure wouldn't
hurt you to try it!

307
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:22,527
Hm!

308
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:25,430
Okay, look I'm all done!

309
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:28,533
Great! so tell me, does
your mind feel calmer now?

310
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,302
It does!

311
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,437
Hey by the way,
what time is it?

312
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:34,372
It's about
seven o'clock.

313
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,476
It's seven?! It's
that late already?!

314
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:39,845
Calm down Rukia! Don't
get so freaked out!

315
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:43,949
"Calm down"?! Because of your idea I've
wasted even more of my precious time!

316
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:46,818
That's not fair! I've tried to
help you and all you can say is--

317
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:47,652
Enough!

318
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:49,955
Just go home.

319
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:51,957
[frustrated]

320
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:55,761
But Rukia, I was
just trying to--

321
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:57,829
I said, go home!

322
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:59,297
Hey, hear me out!

323
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:00,699
Whoaa!

324
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:06,705
Oof!
Heh heh!

325
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,573
Are you all right Rukia?

326
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:10,442
Uahh...

327
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:14,012
Yeah, I'm fine...

328
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,448
[gasp]

329
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:20,352
The kimono...

330
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:24,556
D'ahh! I...
Uhh... Oh no...

331
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:29,628
I- I'm so sorry, Rukia!
I'll pay whatever it costs...

332
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,767
This piece was painstakingly made, just for
this dance, over a long period of time!

333
00:17:37,402 --> 00:17:38,370
[soft]
Augh.

334
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,306
I need you
to leave.

335
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:43,475
Rukia...

336
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:45,443
Just get out!!

337
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:03,395
[soft sobs]

338
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:09,968
Agh!

339
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,473
Master
Byakuya!

340
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:16,341
What is it?

341
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:18,543
Well, it's
about, uh...

342
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:19,978
Hm?

343
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:30,822
Unh.

344
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:45,437
Where am I?

345
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:50,542
It's been awhile Rukia.

346
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:52,944
Kaien! It's you!

347
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:56,281
I came here today to
see how you were doing.

348
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:58,216
Oh Kaien! Please help
me to understand--

349
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,385
Just hold it.
Don't say a word.

350
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:02,354
Right now, you're like,

351
00:19:02,787 --> 00:19:05,357
"The boy at the temple gate,
a candle in the wind"!

352
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:06,291
Huh?

353
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,661
You know the
old proverbs:

354
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:11,830
"A cornered rat
cannot repent."

355
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,399
"Nothing ventured is
worth two in the bush."

356
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:15,967
"Out of sight,
can fall from trees."

357
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:16,968
Am I right?

358
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:17,969
Um, okay...

359
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,938
Wait! There's more of them!

360
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:22,574
Fear is greater
without consent.

361
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:24,409
In one ear and
nail the other.

362
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:26,711
Even a worm has a
god who will save it.

363
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:29,381
Don't ever forget
what I have said!!

364
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:35,420
Please don't go, Kaien! I need your advice!
What should I do?!

365
00:19:37,422 --> 00:19:40,258
When you know that your
toes are tired, always

366
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:42,694
put a chili pepper in your socks!
So long!

367
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:45,563
Wha!? Wait, Kaien!!

368
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:47,599
Ahh!

369
00:19:47,632 --> 00:19:48,934
Whoaa!

370
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:51,836
Kaieennnn!

371
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:54,439
[gasp]

372
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:57,809
Uhh.

373
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:01,413
A dream. Huh?

374
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,382
That was a really
strange dream.

375
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,685
Uh?

376
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:09,721
[door closes]

377
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,224
Brother!

378
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:21,833
Hisana wore that very kimono when she
performed at the Celebration Dance.

379
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:26,838
And you should wear it as well, when
you dance at this year's ceremony.

380
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:27,939
You mean that?

381
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:31,443
However, It's not the
kimono that matters.

382
00:20:31,676 --> 00:20:35,647
What's more important, is the
attitude you have during the dance.

383
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:38,883
YouknowwhatI
meanbythat.

384
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:43,254
Therewassomeoneelse whotoldyouthesame
thingwaybeforeIdid.

385
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:46,424
Come on, let's get in
on the fun, Rukia!

386
00:20:46,658 --> 00:20:48,760
You look
ravishing today!

387
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:52,697
Doing calligraphy will calm
your mind and help you focus.

388
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,336
Now I understand, that's why Renji
did all those things with me.

389
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:01,840
Rukia, there's still time
before the ceremony.

390
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:04,509
Use it wisely for
your practice.

391
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:08,546
And do not forget that you will be
representing the entire Kuchiki Clan.

392
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,948
Thank you very
much, Brother!

393
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,551
[Hanataro]
Hello!

394
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:16,554
Oh, why hello
Hanataro!

395
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:18,623
It's been
quite a while.

396
00:21:19,424 --> 00:21:22,827
I was sent here today in order to
pay Lieutenant Abarai a visit.

397
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:25,430
Oh really? You're
here to see Renji?

398
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,298
Yes, is something
the matter?

399
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:31,569
No, it's just that Renji hasn't come
out of his room since yesterday.

400
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:33,872
I understand.
In that case,

401
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:35,940
Can you please
give this to him?

402
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:38,443
Sure, I'll see
he gets it.

403
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:40,845
Great. Then
I'll be going.

404
00:21:43,314 --> 00:21:46,217
It's pretty rare for Renji
to get a letter sent to him.

405
00:21:46,718 --> 00:21:47,819
Wonder who
it's from?

406
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:49,421
Oh!

407
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:56,828
[Rukia] "Dear Renji, On January 10th, I
will be performing the Celebration Dance."

408
00:21:58,296 --> 00:22:00,598
"I'dreallylikeyouto
comeandseemeperform."

409
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,302
"P.S. And Renji,"

410
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:07,672
"Thank you."

411
00:23:45,877 --> 00:23:48,447
[Renji] Rukia! Your dancing
has improved so much!

412
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,250
[Rukia] Really?! My feet were warm
and that made it easier to perform.

413
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:54,152
[Renji] I'm sure that's
thanks to my advice!

414
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:57,956
[Rukia] Kaien was right all along!
I kept a chili pepper in my socks!

415
00:23:57,989 --> 00:23:59,124
[Renji]
What about my advice?

416
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:00,792
[Rukia]
Thank you so much, Kaien!
