1
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,641
(Gasps)

2
00:01:54,641 --> 00:02:00,085
Hello, good to see you.
You seem to be doing
well.

3
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:01,287
[Tsukishima]
Yes...

4
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,856
(Gasp)

5
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,665
In fact he appears to be
brimming with energy.
That actually makes me
quite happy.

6
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:09,668
(Grunt)

7
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:11,205
Now then...

8
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:15,712
(Explosion)

9
00:02:15,746 --> 00:02:20,387
[Ginjo]
I destroyed the stairway.
Yukio's the only one who
has the power to get up here.

10
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:23,560
[cont'd]
That levels the playing
field.

11
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:27,534
[cont'd]
So now, there's really
nothing to hold you back.

12
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:29,538
Fight them with everything
you've got!

13
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:34,146
[Ginjo]
Let'em have it,
Ichigo!

14
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:35,114
(Growls)

15
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:36,350
(Gasp)

16
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:37,819
(Growl)

17
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,860
(Gasp)

18
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:46,234
Ah!

19
00:02:46,268 --> 00:02:52,679
(Grunts)

20
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:56,386
(Fighting Grunts)

21
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:02,865
Huh?!

22
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:11,414
(Attacking Grunts)

23
00:03:11,447 --> 00:03:22,567
Ahh!

24
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:25,505
So that's your Fullbring
in it's completed form?

25
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,879
If so, you've come a long
way in a short time.

26
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:32,385
Is that supposed to
be a compliment?

27
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:35,624
You might as well speak
while you still have
the opportunity.

28
00:03:35,657 --> 00:03:39,865
My mission is simple.
I came here to kill you.

29
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:49,883
(Stunned Breath)

30
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:57,563
(Stunned Breath)

31
00:03:57,597 --> 00:04:03,574
(Gasp)

32
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:10,688
Chad! Orihime!

33
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:13,459
Sotenkishun!

34
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:21,975
[Orihime]
I reject!

35
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:26,516
Don't do it!

36
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,692
Stop it, Orihime!
Don't help him out by
healing his wounds!

37
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:38,337
That guy is...

38
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:41,310
Hm!

39
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:45,317
Well as always, that was
amazing. Thank you,
Orihime.

40
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,959
Sure, any time!

41
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:52,530
Tell me, Chad....

42
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:56,637
[Ichigo Cont'd]
Have you and Orihime
lost it like the others?

43
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,710
What are you talking
about, Ichigo? I don't
know what you mean?

44
00:04:59,743 --> 00:05:02,715
If you ask me, you're
the one who's losing it.

45
00:05:02,748 --> 00:05:12,800
Ichigo, how could you do
something so terrible to Mr.
Tsukishima? Have you forgotten
he's always helped us!

46
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:18,444
Ichigo, how could you do
something so terrible to Mr.
Tsukishima? Have you forgotten
he's always helped us!

47
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:28,428
[Chad]
That's right. Like the
time when we saved Rukia.

48
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:37,411
[cont'd]
Or the time we went to Hueco
Mundo to rescue Orihime
from the Arrancar.

49
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:39,949
And finally, defeating
Aizen.

50
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:43,790
[Chad]
We were only able to
accomplish all that thanks
to Mr. Tsukishima!

51
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:46,461
You see what's happening?

52
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:47,997
Ichigo...

53
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:56,579
(Grunt)

54
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:04,426
Ichigo!

55
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,664
[Moeh]
Going somewhere?

56
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:09,603
We're the ones your
fighting, remember?

57
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:14,546
You can't afford to be
thinking or worrying about
anything but that!

58
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,018
Who is this guy?

59
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:23,295
[cont'd]
What did he just do?
Did he make that thing
fall?

60
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:26,734
[cont'd]
Doesn't look like he's
got anything in his hands.

61
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:31,075
[cont'd]
How strange. The chain on
the chandelier that fell
isn't cut.

62
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:34,615
[cont'd]
All of its screws came
undone.

63
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:43,999
So then, what is this
guy's Fullbring?

64
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:45,868
You're staying here.

65
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:57,490
There is a time and a
place for everything, but
this is inappropriate.

66
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,660
(Grunt)

67
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:07,508
[Tsukishima]
You know those science fiction
novels where people go back
in time to alter events?

68
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:12,384
Ever notice how the
slightest tampering can
completely change the future.

69
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:18,628
That's because everyone
accepts the idea that time
flows from the past to
what lies ahead.

70
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:23,504
[cont'd]
But my Fullbring, "Book
of the End," insinuates
itself into peoples pasts.

71
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:25,106
(Gasp)

72
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,680
[Tsukishima]
You see, my power doesn't
manipulate time or
radically alter someone's

73
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:33,355
[cont'd]
memories. Instead, I have
the unique ability to
physically insert my complete

74
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:36,727
[cont'd]
presence into the past
of others.

75
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,533
So Ginjo's guess about
your power was right.

76
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:45,109
Oh? So Ginjo was actually
able to figure me out.

77
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:53,057
What a surprise. I really
didn't think he was that sharp.
Perhaps I've underestimated
him all these years.

78
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,897
[Tsukishima]
Well I know it's
regrettable, but I
want you to understand.

79
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:00,871
[cont'd]
The past your friends
experienced and the past
you experienced are two

80
00:08:00,904 --> 00:08:03,676
[cont'd]
very separate
realities.

81
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:05,546
Hah!

82
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,522
That's a pretty distorted
description of what
you've done. What you
should say is that you

83
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:14,496
used your powers to
twist reality into
what benefits you.

84
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:17,100
But that's where
you're wrong.

85
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,776
[Tsukishima cont'd]
I didn't twist reality
at all. I am part of the
lives of all your

86
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:30,691
[cont'd]
close friends and
family.

87
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:35,868
[cont'd]
You're the only one
that's leading a life
with a false past.

88
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:41,711
[cont'd]
You must feel empty knowing
it's only different for
you, but don't worry.

89
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:47,088
Soon that isolated feeling
inside you will have never
existed in the first place,

90
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:51,931
(Gasp)

91
00:08:51,964 --> 00:09:06,624
Ahh!

92
00:09:06,657 --> 00:09:11,165
Orihime...

93
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:13,469
(Punch Grunt)

94
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,206
Chad, why?!

95
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,545
[Chad]
That's what I want
to know.

96
00:09:18,578 --> 00:09:22,920
This is not the reason
that I've worked so
hard to become strong.

97
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:27,027
It's not so I could
fight you! Why are you
doing this?!

98
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:32,003
You've got it all
wrong! Please, stop!

99
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:42,589
Brazo Izquierdo
Del Diablo!

100
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:50,469
Damn it! Damn it!
Why is this happening?
Why won't they believe
me?!

101
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:58,785
All I've wanted to do
was protect you guys!
So why this?! I-I tried!

102
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:09,605
It's not fair! I
didn't regain my powers
for things to end up
like this?!

103
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:12,176
Tsukishima!

104
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,044
(Explosion)

105
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:14,513
Ichigo!

106
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,719
Dirty Boots!

107
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:18,954
Ahh!

108
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:22,127
(Fighting Grunts)

109
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,171
Time tells no lies.

110
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:30,676
Stop it, Kutsuzawa!

111
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:33,080
(Grunt)

112
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:38,757
Damn it! Not you
guys too!

113
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,494
I have to do something!

114
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:42,030
[Riruka]
Doll House!

115
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:42,631
(Gasp)

116
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:47,774
You're not leaving!

117
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:49,944
Ahh!

118
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,012
Damn it!

119
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:52,649
(Grunt)

120
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:53,851
(Grunt)

121
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:58,760
Ah!

122
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:03,001
What the hell?
That punch felt like
nothing to me.

123
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:08,912
(Gasp)

124
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:12,085
My sword...
It's broken!

125
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:15,758
Hah! You're damn lucky
that I hit your sword
instead of you!

126
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:20,232
That last spin I made
was so good, there's no
telling how you would've
ended up!

127
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:24,106
[Ginjo]
What do you mean?!

128
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:25,976
My Fullbring is
called...

129
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:30,083
[Moeh]
Jackpot Knuckle!

130
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:35,092
I can control the odds
and make a jackpot hit for
me, right from the start!

131
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:38,799
[cont'd]
That last punch I threw
hit the jackpot and look
what happened?

132
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:42,672
[cont'd]
The guard of your
sword went and snapped
from wear and tear!

133
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:46,312
[cont'd]
The coin I flicked
earlier hit the jackpot too
and you saw the result.

134
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:51,723
[cont'd]
Those screws of the
chandelier came undone and
it all came falling down.

135
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:54,995
Come and get me,
Kugo Ginjo.

136
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:59,603
Do it and I'll show
you how a one shot kill
can really happen!

137
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:03,945
Damn, I can't just stand
here and let Ichigo
get cut down!

138
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:08,720
Sorry, but my time's too
precious to waste goofing
around with you!

139
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:12,092
Let's go!

140
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:16,134
(Fighting Grunts)

141
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,137
(Fighting Grunts)

142
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,143
Tsukishima!

143
00:12:21,176 --> 00:12:22,879
What is it?

144
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:29,190
Is this getting to you?
I see your so angry, you
can barely even speak to me.

145
00:12:29,224 --> 00:12:30,292
Ah!

146
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:41,179
(Grunt)

147
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:42,983
Getsuga!

148
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:44,785
Tensho!

149
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:47,156
He's fast!

150
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,366
(Grunt)

151
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:57,776
He's in Fullbring mode,
yet he was able to unleash
Getsugatensho.

152
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:01,015
He's advanced rather
dramatically.

153
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,786
His powers have
definitely reawakened.

154
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:08,728
Not only that but the
speed of his attacks
are several times faster
than I had expected.

155
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:15,074
[Tsukishima]
He really has succeeded
in combining his Soul Reaper
powers with Fullbring.

156
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:17,244
Damn you!

157
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:21,385
[Tsukishima]
And as I thought it would,
despair helped fuel the
completion of his power.

158
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:23,322
Well, okay.

159
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:26,895
It's time to put the
finishing touches on
this.

160
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:28,397
Ichigo!

161
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:30,802
I'd keep your eyes
over here!

162
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:34,241
(Grunt)

163
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:37,214
No you don't!

164
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:41,955
(Kick Grunt)

165
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,726
The time has come.

166
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,799
(Annoyed Grunt)

167
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:54,445
Time for what?
What do you mean?

168
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,814
Ahh!

169
00:13:55,814 --> 00:14:05,164
Ahh!

170
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:08,404
There's no way I've got
a chance against all
four of them.

171
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:13,813
Now where's Ichigo?

172
00:14:13,846 --> 00:14:17,219
Ahh!

173
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:20,392
(Gasp)

174
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:25,935
Why are you two
protecting him?!
Please, stop! Orihime!
Chad!

175
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:28,006
I say the same
to you!

176
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,111
Come back to your
senses! Ichigo!

177
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:40,795
Don't you get it?
I only came here to
fight Tsukishima, not
you!

178
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:45,871
Come out! Stop hiding
behind my friends,
you bastard!

179
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:55,890
Get out here and
fight your own battle!

180
00:14:55,923 --> 00:15:00,899
Get out here and
fight your own battle!

181
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:14,390
Where'd he go?

182
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:20,200
(Gasp)

183
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:25,443
(Struggling Breaths)

184
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:27,881
Damn it!

185
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:29,317
Ginjo!

186
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:59,371
(Grunt)

187
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:06,251
Damn it!

188
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:10,191
(Painful Sigh)

189
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:17,371
Ginjo!

190
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:20,009
What'll happen next?!

191
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:26,988
With my Fullbring, "Book
of the End," I can insert
my presence into another
person's past.

192
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:41,848
Will Ginjo end up like
all the others?
Will he suddenly side
with Tsukishima?

193
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:47,859
Ginjo! Hey Ginjo,
are you all right?!

194
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:51,433
Ginjo!

195
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:57,409
(Painful Breathing)

196
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:00,482
Pipe down, will ya?

197
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:05,858
Right now, you really need
to stop focusing on me,
Kurosaki.

198
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,428
[Ichigo]
Ginjo...

199
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:10,166
Think only about
what I said earlier.

200
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:16,144
[Ginjo Cont'd]
If Tsukishima blindsides
you, you're done!

201
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:21,887
(Fighting Grunt)

202
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,425
[Ichigo]
So are you sure you're
all right?

203
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,829
[Ginjo]
I don't know...

204
00:17:26,863 --> 00:17:28,533
But...

205
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:33,342
[cont'd]
At the moment, I still
consider Tsukishima to
be my enemy!

206
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:38,851
[cont'd]
And I still see you
as a friend.

207
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:42,324
Yeah, that's good
to know.

208
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:47,434
I could feel that he
cut me pretty good.
But for some reason his
power didn't work.

209
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:51,040
[Ginjo Cont'd]
Could it be that the
time his power needs
to take effect varies?

210
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,480
[cont'd]
Or maybe he hasn't used
his full power yet, but
I'm not sure how we'll

211
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:57,886
[cont'd]
be able to tell.

212
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,529
Whatever's going on here,
we have to defeat him
now while we can, because
if his power do take effect

213
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:12,613
there won't be a
thing we can do to
stop him!

214
00:18:12,646 --> 00:18:17,087
Ichigo, what happened
to you?
What's gotten into you,
Ichigo?

215
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:22,865
Ichigo..
It's all your fault!
Hey, Ichigo!

216
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:26,605
(Gasp)

217
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:33,016
Right.

218
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:38,627
Hm?!

219
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:43,636
Ichigo...

220
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:45,171
Uryu!

221
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:47,309
Whose side is he on?!

222
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:51,516
[Ichigo]
After all, Uryu was also
cut down by Tsukishima.

223
00:18:51,516 --> 00:18:55,223
[cont'd]
And who healed his wounds?
Was it Orihime?

224
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:58,396
[cont'd]
But she was cut down
by Tsukishima as well.

225
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:04,507
[cont'd]
So did she go heal Uryu,
before or after she thought
of Tsukishima as her friend?

226
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:10,083
If it was after, does
that mean she healed
Uryu so he could join
Tsukishima's army?

227
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,654
And fight me along
with everyone else?!

228
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:26,079
[Ichigo]
So Uryu, which is it?!

229
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:35,563
(Gasp)

230
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:45,414
So then, you're one of
them too, huh?
Uryu!

231
00:19:45,414 --> 00:19:48,052
Uryu...

232
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:53,429
Ichigo, come over
here.

233
00:19:53,429 --> 00:20:00,074
I saw what's going on
down here. Relax.
I'm on your side.

234
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:03,012
Oh really?

235
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:05,417
Come on! You need to
move now!

236
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,187
(Gasp)

237
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,225
Uryu!

238
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,029
Ichigo!

239
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:13,532
[Uryu]
Don't you get it?!

240
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:15,168
(Gasp)

241
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:25,219
The guy who attacked
me, is standing right
behind you!

242
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:37,441
The guy who attacked
me, is standing right
behind you!

243
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:39,112
No!

244
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:40,114
(Grunt)

245
00:20:40,147 --> 00:20:48,661
(Painful Exhale)

246
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:58,714
(Laughing)

247
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:07,496
(Laughing)

248
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:13,072
Ginjo, why?

249
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,341
Huh?

250
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,080
[Ichigo]
Is it because of
Tsukishima's power?

251
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,184
It sure was.

252
00:21:19,217 --> 00:21:25,161
[Ginjo Cont'd]
It was definitely because
of Tsukishima's power.

253
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:27,499
But you need to
understand something.

254
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:37,517
I didn't become your
enemy just now when you
saw Tsukishima cut me.

255
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:44,230
I didn't become your
enemy just now when you
saw Tsukishima cut me.

256
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:57,386
I let Tsukishima cut me
twice so I could return
to my original self.

257
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:03,330
[Ginjo Cont'd]
Now your Fullbring is
mine!

258
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:13,081
(Painful Grunt)

259
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,157
[Moeh]
You're all very strong!
Just what I'd expect from
Mr. Tsukishima's friends.

260
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:52,528
[Riruka]
I've been meaning to
ask. Uh, who are you?

261
00:23:52,562 --> 00:23:54,264
[Moeh]
I'm Mr. Tsukishima's
apprentice!

262
00:23:54,264 --> 00:23:56,168
[Jackie]
He had an apprentice?

263
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:59,320
[Moeh]
You haven't hear about
me from him? Like how
useful or handsome I am?

264
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:01,322
[Riruka & Jackie]
Not a word!
