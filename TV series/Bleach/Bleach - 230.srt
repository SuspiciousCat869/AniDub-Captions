1
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:13,233
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:20,633
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,600
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:28,300
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,433
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:40,288
Hey.

7
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:47,254
How long are we gonna
have to stick around this
place anyway? I'm so
freakin' bored here.

8
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:49,654
Eh, I'm gonna take a look
outside.

9
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:50,988
Not a good idea.

10
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:51,954
Huh?

11
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:56,388
It's too soon. Not
everyone has arrived
as of yet.

12
00:02:57,254 --> 00:02:59,421
Everyone who?

13
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:01,288
How many more are coming?

14
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:03,554
<i>Well, I can't be sure,</i>
<i>exactly.</i>

15
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,854
Aw, who cares about our
numbers? In fact, why
don't I go out there
and handle this myself!

16
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:16,054
Shut up. Rushing into
things is foolish.

17
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:20,888
You said it! An
impatient man is
so unattractive.

18
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:23,421
Huh?

19
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:33,454
Welcome back.

20
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:37,454
I have brought us a new
friend. Look after him.

21
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,854
Hey, that guy's pretty
good looking.

22
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:52,021
Be straight with me, how
long are we gonna be
stuck down here waiting?

23
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:54,621
You'll have to bear it
a bit longer.

24
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:58,121
The rest of our comrades
will be joining us very
soon.

25
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:01,788
Aw, come on!

26
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:11,521
The era of the Soul
Reaper is coming to
an end.

27
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:24,388
Ichigo.

28
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:29,354
Can you hear it, Ichigo?

29
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:36,788
Hold on. Why
am I---

30
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:38,821
<i>Ichigo!</i>

31
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:39,688
Huh?

32
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:42,621
Surely you are able to
hear it, Ichigo.

33
00:04:42,654 --> 00:04:45,154
What, your voice? Of
course I hear it.

34
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:47,921
No, Ichigo, that is not
what I mean.

35
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,121
Huh?

36
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:53,721
Sorry, I don't hear
anything other than you.

37
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:55,621
What're you talking
about?

38
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:02,721
Forget about it.

39
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:05,210
What? No, I can't forget about it now.

40
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,749
Listen, Old Man! Hey! Answer me!

41
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,321
Roar, Zabimaru!

42
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,754
Scatter, Senbonzakura.

43
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:30,654
Lieutenant!

44
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:35,288
Ban-kai!

45
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:42,088
Whoa.

46
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:52,054
Hihio, Zabimaru!

47
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:53,754
Heh!

48
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,188
[cheering]

49
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:05,821
You haven't forgotten,
have you?

50
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:11,154
When Senbonzakura is
controlled directly by my
hands, it has twice the
speed.

51
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:14,121
Your slow Bankai is no
match for it.

52
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:17,388
Here I come.

53
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,588
Hear my voice.

54
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:40,188
Now, Hikotsu Taiho!

55
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:02,288
Look at that. You used
your Bankai?

56
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:09,654
Captain? Is something
wrong?

57
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:12,588
No.

58
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:15,821
Captain? Huh?

59
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:18,654
Wow fellas, that was
quite the sparring
session.

60
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,421
Yes Lieutenant Abarai,
your skills have
improved.

61
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:24,521
Oh have they? Thank you.

62
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:27,354
Um, Captain?

63
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:30,754
That will be all for
today.

64
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:34,521
Uh, yes sir. I
appreciate the
opportunity.

65
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,254
Byakuya?

66
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,554
Please excuse me.

67
00:07:39,754 --> 00:07:41,988
Wonder what's eating
that guy.

68
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:00,588
Hyorinmaru!

69
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:26,954
What's the matter?

70
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,954
What was that about?

71
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:47,988
Hyorinmaru.

72
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:51,621
<i>Just come on out already!</i>

73
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:54,021
Agh! Rangiku!

74
00:08:55,921 --> 00:09:01,888
Get out here, Haineko!
Are you seriously ignoring
me?! You think that I'll
just take this from you?!

75
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:04,088
You better watch
yourself!

76
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,021
Hey.

77
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:07,954
Are you even listening?!
That's it, I'm mad.

78
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:14,054
You are lazy, moody and a
brat! What a useless
Zanpakuto! Whoever
forged you was--

79
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:15,454
Rangiku!

80
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:18,954
What's the yelling
about, huh?

81
00:09:18,988 --> 00:09:23,921
Hey don't scare me like
that. I was just having
a friendly chat with my
Zanpakuto.

82
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:25,188
That was a chat?

83
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:26,588
<i>Excuse me.</i>

84
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:30,554
Hello there, Rangiku.
Shiro.

85
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:32,054
Momo? Isane?

86
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,288
Why do you always refuse
to call me Captain?

87
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:36,521
What brings you girls
around here?

88
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:40,021
Thi does. It's a special
notice announcing a
lieutenants meeting.

89
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:41,254
Oh, thanks!

90
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:42,754
Something wrong, Shiro?

91
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:44,954
You two... don't you
have somewhere to be!?

92
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:47,021
<i>R-Rangiku!</i>

93
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,388
Uh, what were you doing
in here?

94
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:52,488
Ohh. Just talking to my
Zanpakuto.

95
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:57,188
Our enemies are getting
more crafty all the time.
So we have to hone our
skills too.

96
00:09:57,954 --> 00:10:02,388
And yet that silly
Haineko! She just
refuses to manifest.

97
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:04,254
I'm telling you, she
can be so lame.

98
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:08,721
Oh! You really
shouldn't badmouth your
Zanpakuto like that.

99
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:11,288
You must be more
forgiving towards it.

100
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:16,854
When I was at my lowest
point, Tobiume was so
concerned about me.

101
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:21,188
That's when I realized...
No matter what happens,
I am never alone!!

102
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,488
So you're telling me
you even drive your
Zanpakuto crazy?

103
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:28,888
Umm... Speaking of
Zanpakuto problems...

104
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:33,665
My Itegumo has also been
slow to respond the past
two or three days.

105
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:35,465
Yours too, Isane?!

106
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:39,631
Yes. And this has never
happened before.

107
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:43,798
You're lucky it's
just this once! With
Haineko, it's been
constant.

108
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:46,365
It's the first time,
that's what concerns me!

109
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:49,231
Um, Toshiro? Where are
you going?

110
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:51,598
Where do you think? I'm
still on duty.

111
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:56,731
Oh! But we brought over
some sweet baked bean
desserts that we got from
Captain Unohana.

112
00:10:56,765 --> 00:11:00,831
Let's have a tea break,
Captain. They are your
favorite treats!

113
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:02,465
Captain?!

114
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:10,465
So strange.

115
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:16,298
What does this mean?

116
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:35,298
[giggling]

117
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:42,965
Well. This is it. We've
reached our destination.

118
00:11:42,998 --> 00:11:44,965
Let's get started! Come
on!

119
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:55,398
Reveal yourself.

120
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:16,765
Who's out there?!

121
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:38,751
An urgent summons?

122
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:41,517
What could be going on at
this hour of the night?

123
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:44,717
What the...?

124
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,817
We're all being
summoned? Captain!

125
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:03,517
Yes, I received the
same urgent message.

126
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,584
What did we miss?

127
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,351
Captain Hitsugaya.

128
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:09,817
You have any idea
what's going on? Why
were we called here?

129
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:15,484
I'm not really sure. I've
asked, but it seems no one
else knew about this meeting
ahead of time.

130
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:17,684
And well...

131
00:13:17,717 --> 00:13:18,651
What is it?

132
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:20,651
Is that Rukia?

133
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,451
Huh?

134
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:24,017
You were summoned too?

135
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:27,951
Yes. I'm not sure
why, but I got the call
just like the others did.

136
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:30,751
Well, it's certainly
an interesting group.

137
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:33,917
Are the two of you
filling in for Captain
Zaraki?

138
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:37,417
We've never been the
captain's stand-ins
before. This is a
first.

139
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:42,284
Right, but at present
our captain and
lieutenant are actually
away. So if you order

140
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:45,117
us to stay and listen in,
we have no choice.

141
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:47,351
Oh yeah? Where'd they
run off to?

142
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:50,184
Not sure. It happens
all the time though.

143
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:55,251
None of you people
know why the Head Captain
sent for all of us at such
an unreasonable hour?

144
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:59,584
This sucks. And this
fog is a mess.

145
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:28,617
Ah, Lieutenant Sasakibe.
What's going on here?

146
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:30,651
And where is the Head
Captain?

147
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:36,684
Whoa! Captain?!

148
00:14:36,717 --> 00:14:38,817
Scan the area, and remain
alert.

149
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:43,884
He's in bad shape,
he's gone into cardiac
arrest.

150
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,551
Start resuscitation.

151
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,784
Yes, ma'am!

152
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:48,484
Hmph.

153
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:56,817
I'm afraid the Head
Captain won't be
joining us tonight.

154
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,751
And just who the hell are
you?

155
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:07,384
And how do you know the
Head Captain isn't
coming?

156
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,117
Captain!

157
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:13,451
We're waiting. What
did you do with Head
Captain Yamamoto?!

158
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:19,584
So, you refuse to answer?
Well in that case...

159
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:22,884
I'll just beat the
answer out of you!!

160
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:33,084
Well then. This just
got way more interesting.

161
00:15:33,117 --> 00:15:35,451
Shall we get involved,
Ikkaku?

162
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:38,651
Stay back! Can't you
see that my Captain is
fighting him!?

163
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:41,417
Keep out of this or the
two of you are gonna get
hurt.

164
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:45,551
Bankai! Kokujo Tengen
Myo-oh!

165
00:15:56,517 --> 00:16:00,417
We demand the Head
Captain! Tell us
where he is!

166
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,417
I should warn you, your
feeble attacks won't
touch me.

167
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:05,384
We'll see!

168
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:10,817
Behind you!

169
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,951
Captain, no!!

170
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:25,151
That strike! What
was that!?

171
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,484
A Zanpakuto attacked its
own master?! Impossible!

172
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:29,951
What the hell?

173
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:32,284
What the hell is
going on here?!

174
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:35,051
My, my. How intriguing.

175
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:52,017
Huh?!

176
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,717
Who... are you?

177
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:03,117
Tenken? But how?!

178
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:32,517
How... could
this... ugh.

179
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:36,317
Captain!

180
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:37,051
Hold on!

181
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:38,984
Let go of me,
Yumichika!

182
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:44,948
Reign over the frosted
heavens! Hyorinmaru!

183
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:49,182
Sting all enemies to
death! Suzumebachi!

184
00:17:54,982 --> 00:17:56,048
Captain!

185
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:59,915
Shikai doesn't
work!

186
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,115
You're right.

187
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,548
Now roar, Zabimaru!

188
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:10,682
Growl, Haineko! Huh?

189
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,015
Extend, Hozukimaru!

190
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:16,115
What's wrong with this
thing?!

191
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:18,715
There's no more
Spiritual Pressure in my
Zanpakuto!

192
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:20,548
Tobiume, what's
wrong?

193
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:22,048
Wabisuke?!

194
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:27,348
You're right. The
Spiritual Pressure is
indeed absent. The
question is why?

195
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:33,582
It's very simple. You
and your precious
Zanpakuto, are no
longer united as one.

196
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:38,215
I freed them. Released
them from the Soul
Reapers' control.

197
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:41,348
Freed our Zanpakuto?

198
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:42,848
Is that possible?

199
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,015
What's that?

200
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,215
What are you trying to
pull now you psycho?!

201
00:18:55,248 --> 00:19:00,882
Oh, that wasn't me. Your
own Zanpakuto are
responsible for this
destruction.

202
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:02,482
No!

203
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:07,348
I'm afraid it's true,
dear. They have all
been released from the
Soul Reapers' control!

204
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:12,582
[laughing]

205
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:17,548
What is that?!

206
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:19,715
<i>Put out the fire! Hurry!</i>

207
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:22,015
There's someone over
there!

208
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:22,915
Who is it?!

209
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:23,982
An intruder?!

210
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:27,915
[laughing]

211
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:37,715
What is it?!

212
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:42,682
Heh!! Too easy!

213
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:46,615
Must he be so barbaric?

214
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:47,982
Huh?

215
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:52,282
Good evening. If I were
you I'd start running.

216
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:57,982
I apologize, but I
don't have time to play
with all of you.

217
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:07,482
Don't even try. You
guys don't have a
prayer.

218
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:12,148
Hmm?

219
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:16,115
We've been summoned.
Come along.

220
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:17,815
Hmph.

221
00:20:26,282 --> 00:20:30,183
This was just a preview.
A small demonstration,

222
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:33,882
so you would begin to comprehend
the power of my comrades.

223
00:20:34,748 --> 00:20:38,344
And as for the Zanpakuto,
which you foolishly thought

224
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:42,944
you owned. Well, cast your
eyes on their true form!

225
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:54,182
Somehow the Zanpakuto
managed to manifest
themselves?!

226
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:57,482
That's insane!

227
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:03,948
Hmmm? Oh!

228
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:07,248
How is this possible?

229
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:10,715
This is nuts.

230
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:13,715
Out of the way!

231
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:15,215
How dare you!

232
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,815
Hm? Brother?

233
00:21:28,682 --> 00:21:31,782
Enough of this. Tell us
who you are.

234
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:36,448
I am known as
Muramasa.

235
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:42,415
And this night marks the
end of the Soul Reapers'
reign over the Zanpakuto.

236
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:44,982
From now on...

237
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:50,348
It'll be the Zanpakuto
who rule over the Soul
Reapers.

238
00:23:45,954 --> 00:23:47,921
Hey Ichigo, what's
bothering you?

239
00:23:47,954 --> 00:23:50,654
<i>I bet I don't get much</i>
<i>screen time in this new</i>
<i>story arc.</i>

240
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:52,754
Don't you get some
action in the next
episode?

241
00:23:52,788 --> 00:23:53,921
<i>I doubt it.</i>

242
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:55,721
Wow, you're pretty
negative.

243
00:23:55,754 --> 00:23:58,388
With that lousy attitude,
you won't get any screen
time.

244
00:23:58,421 --> 00:24:00,054
Damn it, you're right!
I'll stop complaining
now.
