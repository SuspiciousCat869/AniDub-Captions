NARRATOR: An investigation
was triggered

4
00:01:50,516 --> 00:01:52,983
when the Rukon district
residents started vanishing,

5
00:01:53,016 --> 00:01:55,516
leaving only their
clothing behind.

6
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,849
Squad Nine's Captain, Kensei
Muguruma, and his Lieutenant

7
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:01,749
Mashiro Kuna, were put in
charge of the operation.

8
00:02:01,783 --> 00:02:04,649
But when their spiritual
pressure disappeared,

9
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:08,883
it became a major case involving
the 13 Court Guard Squads.

10
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,883
When Shinji Hirako and his
allies arrived on the scene,

11
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,183
they were met by
Kensei and Mashiro.

12
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:16,483
Shockingly, the two
had somehow transformed

13
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:19,816
into powerful
Hollow-like beings.

14
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,483
A much different Kensei
launched an attack.

15
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:25,283
Shinji and the others
fought against him.

16
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:29,749
But then, all of a sudden,
Hiyori also transformed.

Kaname.

20
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,049
Tell me.

21
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,616
Why did you do that?

22
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:58,549
You betrayed him.

23
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,549
Your own captain.

24
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,849
AIZEN: He didn't betray him.

25
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:10,883
He's actually quite loyal.

26
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,049
As a matter of fact,
Kaname was just

27
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,116
loyally following my orders.

28
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:18,216
You, of all people,
can understand that.

29
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:22,749
So please don't hold it
against him Captain Hirako.

What's happening to me?

33
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:40,816
AIZEN: In the end, I hope
you'll remember one thing.

34
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:43,583
Any betrayal you
can see is trivial.

35
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:47,149
What is truly frightening,
and much more lethal,

36
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:48,816
is the betrayal you cannot see.

37
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:55,116
Good bye.

38
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:56,783
I must commend you.

00:03:56,816 --> 00:04:00,149
You people have provided
wonderful research material.

40
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:17,949
Well, unexpected guests.

41
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:19,616

-Kaname.

50
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,816
I think I made myself clear.

51
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:51,649
-Yes sir.

52
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:52,816
Please forgive me insolence.

Why'd you come here?

55
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:08,816
You're such an idiot.

56
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:13,149
Shinji, what is up
with that hideous mask?

57
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:16,083
-You don't know the half of it.

58
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:16,583
-Hm.

00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:31,816

-Yes.

-What have you done?

00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:35,583
-Nothing.

63
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,083
As you can see, I
happened upon the members

64
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:44,916
of the Soul Investigation Unit.

65
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,583
They seem to have been
injured in battle.

66
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:50,983
I was merely trying
to save their lives.

00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:51,716
-You bastard.

68
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:53,616
They'll never buy that.

69
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:59,283
-Tell me, why are
you lying to us?

70
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:00,616
-Lying?

71
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,916
Is there a problem with a
lieutenant helping his captain?

72
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:10,383
-No, but that's
not what I meant.

73
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,283
Injured in battle?

74
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:14,383
You call these injuries?

75
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,616
You're dancing around the truth.

76
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:20,649
This is Hollowfication.

00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:21,149
-Hm.

00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:28,583
First it's the vanishing souls.

like they've been erased.

it can only be one thing.

Actually, let's not beat
around the bush, shall we?

84
00:06:58,449 --> 00:06:59,716
We both know who's responsible.

-I see.

Your reputation
surely precedes you.

glad you came tonight.

fulfilled our objective.

But later.

112
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:58,683
First we need to treat
Captain Hirako and his group.

-Perhaps.

114

But with the Hollowfication
so far along,

115
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:05,916
we can't treat him here.

00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:08,916
-Captain Urahara, forgive me.

117
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,183
But it appears you know
more about this situation

118
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,549
than I thought.

119
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,416
I can tell by your familiarity
with the term Hollowfication.

120
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,383
If that is the
case, then I assume

121
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,816
you may also know how
to undo all of this.

122
00:09:31,349 --> 00:09:32,183
-Yes, I know.

123
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:37,283
But the technique is risky.

124
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:38,249
-I see.

125
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:40,416
Even so, it is
better than nothing.

126
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,716
We'll have to transport
all eight of them

00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:47,383
in their current condition.

128
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,316
We can take them to
Squad Twelve's barracks.

-Huh?

130

-With the facilities
at the barracks,

131
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:54,916
we'll have a chance
to save their lives.

132
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:57,949
-But in their current condition?

133
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:58,849
They can't move.

How can we?

135
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:03,316
-We will use time stop and
teleportation techniques.

-Yes, I am well aware.

139
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:10,516
Both of the techniques
are strictly forbidden.

140
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:12,983
Which is why I suggest
that you close your eyes

141
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:15,549
and stop listening for
the next few moments.

-Hollowfication is
one of the discoveries

147
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,449
I made while I was studying how
to strengthen a Soul Reaper's

soul.

149
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,349
In the process, I created

00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,949
That's what I'll use to
treat Shinji and the others.

153
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:41,383
-What is this
substance of yours?

154
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,649
-I call it Hyogoku.

-Hyogoku.

156
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:51,749
What is the sensation?

158
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:54,749
No.

159
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:56,083
It's different.

160
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,949
It's a presence.

The presence this
stone possesses

162
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:04,983
is somehow trying to
push me away from it.

What is this thing?

164

What has Captain
Urahara created?

And Captain Hirako and the rest.

166
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:19,716
This substance will
save their lives?

-If Lieutenant Aizen was really
behind the vanishing souls

considered the possibility

that a treatment for
Hollowfication might exist.

I am here to inform

You have been summoned
here for an inquest.

You will only speak in
response to questioning.

on the Captain of Squad 5.

As well as seven others in the

found much evidence

Kisuke Urahara,
Captain of Squad 12,

00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:18,850
for conducting research
on banned phenomenon,

242
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:22,350
and using such to cause injury
to follow squad members,

you are sentenced to
eternal banishment

be stripped of
all spirit energy.

who were the victims

If I know you, from the very
first moment Shinji told you

about this incident, you
imagined the worst case

better set up a double,
