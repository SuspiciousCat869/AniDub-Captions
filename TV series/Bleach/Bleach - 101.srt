[theme music]

2
00:00:15,566 --> 00:01:36,033
[theme music]

3
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:46,441
-Now it's Mabashi's spiritual
pressure that's disappeared.

4
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:49,974
It looks like the enemy is
putting up a good fight.

5
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:51,474
Why don't you come out?

6
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:53,641
Quit playing these
hide and seek games.

7
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:56,007
I much prefer
talking face to face.

8
00:01:59,174 --> 00:02:00,307
-Hmm.

9
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:03,407
So you knew I was
there, did you?

10
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:07,141
I tried to copy you and
hide my spiritual presence.

11
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:09,907
-Haha.

12
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:12,307
Even if you hid your
spiritual pressure,

13
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:15,241
there's no way to conceal
your lust for blood.

14
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:17,041
I can smell it in the air.

15
00:02:17,074 --> 00:02:18,574
-My apologies.

16
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:20,507
But it has nothing
to do with you.

17
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,907
I was looking for Ichinose.

18
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:25,341
You don't know
where he is, do you?

19
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:27,107
-It's hard to say.

20
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:28,241
Perhaps he's dead.

21
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,107
His spiritual pressure
disappeared quite a while ago,

22
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,941
so I assumed one of your
cohorts had done the deed.

23
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:37,407
-Ah, I was hoping to
have that honor myself.

24
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,474
But since I can't
have him, I suppose

25
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:41,407
I'll just make do with you.

26
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,007
You understand.

27
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,641
It's the price you have
to pay for humiliating me.

28
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:48,074
-If I must, I must.

29
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:51,574
But don't make the mistake
of underestimating me.

30
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:54,007
You might just be
in for a surprise,

31
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,941
because I have been given
a very specific job.

32
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,341
To send all the
captains to their grave.

33
00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:12,907
-Baura.

34
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:24,641
-Hmm.

35
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:25,874
Oh?

36
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:29,207
-Boss, is this
our next opponent?

37
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:30,974
-That's right.

38
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:33,874
But he's not like the small fry
you've been fighting lately.

39
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:37,207
This one is a captain of
the 13 Court Guard Squads.

40
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:38,607
-That's good.

41
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:42,307
Then perhaps I'll
have fun today.

42
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:46,041
-So I take it this fish thing
is the doll you control.

43
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:46,607
-Yes.

44
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:48,941
This is my doll, Baura.

45
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:51,607
-Haha.

46
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:54,174
-What is so funny?

47
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:56,074
-I beg your pardon.

48
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:58,374
I was just thinking that
you Bounts are certainly

49
00:03:58,407 --> 00:03:59,941
interesting.

50
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,174
I wonder how much you know.

51
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:06,241
Are you even aware of the
source of your powers?

52
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:08,541
They're derived from an
ancient technology that

53
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:11,874
was developed right here
in the Soul Society.

54
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:14,041
-And what does this have
to do with anything?

55
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:17,907
-It was a technology deemed
so dangerous at the time

56
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:21,074
that it was sealed away
after a single accident.

57
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:23,341
Such a wasted opportunity.

58
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:25,941
Even my department of
research and development

59
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,274
doesn't have any
compete data on it.

60
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:29,941
But here's a thought.

61
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:32,374
Now that I've met
you, it occurs to me.

62
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:34,574
How about volunteering
yourself to become

63
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,007
a subject for my research?

64
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,641
-Are you joking?

65
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:41,074
-To be honest, I never
thought about it before,

66
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:43,907
because I never found the
Bounts very interesting.

67
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:46,041
But lately, because of
the Bounts activities,

68
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:48,307
I've been looking at
a lot of the old data

69
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,207
and it's led me to
think about conducting

70
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:52,241
my own research on the subject.

71
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:56,074
Rest assured, I'll do my best to
make it as painless as possible

72
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:57,874
for you.

73
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:00,074
And I'll even overlook the fact
that you Bounts humiliated me

74
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:04,974
by using me to return that
young Quincy's power to him.

75
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:08,041
-Unfortunately,
I have to refuse.

76
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,241
-Huh?

77
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:12,207
-The ultimate goal of the
Bounts is the utter destruction

78
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:13,374
of the Seireitei.

79
00:05:13,407 --> 00:05:17,407
As such, I intend to remove
any who stand in our way.

80
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,407
Baura.

81
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:21,241
-Yes, Boss.

82
00:05:21,274 --> 00:05:22,174
-Oh well.

83
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:24,041
It was worth a try.

84
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:30,041
But in that case, I intent to
make you regret that decision.

85
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:32,474
-Strong spiritual pressure.

86
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:36,274
But in the end, it
still won't help you.

87
00:05:36,307 --> 00:05:38,541
-I have read several
reports on you.

88
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:43,074
And they said that
as a mole-type,

89
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:45,474
you can only reappear
from large surfaces,

90
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:47,441
such as the ground or walls.

91
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:49,341
Such tactics might
have worked against me

92
00:05:49,374 --> 00:05:51,241
in the world of the
living, but here it

93
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:54,074
makes you quite predictable.

94
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:55,941
Now, claw out.

95
00:05:55,974 --> 00:05:57,241
Ashisogi Jizo!

96
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:06,407
Well, bring it on then.

97
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,641
I'm right here.

98
00:06:08,674 --> 00:06:10,107
[deep yell]

99
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,941
-How can this be?

100
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:22,407
Damn it!

101
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:24,574
I never heard
about this ability.

102
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:26,074
[deep yell]

103
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:29,607
-But you're still
no match for me!

104
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:30,107
Huh?

105
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:37,041
-I've got you now!

106
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:40,007
[yelling]

107
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:53,407
-You barely escaped that.

108
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:55,207
-Shut up you.

109
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:57,341
-Your reports were incomplete.

110
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,574
You should have known that
since we Bounts came to the Soul

111
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:02,341
Society, we have been
absorbing large quantities

112
00:07:02,374 --> 00:07:08,174
of high quality Reishi, making
us all immeasurably stronger.

113
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:11,174
Baura is no longer limited to
only appearing in the ground

114
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:12,507
and in the walls.

115
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,007
Now the sky itself which
is filled with Reishi

116
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,541
is open to Baura's powers.

117
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:19,541
-So there is nowhere
for you to hide.

118
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:21,341
-Haha.

119
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,641
You call yourself a captain and
this is all you have to offer?

120
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:26,307
What a wretch you are.

121
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,574
-I can feel the Soul
Reaper captain's

122
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:33,374
elevated spiritual pressure.

123
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:36,607
Is someone fighting
a Bount somewhere?

124
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:39,374
When the Soul Reapers
turned on each other before,

125
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:40,941
that was the work
of the Bounts too.

126
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:47,307
Damn those cursed Bounts.

127
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:58,241
I only hope my powers hold up.

128
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,407
-Well, well.

129
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:11,874
You have the nerve to damage me.

130
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:14,007
-Hmm?

131
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,874
-You have certainly
proven to be an annoyance.

132
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:25,407
-Well, what an amusing body
you have there, captain.

133
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:26,374
-Shut your mouth.

134
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:29,141
I don't need any opinion
from my guinea pigs.

135
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:31,874
You're nothing but an
experiment gone wrong.

136
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:34,007
When I get through
dissecting you,

137
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,274
you won't be able
to talk at all!

138
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,174
-Baura!

139
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:38,907
-Yes, Boss.

140
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:41,374
[yelling]

141
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:45,974
-Don't think I'm going to
fall for that trick again.

142
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:52,374
[yelling]

143
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,007
-I would have brought
Nemu along if I'd

144
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,641
known it was going
to be this way.

145
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:58,407
She would have made an
excellent decoy for his attacks

146
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,007
and thus saved me
a lot of trouble.

147
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:03,974
Huh?

148
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,541
How interesting.

149
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:07,874
He always hides himself
in an alternate space

150
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:10,474
when he's transporting,
and then reappears right

151
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:14,107
before he attacks, engulfing
everything around him.

152
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:22,641
In that case, this
is the perfect spot.

153
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:28,974
Come on out now and die, Bount.

154
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:32,374
[explosion]

155
00:09:37,974 --> 00:09:41,441
-I can see you, Bount.

156
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:43,041
[groan]

157
00:09:43,074 --> 00:09:45,374
-I watched you long enough
to notice the pattern.

158
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:47,474
Every time you appeared
from an alternated space,

159
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:52,074
you have to swallow everything
that was in your way.

160
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:54,441
So I set off explosions
to release this matter

161
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:55,174
into the air.

162
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:57,041
Now with so much
floating debris,

163
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:59,107
I can see all of your movements.

164
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,107
-Release me.

165
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,407
-Haha.

166
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:02,607
Tear him apart.

167
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,507
Ashisogi Jizo!

168
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:10,174
It's over now.

169
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:11,174
[yelling]

170
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:13,607
-What?

171
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:15,041
[yelling]

172
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:21,874
-That was unexpected.

173
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:28,574
It appears I didn't
stab you deep enough.

174
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:30,874
-You are mad.

175
00:10:30,907 --> 00:10:32,174
-No matter.

176
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:33,374
From what I've
seen, it shouldn't

177
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:35,374
be that difficult to
finish you off later.

178
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:36,874
Oh, wait.

179
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:38,141
I can't finish you
off if I intend

180
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:39,874
to keep you for experiments.

181
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,641
I can come close,
but I have to keep

182
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,574
you at least partially alive.

183
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:44,974
-Haha.

184
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:46,607
How confident you are.

185
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:48,241
-Why shouldn't I be?

186
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:50,307
-So soon you've forgotten.

187
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:53,641
Everything in this world is made
of Reishi, and because of that,

188
00:10:53,674 --> 00:10:55,941
we Bounts are invincible here.

189
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:01,441
-This power again.

190
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:05,641
That Quincy had the same
ability to control Reishi.

191
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:08,641
-By absorbing high quality
Reishi in this way,

192
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:11,874
we Bounts are able to
quickly heal our wounds.

193
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:14,541
So as a result, it doesn't
matter how many times

194
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,274
you are able to
strike at me which

195
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:18,274
your attacks, because
sooner or later,

196
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:19,907
you will run out
of spirit energy

197
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:21,507
and end up lying on the ground.

198
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:21,941
Huh?

199
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,574
What is this?

200
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:24,541
I can't move my arm.

201
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:30,307
[yelling]

202
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,441
-Who's the one that's going
to end up lying on the ground?

203
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:34,207
[yelling]

204
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:37,174
-Ashisogi Jizo has a
nasty habit of paralyzing

205
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:39,207
the limbs of anyone it cuts.

206
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,174
Although I'm sure
you've noticed by now,

207
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:43,141
it leaves the pain
receptors and their signals

208
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:45,307
to the brain fully intact.

209
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:47,474
Movement is the only
element it takes away.

210
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,374
[yelling]

211
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:51,607
-Unlike in case of
normal paralysis,

212
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:54,474
the pain never does go away.

213
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,607
-Boss.

214
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:58,607
-You hold still.

215
00:11:58,641 --> 00:11:59,674
This is good.

216
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:02,907
Thanks to you, I now know
Ashisogi Jizo's power

217
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:04,974
is highly effective
against Bounts,

218
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:06,507
which means it doesn't
matter how well you

219
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,174
recover by absorbing Reishi.

220
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:10,107
I will still have
superior power.

221
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:11,474
[yelling]

222
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:14,507
-Isn't it rewarding to
have made a new discovery.

223
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,074
However, we'll have to
continue this study back

224
00:12:17,107 --> 00:12:19,941
at my research facility

225
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:21,374
-Baura.

226
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,941
-Boss.

227
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:25,441
-It is useless to keep trying.

228
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:26,407
-Do it.

229
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:28,374
-Yes, Boss.

230
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:30,007
[yelling]

231
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:30,507
-Huh?

232
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,107
What the?

233
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:49,562
-Hmm?

234
00:12:53,602 --> 00:12:55,269
He has vanished.

235
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:57,636
But Ashisogi Jizo's
paralyzing effect

236
00:12:57,669 --> 00:12:59,702
won't wear off no
matter how much distance

237
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:01,569
he puts between us.

238
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:04,369
You should know better than to
think you can ever get away.

239
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:11,636
-Boss.

240
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:13,236
Are you all right?

241
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:15,069
-Don't worry about me.

242
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:17,336
I just absorbed a
large amount of Reishi.

243
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:19,269
So these wounds will soon heal.

244
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,969
But the paralyzing
effect of his Zanpakutou

245
00:13:28,002 --> 00:13:30,036
has not lessened at all.

246
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:31,369
Damn that Soul Reaper.

247
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:35,069
I'm I can't afford
to end it here.

248
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:37,136
Baura, counter attack.

249
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:38,736
-Yes, Boss.

250
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:41,036
-I will kill you, Soul Reaper.

251
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,502
All right then.

252
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:52,502
We'll wait here.

253
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:55,136
It shouldn't take long
for him to come after me

254
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,402
once he senses my
spiritual pressure.

255
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,036
-In fact, I'm here already.

256
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:01,136
-Huh?

257
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:05,302
-What took you so long?

258
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:08,102
-How did you-- how'd
you get here so fast?

259
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:10,502
-Most disconcerting, isn't it?

260
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:13,302
I was going to finish
this all at once as soon

261
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:17,602
as you appeared, but as it
turns out, I'm glad I held back.

262
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:20,469
It's given me a chance to watch
and study you a little bit

263
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:21,402
longer.

264
00:14:21,436 --> 00:14:23,336
-But how did know
where I would appear?

265
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:24,469
-My, my.

266
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:26,269
Aren't we full of
questions today?

267
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:28,369
But I suppose there's
no harm in telling you

268
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:31,236
since you'll be
dead soon anyway.

269
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,202
I received a detailed
report concerning

270
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:35,602
your battle with the
lieutenant of Squad 10.

271
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:37,669
She mentioned that she
had been able to track you

272
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:41,402
during the fight by using
the Kakushitsuijaku.

273
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:44,336
Therefore, because I had
your spiritual pressure data,

274
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:46,469
I knew I too would
be able to find you,

275
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:49,036
even if you hid in
an alternate space.

276
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:52,402
And then, I learned that
the human, Ichigo Kurosaki,

277
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:55,169
had been chasing you
using a Mod-Soul, which

278
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:58,102
could sense Bounts
spiritual pressure.

279
00:14:58,136 --> 00:15:00,502
And so, I used
the same principle

280
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:03,436
and created this
tracking device.

281
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,636
-Incredible.

282
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:05,569
-Haha.

283
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:08,202
Isn't it though?

284
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,469
Of course, a device like
this is only as good

285
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:13,169
as the data one has
to input into it.

286
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:15,202
As a result, I can't
use it to discern

287
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:17,669
the locations of any
of the other Bounts.

288
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:20,069
Only your data
has been inputted.

289
00:15:20,102 --> 00:15:22,002
It was difficult
to get information

290
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:24,536
from the group that returned
from the world of the living.

291
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:27,036
It was only in our
last battle that I

292
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:29,002
was able to make the
final adjustments

293
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:32,402
to your spiritual
pressure record.

294
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:35,436
-Then you have been targeting
me from the very beginning.

295
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,502
-Did you think it was
just a coincidence

296
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,469
that you met me here
in the Seiretei as wide

297
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:41,269
as this place is?

298
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:44,436
By the way your body has aged
after absorbing so many souls,

299
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:47,336
I'd say you're the
perfect research subject.

300
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:50,202
-You're quite mad.

301
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:53,202
-Anyway, that's enough
talk for one day.

302
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:55,269
If you'll be so kind as to
accompany me to my research

303
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:56,636
lab now.

304
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:58,202
No doubt there is
a great deal more

305
00:15:58,236 --> 00:15:59,969
I can learn about
the Bounts once I

306
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,469
begin dissecting your body.

307
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:05,102
Running away is pointless.

308
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:07,269
Now that I have your
complete spiritual pressure

309
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:09,969
data recorded, you're
as good as mine.

310
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:15,136
[laughing]

311
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:16,636
-Is that what you
think, Soul Reaper?

312
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:18,236
You're the one who is mine.

313
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,202
-Huh?

314
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:20,302
-Baura!

315
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:22,036
-Yes Boss.

316
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,702
-What the?

317
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,269
-This is the combined
spirit energy

318
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:31,102
I've absorbed from all the Soul
Reapers who have attacked me up

319
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:33,169
to now.

320
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:43,169
[blasts]

321
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,169
-Huh?

322
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:48,436
[yelling]

323
00:16:48,469 --> 00:16:50,036
[explosion]

324
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,436
-What the hell?

325
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:55,169
Ah!

I didn't think it
could move this fast.

-Yes.

333
00:17:09,802 --> 00:17:11,402
It's a Bount!

334
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:14,302
Someone is battling with a
Bount and it's somewhere close!

00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,102
-Tell me.

336
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,069
-There!

337
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,036
Up there on that big tower!

Right.

-You disgusting Bount.

-I'm ready for your
tricks this time.

345
00:17:46,302 --> 00:17:48,969
I'm going to finish you off
before you can inject yourself

346
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,369
with that drug again.

347
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,269
Go get him Baura.

348
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:54,302
-Yes Boss.

349
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,002
-How annoying.

350
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:58,036
As a research subject,
you may be more trouble

351
00:17:58,069 --> 00:17:58,602
than you're worth.

352
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:01,236
So I'll make you pay!

-Konjiki Ashisogi Jizo!

356
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:16,602
Konjiki Ashisogi Jizo
creates a poison.

357
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:19,169
It uses my actual
blood and turns it

358
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:21,169
into a deadly mist,
which it then scatters.

359
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:23,102
There is no place to run.

00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:26,369
-A mist of poison.

Suck in that poison!

00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:30,736
-Yes, Boss.

365
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:40,436
-Baura, I'm going to temporarily
give you all my spirit energy.

00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:41,736
-All right.

367
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:44,502
I'm ready to suck
everything in, Boss.

00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:46,636
-Still trying to win?

369
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:48,469
I have been graciously
offering to keep

370
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,169
you alive as an experimental
subject, but I give up!

371
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:56,969
I shall take pleasure
in watching you die!

372
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,169
-No, this cannot be the end.

373
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:01,969
I refuse to go out this way.

374
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:04,002
I broke the laws of my tribe.

375
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:07,069
I devoured tens of
thousands of human souls.

376
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:10,536
I watched as my body aged
prematurely as a result.

377
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,569
Despite all of that,
I never stopped

378
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:14,636
trying to consume souls.

379
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:17,602
I did it to increase my power.

380
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:19,502
I did all these
things for the goal

381

of becoming the Bounts' leader.

have had the necessary ambition

to become the
Bounts' leader, you

403

was sadly lacking when
it came to the ability.

tell you everything.

no longer interested in you.

So.

-Help me!

00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,569
Oh no!

throughout his entire body.

Oh well.

415
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:20,236
It appears the whole thing
was a waste of my time.

416
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:24,136
And since I've used up all
the Hojiku-Zai I had with me.

417
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:26,736
I suppose I had better return
to the research development now.

There's nothing wrong with this.

This is the ancient
Quincy uniform.

Wearing this makes me a
part of a glorious history.

how fabulous it is?
