00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:50,562
NARRATOR: Ichigo
and his friends were

3
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:53,662
on the brink of being defeated
by the formidable Espadas when

4
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:55,895
the captains of the
13 Court Guard Squads

5
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:57,462
arrived in Hueco Mundo.

6
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:59,262
Under the orders of
Head Captain Yamamoto,

7
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:02,962
the captains quickly
challenged the Espadas.

8
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:05,795
Captain of Squad
11 Kenpachi Zaraki

9
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:09,195
came to the aid of Ichigo
and initiated a fierce battle

10
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:13,628
with Espada #5, Nnoitra Gilga.

11
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,862
After his eye patch
was cut off, Kenpachi

12
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:17,962
unleashed a massive
amount of spirit energy

13
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:21,362
that forced Nnoitra to
reveal his Resurreccion form

14
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:24,128
and fight back with
his six lethal arms.

15
00:02:24,162 --> 00:02:27,028
But no matter how seriously
Kenpachi was wounded,

16
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:31,095
he howled with laughter and
relished fighting his opponent.

17
00:02:31,128 --> 00:02:33,762
Nnoitra was enraged by
Kenpachi's behavior,

18
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:37,628
and attacked him
even more brutally.

19
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:39,928
Bleeding profusely
from his deep wounds,

20
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:44,028
Kenpachi found he was unable to
counter his opponent's attacks.

21
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:46,262
His situation was
becoming desperate.

22
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:47,995
Kenpachi realized
he would die soon

23
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:50,828
unless he could find a
weakness in Nnoitra's defense.

24
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:54,395
Suddenly his solution was clear.

25
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:59,795
With Nnoitra about to defeat
him, Kenpachi made his move.

26
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:03,962
-This has gone on too
long, hurry up and die!

27
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:09,562
-Kenpachi!

28
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:21,462
-Huh.

29
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:24,595
If we keep this
up, I think there

30
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:25,828
is a chance that I'll die.

31
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:31,328
-Oh, Kenny, no.

32
00:03:36,362 --> 00:03:37,828
-Oh well, then.

33
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:40,928
Guess I have no choice.

34
00:03:40,962 --> 00:03:44,895
It's been a while
since I've tried this.

35
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,095
Time for some kendo.

36
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,428
An important
lesson-- that a sword

37
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,495
becomes much more
powerful when it's

38
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:55,728
swung with both hands
instead of just one.

39
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,062
-Of course it does.

40
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:03,495
That should be
perfectly obvious!

41
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:13,695
-But you don't know
the half of it.

42
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:15,128
-(VOICEOVER) Is he giving up?

43
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:17,562
He's just standing there!

44
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:19,828
I am the strongest!

45
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:20,628
I am the strongest!

46
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:34,428
[gasp]

47
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:19,895
-(AFRAID) All right,
I surrender, you win!

48
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:20,895
Just don't kill me.

49
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:25,728
Guaagh!

50
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:32,928
-You have something
you want to say?

51
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:39,062
You think it's wrong for
me to kill my opponents,

52
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,862
especially since he's
a fellow Arrancar?

53
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:43,228
Oh, please.

54
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:46,362
I think the answer
should be obvious.

55
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:50,862
It's because we're both
Arrancars that I killed him.

56
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:52,262
Listen carefully.

57
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:55,828
If you intend to travel with
me, then remember something.

58
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:59,862
Taking pity on an enemy
won't save a comrade.

59
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:00,862
It's foolish.

60
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:10,128
-Now listen to me, Nnoitra.

61
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,195
I said I don't
want to fight you.

62
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:15,228
I just don't see
the reason for it.

63
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:16,328
It makes no sense to me.

64
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:24,495
-You may not see it,
but it's clear to me.

65
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:28,962
The fact is, fighting
itself is my purpose.

66
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:32,628
-That doesn't explain much.

67
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:36,162
Why are you so desperate
to engage in these fights?

68
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,795
-Because I want to die.

69
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:42,162
I want to die
gloriously in battle.

70
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:45,095
That's why I work so
hard to become strong.

71
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:48,928
If I'm strong, people will
come to me looking for a fight.

72
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:52,928
And when I'm fighting, that's
when I feel truly alive.

73
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:55,628
-You must be
addicted, obviously.

74
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:56,928
-You're right.

75
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:59,862
The strongest liquor is
nothing compared to a fight.

76
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:07,228
In our world, there's
no such as salvation.

77
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:09,495
And that's true whether
or not Aizen is here

78
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:12,795
to absolve us of our sins.

79
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:15,228
If I am grateful to him
for anything at all,

80
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:17,928
it's for making
me more powerful.

81
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:22,028
Because of him, I experience
more intense battles.

82
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:24,728
I am determined
to become strong.

83
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:28,595
Stronger than anyone else.

84
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:33,362
If I'm going to fight
the strongest foe,

85
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:36,195
there can't be anyone
else stronger than me.

86
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:41,062
I'm going to crush everyone with
whatever means at my disposal.

87
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:48,995
I want life to have fled my
body before it hits the ground.

88
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:53,828
That's how I want to die.

89
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:25,962
-Good fight, Nnoitra.

90
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:26,728
That was fun.

91
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:50,828
-Kenpachi.

92
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:04,228
Kenpachi--

93
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:05,195
[crash]

94
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:06,295
[gasps]

95
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:09,162
-What's the matter with
you, are you crazy?

96
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:09,662
Aaahh!

97
00:09:13,462 --> 00:09:16,495
Hey, I'm on your side!

98
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:18,495
-Your sword.

99
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:19,495
Pick it up.

100
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:31,162
Now that you've got it,
take the women and go home.

101
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,595
Your work here is done.

102
00:09:33,628 --> 00:09:36,028
It's time for us to take over.

103
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:37,162
-What are you saying?

104
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:38,895
I've come this far, I'm
going to see it through!

105
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:41,662
-What are you?

106
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:43,895
You're a substitute Soul Reaper.

107
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:47,162
Your job is to
protect Karakura Town.

108
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:50,062
Isn't that right?

109
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:51,828
You rescued this woman.

110
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:53,862
You should be satisfied.

111
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:57,028
So accept what I'm
saying and go home.

112
00:09:57,062 --> 00:09:59,528
You've had your share
of fighting, kid.

113
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:04,228
It's time to let the
professionals take over.

114
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:06,095
Woman!

115
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:07,428
-Yes, sir?

116
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:09,228
-Come and heal my wounds.

117
00:10:09,262 --> 00:10:10,195
-Uh, right!

118
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:18,628
[gasp]

119
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:20,528
-Sorry for this.

120
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:22,495
I don't enjoy these
kinds of assignments,

121
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:23,828
but I have my orders.

122
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,762
Need to borrow her for a bit.

123
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:36,228
-They're gone.

124
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:49,952
AIZEN: Welcome back, Orihime.

125
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:57,019
What's the matter?

126
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:59,586
I thought you'd be happy to see
us now that you're back again,

127
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:00,652
but you look so troubled.

128
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:07,486
You should try to smile.

129
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,286
Everyone gets so depressed
when the sun doesn't shine.

130
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:15,419
Smile and wait here a while.

131
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:27,552
That's all you need to do,
just until-- just until my men

132
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,852
and I finished
destroying Karakura town.

133
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:35,519
-You're going to
destroy Karakura Town?

134
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:36,186
-That's right.

135
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:46,952
I need to destroy Karakura
Town to create the Oken.

136
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:56,752
Kaname.

137
00:11:56,786 --> 00:11:57,619
-Yes?

138
00:11:57,652 --> 00:11:59,986
-The Tenteikura.

139
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:00,486
-Right.

140
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:15,652
Bakudo #77, Tenteikura.

141
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:32,252
AIZEN: Can you hear me,
my daring intruders?

142
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:33,586
-That awful voice--

143
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,352
-Aizen.

144
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:36,986
-They're using the Tenteikura.

145
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:43,452
AIZEN: I commend you
for coming this far

146
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:45,386
and defeating my Espadas.

147
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,519
As a reward, I will
tell you this much.

148
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:50,619
We are proceeding with
our plans to invade

149
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:51,819
the world of the living.

150
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:52,719
-What's that?!

151
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:54,052
-They're what?!

152
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:56,152
I thought they determined
that such an invasion was

153
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:59,652
impossible to carry out, unless
Orihime awakened the Hogyoku.

154
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:01,586
-Wait a minute,
where is Orihime?

155
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:04,886
AIZEN: Orihime Inoue is being
held in the fifth tower.

156
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,619
If you want to
effect her rescue,

157
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:10,686
feel free to come and get her.

158
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:13,952
She is no longer
of any use to me.

159
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:15,719
-What's that?

160
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:18,286
-She is no use?

161
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:21,719
AIZEN: Her powers
are indeed amazing.

162
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:24,519
Her ability to reject
all forms of phenomena

163
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:29,386
is beyond anything the human
race has ever demonstrated.

164
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:32,286
The leaders of the Soul
Society are not fools.

165
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:34,586
They have understood the
importance of that power

166
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:35,786
from the beginning.

167
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:38,252
That's why her capture
was a threat to them.

168
00:13:38,286 --> 00:13:40,619
It helps to explain
their response to her.

169
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:42,619
They were afraid.

170
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:44,519
They immediately
took steps to protect

171
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:48,819
not the world of the living,
but the Soul Society itself.

172
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:51,086
-With this new
information, we now

173
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:54,086
know that the Arrancars
are ready for battle.

174
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:57,186
All members of Captain
Hitsugaya's advanced troops

175
00:13:57,219 --> 00:14:02,252
are to return immediately
and defend the Soul Society.

176
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:04,986
AIZEN: Her very presence
caused them to mobilize.

177
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:07,852
She became the bait to
lure in the Soul Society's

178
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:11,419
potential new military
strength, the Ryoka, which

179
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:14,852
included the substitute
Soul Reaper and his friends.

180
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:16,719
-Damn it.

181
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:19,019
AIZEN: If you were wondering
about the fate of the four

182
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:23,186
captains who came to assist
the intruders, don't worry.

183
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:25,952
I was able to imprison
them here in Hueco Mundo.

184
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:40,652
--[gasp] The four Garganta that
we passed through in order

185
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:43,052
to get here have
all been sealed.

186
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,186
-Wait a minute, Mayuri.

187
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,919
Can't we open them
up from this side?

188
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:50,686
-I'm afraid it's impossible.

189
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,719
The trouble is there's
only one person who

190
00:14:52,752 --> 00:14:54,786
knows how the Garganta works.

191
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:57,886
And that, unfortunately,
is Kisuke Urahara.

192
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,819
If we can't contact him I'm
afraid opening them again is

193
00:15:01,852 --> 00:15:03,619
going to present
something of a problem,

194
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,819
' as much as I hate to admit it.

195
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:13,919
-The strength of the
13 Court Guard Squads

196
00:15:13,952 --> 00:15:16,519
is really quite simple
when you break it down.

197
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:18,886
The 13 captains all
possess enough power

198
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,152
to be able to stand as a
military force of their own.

199
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:25,052
But now, however, three
of them have defected.

200
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:27,519
And four of them are imprisoned.

201
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,619
If you do the
math, you could say

202
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:31,952
that the military power
of the Soul Society

203
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:33,819
has been cut in half.

204
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:35,052
It makes our job easy.

205
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:46,352
We will destroy Karakura
Town, create the Oken,

206
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:49,652
and overthrow the Soul Society.

207
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:52,452
AIZEN: When all of this is
done, I shall take each of you

208
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,052
on at my leisure.

209
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,219
-Karakura town, destroyed?!

210
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:01,186
-Hold on, Ichigo.

211
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:02,786
Where are you going?

212
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:05,786
What the hell do you think
you'll be able to accomplish?

213
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:08,019
-You have any
better suggestions?

214
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,052
Karakura Town is in real danger!

215
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:12,752
Do I just wait for
them to destroy it?

216
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:14,252
-Didn't I mentioned this?

217
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:17,652
The old man gave Kisuke
Urahara a set of orders.

218
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,886
He waited until he knew
the final battle was

219
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,052
coming in winter.

220
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:22,219
Then he acted.

221
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:24,186
The first order was
to the captains.

222
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:27,052
They were all assigned
to duty in Hueco Mundo.

223
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,686
Do you know what the
second order was?

224
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,719
It went to the rest
of the officers.

225
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:39,686
It was short and to the point.

226
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,786
Every officer of
captain level was

227
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:43,852
to prepare for battle
in Karakura Town.

228
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:57,789
-Do you know what
the second order was?

229
00:16:57,822 --> 00:17:00,455
It went to the rest
of the officers.

230
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:02,189
It was short and to the point.

231
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,289
Every officer of
captain level was

232
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:06,855
to prepare for battle
in Karakura Town.

233
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:38,355
-Wait a minute.

234
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:40,955
That means the 13 Court
Guard Squads are--

235
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:41,955
-Yes.

236
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:43,822
If my calculations
are correct, they

237
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,589
should have arrived by now.

238
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:46,422
-That's crazy.

239
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:48,455
They can't have a battle there.

240
00:17:48,489 --> 00:17:51,089
The power of all those
captains is too much.

241
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:53,522
What do you think will
happen to Karakura Town?

242
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:56,389
I'm telling you right
now, it'll be destroyed.

243
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:58,022
-Remember what I said.

244
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:00,755
Everyone should be
ready for battle.

245
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:04,089
That was his order.

246
00:18:04,122 --> 00:18:05,355
Think about it.

247
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:08,289
Just increasing the number
of captain level fighters

248
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:12,589
doesn't necessarily equate
to being ready for battle.

249
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:13,955
-He meant Tenkai Kecchu.

250
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:17,055
It means to reconstruct
Karakura Town in order

251
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:19,689
to make it possible
to fight there.

252
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:24,155
In order to do that, Kisuke
Urahara did something creative.

253
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:27,455
He constructed a device
called Tenkai Kecchu, which

254
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,789
connected four pillars to
form a giant Senkaimon.

255
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:33,655
He then placed the Tenkai
Kecchu around the four corners

256
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:35,255
of Karakura Town.

257
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,589
At the same time, he
asked my Department

258
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:40,322
of Research and Development
to do something incredible.

259
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:43,155
He asked us to construct
an elaborate replica

260
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:47,689
of the entire town, down
to the last dwelling.

261
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:51,489
He asked us to place it
near the Rukon District.

262
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:54,122
An incredible challenge,
but I have to humbly admit,

263
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:55,389
we pulled it off.

264
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:56,789
Here's the twist.

265
00:18:56,822 --> 00:18:58,822
Whatever Tenkai
Kecchu encircles can

266
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:01,489
be switched with something
inside the Soul Society.

267
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,589
By utilizing this
technique, we were

268
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:05,655
able to transfer
the real Karakura

269
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:08,922
Town from its present location
into the area surrounding

270
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,755
the Rukon District.

271
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,689
-Wait a minute, Captain.

272
00:19:12,722 --> 00:19:14,089
What about the residents?

273
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:17,722
-We put them to sleep, and then
transported them and the town

274
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:19,389
to the Soul Society.

275
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:20,789
MAYURI: What you
see out there now

276
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:24,255
is merely a replica of Karakura
town, completely devoid

277
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,955
of people.

278
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:28,589
Presuming the captains
do battle there,

279
00:19:28,622 --> 00:19:31,422
even if the town is destroyed
it won't matter a bit.

280
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,022
YAMAMOTO: Excellent.

281
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:46,489
It seems we made
it here in time.

282
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:49,222
-Made it in time.

283
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,555
Now, why would you think
to say something like that?

284
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:56,322
I'm well aware that
what lies beneath you

285
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:58,855
is not Karakura Town.

286
00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:04,355
This may come as a surprise,
but that means nothing to me.

287
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:07,889
Starrk, Barragan,
Halibel, come here.

288
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:43,189
If Karakura Town is now
inside the Soul Society,

289
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:47,355
we'll just kill you right
here and create the Oken

290
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:49,289
within the Soul Society.

291
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:50,789
It is that simple.

292
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:59,489
Until then, I shall
leave Las Noches

293

And that job was to
protect Karakura Town.

300
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:44,822
You were wrong.

301
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:46,789
I know what my job is.

00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:48,289
