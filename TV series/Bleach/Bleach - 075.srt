You know, you don't have to

You want me to hurry
up and finish the job.

But it's not good to rush
these things, don't you agree?

to harm the Quincy.

what I like with the woman?

you to be protecting me.

-What?

-It's just that I decided
not to run away anymore.

00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:56,061
I don't want to be
a burden to others.

And I don't want to be a victim.

-Oh, what a wonderful,
sentimental thing to say.

82
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:03,627
Such a manly attitude you have.

Ha!

want to hug you. [laughs]

There were two
Bounts here recently.

-I believe you.

But can't you try harder to
keep yourself out of sight?

90
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,794
-Oh, so now you're going
to insult my looks, too?

00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:27,161
-[sigh] It's not that.

92
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:29,061
I'm just afraid
people will notice

93
00:07:29,094 --> 00:07:31,794
four strange stuffed
animals walking around.

94
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,794
-Oh, so no I'm strange, am I?

95
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:35,694
Well, listen here, Mr. Perfect.

96
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:38,694
[sigh] None of us chose the
appearance of these animals.

97
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:39,994
But this is what we got.

98
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,327
And we all just have
to deal with it, OK?

99
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,361
-All right, all right.

100
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:44,627
I get it.

101
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:46,027
-[gasp] It's here!

102
00:07:48,994 --> 00:07:51,294
Up there!

103
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:52,627
KON: Aha.

104
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:53,761
Definitely suspicious.

105
00:07:58,027 --> 00:07:59,894
-Traces of his
spiritual pressure.

106
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:00,694
-[gasp]

107
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:02,027
-I feel it.

108
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:02,561
ICHIGO: Uryu!

109
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:13,494
-Uryu.

110
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:17,527
-No doubt, he was brought
here by someone not long ago.

111
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:20,261
-And the fire must
be from that woman.

112
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:23,194
-But the other one is
someone we don't know.

113
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:24,427
-Hm.

114
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:26,294
-It looks like they had
quite a battle, and probably

115
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:27,427
over the Quincy.

116
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:28,494
-I would agree.

117
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:30,827
That's the most likely scenario.

118
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,327
-So then both sides were
trying to take you Uryu.

119
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:34,094
-Hm?

120
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,294
Tug of war?

121
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,427
Wait a minute!

122
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:39,294
Uryu Ishida can't play
the role of a princess.

123
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:40,527
Ah!

124
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,294
So wrong.

125
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:45,061
But he did look
good in the dress.

126
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:45,861
Hm?

127
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:46,394
Ah!

128
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:47,761
I'm on fire!

129
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,661
My head's engulfed in flames!

130
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:50,627
Oh!

131
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:51,594
Oh!

132
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:53,927
Oh, I'm a hot head.

133
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:57,094
-Noba, I didn't know you
could suck in fire like that?

134
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:58,927
-It didn't burn you?

135
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:00,294
-It's not a problem.

136
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:00,927
CHAD: Ichigo.

137
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,361
-Huh?

138
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:06,261
-It's Uryu's bandage.

139
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:07,094
-Hm.

140
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:08,861
Can we track his spirit ribbon.

141
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:10,194
RUKIA: I don't think so.

142
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:12,527
His spiritual
pressure is very weak,

143
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:15,061
and he's suppressing it
in order to stay hidden.

144
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:16,494
-That's just great.

145
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:18,427
He's not even going to
let his own friends know

146
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:19,894
if the Bounts have caught him.

147
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,627
NOBA: It's all right, Ichigo.

148
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,761
-Huh?

149
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:24,161
KURODO: There's still
a way we can track him.

150
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:27,694
-There's a good chance that we
can follow the Bounts' Reishi

151
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:28,361
residue.

152
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:29,594
-Wait, are you sure?

153
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:30,294
-Yeah.

154
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:32,094
But it is frustrating.

155
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:35,794
My powers would be stronger
if I were in a Gigai.

156
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:38,294
Unfortunately, the real
bodies of us Mod-Souls

157
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,961
are just little pills.

158
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:43,127
We can't walk or even speak,
unless someone helps us

159
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:46,961
by putting us into a Gigai.

160
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:49,127
-Hm.

161
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:51,827
You know what, there's something
that I've always wondered

162
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:52,894
about.

163
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,561
If you need someone
else, why don't you

164
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,461
all just put each
other into Gigais?

165
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:58,461
-Uh.

166
00:09:58,494 --> 00:09:59,427
-Uh.

167
00:09:59,461 --> 00:09:59,927
-Hm.

168
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,194
-Big deal.

169
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:18,227
I didn't need him to come
up with this idea, you know.

170
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:19,527
I always knew.

171
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:20,927
I just pretended I didn't know.

172
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:23,327
-I'm not ashamed to admit that
I never thought of it before.

173
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,327
How amazing, though.

174
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:25,994
Talk about failing
to see that which

175
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:27,594
is right there in
front of your face.

176
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:33,027
-Well, I was acting
dumb on purpose,

177
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:34,161
as anyone can plainly see.

178
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:36,327
Otherwise, I would have
suggested the same thing

179
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,161
anytime.

180
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:39,227
Now, let's go find those Bounts.

181
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:40,661
KURODO: Absolutely!

182
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:41,227
-Hey!

183
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,061
What about me?

184
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:44,261
I'm still a stuffed animal!

185
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:45,261
Wait!

186
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:47,427
How am I supposed
to keep up with you?

187
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:47,927
Wah!

188
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:56,544
RANGIKU: Squad 10.

189
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:59,344
Captain Hitsugaya and
Lieutenant Matsumoto reporting.

190
00:10:59,378 --> 00:11:00,711
YACHIRU: Squad 11.

191
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:05,311
Captain Zaraki and Lieutenant
Kusajishi reporting as well.

192
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:07,478
KUROTSUCHI: Come in.

193
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:10,278
-So sorry to keep you waiting!

194
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:13,478
-I have no interest in
your sniveling apologies.

195
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:16,344
If you were members of my
squad, I'd turn all of you

196
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:19,878
into dog food for
this insubordination.

197
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:22,478
RANGIKU: Captain Ukitake,
why have you summoned us?

198
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:25,078
-The one who wanted to
talk to everyone was me.

199
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:25,911
-Huh?

200
00:11:25,944 --> 00:11:26,978
UKITAKE: Thank you for coming.

201
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:28,611
Something like this
would ordinarily

202
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:30,711
have been handled by
General Captain Yamamoto,

203
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:31,778
but he's away.

204
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:34,911
[clears throat] We
have an urgent security

205
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,444
matter to discuss with you.

206
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,544
Captain Kurotsuchi
has the details.

207
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:39,244
-Wrong.

208
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:40,444
There are no details.

209
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:42,611
My data bank has
been compromised.

210
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:44,411
Someone has been
breaking in and reading

211
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:46,844
highly classified information.

212
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:47,811
-Information?

213
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:50,244
On what?

214
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:52,044
-Well, now.

215
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,478
Would you believe on Bounts?

216
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:56,444
[gasping]

217
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,211
KUROTSUCHI: Furthermore,
the intruder

218
00:12:01,244 --> 00:12:04,178
left behind a booby trap
buried deep in the data bank,

219
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:07,378
one that will destroy all
the data if it's disturbed.

220
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:10,478
Do any of you have the faintest
idea what all this means?

221
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:11,678
Do you?

222
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:14,011
This is a challenge
and great insult to me,

223
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:16,278
captain of Squad 12,
head of the Department

224
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:17,878
of Research and Development.

225
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,811
And I will not stand for it!

226
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:22,178
If someone in this
room is involved

227
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:25,111
in this insidious
plot, come forward now.

228
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,378
Confess!

229
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:30,778
I will pickle you limb by
limb in a vat of hot acid!

230
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:33,578
-Don't go looking for
a fight, Kurotsuchi.

231
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:36,911
All those here are high-ranking
officers of the 13 Court Guard

232
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:38,278
Squads.

233
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:40,944
-You have a short memory for
current events, it would seem.

234
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:43,811
Was it not a high-ranking
officer who betrayed us?

235
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:49,344
UKITAKE: I'm just
saying that this

236
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:51,444
is a dangerous
problem which involves

237
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,378
all of the Soul Society.

238
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:55,444
We should avoid acting rashly.

239
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:56,411
KUROTSUCHI: Hmph.

240
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:58,478
Some good you are.

241
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,611
Very well.

242
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:02,244
But if I find out one
of you are behind this,

243
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:05,811
I suggest you beware,
because I have a plan.

244
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:13,511
KENPACHI: [groan] I have a
bad feeling about all this.

245
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,011
-Hm?

246
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,011
About what?

247
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:20,078
-This Kurotsuchi thing, and
the fact we found Ichinose.

248
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:20,811
-Huh?

249
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:22,844
But why?

250
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,744
-I'm not sure.

251
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:26,311
-Hm.

252
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:30,544
Sounds to me like you're
worried about Maki after all.

253
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:33,911
KENPACHI: No, it's not that.

254
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:36,711
Something's wrong, somehow.

255
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:44,878
ORIHIME: I think I've got it!

256
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,944
There's a mansion
just a mile from there

257
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:48,011
that fits the description.

258
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,411
-Oh, yeah?

259
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:51,911
ORIHIME: They say the man who
lives there is incredibly rich.

260
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:57,678
But no one I asked has
ever actually seen him.

261
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:58,178
-Hm.

262
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:05,611
-[groans]

263
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,244
-Kariya has forgiven
your insubordination

264
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:09,178
for the last time.

265
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:15,411
And if you don't believe me,
you can go and ask him yourself.

266
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:19,111
That is, if you can manage
to get out of this room.

267
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:20,311
Hm.

268
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:22,644
It seems that you can't
even get up off the floor.

269
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:25,678
-[groans]

270
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:28,244
-I hope you know better
than to try anything stupid,

271
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:30,844
like using your doll
in that condition.

272
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:33,211
It would just be
the death of you.

273
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:42,711
-So this is it.

274
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:44,044
-What a huge yard.

275
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:46,411
Can't even see the house.

276
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:48,411
-There's no mistaking it.

277
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:50,311
-The Quincy's in there.

278
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:51,111
-OK.

279
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:52,178
Now, let's split up.

280
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:58,711
[knocking]

281
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:00,011
-Come in.

282
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:01,911
-Excuse me, sir.

283
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,611
Would you like to
see the Quincy?

284
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:06,844
-Koga is the one
who brought him in?

285
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:07,844
-Yes.

286
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:10,044
We're holding him
in the main foyer.

287
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:12,611
-The Quincy is the
joker in the deck.

288
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:13,978
I say it's time we meet.

289
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:29,078
UTAGAWA: Shall I put
the plan into motion?

290
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,544
KARIYA: No.

291
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:32,811
-Why are you holding back?

292
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:35,144
I don't understand.

293
00:15:35,178 --> 00:15:40,511
KARIYA: We have lived for a long
time, a very long time, which

294
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:45,511
coats all of our memories
in shades of gray.

295
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:49,944
For the first time, I am able
to see the world in color again.

296
00:15:49,978 --> 00:15:54,544
Is it so wrong for me to want
to enjoy this a little longer?

297
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,278
-I understand, sir.

298
00:15:56,311 --> 00:15:56,811
But still--

299
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:58,411
-Silence!

300
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:00,978
No, Utagawa, you
don't understand.

301
00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:11,444
-Are you ready?

302
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:11,944
-[gasp]

303
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:12,778
-What is it?

304
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:14,244
What's Wrong?

305
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:16,278
-The Bounts' spiritual pressure.

306
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:17,711
Now that we're
here this close, I

307
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:21,644
can tell that there are a lot of
them inside that house-- seven,

308
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:25,078
eight, or nine.

309
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:26,011
Maybe more.

310
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:27,244
-There are that many?

311
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,878
But we don't have
any idea what they're

312
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:31,244
up to, so we have to act.

313
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:31,744
Let's go.

314
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:45,211
-What's wrong?

315
00:16:45,244 --> 00:16:46,111
Afraid?

316
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:49,611
[laughs] [gasp]

317
00:17:04,644 --> 00:17:07,544
-So, you're Uryu Ishida.

318
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:12,211
[laughs] I can't blame
you for being suspicious.

319
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:15,878
We haven't given you
a very warm welcome.

320
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,478
-Who exactly are you?

321
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:19,011
-I'm Kariya.

322
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:20,811
And I've had you
brought here because I'm

323
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:23,078
interested in borrowing
your Quincy powers.

324
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,578
-In order to gain the
power of Wekomundo?

325
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:32,611
-[gasp] We're a lot
alike, you and I.

326
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:36,144
We've suffered rejection
because of our unique abilities.

327
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:39,011
I know the pain you've endured.

328
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:39,678
-Abilities?

329
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:40,978
-That's right.

330
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:43,578
And I have a proposition--
that you and I live together

331
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:48,344
symbiotically, rather
than as mortal enemies.

332
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:51,911
Bounts will be able to protect
you from any other enemies.

333
00:17:51,944 --> 00:17:54,444
And there is also a
good chance we will even

334
00:17:54,478 --> 00:17:57,278
be able to revive your
lost Quincy powers.

335
00:17:57,311 --> 00:17:59,611
-[gasp]

336
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:02,711
-Not a bad proposition, eh?

337
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:06,778
-But if you already know I don't
have any powers, then why--

338
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:08,444
-I told you that already.

339
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,578
We're the same, you and I.

340
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:12,911
-I see no reason to trust you.

341
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:17,244
-[sigh] I understand
your suspicions.

342
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:19,978
Besides, we have all
the time in the world.

343
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:23,678
Give him time.

344
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:26,044
I'm sure he'll come around.

345
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:27,044
Believe me.

346
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:41,178
Please, make yourself
at home here.

347
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:44,478
-So I'm your captive?

348
00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:46,311
-Let's say you an
important guest.

349
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:53,344
-Dalk, you can release him.

350
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:54,378
-Oh, too bad.

351
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,278
-Not bad, I guess, as
far as prison cells go.

352
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:06,544
-Kariya is a kind person,
but very dangerous, too.

353
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,344
You should consider
it a warning.

354
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:11,778
-Thank you so much.

355
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:12,878
-You'll soon learn.

356
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:18,078
-Huh?

357
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:20,444
We headed toward the
mansion, but now I

358
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:21,678
don't even know where we are.

359
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:22,178
-Hm.

360
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:23,178
-Huh?

361
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:26,944
Oh, I don't know
which way to go.

362
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:28,711
Since we got hear,
it seems like I've

363
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:30,578
lost my sense of direction.

364
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:33,711
-Yeah, me too.

365
00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:35,144
-Hey, hold on!

366
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:36,611
Oh.

367
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:38,044
Wait for me!

368
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:44,544
-Damn it.

369
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:45,911
Another wrong turn.

370
00:19:45,944 --> 00:19:48,611
-This house has too
many doors and hallways.

371
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:50,711
-That's the only reason
we're disoriented.

372
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:51,678
-What?

373
00:19:51,711 --> 00:19:55,444
-Something is messing
up our senses--

374
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:59,911
maybe a strong magnetic
force, or-- [gasp].

375
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:01,844
It sees us.

376
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:02,844
-What is it?

377
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:10,011
[gasping]

378
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:12,678
-Bastard.

379
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,478
RUKIA: [inaudible].

380
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:21,111
-What the hell was that?

381
00:20:21,144 --> 00:20:23,111
-I don't know, but it's
definitely trouble.

382
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:24,044
-Huh?

383
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:24,544
-Hm?

384
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:28,878
-Oh, no.

385
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:31,478
[whimper]

386
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:32,611
-Let's try to outrun them!

387
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:33,111
-Right.

388
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:39,178
ICHIGO: Oh, no.

389
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:50,444
Could this possibly
get any worse?

390
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:51,611
Ririn!

391
00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:52,578
-Ichigo!

392
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:53,078
-Hm?

393
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:54,344
What?

394
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,744
Are those things following
you what I think they are?

395
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:58,378
-Noba, can you
erase these things?

396
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:03,311
ICHIGO: You saved us.

397
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:05,211
RUKIA: But what are
you doing up here?

398
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:06,678
-We had to escape outside.

399
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:09,144
Everywhere we went
in the house, we

400
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:11,211
ran into those
flying eyeball dolls!

401
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:12,644
-They gave us no choice.

402
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:14,378
Noba erased as many
as he could, but it

403
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:15,944
began to seem as if
they would never stop.

404
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:17,878
They were coming out of
the woodwork everywhere

405
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:18,944
we turned in there.

406
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,678
-And now it seems
they're outside as well.

407
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:23,544
-I'm tired.

408
00:21:23,578 --> 00:21:24,744
-Huh?

409
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:26,178
-And it doesn't look like
they're about to give us

410
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:27,478
a break, either. ,

411
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:30,978
KURODO: Oh, no!

412
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:34,111
[grunting]

413
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:35,078
-Let's go!

414
00:21:47,144 --> 00:21:48,644
Where are we?

415
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:51,544
KURODO: I don't know, but
that's an amazing tapestry.

416
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:54,578
And it would appear to
depict a witch hunt.

417
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:55,778
KARIYA: You are correct.

418
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:56,644
[gasping]

419
00:21:56,678 --> 00:21:58,478
-Who said that?

420
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:02,378
[laughter]

421
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:14,611
[gasping]

422
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:20,278
-Welcome to our mansion.

423
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:23,211
[gasping]

424
00:22:23,244 --> 00:22:24,511
-Substitute Soul Reaper.

425
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,781
[music playing]

426
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,909
ICHIGO: Ririn, where
did you hide your Gigai?

427
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:11,076
RIRIN: Under your bed.

428
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:11,843
ICHIGO: What?

429
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:13,809
What if someone found it?

430
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,443
RIRIN: [giggle]
Oh, it's all right.

431
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:17,109
I hid it along with
a doll, set to make

432
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:19,209
it look as if it was a
secret hobby of yours.

433
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:20,876
ICHIGO: What if
someone found it?

434
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:23,409
RIRIN: A secret hobby.

435
00:24:23,443 --> 00:24:27,309
[music playing]

436
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:35,109
KON: It must be the
guide to soul reapers.

437
00:24:35,143 --> 00:24:36,843
ALL: Golden!

438
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,809
TETSUZAEMON (VOICEOVER):
I must endure this.

439
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:41,243
I must not show my pain.

440
00:24:41,276 --> 00:24:42,276
TETSUZAEMON: Where is it?

441
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:45,143
Tell me where it is, somebody!

442
00:24:45,176 --> 00:24:47,109
-Is something the matter
with you, Tetsuzaemon?

443
00:24:47,143 --> 00:24:48,209
-No, Captain.

444
00:24:48,243 --> 00:24:49,209
It's nothing.

445
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:50,709
I just have a bit
of a stomach ache.

446
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:52,609
-The, bathroom is
right there, you know.

447
00:24:52,643 --> 00:24:53,276
-Thank you, sir.

448
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:56,009
Excuse me.

449
00:24:56,043 --> 00:24:58,709
Huh?

450
00:24:58,743 --> 00:24:59,743
RIRIN: Captain?

451
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:00,409
Gah!

452
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:01,743
Oh.

453
00:25:01,776 --> 00:25:03,643
CAPTAIN: Hey,
what's the problem?
