URYU (OFFSCREEN):
When are you going

3
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,520
to stop and get
some sleep, Orihime?

4
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:41,571
You need to rest.

5
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:42,371
-I will.

6
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:43,704
Just a little while longer.

7
00:01:46,937 --> 00:01:48,337
-So is Tsubaki recovering?

8
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,504
-Not yet.

9
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:58,437
I'm afraid it's
worse than I thought.

10
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:00,404
Tsubaki!

11
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:01,804
Not this time!

12
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:03,737
Koten Zanshun, I reject!

13
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:10,137
Tsubaki!

14
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,304
-You stupid girl!

15
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:16,071
What were you thinking,
hesitating like that?

16
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:18,337
-Tsubaki, no!

17
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,204
I guess my will
wasn't strong enough.

18
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:25,537
-It's OK.

19
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:26,871
Don't worry, Orihime.

20
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:29,871
It just requires a certain
knack to heal one of our own.

21
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:31,804
But it'll be all right.

22
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:38,337
-I'm sorry.

23
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:43,237
-Don't look so sad, Orihime.

24
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:45,404
You still have your
shielding and healing powers.

25
00:02:45,437 --> 00:02:47,104
Don't forget that.

26
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:48,004
-That's correct.

27
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:49,137
And not only that.

28
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,104
You need to stay strong,
because any doubt that

29
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,637
resides in your heart has
a direct negative influence

30
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:55,104
on our powers as well.

31
00:02:55,137 --> 00:02:56,404
-Oh, but I--

32
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:58,504
-We just need to practice
more, and pretty soon you'll

33
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:01,437
be able to skip saying the
whole kotodama spirit chant

34
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:04,271
and just summon each of us
by using the attack names.

35
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:05,704
-If you can learn
to do that, we'll

36
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:09,737
all be better able to protect
you by reacting much quicker.

37
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:11,171
-Oh-- OK.

38
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:19,504
What is it?

39
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:20,804
-Just you wait.

40
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:24,737
I'll be well again in no time.

41
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,237
-OK.

URYU (VOICEOVER):
Orihime loosing

47
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:51,671
her attack powers may actually
turn out to be a good thing.

48
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:53,871
Having spent these
last few days with her,

49
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:57,271
I've learned that she's
really not suited for combat.

50
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:00,504
He just doesn't have it
in her to hurt anybody,

51
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:02,571
even if it's the enemy.

52
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:05,037
People like her shouldn't fight.

53
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:09,304
Battles aren't good for
her or her little friends,

54
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:10,771
and her allies, too.

55
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:15,537
MAKIZO (OFFSCREEN): Hey!

56
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:16,571
Hold it there, you two!

57
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:22,937
Just let me get a look at you.

58
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,871
What are you doing in this area?

59
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:29,737
What squad are you with, anyway?

60
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,004
-Well, we're--

61
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,504
-We're with Squad 11.

62
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:33,771
-Hmm?

63
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:35,404
Well, what do you know?

64
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:37,204
I'm in Squad 11, too.

65
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:40,204
But here all this time,
I never had any idea

66
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:43,137
that in a squad that
specializes in combat,

67
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:45,771
we had moron's stupid
enough to walk around

68
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:47,137
without carrying Zanpakuto!

URYU (VOICEOVER): That's
what I was afraid of.

70
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:50,837
Each squad has distinct
characteristics.

71
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:55,671
-Hmm?

72
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:58,571
Hey, this is Squad 12's emblem.

It's the least we could do for
our fellow Squad 12 members.

bullies are always

looking for any excuse they can
find to give us a hard time.

Forgetting your sword

Something's not right here.

100
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:53,837
Why would these guys go out
of their way to help us?

101
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:56,337
Even though the big guy was
drunk, his suspicions about us

102
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,137
were perfectly logical.

103
00:05:58,171 --> 00:05:59,737
Our clothes don't
match our story,

104
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:03,904
yet these four weren't
suspicious at all.

-Captain, this isn't what
you said was going to happen!

109
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:23,471
You said-- you said we were
just supposed to talk to them!

110
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:25,804
You told us to bring them
back to the barracks!

-Oh, no, no.

112
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:28,804
Once the bombs
have been released,

113
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:32,271
they are not ever
supposed to return.

116
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:42,771
-Thank you, Uryu.

117
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:45,071
I didn't see that coming at all.

118
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,471
If you hadn't warned me--

119
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:48,904
-Don't thank me.

120
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:51,071
We survived because you
were able to summon them

121
00:06:51,104 --> 00:06:53,337
without calling
their names, Orihime.

122
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:57,137
-What about the
four that helped us?

123
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:58,937
-I'm sorry, but
they didn't make it.

124
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:05,671
But that's not something
you should feel any guilt

125
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:07,637
or responsibility for, Orihime.

126
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:19,671
The one who bears that
responsibility is right there!

127
00:07:19,704 --> 00:07:23,537
-Oh, I have not seen
this technique before.

128
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:26,737
This shield of yours, it's the
work of the girl behind you,

129
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:27,837
I assume.

130
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:29,837
-I've not about to answer that.

131
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,437
-How interesting.

132
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:35,004
There may be something
I can learn from you.

133
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,204
I'll make you an offer, woman.

134
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:40,237
Why don't you come work for
me as my research subject?

135
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:41,771
-That's ridiculous.

136
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:44,404
I told you already we
have nothing to say you!

137
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:45,871
-You needn't worry.

138
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:48,971
Rest assured, I take
good care of my subjects,

139
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:53,104
and I'm always very
"gentle" with the ladies.

Girl's crying.

00:07:58,337 --> 00:07:59,671
But why?

143
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:02,104
Could she be crying out of fear?

144
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:03,371
No.

145
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:04,637
ORIHIME (VOICEOVER): Look out!

146
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,704
MAKIZO (VOICEOVER):
If it was fear,

147
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:07,271
then she wouldn't
have risked her life

148
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:08,571
to save me from the explosion.

149
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,504
What is it, then?

150
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:12,937
Is she crying for the
four who just died?

151
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:15,204
And why did she save
me in the first place?

152
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:17,204
I'm the enemy, after all.

153
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,637
Why show me any mercy?

154
00:08:18,671 --> 00:08:21,904
I don't get it.

155
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:24,771
I just don't get it.

156
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,437
-So, then, how about
if I guarantee you

157
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:29,704
my best working
conditions, woman?

158
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:32,937
I'll limit experimental drug
therapies to eight times a day

159
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,304
and mechanical experimentations
to five hours a day.

160
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:38,871
I'll even do my
utmost to refrain

161
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:42,237
from performing surgeries
which may be life-threatening.

162
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,604
How about it?

163
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:46,604
Rather generous terms for a
mere experimental subject,

164
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:47,771
wouldn't you agree?

[quincy bow sound]

166
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:51,537
-Hmm?

167
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:54,304
KUROTSUCHI (VOICEOVER):
He's first.

168
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:57,171
Well, a Quincy, eh?

169
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,304
Such a rarity these days.

170
00:08:59,337 --> 00:09:02,637
In fact, it's been years since
I've seen a live specimen.

171
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,204
But I'm sorry to disappoint you.

172
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:08,137
I long ago finished researching
your pathetic species.

173
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:10,971
I'm no longer interested
in dealing with your kind,

174
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:13,704
so just get out of my way.

175
00:09:13,737 --> 00:09:15,404
-Finished researching?

176
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:16,637
What do you mean by that?

177
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:18,704
Just who the hell are you?

178
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:20,004
-You don't know?

179
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:22,671
What do you Ryoka do, just
storm into the enemy's base

180
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:25,871
without doing any research into
who it is you're attacking?

181
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:28,137
How very careless of you.

182
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:30,571
I would think you would
at least commit to memory

183
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:33,537
the names of the 13 Captains!

184
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:37,271
I'm the Captain of Squad 12, as
well as the second generation

185
00:09:37,304 --> 00:09:42,671
Chief of Research and
Development, Mayuri Kurotsuchi!

186
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:45,671
You don't need to remember
that, though, because soon

187
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:49,404
you will no longer
know anything.

188
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:53,971
-[inaudible] Orihime!

189
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:55,404
Run, get out of here.

190
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:55,937
-No!

191
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:56,771
I'm staying!

192
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,404
I want to fight, too!

193
00:09:58,437 --> 00:09:59,204
That

194
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:00,071
-That's out of the question.

195
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:01,571
Hey, you Squad 11 guy.

196
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:03,237
Take the girl with you and go!

197
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,171
-I don't take orders from you.

198
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,604
I'm getting out of here!

199
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:08,704
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Not
without the girl, you're not.

200
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:11,771
Not unless you want
an arrow in the back.

201
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:14,371
And if you don't hurry
up and take her now,

202
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:17,504
you'll die here, caught
in the crossfire.

203
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:18,471
-But I--

204
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:19,037
-Do it!

205
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:22,437
-Damn it.

206
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:23,637
Let's go, missy.

207
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:26,637
You're coming with me.

208
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:29,037
-Did I give you
permission to run away?

209
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:31,037
[music playing]

210
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:49,837
-Did I give you permission
to try and stop them?

211
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:51,849
-My, my.

212
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:54,582
I've already told you I
have no interest in you.

213
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:07,203
-Put me down!

214
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:09,336
-Get your hand out of
my face, you crazy girl!

215
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,636
-No!

216
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:11,869
-Can't you you see that I'm
trying to rescue you here?

217
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:13,936
I'd think you'd be a little
more thankful that I,

218
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:16,936
Makizo Aramaki of Squad 11
am the kind of chivalrous man

219
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,403
that would go to
such great lengths

220
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:22,036
to avoid leaving behind
a delicate woman!

221
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:23,036
Ahhhh!

222
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:24,503
Why you!

223
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:27,003
Take this!

224
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:30,403
Sorry about that, but
I had to do something.

225
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,236
I have no intention
of getting mixed up

226
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:34,703
with that freak
Kurotsuchi, or of getting

227
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,469
an arrow in the back from
your four-eyed friend.

228
00:11:37,503 --> 00:11:40,136
So I really had no choice but
to get a little rough with you

229
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:45,503
just now-- oh, no, maybe
I got a little too rough.

230
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:47,936
I'll be sure to apologize
to her when she wakes up.

231
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:53,103
-My, my.

232
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:55,469
This Cases the first
time in a long time

233
00:11:55,503 --> 00:11:57,203
that I've been faced
with this problem.

234
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:08,503
URYU (VOICEOVER): He
took his own arm off.

235
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:10,369
-[sarcastically] It hurts.

236
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:13,603
It hurts, it hurts.

237
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:15,436
My, my, how this hurts.

238
00:12:21,003 --> 00:12:24,203
Almost enough to make me
lose my mind, it hurts.

239
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:26,769
And I see that the
girl has gotten away.

240
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:29,036
But as long as she has
left behind even so

241
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:30,803
much as a single
hair, I will still

242
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:33,469
be able to track her down.

243
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,536
Ah, I can't wait to
capture her and experiment

244
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,469
until I turn her too much.

245
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,736
Sadly, I must deal
with you first.

246
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,703
URYU (VOICEOVER):
What a monster.

247
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:45,136
And there's a second
enemy as well.

248
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,836
If Kurotsuchi is the Captain,
then the woman behind him

249
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:49,569
must be his Lieutenant.

250
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,703
So far she hasn't moved
an inch even though her

251
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:54,636
superior a bow
pointed right at him.

252
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:57,669
Does that mean her
combat abilities are low?

253
00:12:57,703 --> 00:13:02,003
If so, then I should
start with the Captain.

254
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:02,803
-Where'd he go!

255
00:13:09,036 --> 00:13:09,969
Not bad.

256
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:16,569
You do seem to have
some good moves.

257
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:21,569
This attack and the time before,
you used Hirenkyaku, right?

258
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:23,336
It's an advanced
Quincy technique

259
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,069
to achieve high speed by
gathering spirit energy

260
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:28,736
into a current beneath the feet.

261
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:31,069
I am surprised to
find someone as young

262
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,469
as you has been
able to master it.

263
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:36,736
It would appear that you are
a talented specimen indeed.

264
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,403
URYU (VOICEOVER): I
couldn't outrun him.

265
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:41,136
And how does he know all this?

266
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:43,603
-However, chasing you
around this way really

267
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:45,103
is a bit of a bother.

268
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:47,269
I'm much more interested
in capturing the girl

269
00:13:47,303 --> 00:13:49,169
and getting started
with my research,

270
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,969
so I'm rather pressed for time.

271
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:53,936
I'm a busy man, you
see, so I've decided

272
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:56,969
to use the method that requires
the least amount of energy

273
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:01,136
and effort in order to kill you.

274
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:05,803
Claw out.

URYU (VOICEOVER): He's
released his weapon.

279
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:24,936
What are its abilities?

280
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:26,636
Will it absorb my attack?

281
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:29,869
I can't just fire recklessly!

282
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,803
Damn it!

Oh, no!

I can't believe it.

He deliberately slashed
his own Lieutenant.

288

Isn't she his partner?

289
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:58,836

something like that?

-You idiot.

291

I gave you a direct
order to hang onto him

were ripped off.

At least she served her purpose.

298

Killing you now will be as
easy as strangling a baby.

299

URYU (VOICEOVER): He

just to make sure his
sword connected with me.

00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:24,603
Are you deliberately
insulting me?

325
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:25,936
Is that it?

326
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:29,103
Are you suggesting there's
something wrong with your body

327
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:30,803
that an insignificant
slash could cause--

328
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:32,636
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Stop it!

329
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:34,103
Why are you doing that?

330
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:36,503
How can you treat your
very own people that way?

331
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:38,803
If you don't treat
here soon, she'll die!

332
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:42,536
-So now even you feel
free to begin insulting me

333
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,369
by suggesting she'll die
from a wound like this?

334
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:49,069
A body which I created?

335
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:50,636
Surely you're not
saying it could

336
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:53,736
cease to function from an
injury as minor as this one?

337
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:56,269
You'd better be careful
whom you insult.

338
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:58,203
-You created this girl?

339
00:16:58,236 --> 00:16:59,336
-That's right.

340
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:02,136
Would you like to know
what the brat's name is?

341
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:04,803
I melded the essence
of my Gigai technique

342
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:08,636
with my Gikon technique and
named her Nemu Kurotsuchi.

343
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:12,369
An appropriate name for such a
masterpiece, don't you think?

344
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:16,003
So you can forget about parading
your misguided sense of justice

345
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,103
around here.

346
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,803
I'll use this thing
however I see fit,

347
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:24,503
and what I do is no concern
to a stranger like you.

348
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:25,836
-Uhh!

349
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:26,536
-Stop it!

350
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:30,669
URYU (VOICEOVER): My arm.

351
00:17:30,703 --> 00:17:32,436
It won't move.

352
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,503
-My, my.

353
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:35,069
It would seem a bit
dense of you to only now

354
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:37,003
be noticing such a thing.

355
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:40,069
This robs the mobility from
all four limbs of whomever

356
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:41,303
is cut by it.

357
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:45,669
My Zanpakuto immobilizes
the body of whoever it cuts.

358
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:47,869
-A tranquilizer.

359
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:49,236
-Don't be ridiculous.

360
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,136
I never use such
primitive technologies.

361
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,603
This process looks at all
the countless signals fired

362
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:56,669
from your brain and
selectively severs

363
00:17:56,703 --> 00:17:59,936
only the signals controlling the
neural impulses for movement.

364
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:02,069
That's how
sophisticated this is.

365
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:04,003
It takes away the
ability to move,

366
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:06,569
but unlike
tranquilizers, it leaves

367
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:08,969
intact the pain receptors
and nerve endings.

368
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:11,169
In other words--

369
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:12,936
-Ahhhhhh!

370
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:15,369
Uhhhh!

371
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:19,936
-Not and ounce of
your pain is lost.

372
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:21,069
Hey, you, Nemu.

373
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:22,136
Get up.

374
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,203
I want you to administer
the killing blow.

375
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:25,869
Nemu!

376
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:27,269
Oh, that's right.

377
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:30,569
You were cut by my sword, too,
so you can't move your limbs

378
00:18:30,603 --> 00:18:32,303
any more than he can.

379
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:33,203
Damn it!

380
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:34,469
You're so useless!

381
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:36,936
URYU (OFFSCREEN):
Leave her alone!

382
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:38,603
-What's that?

383
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:40,636
-I said, leave her alone.

You are persistent.

386

Or is this an example of that
annoying Quincy honor you

people are always
mumbling about,

388

and that leads you to
show mercy to your enemies

389
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:53,769
just because they happen
to be wounded women?

390
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:55,003
-What?

391
00:18:55,036 --> 00:18:57,436
-Oh, you know what
I'm talking about.

392
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,469
That stupid line
that all you Quincies

393
00:18:59,503 --> 00:19:02,636
keep saying right up
until the moment you die.

394
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:05,236
By the honor of the
Quincy, I cannot do this.

395
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,203
By the honor of the
Quincy, I won't allow that.

396
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:09,736
Quincy this, Quincy that.

397
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:10,969
Every last one of you!

398
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:13,403
It's so annoying!

But no words you say
will make any difference,

because soon with one
thrust of this blade,

401
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:20,236
I will forever silence you.

402
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:22,469

00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:24,336
-Your disrespect is disturbing.

404
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:26,969
Don't you know what
hardships I had to endure?

405
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:29,269
When I became Chief of
Research and Development,

406
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:31,803
the Quincy was already a
rare and vanishing breed,

407
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:34,803
so it was difficult to
get subjects to study.

408
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:38,236
The few survivors were under
Soul Reaper surveillance.

409
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:39,903
The trick was to
bribe them so they

410
00:19:39,936 --> 00:19:41,669
would be too late
coming to the rescue.

411
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:44,636
Then I could collect the souls.

412
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:48,369
Such hard work it was,
opening up living skulls,

413
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:52,436
electric shocks, sawing off
limbs, grinding bodies to much.

414
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:56,203
It was made even harder with the
poor quality of the specimens.

415
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,436
The last one was
a grubby old man

416
00:19:58,469 --> 00:20:01,169
who kept screaming out
the name of his student.

417
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:03,636
It was all so pathetic.

418
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,669
Do you want to see
a picture of him?

419
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,869
It was taken after
the experiments,

420
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:11,269
so the body isn't
exactly intact anymore.

forgotten it now.
