ICHIGO NARRATING: Ever since
the powers of the Soul Reaper

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:10,833
were thrust upon me, my
whole world has changed.

3
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:13,733
Now, I'm Ichigo Kurosaki,
Substitute Soul Reaper.

4
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:16,300
And I'm combining my
powerful spirit energy

5
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:19,833
with this blade in order
to protect my friends!

YAMAMOTO: Former Squad 5 captain
Sosuke Aizen, former Squad 3

8
00:01:58,672 --> 00:02:04,139
captain Gin Ichimaru, and former
Squad 9 captain Kaname Tosen.

9
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:09,072
The whereabouts of these
men is still unknown.

10
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:11,739
According to the report from
the Department of Research

11
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:13,639
and Development,
the Hogyoku known

12
00:02:13,672 --> 00:02:16,339
to be in Aizen's possession
is still dormant.

13
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:18,639
It will require
quite a bit of time

14
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:22,506
before it can be completely
resurrected and used by him.

15
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:28,172
But here's my conclusion-- that
there is no immediate danger.

16
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:31,639
However, there is no doubt
these three men still

17
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:34,172
pose a grave threat
to the Soul Society

18
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:36,872
as well as to the
world of the living.

19
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,039
Therefore, to deal
with this danger,

20
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:41,772
I have formed a task force
to hunt down the three

21
00:02:41,806 --> 00:02:43,606
and bring them to justice!

22
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,239
That is all for today.

23
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:45,706
Dismissed.

24
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:54,239
-So Old Man Yamamoto has
formed a task force, eh?

25
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:56,839
-Well, that's what he
calls it, but everyone

26
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:59,772
knows they're really
just assassins.

27
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:02,306
Aizen's in trouble.

28
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:06,206
But he certainly asked for it,
so I don't have any sympathy.

29
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,439
Hey, did you hear about Renji?

30
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:11,272
They sent him to the town that
the Ryoka Ichigo comes from.

31
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:14,772
-Yes, it would seem they're
interested in keeping him busy.

32
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:16,672
-Yeah.

33
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:18,539
-Why, what is it?

34
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:22,506
-Well, it's just that I heard
some rumors the other day about

35
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,639
what's been going on there.

36
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:24,972
And it sounded pretty dicey.

[grunts]

43
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:48,206
Damn, we've been
searching all night,

44
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,639
and we haven't even
found a trace of her.

45
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:51,839
-Yeah.

46
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:54,306
I don't sense her spiritual
pressure at all anymore.

47
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:57,006
-If only we knew what
that strange gate was.

48
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,106
-To me, it looked like the gate
straight into the underworld.

49
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,372
-Is there such a thing?

50
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:02,939
-You've never heard of it?

51
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:03,672
-Well, I have.

52
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,039
Saw it once before, in fact.

53
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:13,906
-That wasn't it, though.

54
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:16,906
There's no way hell would make
off with a living human being.

55
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:18,139
-I sure hope you're right.

56
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:19,739
And what the hell
are you doing here

57
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:21,306
at our school anyway, Renji?

58
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,439
-What do you think?

59
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:24,472
They gave me responsibility
for this town.

60
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,506
Obviously, if anything
strange happens here,

61
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,372
it's my duty to handle it.

62
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:29,939
-That's all well
and good, Renji.

63
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:31,839
But it isn't what he asked you.

64
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,139
We all know why you're
here in town, in general.

65
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,839
He just asked you what you're
doing here at our school.

66
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:39,372
-And I just explained
it, dumb ass!

67
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:41,772
-Yeah, and you're still
missing the whole point.

Both of you, just shut up!

71
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:47,506
-The thing that
worries me is what

72
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,539
happened with the girls earlier.

73
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:52,339
-Hey, have you
girls seen Orihime?

74
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:53,106
-Who?

75
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,239
Orihime?

76
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,006
Is she a new student
or something?

77
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,106
-Oh, very funny.

78
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,439
You know who I'm talking about.

79
00:04:58,472 --> 00:04:59,572
Orihime.

80
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:02,139
-Well, I sure don't know
anybody by that name.

81
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:05,139
Are you feeling OK, Ichigo?

82

-Uh.

83
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,572
-It appears as though
their memory of her

84
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:10,506
has been completely erased.

85
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:12,406
-The same thing happened
to everyone back

86
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,872
when Rukia disappeared.

87
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:16,572
-That's it!

88
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:17,972
-What's it?

89
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:20,606
-The fact that someone's gone to
all the trouble of using memory

90
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,739
replacement on these
kids means that they

91
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:25,506
knew, sooner or later,
we'd come looking for her.

92
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,039
And it also proves Orihime's
disappearance was no accident.

93
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:31,039
Somebody has kidnapped her.

94
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:32,406
-All right.

95
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,272
Then I think that we should
go back to Orihime's apartment

96
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:35,572
and take another look.

97
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:37,972
There might be some
clues we missed somehow.

You mean right now?

I thought you guys were
supposed to be in class.

important than school.

-I'll take care of that.

-Right, what are
you going to do?

110
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,839
Break it down?

111

-There is no need.

112
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,439
I can handle this.

113
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,339

illegal to pick a lock.

-Right now, we have no choice.

At least, it's better than
breaking down the door.

-Instead of jabbering,
why don't you

make sure no one is watching us?

keep talking about food?

-Because I'm hungry, obviously!

it only makes it worse.

it was was invited by Orihime

spiritual pressure.

-Is that lunch time yet ready?

330
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:55,669
-Maybe the moocher called in
for a pizza on our account.

331
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:56,802
-Yeah, I'm here.

332
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:57,669
GIRL (ON PHONE): Wow!

333
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:59,602
You made it just in time.

334
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:02,302
-Yeah, but how did
you get this number?

335
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:04,135
And where are you
calling from anyway?

336
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:05,369
-Doesn't that phone
tell you who's--

337
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:05,902
GIRL (ON PHONE):
Oh, I can't tell--

338
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:06,702
---calling?

339
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:07,202
GIRL (ON PHONE): --you that?

340
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:08,302
-Damn it!

341
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:08,935
GIRL (ON PHONE): That's
not how the game works.

342
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:10,235
-Can we trace it?

343
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:11,302
GIRL (ON PHONE): The mystery
is what's so fun about it.

344
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:12,135
-I think only the
police can do that.

345
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:13,169
GIRL (ON PHONE): For 50,000--

346
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:14,169
-I can record the
call if you think--

347
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:14,802
GIRL (ON PHONE):
--maybe I'll give you--

348
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:15,802
---it might help.

349
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:17,902
GIRL (ON PHONE):
--some hint. [giggles]

350
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:19,235
OK, I'll tell you what.

351
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:22,169
Try going back to your friend's
apartment at 8:00 tonight.

352
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:22,935
Who knows?

353
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:24,502
You might find her there.

354
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:26,602
-Then why should we
wait until tonight?

355
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:28,102
Why can't you
bring her back now?

356
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,535
GIRL (ON PHONE): My, my,
you're such an impatient boy!

357
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,535
-Hey, you at least,
let me hear her voice!

358
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:33,869
GIRL (ON PHONE): [giggles]

359
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:34,802
Tonight.

360
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:36,202
See you!

361
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:38,169
-No, don't hang up!

362
00:14:38,202 --> 00:14:39,169
Hello?

363
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:40,002
Hello!

364
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:41,435
-What's all the racket in here?

365
00:14:41,469 --> 00:14:42,402
Are you having a party?

366
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:47,569
GIRL (ON TAPE): My, my,
you're such an impatient boy.

367
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:49,269
ICHIGO (ON TAPE): Hey, at
least, let me hear a voice!

368
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:50,569
GIRL (ON TAPE): [giggles]

369
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:51,535
Tonight.

370
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:53,902
See you!

371
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,969
-Hm, it certainly does sound
like a kidnapping, doesn't it?

372
00:14:58,002 --> 00:14:58,935
-Of course, it is.

373
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:00,135
What else could it be?

374
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,435
-And I seriously doubt
that whoever is behind this

375
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,969
is going to just give
Orihime back tonight.

376
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:06,535
I'm sure that it's a trap.

377
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:09,002
-The fact that she knew the
number to call here at the shop

378
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:12,235
also means it's not an ordinary
person we're dealing with.

379
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:13,969
-So she's a Soul Reaper?

380
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:15,302
-I didn't say that.

381
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:17,469
I just don't think there's
enough information for us

382
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:18,769
to act upon.

383
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:20,202
-Tell me what you think.

384
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:22,435
-I have to agree with Yoruichi.

385
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:24,235
We don't have
enough to go on yet.

386
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:26,669
-There must be something
you can do to help us out.

387
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:28,835
-Ah, I suppose I can try.

388
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:30,869
Don't expect too much,
though, because I haven't

389
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:33,002
done this kind of work
before, so I don't really

390
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:34,102
know what I'm doing.

391
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:34,702
-All right.

392
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:35,835
Thanks a lot.

393
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,135
-So 8 o'clock tonight, right?

394
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:39,535
-Yeah, I'll see you there.

395
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:40,969
We're going to get Orihime back.

396
00:15:41,002 --> 00:15:43,369
And then I'll make them pay.

397
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:44,935
-All right, then.

398
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:46,402
-8 o'clock sounds good.

399
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:49,269
-Wait, you aren't going
with them, are you?

400
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:52,402
-No, but if they're going out,
that means Renji won't be here,

401
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:55,069
so we don't have to cook
dinner for the moocher.

402
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:56,435
-[groans]

403
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:57,202
-Renji!

404
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:58,702
-How pathetic.

405
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:01,169
-Hm.

406
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:04,202
[dog barks]

407
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:14,835
-Any signs of life inside?

408
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:16,369
-No, nothing yet.

409
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:19,335
And by the way, how come you're
not wearing that cape of yours?

410
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:22,435
-Um, well, I had to
take it to the cleaners.

411
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,302
-Your cape is dry clean only?

412
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:25,369
You serious?

413
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,502
-Yeah, so what's wrong
with looking good?

414
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:28,869
[static noise]

415
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:29,735
-What the hell?

416
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:33,802
That's Orihime's window!

417
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:41,269
Damn, it's still locked!

418
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:42,769
-You want me to
pick the lock again?

419
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,002
-No, there's no time for that.

420
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:45,535
We've got to get
in there right now.

421
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,669
Come on, Chad, break
this door down.

422
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:48,169
-Right.

423
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:58,769
-What's going on, guys?

424
00:16:58,802 --> 00:17:00,069
-Orihime?

425
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,435
-Did she bring you back
like she said she would?

426
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:04,535
-I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

427
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,535
-You aren't hurt, are you?

428
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,102
-Huh?

429
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:08,435
Hurt by what?

430
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:11,769
-Orihime, you were kidnapped
by someone last night.

431
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:12,269
-Huh?

432
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:13,102
I was what?

433
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:14,802
He-he, no way!

434
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:17,202
-So you don't remember
a thing about it.

435
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:19,369
-Orihime, I want you to
think back to last night.

436
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:21,735
What was the last thing
that happened to you?

437
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,069
-Hm, well, I have
to think about that.

438
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:25,869
The first thing
that happened was

439
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:27,835
school since the new
semester started today.

440
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:29,902
I remember seeing
all my friends.

441
00:17:29,935 --> 00:17:32,835
And after that, Tatsuki
and I got ice cream

442
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:35,202
and gave ourselves headaches
from eating them too fast.

443
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:37,469
Then I went home
and did my homework.

444
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:40,169
And after that, had
dinner and went to bed.

445
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:43,002
-But the new semester
started yesterday, Orihime.

446
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,002
-Huh?

447
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:45,602
-They erased her memory, too.

448
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:47,169
She lost a day.

449
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:48,835
-Well, at least,
they didn't hurt her.

450
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:49,935
She's OK.

451
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,602
-But whoever did
this is still around.

452
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:56,569
-So we'll stick around,
too, and keep our eyes open.

453
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:58,202
GIRL (ON TAPE): OK,
I'll tell you what.

454
00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:01,169
Try going back to your friend's
apartment at 8:00 tonight.

455
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:02,506
Who knows?

456
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,772
You might find her there.

457
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:07,839
-Hm.

458
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:08,706
-What is it?

459
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:10,372
Did you find something?

460
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:15,472
-No, I ran the voice of the
analyzer twice, but no reading.

461
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:17,272
This voice has no reimon.

462
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,939
-No reimon?

463
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,139
-The equivalent of a hand
with no fingerprints.

464
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:23,039
Unusual.

465
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:24,939
-Very unusual, indeed.

466
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:26,139
-Excuse me, Master.

467
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:26,972
-Hm?

468
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,206
-What is it, Tessai?

469
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,039
-That cloud.

470
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:37,672
-Huh?

471
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:40,239
I've never seen a
cloud quite like that.

472
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:41,706
-Could it be a
Menos approaching?

473
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:44,272
-No, a Menos cloud is
somewhat different.

474
00:18:51,939 --> 00:18:55,772
-Whatever it is, it's bad.

475
00:18:55,806 --> 00:18:56,272
-Hm.

476
00:19:13,972 --> 00:19:15,406
-Nothing's happening.

477
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:18,006
-Shall I make us some tea?

478
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,372
-Wait a minute.

479
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:22,172
Something's coming.

480
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:23,172
Huh?

-Stay away from the
windows, everyone.

00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:36,406
It's not safe!
