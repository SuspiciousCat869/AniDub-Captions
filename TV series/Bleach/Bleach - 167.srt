NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:53,462
who was kidnapped by Sosuke
Aizen, Ichigo and his friends

5
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:55,695
snuck into Hueco
Mundo and infiltrated

00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:58,528
Aizen's fortress,
known as Las Noches.

7
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:01,295
Upon entering the fortress,
they were engaged in battle

00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:05,162
by some of Aizen's
most deadly Arrancars.

00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:07,295
At every turn our
heroes found themselves

10

at a disadvantage, outmaneuvered
and beaten by their opponents.

11
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:13,662

final desperate battle

ORIHIME INOUE
(VOICEOVER): That's right.

31
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:27,462
The whole reason I
came here was because I

32
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:28,962
wanted to protect everyone.

33
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:32,928
I thought I was ready to
make whatever sacrifice.

34
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:36,928
But then when I heard
that Ichigo and the others

35
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:39,895
had come to save me,
somewhere deep in my heart

36
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,362
I felt such happiness.

37
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:47,862
Then I saw Ichigo wearing
a mask and his eyes.

38
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,328
They looked like my
brother's eyes that night.

39
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:52,828
I was so scared.

40
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:57,328
I thought that maybe he didn't
come to save me after all.

no such thing as an
individual Gillian.

77
00:06:39,762 --> 00:06:42,595
Gillians are the
lowest class of Menos.

78
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,428
It's believed that
they are created

when hundreds of
Hollows come together,

but that's not
actually the case.

81
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:53,928
Hollows consume human souls.

82
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:57,062
And why is this
necessary, you ask?

83
00:06:57,095 --> 00:07:00,495
They do it to satisfy
a hunger caused

84

by the emptiness inside them.

85
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:05,495
But each Hollow is unique.

86
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:09,928
There are certain Hollows who
are more ravenous than others,

87
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:14,128

souls of their own kind.

(VOICEOVER): Those Hollows

90
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:23,428
are drawn by a mutual
desire-- the desire

91

to consume each other.

of individuality.

96
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:40,895

100
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:53,262
are times when the
personality of one Hollow

transcends the
others in a Gillian

But Adjuchas fall

113
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:44,548
prey to an even greater fear.

114
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:47,115
It's the fear of regression.

115
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:50,182
Unless it continues
to consume Hollows,

116
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:55,582
an Adjucha will regress
and become a Gillian again.

117
00:08:55,615 --> 00:09:00,915
Those that regress inevitably
lose their individuality

118
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:03,548
and never again can
become Adjuchas.

our lives as
Gillians or Adjuchas.

142
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:48,248
One day we will rise
to become Vasto Lordes.

143
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:53,182
But to do that, we need
power, an immense power that

can guide us.

No matter how badly I beat
you, somewhere deep inside,

you always think
you can beat me.

would have the nerve to
treat you as an equal?

165
00:12:22,182 --> 00:12:24,148
GRIMMJOW JAEGERJAQUEZ: Haaah!

166
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:25,548
[gags and retches]

167
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:26,148
-Huuuuayyyyah!

168
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,682
That has nothing to do with it.

169
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,382
It doesn't matter
to me if you're

170
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:36,415
a human, a Soul
Reaper, or an Arrancar.

171
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:38,248
They're all the same.

172
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:41,182
Anybody that looks down
on me will be crushed!

173
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:50,082
As for you, Ichigo--

174
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:52,215
-Nnngh!

175
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:55,315
-You're gonna be
the first one to go!

[shoom]

177
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:00,648
-Are you ready?

178
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:09,248
-What the hell is that?

179
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:11,715
-Heh.

180
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:13,682
[sound of shattering glass]

181
00:13:13,715 --> 00:13:16,115
-Desgarron.

182
00:13:16,148 --> 00:13:17,915
It's my ultimate technique.

183
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:24,615
What did you say?

184
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:27,915
-I said we're
giving up, Grimmjow.

185
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:31,115
Do you realize how
much time has passed

186
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:33,648
since we began
traveling together?

187
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,815
-What difference does it make?

188
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:41,248
-We now realize that we'll
never become Vasto Lordes.

189
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:44,048
-Since eating our
1,000th Hollow,

190
00:13:44,082 --> 00:13:47,182
we can no longer feel
our powers increasing.

191
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:50,982
Today's meal marks number 3,000.

192
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:53,115
3,000 more won't
make any difference.

193
00:13:56,348 --> 00:13:57,582
-Huh.

194
00:13:57,615 --> 00:14:00,482
You're crazy.

195
00:14:00,515 --> 00:14:03,382
If you want to give up, you're
all free to go die in a ditch

196
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:04,682
somewhere.

197
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:07,215
I'm moving on.

198
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:10,048
-Very well, Grimmjow.

199
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:13,515
But if that's your
decision, consume us first.

200
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:21,915
If even a portion of our
bodies is consumed by a Hollow,

201
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:25,582
our evolution stops.

202
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:29,615
Di Roy can never become
a Vasto Lorde now.

203
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:31,582
We know that.

204
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:33,915
Our evolution ends here.

205
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:39,415
-You're a bunch of cowards.

206
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:42,448
-As I said, we've
come to a realization.

207
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,915
There are those who can become
Vasto Lordes and those who

208
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:47,248
cannot.

209
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:51,048
Some are not destined to rise
beyond the Adjucha state.

210
00:14:51,082 --> 00:14:53,582
Perhaps it goes even
deeper than that.

211
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:56,348
We are aware of that now.

212
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:59,382
From the moment
we became Hollows

213
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:02,815
we were destined to be Adjuchas.

214
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:07,715
But you were meant for
something far greater.

215
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:09,548
Eat us, Grimmjow.

216

Fine.

If that's what you
want, I'll eat you all.

know, I got news for you.

You're not the only
one who wants to win.

235
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,551
-What's that?

236
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:48,185
-You want to kill me?

237
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:51,018
Because of how I look at you?

238
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,051
Well, I know how you feel!

were right before when

242
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:07,051
you said that I came here
because I wanted to fight!

Gyeeeahhhh!

244
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:12,485
The real reason I came
here was to defeat you!

245
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:20,385
So I'm going to destroy you!

246

And Ulquiorra!

I'm going to defeat Aizen!
