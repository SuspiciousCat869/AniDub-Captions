00:00:20,533 --> 00:01:39,733
[theme music]

00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:46,321
-Rukia Kuchiki is
hereby found guilty

4
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:48,221
of all charges against her.

5
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:50,421
Twenty five days
from now she will

6
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:53,021
go to the central
execution grounds

7
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:55,321
to suffer the
ultimate punishment.

8
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:58,154
That is the final decision
of the Soul Society.

9
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,088
GIN (OFFSCREEN): My
compliments, squad six captain.

10
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:13,388
You handled yourself very
professionally in there.

11
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:15,921
I thought that condemning
your own sister to death

12
00:02:15,954 --> 00:02:17,721
might be difficult for you.

13
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:20,188
You're truly an example
for all Soul Reapers.

14
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:21,621
ZARAKI (OFFSCREEN):
Are you joking?

15
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:24,254
The only Soul Reapers
who are scared of dying

16
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:27,154
are you and the
captain of squad 9.

17
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,954
GIN (OFFSCREEN): Oh, is that so?

18
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:30,821
-If this were official
business, you two

19
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:33,488
wouldn't be without
your agitants.

20
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:36,021
So what do you want with me?

21
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:38,088
-We were just concerned.

22
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:40,954
We wanted to make certain that
one of our esteemed colleagues

23
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:43,588
wasn't feeling badly about
having to pass sentence

24
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,421
on a member of his own family.

25
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:48,121
-Our family lineage is
none of your business.

26
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:50,054
-Good to know you're not upset.

27
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:53,488
Criminals can do such damage
to a noble family's image.

28
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:54,788
-Oh?

29
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,754
And since when does
a commoner like you

30
00:02:56,788 --> 00:02:59,188
know anything about nobility?

31
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,754
-Huh, well I guess you
could say I've always

32
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:03,421
been a keen observer.

33
00:03:03,454 --> 00:03:06,654
For that matter, I'd be pleased
to offer you my services.

34
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:09,088
Perhaps you'd like me
to behead the criminal

35
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:11,054
before the execution.

36
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:14,221
-I don't think that even
you, squad 11 captain,

37
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:16,688
has the skill required
for something like that.

38
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:18,354
-Why don't you test me then.

39
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:20,321
-I don't think you
really mean that.

40
00:03:20,354 --> 00:03:21,221
-Try me.

41
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:27,954
-My most sincere
apologies, squad 6 captain.

42
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:30,154
I assure you it was
not my intention

43
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:31,788
to offend you in any way.

44
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:33,854
Please give my regards to
your sister, all right.

45
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:35,354
ZARAKI (OFFSCREEN):
Untie me damnit!

46
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:36,821
Let me at him!

47
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,488
-Finally.

48
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,454
-Oh, there you are Mr. Tessai.

49
00:03:52,488 --> 00:03:53,688
Are you all right?

50
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:55,054
-No, I'm not all right.

51
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:56,621
My glasses nearly fell apart.

52
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,754
-As long as you're
still breathing then

53
00:03:58,788 --> 00:03:59,754
you're all right.

54
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,554
And even if your
glasses are cracked,

55
00:04:01,588 --> 00:04:02,921
you'll probably
want to keep them

56
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:04,321
on just to see
what happens next.

57
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:07,754
Just a minute ago Mr.
Kisuke got out his sword.

58
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:10,188
So this should really be good.

59
00:04:10,221 --> 00:04:11,554
[scream]

60
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:14,054
-Hey not bad, considering you're
using a little kiddie sword.

61
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,121
-Oh, what a compliment, student.

62
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:18,388
Don't expect me
to go easy on you.

63
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:19,721
[laughing and labored breathing]

64
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:22,254
-(IN HEAD) Hey wait a minute.

65
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:23,721
Why am I running?

66
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:25,454
I thought that only
a Zanpakuto could

67
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:27,021
kill Soul Reapers and Hollows.

68
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:30,088
But I saw mister hat and clogs
pull that little sword out

69
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:31,121
of his cane.

70
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:34,554
So it can't possibly
be a Zanpakuto.

71
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:39,788
So even if he hits me
with it, he can't cut me.

72
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,854
-You let your guard down.

73
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,721
You thought because
I'm not a Soul

74
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:46,421
Reaper I couldn't
have a Zanpakuto.

75
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:49,854
And you're thinking there's
no way I can hurt you.

76
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:51,888
You are so naive.

77
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:53,521
Awaken now, Benihime.

78
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:02,888
I assure you this is a
real Zanpakuto, very real.

79
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:06,588
Awaken, Benihime.

80
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:12,521
-Roar, Zabimaru!

81
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:15,521
You can't even ask your
Zanpakuto its name.

82
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:16,988
I knew it!

83
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:20,388
-A name for my Zanpakuto?

84
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,554
-Yes.

85
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:25,654
Each Zanpakuto carries a
unique name and this one

86
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:28,854
is Benihime, the red princess.

87
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:29,888
Let us show you.

88
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:34,221
[bang]

89
00:05:34,254 --> 00:05:34,721
[gasp]

90
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,421
-I'll give you credit
for not running away

91
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:42,688
at least and for parrying
with that broken stump.

92
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:45,421
You're not short on nerve.

93
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:48,988
Just the same, Benihime
is much too fierce

94
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:52,388
to let a blade
like that stop her.

95
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:53,721
[groan]

96
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,054
-(IN HEAD) Damn!

97
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,121
It can't be.

98
00:05:57,154 --> 00:06:01,588
He just cut right through my
Zanpakuto like it was butter.

99
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:03,721
-Don't you get it Ichigo?

100
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:07,588
Your sword has no concentration
of spirit energy in it.

101
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:10,221
It has size, but
that's all it has.

102
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,421
It carries a Zanpakuto
shape but has

103
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:14,788
none of the necessary
internal strength.

104
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:19,621
So I can cut it, just like that.

105
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:27,154
Now you no longer
have any sword at all.

106
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:29,654
Do you plan to
continue attacking me

107
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,554
with nothing but the hilt?

108
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:34,921
I suppose you could still manage
to knock my hat off with it.

109
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:36,821
But this time
Ichigo, you're going

110
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:41,421
to need a lot more than
just blind luck or courage.

111
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:43,421
I think it's only
fair to warn you--

112
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:48,121
if you try to go against me
with that inferior weapon I

113
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:50,388
will kill you.

114
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,288
[gasp]

115
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,888
-(IN HEAD)I've got to get away.

116
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:54,488
I don't think he's kidding.

117
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:56,254
He's really going to
kill me this time.

118
00:06:56,288 --> 00:07:01,154
[scream] This is so pathetic.

119
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,454
What am I doing?

120
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,121
Why am I running away?

121
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:06,488
Is this is all the
backbone I have?

122
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:10,321
Am I just a coward after
all, a complete phony?

123
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:12,221
I'm so disgusted with myself.

124
00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:13,588
How pathetic!

125
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:16,354
It's pathetic, pathetic!

126
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:17,421
-Yes, that's you.

127
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:23,088
-Master?

128
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:27,554
-Why are you
running away Ichigo?

129
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:30,788
You still haven't called me yet.

130
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:36,354
Face forward Ichigo and you
should be able to hear it now.

131
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:40,121
The only thing plugging
your ears is your own fear.

132
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:47,154
There's only one enemy
and there's one of you.

133
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:48,754
So what is there
to be afraid of?

134
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:56,688
-Hey, what's up?

135
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,921
He just stopped
and so did Ichigo.

136
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:08,188
ZANGETSU (OFFSCREEN):
Abandon your fear.

137
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,688
Turn and face him.

138
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:11,454
Don't give an inch.

139
00:08:11,488 --> 00:08:13,121
Now, Ichigo!

140
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:14,521
Advance!

141
00:08:14,554 --> 00:08:15,954
Never stop!

142
00:08:15,988 --> 00:08:19,121
If you retreat, you will age.

143
00:08:19,154 --> 00:08:21,921
Be afraid and you'll die.

144
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:24,054
Now shout out my name!

145
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:24,554
-Zangetsu!

146
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:30,021
-Whoa!

147
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:32,488
What's going on out there?

148
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:42,554
[music playing]

149
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:53,154
[music playing]

150
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:55,388
-What kind of Zanpakuto is that?

151
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:58,421
It doesn't even have a
hilt or a guard on it.

152
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:02,021
It's not even shaped like
a normal sword. [gasp]

153
00:09:02,054 --> 00:09:04,188
If you ask me, his
old one was better.

154
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:11,054
-Well it's about time.

155
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:14,088
Now that you've managed
to draw your Zanpakuto,

156
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,254
time for lesson number three.

157
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,021
Are you ready for that?

158
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:21,488
-Don't take this the
wrong way Mr. Urahara,

159
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:24,088
but I hope you dodge this.

160
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,154
-What?

161
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:29,188
-Because I can't control it yet!

162
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:30,188
-Scream Benihime!

163
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:35,121
[music playing]

164
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:46,254
-Phew, good thing
I protected myself

165
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,188
with my blood mist shield.

166
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,888
Without it, I probably would
have lost an arm just now.

167
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:57,788
That wasn't very nice.

168
00:09:57,821 --> 00:10:01,654
I do believe you've
killed my hat.

169
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:02,854
Impressive.

170
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:04,388
I didn't expect
you could do that

171
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:07,254
with a single swing
of your sword.

172
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:10,254
Ichigo, you are one
frightening kid.

173
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,054
You know that?

174
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:15,321
Lesson three cleared.

175
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:26,254
-At last it's complete.

176
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:36,721
I owe it all to you, Sensei.

177
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:39,188
[crash]

178
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,154
[gasp]

179
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:42,654
-You did it!

180
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:44,121
Chad that was so amazing!

181
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:45,088
Way to go!

182
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:45,721
Wow!

183
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:46,921
-You clumsy fools!

184
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:51,054
That explosion is causing
a panic in the streets.

185
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:51,688
Quick!

186
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:52,521
Out the back door!

187
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:54,654
-OK, OK!

188
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,521
-I can't believe how
quickly they've both

189
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:58,621
awakened their powers
and become capable

190
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:00,521
individuals. [scream]
What happened?

191
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:01,654
-Oh no!

192
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:03,188
Chad just tripped and
fell down the stairs!

193
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:03,988
Somebody call the--

194
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:04,721
-Then again.

195
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:17,269
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
After completing training

196
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,269
at Urahara's shop, I was
told to go home and wait

197
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:22,983
for the opening of the
gate into the Soul Society.

198
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:26,116
So here I am for what could
be my last summer vacation.

199
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,916
-Isn't this exciting everyone!

200
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,816
We're finally here at
the fireworks festival!

201
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,750
-You're so enthusiastic.

202
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:32,083
-Why not?

203
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:34,416
Who doesn't love to watch
stuff catch fire and explode!

204
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,083
-Hey, don't forget about me.

205
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:38,016
In fact, I slept over
there on the sidewalk

206
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,216
last night in order to
save the very best spots.

207
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,183
Follow me and
we'll go there now.

208
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:44,383
-(OFFSCREEN): Hey, for a
grown-up you're all right.

209
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,083
Fantastic.

210
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:46,016
-(OFFSCREEN) Let's go!

211
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,050
-How about you
two lovely ladies.

212
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,350
Care to join us?

213
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:49,683
We'll be there a little later.

214
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:50,383
-Suit yourselves!

215
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,616
Come on everybody!

216
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,983
The sun's going down and
it's almost explosion time!

217
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:57,350
-Well, might as well.

218
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,016
I guess I'll go too.

219
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,850
Sorry, Tatsuki.

220
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:01,116
It's always like this.

221
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,250
You don't have to come
along if you don't want to.

222
00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:05,183
-Oh, don't worry
about me, Ichigo.

223
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:07,150
I'll probably catch up
with everybody later.

224
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:08,483
You just go ahead and have fun.

225
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:10,083
-All right, see ya.

226
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:11,683
-They're all so energetic.

227
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:12,650
-I'll say.

228
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:14,450
It wears me out
just watching em.

229
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,350
-Is your hand
bothering you, Tatsuki?

230
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:17,283
-Huh?

231
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:19,350
No actually it
doesn't hurt at all,

232
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:21,450
except for hurting my
pride a little bit whenever

233
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:23,350
I think about how it
cost me first place.

234
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:25,950
-Yeah, but taking second place
in the national tournament

235
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,916
still makes you the
second strongest

236
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,250
girl in the whole country.

237
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,016
-Huh?

238
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,316
-That means you're great!

239
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,683
-I hadn't thought
of that before.

240
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:33,383
-See!

241
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,483
Tatsuki you're amazing!

242
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,983
-(SIGHING) This is one of my
favorite places in the whole

243
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:43,316
world to relax.

244
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,083
-We haven't come here since
last year about this time.

245
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:48,750
-Did I ever tell you about
coming here with my brother?

246
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:51,350
He and I used to come
to this place too.

247
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:54,250
And he had this amazing ability
to catch red dragonflies

248
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:56,050
on his fingertip.

249
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,216
He would is just point
his finger to the sky

250
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,783
and right away a
dragonfly would land.

251
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:02,883
It was like magic.

252
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:07,083
I always wanted to be able to
do that too, but I never could.

253
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:10,450
I'll protect you this
time Tatsuki, I promise!

254
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,883
-So, you're going to visit
some relatives next week?

255
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,250
-Uh, mm hm.

256
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,750
-Ichigo said he was
taking a trip then too.

257
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:22,950
-Uh huh. [nervous laugh]

258
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:27,950
-What you said about
winning second place

259
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:29,483
was pretty cool Orihime.

260
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:30,716
-Hm?

261
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,716
-You're right.

262
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,450
Because even though
I didn't come

263
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:36,350
in first in that tournament
I still gained something.

264
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,383
There are always things
you discover just

265
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,083
by doing the best you can do.

266
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:47,750
So I think that
for you-- if you've

267
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:50,350
decided to do something you
should go ahead and do it.

268
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:52,950
[gasp] And do the best you can.

269
00:13:52,983 --> 00:13:58,516
But please, just promise
that you'll come back, OK.

270
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,516
I'll be waiting, Orihime.

271
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,150
[fireworks]

272
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:08,116
-Oh yeah!

273
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,016
-Oh, yeah!

274
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,383
-Ichigo's dad rocks!

275
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,350
-This is a great spot!

276
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:18,183
[fireworks and crowd]

277
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,483
-Well, I guess it's about time.

278
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:25,816
All I can do now is wait.

279
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,983
-Seven days from now at 1:00 AM
be ready with your window open.

280
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:34,750
-I've got a really bad
feeling about this.

281
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:37,516
Huh?

282
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,683
There's a nice breeze
tonight at least.

283
00:14:40,716 --> 00:14:42,150
Hey!

284
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:46,150
[crash] [gasp] What the hell?

285
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:47,650
Huh?

286

URAHARA (OFFSCREEN): I Meet
us outside the Urahara shop

287
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,650
immediately.

00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:52,783
[screams]

289
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:54,916
-Who the hell contacts
people like that?

290
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,616
This is like some TV
crime scene message

291
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,050
written in the
victim's own blood!

292
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,050
And it better not stain my wall!

293
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:01,616
Hm?

294
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,316
What now, a PS?

295
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,750
URAHARA (OFFSCREEN):
PS-- if you're

296
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:08,050
thinking that this messages
is like some written

297
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,916
in the victim's own blood
cliche from some TV show,

298
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,050
then you obviously
have no sense of humor.

299
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:19,416
-Oh shut up!
[breathing] [snoring]

300
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,883
-Well dad, Karin,
Yuzu-- goodbye.

301
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,216
-Good morning Ichigo!

302
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,216
[crash] Way to dodge
the attack, my son.

303
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,016
-This is how you say goodbye?

304
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,216
What's wrong with you?

305
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,383
-Before you left
Ichigo, I wanted

306
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,316
to make sure you had
this to take with you.

307
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,216
-What am I supposed to do
with some dirty old charm?

308
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,516
-Watch your mouth.

309
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,750
That talisman was given to
me by your mother long ago.

310
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:49,783
It's precious.

311
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,083
-And what are you
giving it to me for?

312
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,283
I can't keep this thing!

313
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:53,483
-Of course you can't!

314
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:54,816
Who ever said I was giving
it to you permanently?

315
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,983
You have to give it back to
me as soon as you come home.

316
00:15:57,016 --> 00:15:59,083
Sheesh!

317
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:00,716
It should bring you luck.

318
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,716
It always has for me.

319
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,383
Think of it as a gift
from your mother.

320
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:08,150
Well, what do you say?

321
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:10,650
Hey, I'm offering you a
magic talisman and I swear,

322
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:12,783
if you don't bring it back
I'll shave my beard off.

323
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:13,550
-All right already.

324
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,516
-Now answer me already!

325
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,350
-I'll take it.

326
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:16,116
I'm going now.

327
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,183
Goodbye dad.

328
00:16:17,216 --> 00:16:17,683
-Bye!

329
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:22,850
-I will tell you.

330
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:26,316
I'm a Soul Reaper.

331
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,383
You'll learn that
exorcising a Hollow

332
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:32,083
is not the same
thing as killing it.

333
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,516
Could she have been
killed by a Hollow?

334
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,116
Do you think that it's possible?

335
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,050
-(IN HEAD) So many strange
things have happened lately.

336
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,583
-You are just a lowly human.

337
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:44,516
How dare you grab my
brother like that!

338
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,550
-(IN HEAD) But now I swear--

339
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:51,016
-You are going to die so
why not stay put and live

340
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,350
a few seconds longer?

341
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:57,616
-(IN HEAD) I can't pretend
like all that never happened.

342
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,783
-Well, well.

343
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,283
If it isn't Ichigo.

344
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:01,716
And right on time.

345
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,083
Welcome to the club.

346
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:03,883
-Hey Chad.

347
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,916
What are you doing here?

348
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,916
-Rukia saved me once.

349
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,583
I want to help her out if I can.

350
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,050
I'm going too.

351
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,150
-Huh?

352
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:14,150
-What's the matter?

353
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:15,750
Are you hard of
hearing or something?

354
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:17,416
-What?

355
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,583
Uryu?

356
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:21,383
-I don't take defeat
well, especially when

357
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,950
it's at the hands
of a Soul Reaper.

358
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,083
So I'm going too.

359
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:29,783
-So I guess we're all
present and accounted for.

360
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:30,583
-Orihime?

361
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,750
-Yes, I got the message too.

362
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:34,116
-Hold on a second.

363
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,316
Can somebody please tell me
what the hell is going on here?

364
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,316
-You're a little slow on
the uptake, aren't you?

365
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,083
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Yuruichi!

366
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:42,116
-Kid, don't tell me you
didn't notice the increase

367
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,616
in the hidden powers of
these three friends of yours.

368
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,383
There have been so many clues.

369
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,150
You need to be more
observant than that

370
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:49,416
if you want to survive.

371
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,850
While you were
training and trying

372
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:53,116
to regain your Soul Reaper
powers, the three of them

373
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,783
were also training
in their own way.

374
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:58,516
Instead of asking stupid,
meaningless questions,

375
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,550
you ought to be thanking them.

376
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,383
-Uh.

377
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,716
A freaking cat just spoke to me!

378
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,650
-His name is Yoruichi
and he's not just a cat.

379
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:08,483
-It is hard to get used to.

380
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:10,083
-I'm still adjusting
to it myself.

381
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:11,383
-All right, all right.

382
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,683
Come on everybody.

383
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,916
Let's take this little
party inside the store.

384
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,450
There are things we can't talk
about out here in the open.

385
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:18,616
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Orihime.

386
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,683
[gasp]

387
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:22,316
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
What is it Ichigo?

388
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,083
-How much do you know
about what's going on?

389
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:29,850
I mean, this is going
to be dangerous.

390
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:32,216
-Yes, but I gave my promise.

391
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,683
I promised that I'd go with you.

392
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:39,516
And I told Tatsuki
I'd come back to her.

393
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,916
-What?

394
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,416
Hm.

395
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:48,383
-Wow!

396
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,650
This is so incredible!

397
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:51,716
Who knew there was something
this humongous right

398
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,550
below the shop?

399
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,816
Isn't it amazing?

400
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,783
-I guess.

401
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:57,450
-Oh, what a
heartwarming reaction.

402
00:18:57,483 --> 00:19:00,783
It's such a pleasure to have
you on this trip, my dear.

403
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:03,083
-The pleasure is all
mine, Mr. Tessai.

404
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,416
-All right everyone.

405
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,683
Your attention, please.

406
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:09,683
All eyes right
over here-- voila!

407
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:12,616
This is the gate that
leads to the Soul Society.

408
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,183
It's called the Senkaiman,
or Tunnel World Gate.

409
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:18,916
I'm going to tell you all how
to successfully pass through it.

410
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,016
But first we need
to change one thing.

411
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,150
-Wow!

412
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:24,550
-Hey, how about
giving me a little

413
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,016
warning next time Urahara.

414
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,150
-So Ichigo, you're not
inside this Ichigo anymore?

415
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:30,183
-Don't talk about me like
I'm some kind of doll

416
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:31,183
with changeable outfits.

417
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:32,616
-All right, listen up.

418
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,650
Unlike normal gates, this
one has a spirit particle

419
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:37,783
conversion machine.

420
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:39,616
-What the hell are
you talking about?

421
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,016
-I'll explain.

422
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,950
As you already know, the Soul
Society is a spirit world.

423
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,583
Unless you're in spirit form
it's impossible to enter.

424
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:50,750
Right now only one of
you can cross through

425
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:53,750
as a spirit-- Ichigo,
a Soul Reaper.

426
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:56,450
The conversion machine will
transform the rest of you

427
00:19:56,483 --> 00:19:58,216
into spirits as well.

428
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,083
-So you're saying the gate
will let us pass through

429
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,716
without extracting our souls?

430
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,750
-Yes.

431
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:05,216
Passing through the
conversion machine

432
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,416
will allow you to stay
in your present forms.

433
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,983
-All right, we understand.

434
00:20:09,016 --> 00:20:10,016
Let's get going!

435
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,383
Ah!

436
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,050
-But there's a catch.

437
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,216
The window of time the
gate can be kept open

438
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,450
for you is only
four minutes long.

439
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:20,916
-But is that enough time?

440
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,083
-Ordinarily no.

441
00:20:23,116 --> 00:20:25,950
In fact, the whole
scheme is a little shaky.

442
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,783
Four minutes with the gate
is all I can give you.

443
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,983
After that it will
close and anyone

444
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:33,416
who hasn't made it through
yet will be trapped forever

445
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,683
in the Dangai, the
precipice world

446
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:38,083
between this world
and the Soul Society.

447
00:20:38,116 --> 00:20:39,916
-How will we ever make it?

448
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,583
-Go forward.

449
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:44,383
Remember what I told you about
the connection between heart

450
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,516
and soul.

451
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,083
You must have no doubt.

452
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:48,416
Have no fear.

453
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,883
Do not think of those
you are leaving behind.

454
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,483
The will to go forward
will be your guide.

455
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:54,916
And don't look back.

456
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,783
Only those who can
do these things

457
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:59,983
can follow me through
the gate and survive.

458
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:03,183
-We all know this already or
we wouldn't still be here.

459
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:06,050
Quit with all your preaching
and let's do this thing now!

460
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,516
-And you understand
that if you lose

461
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,116
you can never return to
this life again, right?

462
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,950
-Then all I need
to do is win, huh?

463
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:15,450
-Exactly.

464
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,550
-So, everybody ready?

465
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,383
As soon as it opens, run
in as fast as you can.

466
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,183
-Right.

467
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,150
-Good luck.

468
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,316
Ah!

469
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,816
Ooh.

470
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:44,083
We're all counting
on you, Ichigo.

471
00:21:52,149 --> 00:22:02,182
[theme music]

472
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:53,449
[theme music]

473
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:54,282
-What is that thing?

474
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:55,115
CHAD (OFFSCREEN): A mountain.

475
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:56,315
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): A whale?

476
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:57,682
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN): No,
it's a gatekeeper giant.

477
00:22:57,715 --> 00:22:59,449
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Well,
there you have it.

478
00:22:59,482 --> 00:23:00,115
OK, Kurasaki.

479
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:01,015
You handle him.

480
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,182
CHAD (OFFSCREEN): Go for it.

481
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:02,749
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
You can do it.

482
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:03,782
-You're the man!

483
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:04,749
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
OK, I guess I am.

484
00:23:04,782 --> 00:23:07,249
-Long hair is not allowed!
