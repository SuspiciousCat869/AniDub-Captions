who has been kidnapped
by the Arrancars,

5
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:55,711
Ichigo, Chad, and
Uryu have snuck

00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:59,245
into the world of the
Hollows, known as Hueco Mundo.

00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:02,045
Upon exiting the garganta,
the three comrades

8
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,611
found themselves in an
underground passageway

00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:06,578
filled with booby traps.

10
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:09,145
After narrowly surviving
the treacherous corridor,

11
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:12,011
our heroes entered the basement
of an unknown building, where

12
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:15,778
they were confronted by
Arrancar gatekeepers.

13
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:18,278
-Where do you think
you're going, intruder?

It couldn't.

No way.

00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:41,345
-I'd rather not.

24
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:43,611
You see, I don't
enjoy finishing off

25
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:45,411
an enemy who's lost
his will to fight.

26
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:54,211
But in this situation,
I just can't

27
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:57,578
allow myself to feel
any pity for your kind.

You cursed humans.

-I already told you, Arrancar.

35
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:56,911
I'm a Quincy.

00:04:56,945 --> 00:04:58,911
That's why I spared your life.

37
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:01,478
I want you to give
Aizen a full report.

38
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,811
Go back and tell him
it's not the Soul Reapers

39
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,645
he should be afraid of.

40
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:09,378
He should fear the Quincy's!

-The room's collapsing.

45
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:17,711
-Yeah, that's because
the two of you

46
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:19,145
weakened it with
all the fighting.

47
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:20,745
We're in the basement
of a building.

48
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,511
How are we supposed
to get out of here?

-You don't.

50
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,945
No one will be leaving now.

51
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:29,378
That's how the
room was designed.

52
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,845
We are the guardians
of this portal,

53
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:35,645
and our orders are very clear.

54
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:38,811
Anyone who tries to get to
Las Noches through this room,

55
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:41,678
without permission,
has to be eliminated.

56
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:48,478
If we fail in that mission,
the sentence is death.

57
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:49,845
Pure and simple.

58
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:54,611
We will all be crushed
as the room collapses.

59
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,111
This is the type
of enemy you face.

60
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,445
The war will be without end.

61
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:01,511
There will be no
victory for you.

Let's get out of here, quick!

00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:10,545
-You think you should
be feared, Quincy?

65
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,511
-Huh?

66
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,411
-You've got things all wrong.

67
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:15,378
And your arrogance will
lead to your death.

68
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,278
Lord Aizen fears nothing.

69
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:22,378
That's why we bow before him.

70
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:27,245
For creatures like us, born from
fear, a man afraid of nothing

71
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:30,445
shines like the moon against
the blackness of night.

72

Everything is illuminated,
everything is focused.

73
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:37,978
And ultimately,
everything makes sense.

It's completely desolate.

but they seem to be withered.

-They're not exactly plants.

84
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:38,711
They're made of some kind
of quartz-like crystals.

It looks like some kind
of palace, or fortress.

It has to be that Las Noches

-I'm not actually sure
how far away it is.

-Well, at least seeing
it from a distance

93
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:07,311
gives us an idea of its size.

really change anything.

than going in blind.

We're here to find
Orihime, and at this point,

99

I'm going to assume that's
where they're keeping her.

-You're probably right.

There isn't any other
place they could hide her.

Wait a minute.

Is it really supposed to be
this calm inside a tornado?

It's a spiritual partition.

-A spirit what?

179
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:03,345
Isn't this the thing we used
when we went to save Rukia?

How'd we end up
inside one of those?

like this might happen,

Where did you pick
up this spirit orb?

Answer the question.

192

Don't tell me you swiped
it from Kukaku's place?

-You moron.

As a matter of fact,
Kukaku gave one to me.

Uryu Ishida, Yasutora
Sado, and Ichigo Kurosaki.

When you said we
were under attack,

I assumed it was
some kind of army.

these so-called kids.

They're humans who were
once labeled Ryoka.

better, I'd think

Members of the Espada,
as I pointed out to you,

we have three enemies.

280
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,745
It's unwise to
underestimate them,

281
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:13,679
but there's no need to
become overwrought, either.

282
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,845
All of you are to
return to your quarters,

283
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:18,879
and behave as if
everything were normal.

284
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:21,145
Don't be impatient,
just sit and wait

285
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,145
for the enemy to come to us.

286
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,379
And don't be concerned.

Regardless of the
situation, as long

288

as you remain calm,
and stay with me,

00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,145
they are no match for us.

We're unstoppable.

-Dammit.

292
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:45,479
It seems like we've been running
across this desert for hours.

293
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:48,745
And no matter what, we're not
any closer to that structure.

-Hm.

It's all perspective.

296
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:55,879
The crystal trees in front of
it look as small as needles.

297
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:58,745
For the trees to look that
small from this distance,

298
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:02,012
and the palace itself to
look so big in contrast,

299
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:06,012
we have to assume that
it's unbelievably huge.

-You sure it isn't
some kind of mirage?

-It's not a mirage.

There's no way we'd be
able to see a mirage here.

of a mirage to you, Ichigo?

Huh?

You know, when we
first got here,

307
00:19:36,112 --> 00:19:37,445
I thought we
discovered that this

308
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,845
was a world where
nothing was able to live.

309
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,612
But surprisingly, there are
some little animals here.

310
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:44,279
Even though they're all Hollows.

311
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:45,512
Now wait.

312
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:47,579
Don't Hollows have to
constantly eat human souls,

just to survive?

314

I wonder what these little guys
end up eating to stay alive.

315
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:56,112
-Here in Hueco Mundo,
reishi is highly

316
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:59,479
concentrated throughout the air.

317
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:03,079
That's good for the
smaller Hollows.

318
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:07,079
I imagine they can absorb enough
energy by simply breathing.

319
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:08,312
-There's reishi in the air?

320

Come on.

321
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,945
How could you even know that?

322
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,845
-Quincy's make use of the
ambient reishi when they fight.

323
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:26,912
The higher the density of
reishi, the stronger we are.

324
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:29,845
I confirmed that in
the last battle we had.

325
00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:31,945
Once I get the hang
of it, I should

00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:34,945
be able to fight better than
in the world of the living.

327
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:37,145
Or even in the Soul Society.

328
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:38,845
-Oh, well that's interesting.

329
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:41,779
You say you function better when
there's a lot of reishi around.

330
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:43,545
He sure sounds like
a Hollow to me!

331
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:44,812
-Excuse me.

332
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,879
Soul Reapers are
practically the same.

333
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,745
-I'm not.

334
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,579
I'm different.

335
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:50,345
-Yeah right, just you.

336
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,012
Rukia had to go back
to the Soul Society

337
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:54,312
for awhile, before she
could regain her powers.

338
00:20:54,345 --> 00:20:56,012
-Rukia's just weird like that.

339
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,245
-Keep this in mind.

340
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:03,479
The higher amount of reishi
benefits the Arrancars

341
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,745
as well as me.

342
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,445
I don't know how
many Hollows Aizen

343
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,279
has turned into Arrancars.

344
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:10,145
More to the point,
it's hard to say

345
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:12,112
how well he's able
to control them.

346
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,145
As far as the Arrancars
are concerned,

347
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:16,779
we're not only the
enemy, we're also food.

348
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:19,445
Even if we should come across
a normal looking Hollow,

349
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,945
we're going to have
to be extra vigilant.

350
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:25,312
The way I figure, the additional
reishi in Hueco Mundo's air

351
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:27,045
will make it a lot
stronger than it ever

352
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,112
would be if we encountered it
in the world of the living.

353
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:31,779
Therefore, we need
to carefully--

354
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:32,912
-You talk too much, Uryu.

355
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:33,879
Let's roll.

356
00:21:33,912 --> 00:21:35,212
-Hey, stop interrupting me.

357
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:36,479
This is important.

358
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,012
-Dude, you're such
a pain in the ass.

359
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:39,579
But you're free to keep talking.

360
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:41,079
Let's go, Chad.

361
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:41,579
-Wait!

362
00:21:59,045 --> 00:21:59,645
-A human?

363
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,012
-No way.

364
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:03,412
There can't be another human
living here, that's impossible.

365
00:22:03,445 --> 00:22:04,545
-We'll deal with that later.

366
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:06,045
We've got to save her!

367
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,976
[theme music]

368
00:23:43,676 --> 00:23:44,943
-Pop quiz, everyone.

369
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:48,010
Have you memorized all the
Espada's names and numbers?

370
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:49,776
-Sure, I'm ten,
and Grimmjow is--

371
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,176
-If this happens, use the
Espada quick reference chart.

372
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,210
-That makes it easy!

373
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:54,976
-Sweet!

374
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,043
I could use one of those.

375
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:58,410
-They're not available
to Soul Reapers.
