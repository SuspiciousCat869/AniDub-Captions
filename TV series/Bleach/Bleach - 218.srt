00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,751
NARRATOR: Sosuke Aizen had
entered the World of the Living

3
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:55,284
and aimed to destroy Karakura
Town's enriched spirit zone.

4
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:58,484
The Soul Reapers devised a
plan to stop his assault.

5
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,784
They set up a Tenkai
Kecchu around the perimeter

6
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:06,351
of Karakura Town and replaced
the entire town with a replica.

7
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:10,051
Ikkaku Madarame, Izuru
Kira, Yumichika Ayasegawa,

8
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:11,818
and Shuhei Hisagi
were dispatched

9
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:13,184
to defend the pillars.

10
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:14,851
Each of them fought
a deadly member

11
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,218
of Barragan's Fracciones.

12
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:20,318
Yumichika faced off against
Charlotte Chuhlhourne.

13
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:23,751
It quickly became personal,
devolving into a bizarre beauty

14
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:24,818
pageant.

15
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:26,584
Charlotte trumpeted
his own good looks,

16
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:29,051
while Yumichika claimed
he was better looking.

17
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:35,951
CHARLOTTE: A princess
always gets her way.

18
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:39,618
It may not be fair, but
that's the way things are.

19
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:53,584
-This blackness-- what is it?

20
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:58,684
-Rosa Blanca, the sentence
of the white rose.

21
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:02,151
Your enveloped in this
briar, covered with black.

22
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:03,518
This is your fate.

23
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,218
You will die here,
unseen by anyone,

24
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,784
smothered in white petals.

25
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:15,151
YUMICHIKA: Completely
unseen by anyone?

26
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:16,718
-That's right.

27
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:22,118
YUMICHIKA: No one can
see in here at all?

28
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:29,051
In that case, thank you.

29
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,151
-Huh?

30
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:33,751
YUMICHIKA: Tear in
frenzy, Ruri'iro Kujaku!

31
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:43,051
CHARLOTTE: [gasp]

32
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:51,918
[whimper]

33
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:56,418
What is all this?

34
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:58,751
-The final act.

35
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:02,051
The flowers are feasting
on your life force.

36
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:04,151
All the spirit
energy you radiate

37
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:09,918
is being stolen and
absorbed into these buds.

38
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:12,884
Do you understand?

39
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,618
The moment those
flowers bloom will

40
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:20,818
be the moment your life
ends, Charlotte, Chuhlhourne.

41
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:21,318
-No!

42
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:13,751
-Now I'll enjoy some
of your spirit energy.

43
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:25,618
Thank you very much.

44
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:29,918
CHARLOTTE: [groan]
You-- you're so sly,

45
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:31,884
hiding it all this time.

46
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,084
Such an incredible technique.

47
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:38,684
I guess that was your
Zanpakuto's second form,

48
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:40,951
your Bankai?

49
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:43,318
Huh?

50
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:44,751
-Not quite.

51
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:45,784
That wasn't a Bankai.

52
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:57,784
You see, my Zanpakuto's actual
name is Ruri'iro Kujako.

53
00:05:57,818 --> 00:06:00,084
My sword is a little particular.

54
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:02,818
It actually has
a favorite color.

55
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:05,784
It simply adores
the color sapphire,

56
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:09,084
and it despises
the color lavender.

57
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:14,351
The name Fuji-- well, it
roughly translates to lavender.

58
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:17,451
My sword absolutely
loathes that name.

59
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:22,551
So it never fully releases
when I address is as such.

60
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:23,918
-But why?

61
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:24,884
Why would you do that?

62
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,351
YUMICHIKA: Among the
13 Court Guard Squads,

63
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:34,284
my Squad, Number 11, has by
far the strongest fighters.

64
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:36,518
Everyone who serves
under Captain Zaraki

65
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:40,218
is a bloodthirsty warrior
who lives to fight.

66
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:43,251
Each squad member would
prefer to die in battle.

67
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:49,518
This mindset eventually led to
an unspoken rule between us,

68
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:53,751
that our Zanpakuto would only
be the direct combat type.

69
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:57,351
Kido-type Zanpakuto are seen
as disgraceful and pathetic.

70
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,351
You'd be considered a
coward just for having one.

71
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:03,418
Naturally, I don't
want anyone in Squad 11

72
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:09,184
to know my sword's
abilities, especially Ikkaku

73
00:07:09,218 --> 00:07:11,251
and the captain.

74
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:13,784
So now you can understand
why when you hid me

75
00:07:13,818 --> 00:07:17,284
away behind that rose
bush, I thanked you.

76
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:23,484
In fact, if you hadn't
used that technique,

77
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:26,484
there's no way I could have
used this sword at all,

78
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:28,851
despite the consequences.

79
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:33,684
-Even if it meant that
you would lost to me?

80
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:36,018
-Yes, even then.

81
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,718
Even if it meant my life.

82
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:47,318
-Your resolve is truly stunning.

83
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:49,318
[bang]

84
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:55,284
-[shout]

85
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:09,784
What gives?

86
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:12,618
Aren't you going
to draw that sword?

87
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:15,418
-This is the only weapon I need.

88
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:16,718
-Is that so?

89
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:19,651
-I'm aware of how
dense your Hierro is.

90
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:24,351
-Oh, so you fought against
an Arrancar before, have you?

91
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:24,851
-Yeah.

92
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:36,018
So, big fella, why don't
you tell me your name?

93
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:37,984
-Why on earth would
I tell you that?

94
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,518
I have no need to reveal my
name to some lowly weakling who

95
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:43,151
I'm about to destroy.

96
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:44,084
-Ha.

97
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:45,451
Fine, keep it to yourself.

98
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:48,051
See if I care.

99
00:08:48,084 --> 00:08:54,118
But I'm Captain Zaraki's
third seat, Ikkaku Madarame.

100
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:56,684
Personally, I think it's polite
to tell a person your name

101
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:58,951
before you kill them.

102
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:01,418
But then, that's just my style!

103
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:14,884
-Huh?

104
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:32,351
[grunting]

105
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,651
-I don't get it.

106
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:49,451
-Don't get what?

107
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:50,984
-Earlier I thought
you told me you

108
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:54,551
were going to battle with all
the power of a lieutenant.

109
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:56,418
But right now, I'd
peg your strength

110
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:59,184
at the level of a
fifth seat, if that.

111
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:02,284
So what's really going on?

112
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:03,584
-Exacta!

113
00:10:03,618 --> 00:10:05,018
You got it.

114
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:05,518
-Hm?

115
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,618
I got what?

116
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:09,884
-As you just said, my
current power level

117
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:12,618
is exactly that of one
of your fifth seats.

118
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:14,984
It pleases me that
you guessed correctly,

119
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:18,918
but I should have expected
as much from lieutenant.

120
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,718
So, you pass.

121
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,884
-What?

122
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:24,518
FINDORR: That was a test.

123
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:27,451
I wanted to see whether or
not you could accurately

124
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:30,818
gauge my power level.

125
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:34,118
Because otherwise, what would
be the point of engaging you

126
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:36,451
at a more potent
lieutenant level.

127
00:10:36,484 --> 00:10:39,818
It's a waste if you can't
tell the difference.

128
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:42,118
-I don't like what
you're implying.

129
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:44,184
If I take what you're
saying at face value,

130
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:46,284
it sounds like you're
claiming you could somehow

131
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,184
fight with the strength
of a lieutenant

132
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:50,751
if that's what you wanted to do.

133
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:51,218
-Exacta.

134
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:57,251
I was at a fifth seat's level.

135
00:10:57,284 --> 00:10:58,618
But now--

136
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:03,551
-[gasp]

137
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:10,695
-Did his attack
just get stronger?

138
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:12,295
-Now I'm at a fourth seat.

139
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:19,595
Third seat.

140
00:11:19,628 --> 00:11:21,095
-[grunt] Stop playing!

141
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:28,228
-We're almost at the same level.

142
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:36,761
Get ready, 'cause now,
I'm at lieutenant.

143
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:11,795
-Bakudo Number 39, Enkosen!

144
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:20,528
ABIRAMA: [laughs]

145
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:22,461
-What the--?

146
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:24,128
ABIRAMA: Finished already?

147
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,028
That was pathetic, Izuru Kira!

148
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,228
But up against my Aguila,
it's not surprising.

149
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:39,761
These aren't ordinary
wings, you know.

150
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:49,461
They're wings of steel,
heavier than boulders.

151
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:51,961
Anything in their path
will be obliterated!

152
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:59,028
-Wings of steel, you say?

153
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,028
-Hm.

154
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:02,595
-That's a pretty good name.

155
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:04,528
Makes 'em sound strong.

156
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:08,028
However, it doesn't change the
fact that they're still wings.

157
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,361
-Huh?

158
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,595
Another strange spell?

159
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:23,661
-Hado Number 58, Tenran!

160
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:28,928
-So you thought if
they're just wings,

161
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:31,028
then a tornado might
mess them up, huh?

162
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,095
You're going to have
try harder than that!

163
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:42,495
Heh.

164
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:49,695
-His speed and power
are tough to deal with.

165
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,595
But if I can lure him into
a narrow space-- Hado Number

166
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:56,995
31, Shakkaho!

167
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:04,861
-He's letting me
know his position?

168
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:06,295
An obvious trap.

169
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:10,661
-Your move now.

170
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:23,795
-Quit trying to confuse
me, you damn rat!

171
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:25,228
Devorar Pluma!

172
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:32,361
-Those things can
pierce cement walls?

173
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:56,025
-There you are.

174
00:15:05,558 --> 00:15:06,692
Damn it.

175
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:08,925
That little pest is
hiding behind everything.

176
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,325
IZURU (VOICEOVER):
It doesn't look

177
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:12,292
like he's running out
of feathers, which

178
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,758
means they're
regenerating instantly.

179
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:18,725
They must regrow from
where he shoots them.

180
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:20,725
In which case--

181
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:22,558
-All this running around.

182
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:26,158
He's probably buying time while
he things up some kind of plan.

183
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,192
[laugh] Not going to happen.

184
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:37,392
-[shout]

185
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:38,725
-What?

186
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:41,125
What is that bizarre power!

187
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:43,592
-[shout]

188
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,925
Where'd you run
off to this time?

189
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:07,058
What's wrong?

190
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,825
Get your legs crushed?

191
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:11,558
Was I too fast for you?

192
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:12,592
Pathetic.

193
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,925
I wasn't even going
at my full speed.

194
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,725
IZURU: I should thank you.

195
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,392
-What?

196
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,425
-Your long range attacks
were pretty tough to handle.

197
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,558
In fact, this whole
time I've been

198
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:26,092
trying to figure out how to
draw you into close combat.

199
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:32,125
You see, my Zanpakuto
only works on objects

200
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,025
connected to my opponent.

201
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:36,425
-What the hell are
you talking about?

202
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,125
What do you think that
weird-looking sword of yours

203
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:40,225
can actually cut?

204
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:44,458
What?

205
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:45,925
No!

206
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,925
No!

207
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,892
[shout]

208
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:58,058
Damn it.

209
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,292
What is this?

210
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,492
My wings can't move.

211
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:05,592
IZURU: My blade doubles the
weight of anything it hits.

212
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,858
A second strike doubles
the weight again,

213
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:10,692
and a third doubles
it once more.

214
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:13,992
Now you've felt the power
of my Zanpakuto Wabisuke.

215
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,092
Now raise your head, Wabisuke.

216
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:28,625
Moments ago, as
you attacked me, I

217
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:33,725
managed to hit your wings
a total of four times.

218
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,925
If you weren't just
bragging, and your wings

219
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,358
are really heavier
than boulders,

220
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,992
there's no way can fly anymore.

221
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:42,358
-You bastard!

222
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:44,225
You're fighting dirty.

223
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:47,825
A true warrior doesn't
pull tricks like that.

224
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,258
-Fighting dirty?

225
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:53,725
Oh, forgive me, but weren't you
the one shouting and screaming,

226
00:17:53,758 --> 00:17:56,525
trying to get me to lose my
cool before the fight began?

227
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:02,325
If that's how a true warrior
is supposed to behave,

228
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:04,158
then I must not
understand the concept.

229
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:09,925
Squad Three's symbol
is the marigold,

230
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,125
a flower which
represents despair.

231
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:17,225
That in essence is the crux
of how my squad fights.

232
00:18:17,258 --> 00:18:21,125
Battles aren't supposed
to be heroic affairs.

233
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:24,458
They're not supposed
to be fun or exciting.

234
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:28,958
To us, every battle is
filled with despair.

235
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:35,058
They are dark,
horrifying, grisly.

236
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:38,125
We should fear warfare,
avoid it always, and whenever

237
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,858
possible, choose
the path of peace.

238
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:45,192
Which is why I
believe my Zanpakuto,

239
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:48,458
Wabisuke upholds Squad
Three's dreams philosophy

240
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:53,192
better than any other
weapon in the Soul Society.

241
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:56,858
Every time it strikes an
enemy, he becomes heavier,

242
00:18:56,892 --> 00:18:59,858
eventually collapsing
to his knees.

243
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:02,592
It's as if my blade
compels him to bow his head

244
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,792
and beg for forgiveness.

245
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:09,825
Wabisuke means to apologize.

246
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:17,425
-[grunt] [laughs]

247
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,425
-Hm?

248
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,592
What do you find funny?

249
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,792
-What the hell are
you talking about?

250
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:23,692
Despair?

251
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:24,492
Fear fighting?

252
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:25,292
Avoid battle?

253
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:31,392
I'll say to you what
you said before.

254
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:35,992
I must not understand
your concept.

255
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:39,358
[growl]

256
00:19:45,158 --> 00:19:49,758
If you ask me, a battle is
all about pushing yourself,

257
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:54,025
relishing it, so you
can crush your enemy!

258
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:55,692
It's supposed to
be exhilarating!

259
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:03,025
Your feeble technique
can't break me.

260
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:07,325
In the end, I won't be the
one bowing my head in apology.

261
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:09,758
It will be you.

262
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:10,758

[grunt]

266
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:54,525
[groan] How?

267
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,692
-I knew your fate was sealed
the moment my sword rendered

268
00:20:57,725 --> 00:21:00,358
even one of your wings useless.

269
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,358
No matter how hard it
tries to take to the air,

270
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:07,858
a bird who can't
fly is easy prey.

exactly this weird looking

00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:15,758
sword of mine could cut.

274
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:16,592
Isn't that right?

275
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,792
-Wait.

276
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:25,825
Please, don't.

277
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:28,958
-A true warrior would never
beg someone for his life.

278
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,458
Farewell, warrior of the sky.

279
00:21:56,492 --> 00:22:01,258
Promise me that you'll
never forgive me.
