THEME SONG: (SINGING
IN JAPANESE)

2
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:47,981
-Damn it.

3
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:50,147
How many freaking steps
does this stupid stairway

4
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:51,614
have, anyway?

5
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:53,647
-What difference does it
make how many there are?

6
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:03,747
-Finally, we made it to the top.

7
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:04,781
-Nobody up here, either.

8
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:06,447
Security seems pretty lax.

9
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:09,147
All right then, guys, let's just
head straight for the tower.

10
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,581
-(TEARFULLY) Oh, Captain.

11
00:02:45,614 --> 00:02:47,047
[footsteps]

12
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,681
-You look terrible.

13
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,314
MOMO: Rangiku, I--

14
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:57,147
-So have you finally
calmed down yet?

15
00:02:57,181 --> 00:03:02,547
-Uh, oh, yes, I have.

16
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:05,381
I'm sorry I lost
control out there.

17
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:08,047
I made trouble for
you too, Rangiku.

18
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:08,847
-Huh?

19
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:10,314
Oh, listen, it's no problem.

20
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:11,781
Never mind about me.

21
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:16,014
You're the one who's in
big trouble right now.

22
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:18,614
-Yeah, I know.

23
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:20,047
What's going on out there?

24
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:22,714
-Hmm?

25
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:24,714
It's a complete disaster.

26
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,414
Something like this
happening right here

27
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:29,047
in the midst of all the
squads, it's unheard of.

28
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,147
And with this Ryoka
situation, everyone

29
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:34,981
is disorganized, acting on
their own without any focus.

30
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:39,081
-But what about-- what about
Captain Aizen's murderer?

31
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:41,681
-They're still gathering
evidence from the crime scene.

32
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:43,381
We just have to wait
for the head captain

33
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:45,414
to announce his findings.

34
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:47,247
-Evidence?

35
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:48,881
But I already know
who killed him!

36
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:49,547
It was--

37
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:50,814
-Don't say it, Momo.

38
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:55,314
That is an accusation
that you can't make.

39
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:57,014
I understand.

40
00:03:57,047 --> 00:03:59,681
I know you want to see
that justice is done,

41
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:03,747
but you should be more concerned
about your own Squad Five.

42
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:04,681
Think about it.

43
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:06,647
All in one day,
your squad has lost

44
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:09,081
both its captain and lieutenant.

45
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:11,914
I appreciate that you're
hurt and you're angry.

46
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:15,847
Nevertheless, when
this happened,

47
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,414
the actions you took upon
discovering Captain Aizen's

48
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:20,914
body, confronting
Captain Ichimaru,

49
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:23,347
and releasing the energy
of your Zanpakuto,

50
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,414
was there no other choice?

51
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:28,381
Nothing else you might have
done in that situation?

52
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:29,947
If you think about
it, I'm sure you'll

53
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:33,981
realize that you did have some
other options at that point.

54
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:36,414
The title of lieutenant
demands that it should never

55
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:38,481
be taken so lightly,
no matter what.

56
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,181
-You're right.

57
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:44,381
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,914
I just-- I thought if I could--

59
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:52,547
-Here.

60
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:54,614
This was in Captain
Aizen's room.

61
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:56,514
It's addressed to you.

62
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,747
-These are from the captain?

63
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,814
They're for me?

64
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:08,347
-You're lucky it was my
captain who found it.

65
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:10,381
But you need to know, if
it had been anyone else,

66
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:11,814
they probably would
have seized it

67
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:13,347
as evidence for
the investigation.

68
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,781
And it never would
have reached you.

69
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:18,781
I haven't read any of it, and
I don't know what it says.

70
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:21,681
But it seems to me that
as a loyal lieutenant,

71
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:24,114
you should be very honored
to know that your captain's

72
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:28,381
last words were for you.

73
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:30,314
I hope you appreciate it.

74
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:31,781
-Oh, I do.

75
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:33,147
Thanks so much, Rangiku.

76
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:02,147
AIZEN (VOICEOVER): Momo, if
you're reading this letter,

77
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:07,114
then it means I
didn't make it back.

78
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:08,781
MOMO (VOICEOVER): He knew.

79
00:06:08,814 --> 00:06:12,214
He knew someone
was targeting him.

80
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,881
Then last night,
after I fell asleep,

81
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:20,014
he wrote this letter knowing
he might not see me again.

82
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:20,981
Oh, Captain.

83
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:25,647
AIZEN (VOICEOVER): I
know my actions lately

84
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:28,347
have been the source
of great worry to you.

85
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:31,781
And for that, I am truly sorry.

86
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:34,214
Until now, I've
never spoken to you

87
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:37,447
about the feelings of
apprehension I've been having.

88
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:42,114
But you must understand, Momo,
that whatever I kept from you,

89
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:45,347
it was only because I
wanted, if at all possible,

90
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:48,547
to keep you from becoming
involved in all this.

91
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:53,114
Sadly, I have now done just
that, and you are involved.

92
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:58,247
I hope that somehow you can find
it in your heart to forgive me.

93
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,747
The chain of events
was unavoidable.

94
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:05,847
As for me, I am probably
no longer among the living.

95
00:07:05,881 --> 00:07:10,514
Therefore, to you, who I
trust more than any other,

96
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:12,981
I leave this record of the
truths I have uncovered.

97
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:16,881
-Oh, no.

98
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:37,147
-This spiritual pressure,
it's incredible.

99
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:40,947
-Crap.

100
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:45,181
We gotta run.

101
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,747
I don't know what's
going on here,

102
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,747
but I'll tell you for
sure there's someone close

103
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:50,914
by we don't want
to meet up with.

104
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:52,814
We have got to move
and get the tower

105
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,214
before the enemy finds us.

106
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:56,047
-Right.

107
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:56,814
-I'll try.

108
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:57,981
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Come on.

109
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,314
KENPACHI (VOICEOVER):
He's finally here.

110
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:07,847
I was getting tired of waiting.

111
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,814
Well now, let's see.

112
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:25,647
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
Something's wrong here.

113
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:27,114
What's going on?

114
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:31,181
We've been running for a while
now, but I can still feel him.

115
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:34,681
We haven't put any distance at
all between us and the enemy.

116
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,347
My legs feel heavy,
like I'm running

117
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:39,247
in quicksand or something.

118
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:41,014
But I'm running fast.

119
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:42,514
I know I am.

120
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:45,681
And the spiritual pressure,
it's like someone's

121
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:48,981
got a blade pressed right
up against my throat.

122
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:56,981
-What the hell are you doing?

123
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,614
This is no time for a break.

124
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:00,514
-I can't keep running.

125
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:03,981
I've got no strength left.

126
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:06,514
-You sure can be a
pain in the ass, kid.

127
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,981
-Are you two all
right back there?

128
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,081
-Never mind us.

129
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:11,681
Get moving, Ichigo.

130
00:09:11,714 --> 00:09:13,781
KENPACHI (VOICEOVER):
Three of them, huh?

131
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:17,547
Which is the one?

132
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:19,514
Not that one.

133
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:21,014
Not that one.

134
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:30,914
Are you the one?

135
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:51,114
What's the matter with you?

136
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:53,647
How long are you going to
keep looking over there?

137
00:09:53,681 --> 00:09:54,147
-Huh?

138
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,647
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
What-- what the hell?

139
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:15,204
KENPACHI (VOICEOVER):
What's the matter with you?

140
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:17,570
How long are you going to
keep looking over there?

141
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:18,070
-Huh?

142
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,037
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): What
the hell just happened?

143
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,737
I could swear I
just got stabbed.

144
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,370
But murderous intent.

145
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:39,704
Could just the intent to kill
actually have such power?

146
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:42,404
-Are you Ichigo Kurosaki?

147
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:44,304
-How do you know my name?

148
00:10:44,337 --> 00:10:46,404
And who are you anyway?

149
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,204
-Come on.

150
00:10:47,237 --> 00:10:49,270
I'm sure Ikkaku told you that.

151
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:50,404
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Ikkaku?

152
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:50,904
Wait.

153
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,637
IKKAKU: Just a minute.

154
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,704
Can I ask you question?

155
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:01,704
Who's the strongest
member of your group?

156
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:05,070
-That's me, I guess.

157
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:09,637
-If so, then I suggest
you keep an eye out

158
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,070
for my captain, Ichigo.

159
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,904
The captain has no
interest in fighting

160
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:15,604
against weak opponents.

161
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:18,504
If it's true that you are
the strongest, then it's you

162
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:19,837
he'll come after.

163
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,004
-Is that good?

164
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:25,304
-You'll find out when you meet.

165
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:28,337
That is, if you can somehow
manage to stay alive

166
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,937
long enough after he finds
you to take his measure.

167
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,370
-Tell me what his name is.

168
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,570
-I'm captain of Squad
11, Kenpachi Zaraki.

169
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,437
I'm here to fight
you to the death.

170
00:11:57,337 --> 00:12:00,337
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): I felt that
same spiritual pressure again,

171
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,537
pressure strong enough to reach
through the sekkiseki rock

172
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,037
walls of this tower.

173
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,537
What is going on out there?

174
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,104
-I want to leave you with
some unconfirmed information.

175
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:16,104
They say that a
group of intruders

176
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:18,737
attempted to enter the
Soul Society yesterday,

177
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,104
five of them.

178
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:22,837
Now my sources say one of
them carried a sword as long

179
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:28,004
as his body, a Soul Reaper
with orange colored hair.

180
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:33,070
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Ichigo, is it really you?

181
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:36,237
I've prayed you would
be able to stay alive.

182
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,037
You must give up on me
and get away from here!

183
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,137
In this world, Ichigo,
there are forces

184
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,070
you can never
understand, forces which

185
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:49,237
defy the logic in the
world of the living.

186
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,037
Please, forget about me.

187
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,070
Run.

188
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:55,570
Run away from this
place so you can live!

189
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:03,504
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
So this is him.

190
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:06,904
Kenpachi Zaraki, the
famous captain of Squad 11.

191
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:13,804
-If you should encounter any
captains, don't fight them.

192
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:15,537
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
The spiritual pressure

193
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,370
I've bee sensing all
this time was his.

194
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:21,770
I already know there's
no running away from it.

195
00:13:21,804 --> 00:13:23,137
-What's wrong?

196
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,004
Is something the matter
with your hearing?

197
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:29,804
I've just challenged you
to a fight to the death.

198
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:33,237
I assume, since you won't answer
me, it's all right with you

199
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,037
if I start.

200
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:39,037
-Ganju, Hanataro.

201
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,137
Hana-- Hey, are you OK?

202
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,970
GANJU (VOICEOVER):
Ichigo, you idiot.

203
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:44,837
ICHIGO: But, Ganju.

204
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,370
-We just got the
wind knocked out

205
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:48,337
of us by this
spiritual pressure.

206
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,837
But that's not what you should
be thinking about right now.

207
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,937
Worry about the issue at hand.

208
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,670
Face your enemy, or
he'll take you out

209
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,437
before you know what hit you.

210
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,304
-Whoa, just look
at all that drool.

211
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:01,737
-Huh?

212
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,137
-You must've scared that
little guy pretty bad,

213
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,004
Kenny, to make him do that.

214
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:08,670
Uh-oh.

215
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:10,104
I think I made him mad.

216
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:11,370
-Well, what did you expect?

217
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:12,337
That was just stupid.

218
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,770
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
What the hell?

219
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:15,104
Where'd she come from?

220
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:17,137
And how could she be unaffected
by his spiritual pressure?

221
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,704
-And stupid is as
stupid does, right?

222
00:14:19,737 --> 00:14:21,804
-Well, you said it, not me.

223
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:24,104
ICHIGO: Hey, twerp
with the pink hair.

224
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:24,670
-Huh?

225
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:26,337
-Who are you?

226
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,870
Or maybe I should
ask, what are you?

227
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,070
-My name is Yachiru Kusajishi.

228
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:36,770
I'm also known as the
lieutenant of the 11th Squad.

229
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:38,204
It's nice of you to ask.

230
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:39,137
Thanks.

231
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,537
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
A lieutenant?

232
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,370
The same rank as Renji?

233
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:46,270
But I didn't even
sense her presence.

234
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:48,404
I didn't noticed her at
all until she landed right

235
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:51,337
on my shoulder.

236
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,170
Obviously, she's no
ordinary opponent either.

237
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:56,437
-Hey, Ganju.

238
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,370
-Right here.

239
00:14:57,404 --> 00:14:59,704
-Get Hanataro up
and go on ahead.

240
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:01,004
You save Rukia.

241
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:02,870
I'll deal with
these two somehow.

242
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:03,537
-No way.

243
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,237
You're going to need--

244
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:04,904
-Ganju!

245
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,337
---help with-- huh?

246
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:06,804
-Please.

247
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,837
-Oh, wow.

248
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,470
Now you're all alone.

249
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:20,370
-I'm sorry, but I can't
let you follow them.

250
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:22,670
KENPACHI: You really
don't understand, do you?

251
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:23,537
-What?

252
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,937
-Don't make me repeat myself.

253
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,404
I've been waiting for you
to get here for some time

254
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:30,937
now, in the hopes
of a decent fight.

255
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,237
I'm not the least bit
interested in your two friends,

256
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,637
nor, for that matter, your
mission to free that Rukia.

257
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,004
-Oh yeah, is that so?

258
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:48,304
-Not bad.

259
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:50,804
Though your stance is too
rigid and you leave gaps

260
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:54,537
in your defence, I must say your
spiritual pressure is something

261
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,437
else, way too much for
even some lieutenants.

262
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,770
No wonder Ikkaku lost to you.

263
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:05,070
But even with that, you're
still nowhere near my level.

264
00:16:05,104 --> 00:16:07,604
I'll tell you what,
Ichigo Kurosaki,

265
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:09,204
I'll give you an advantage.

266
00:16:09,237 --> 00:16:10,504
-Give me a what?

267
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:14,037
-I'll let you go ahead
and have the first strike.

268
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,237
I'll stand here and you can
cut me anywhere you want.

269
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,204
-Wow, Kenny.

270
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:21,170
You're the most
generous captain ever.

271
00:16:21,204 --> 00:16:22,370
-Aren't I?

272
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:25,404
I'm just a walking bleeding
heart of generosity.

273
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:26,670
-Quit playing around with me!

274
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:27,170
-Huh?

275
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:28,170
-Hmm?

276
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:29,537
-Is this some kind
of a joke to you?

277
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,570
You think I can attack
someone who hasn't even

278
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:32,737
drawn his sword?

279
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,504
Don't mock me.

280
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:37,170
-I'm not mocking you at all.

281
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,170
I'm giving you a free shot.

282
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:42,037
Not wanting to attack someone
who hasn't drawn his weapon

283
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,804
is certainly admirable.

284
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,604
But I think you might want to
save that sort of gallantry

285
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:49,404
for another occasion.

286
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:50,270
Come on.

287
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:51,870
Lighten up.

288
00:16:51,904 --> 00:16:53,670
Let's have a little fun.

289
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:56,770
It's a question of
kill or be killed.

290
00:16:56,804 --> 00:17:01,137
Really, what better way can you
think of to spend one's days?

291
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,704
You could go from my
throat or for my gut.

292
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:05,470
Take out my eyeball if you want.

293
00:17:05,504 --> 00:17:08,770
Or if you're lucky, you might
kill me with a single strike.

294
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:11,804
Just quit your
quivering and attack!

295
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,604
-No, Ichigo.

296
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:22,337
Ichigo, don't do it!

297
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:22,837
Run!

298
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,670
-Hold still.

299
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,204
-What do think you're
doing, squirming

300
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:30,570
around when I'm
trying to carry you?

301
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:32,637
-But we can't leave
Ichigo behind.

302
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,837
We can't.

303
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,304
-Now that you mention it,
you're probably right.

304
00:17:36,337 --> 00:17:39,637
But still, he-- he said
he could handle them.

305
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,737
-Handle them?

306
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,537
Are you crazy?

307
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,470
By himself?

308
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:43,004
He can't.

309
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:43,637
He's got--

310
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,170
-Hey, settle down.

311
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:45,004
---to get away.

312
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:45,704
It's the only way he'll survive.

313
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:46,470
-Settle down, Hanataro.

314
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:47,804
-But you don't understand.

315
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:50,104
There's no way Ichigo can
win, even with all his skill.

316
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,004
It's impossible.

317
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,370
He'll be killed.

318
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,104
-Do you know him, Hanataro, that
spiky-headed guy back there?

319
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:58,037
What's the Story

320
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,704
-He is-- he's the captain
of the infamous Squad

321
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:05,604
11, Kenpachi Zaraki.

322
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:08,437
The name Kenpachi is passed
down through the generations

323
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,104
to the one among
the 13 squads who

324
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:12,637
most savors fighting
and killing.

325
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,704
That name means that
the one who carries it

326
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:19,870
will never go down, no matter
how many times he's wounded.

327
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:23,470
It goes way beyond any question
of power or weakness or skill

328
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:24,037
or strength.

329
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,204
He can't die.

330
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:27,670
He's invincible.

331
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:29,670
And if Ichigo
fights, then Ichigo

332
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:31,870
is certain to die at his hands.

333
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:35,004
-In that case, we
definitely can't go back.

334
00:18:35,037 --> 00:18:37,604
We'll keep going forward
and try to reach Rukia.

335
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:38,604
-But, Ganju, we--

336
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:41,204
-Hey, shut your mouth.

337
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:42,937
Listen up.

338
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,504
Ichigo gave us a job to do.

339
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:48,970
He told us to save Rukia, right?

340
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:52,404
You felt that incredible
spiritual pressure back there.

341
00:18:52,437 --> 00:18:53,804
We all did.

342
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:56,804
So you can be sure Ichigo knows
that wired-headed freak isn't

343
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,137
normal.

344
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,204
I'm sure that's why he stayed
behind to fight him alone

345
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:02,437
and ordered us to go on ahead.

346
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,670
He knew exactly what
he was doing, Hanataro.

347
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:08,870
That's because, for Ichigo,
the main priority is the same

348
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:11,637
as it's always been, and that's
to save this Rukia Kuchiki

349
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,604
person no matter what happens.

350
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:15,537
Do you understand, Hanataro?

351
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,070
We've been entrusted by
Ichigo to carry out its order.

352
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:19,637
He's counting on us.

353
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,337
-I see, Ganju.

354
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,804
-If you see, then you know
we haven't a second to lose.

355
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:24,637
Let's get moving.

356
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,504
-Oh, yes, right.

357
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:29,537
GANJU (VOICEOVER):
Ichigo, after we've

358
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,270
saved Rukia, I swear
we'll come back for you.

359
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:36,270
When this is all over, we'll
come back to the Rukon District

360
00:19:36,304 --> 00:19:37,637
together.

361
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,604
We still have a lot of things
I want to talk to you about.

362
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:45,037
So until then, Ichigo,
don't you dare die.

363
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:56,578
[hums]

364
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:03,211
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
This can't be happening.

365
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,578
I know I swung with full force.

366
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:07,111
And I know I didn't miss.

367
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:11,011
How can there not even
be a scratch on him?

368
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:14,778
And how can it be that my
hand is bleeding instead?

369
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:16,911
Impossible.

370
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:19,078
KENPACHI: Is that it?

371
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:21,511
Is that really all you have?

372
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:22,211
I'm disappointed.

373
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:27,978
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
What the hell?

374
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:29,411
What did he just do?

375
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:33,411
He touched the Zangetsu's
blade with his bare hand.

376
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:34,978
That's crazy.

377
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:37,678
-You're kind of a slow
learner, aren't you, Ichi.

378
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:39,845
You can never cut
Kenny, certainly

379
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:42,611
not with that, because
to Kenny it's almost

380
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:45,345
like your sword has
no blade at all.

381
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,745
-Shall I tell you?

382
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,645
You'd probably like to know why
your sword can never cut me.

383
00:20:50,678 --> 00:20:52,245
It's simple, really.

384
00:20:52,278 --> 00:20:54,411
Whenever two spiritual
pressures collide,

385
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:56,845
the weaker one gets pushed down.

386
00:20:56,878 --> 00:20:58,811
It's forced to submit.

387
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:00,978
It gets hurt.

388
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,878
While your spiritual
pressure may

389
00:21:02,911 --> 00:21:05,411
have been enough to
hone that sword of yours

390
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:08,045
for the purpose of
slaying your enemies,

391
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:10,578
it's nowhere near as strong
as the spiritual pressure

392
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:12,578
that oozes from me.

393
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:15,411
That's all there is to it.

394
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:18,378
What a joke, when I
think of all the time

395
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,645
I spent looking for
someone as unworthy as you.

396
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:25,645
Though even as a joke,
it's not very funny.

397
00:21:25,678 --> 00:21:28,645
Now it's my turn, Ichigo.

398
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:30,811
Try to live long
enough to at least let

399
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:33,011
me get the rust off this thing.

400
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:34,711
I am counting on you, Ryoka.

401
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:44,511
CLOSING THEME:

402
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:51,445
(SINGING IN JAPANESE)

403
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:52,878
-All right. [chuckles] Finally
it's my turn to do battle.

404
00:22:52,911 --> 00:22:54,911
So let's hurry up and
get things started.

405
00:22:54,945 --> 00:22:56,078
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Chad,
are you really going

406
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:57,111
to fight that old man?

407
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:59,078
TATSUFUSA: Hey, where are you?

408
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,445
Are you going to come
out and play, or what?

409
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:02,311
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Are you
sure he's all right in the head?

410
00:23:02,345 --> 00:23:04,111
TATSUFUSA: I'm waiting.
