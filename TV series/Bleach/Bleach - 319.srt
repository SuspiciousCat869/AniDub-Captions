1
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:58,166
Forcing a girl down
to the ground...

2
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,333
I wouldn't call that
move "good manners".

3
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,433
Oh?

4
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,299
Uryu!

5
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:08,766
You never learn, do you?
Always getting yourself
into trouble.

6
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:11,099
Your master's not
going to be happy.

7
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,233
Shut up uryu!
Ichigo is not
my mast--!

8
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,966
[Inaba]
Hado Number Four: Byakura!

9
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,666
A Hirenkyaku...

10
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,133
Well then, you
must be a Quincy.

11
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,099
You seem to be quite
interested in us.

12
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:29,033
Actually, I have no
interest in you.

13
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,066
But I don't want you
bringing trouble into
this town, either.

14
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,399
Leave, now.

15
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:36,133
Then I won't have
to take action.

16
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:40,499
[Inaba]
I don't want this skirmish
turning into an incident either,
young Quincy.

17
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,933
<i>But if you choose to</i>
<i>stand in our way,</i>

18
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:45,433
you will leave me no other
choice but to consider you

19
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:48,933
an "enemy" that needs
to be eliminated.

20
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:51,633
I didn't come here
to get in your way.

21
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,099
But you see,

22
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:57,066
It's becoming obvious,
from where I stand,
you are the enemy.

23
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,099
As you wish.

24
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,466
<i>I'll deal with you personally.</i>

25
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:17,699
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>So what now, Ichigo?</i>

26
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:18,899
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

27
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,866
<i>We have to return to the</i>
<i>World of the Living.</i>

28
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:24,499
Be serious! This isn't the
Seireitei as we know it!

29
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,866
As far as you and
I are concerned,
we're surrounded
by the enemy!

30
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,399
[Rukia]
You really think we can just
slip right though the Senkaimon?

31
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:35,499
<i>By now, the Reigai must</i>
<i>have blockaded it to</i>
<i>prevent our escape.</i>

32
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:36,833
<i>It's too risky.</i>

33
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:39,699
Egh. Okay, so what
do you suggest?

34
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,433
I don't know...

35
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:42,666
<i>[Yoruichi]</i>
<i>I have a plan.</i>

36
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:43,733
[gasps]

37
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,066
Yoruichi!

38
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,199
You made it!

39
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:50,133
Do you really think that
those half-brained soldiers
could keep up with me?

40
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,099
I bet that they're still
trying to figure out how
they lost track of me!

41
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,299
Glad to see
you're okay.

42
00:03:56,766 --> 00:04:00,899
Me too, but I still think
they're gonna keep a tight
guard on the Senkaimon.

43
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:02,733
I agree.

44
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,133
Which is why we'll bust
through the gate head on.

45
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:07,399
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Do what?!</i>

46
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:11,266
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>Breaking through will</i>
<i>be nearly impossible!</i>

47
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:16,533
<i>They may be fakes, but you</i>
<i>said those Reigai possess</i>
<i>powers equal to or greater</i>
<i>than the captains!</i>

48
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,899
We're going to break through
BECAUSE they're fakes!

49
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,333
Uhh?
Huh?

50
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,433
Ah! Now I see.

51
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:41,666
This attack of yours
weakens the bonds of
my Reishi,

52
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,866
allowing them to be converted
into your own energy.

53
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:49,633
You're very astute.
And your appearance
reminds me of someone.

54
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,266
Your demeanor is quite
similar to that of a
scientist I despise.

55
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:59,166
Are you referring to
Captain Kurotsuchi?

56
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,033
He is my superior
officer actually.

57
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,999
I thought so.
That must be why
you knew about my
Seeleschneider.

58
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,566
<i>No, this is the first</i>
<i>time I've seen it.</i>

59
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:11,866
The first time!?

60
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:16,999
I am quite capable of
analyzing my opponents'
skill and strength
on the spot.

61
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:22,466
You see unlike Mayuri,
I consider myself a true
"dispassionate scientist".

62
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:27,799
Unfortunately, that
technique of yours doesn't
have nearly enough speed

63
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,699
to have even the remotest
possibility of getting me.

64
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,299
Oddly enough,
I'm aware of that.

65
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:40,499
[gasp]

66
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,999
Hyaagh!

67
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,766
It's really simple.

68
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,566
It's obvious that the speed
of Ginreikojaku wouldn't
be able to catch you.

69
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:04,599
But it turns out all I needed
to do was to increase the
speed of my Hirenkyaku.

70
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,866
It sounded like you're not
very fond of that scientist
we were discussing.

71
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,533
What a shame.

72
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:16,099
If we weren't enemies,
we might've gotten along.

73
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,099
<i>[Inaba] [Echoed]</i>
<i>I think not!</i>

74

What?! Where'd he go?!

75
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:27,366
[gasp]

76
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:32,833
Me, despise Captain Kurotsuchi?

77
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:35,366
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

78
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,933
But... your wound?!

79
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,133
<i>He is a wonderful</i>
<i>superior officer.</i>

80
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:45,466
<i>The Captain does have</i>
<i>"sharp elbows" in his</i>
<i>dealings with others,</i>

81
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:46,899
<i>but I respect him.</i>

82
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:50,733
And yet, I know I
am superior to him
in all respects.

83
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,733
Really, that's all
there is to it.

84
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:56,166
Wha?! So what are
you getting at?!

85
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,333
Go mad...Raiku.

86
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:11,699
That's really
not necessary.

87
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:15,999
I have no intention of
giving you the time to
figure out my power.

88
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:30,333
Can't be. Not from
that distance.

89
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,366
I never even
saw you coming.

90
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:41,966
We're here.

91
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:44,666
So they've come!

92
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,266
Hey! Now there's even
more of them down there!

93
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,599
Hm. This won't be
so easy after all.

94
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:58,566
They can only hold the
Precipice World boundary wall
for a short period of time.

95
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,166
So just focus
on running.

96
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,933
We've gotta get past
them to make it through
to the Precipice World.

97
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:04,799
Let's go!

98
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,766
Looks like they're charging in!

99
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:11,333
All we need to do is
keep them from making it
through the Senkaimon.

100
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,333
But first, let's
slow them down!

101
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:19,699
What's the
matter Rukia!?

102

Rukia!

103
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:24,766
Eeeyah!

104
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,966
You need ta stop
looking around!

105
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,099
Damn!
Damn it!

106
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,733

00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:51,233
They just exploded!

110
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,533
What just
happened!?

decoy pop so early?!

Remember our plan?
We were supposed to do
it at the same time!

Hey I couldn't help it, okay?!
That device wasn't exactly
easy to activate!

Uaah!

Looks like our
plan worked out.

138
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,233
All of you Reigai were
originally created as
an experiment for the
purpose of doing battle.

139
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:33,433
Your personalities and strength
levels might be near perfect
copies of the real Soul Reapers,

140
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,066
<i>but you are a bit</i>
<i>more aggressive.</i>

141
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:41,199
<i>And since that's your natural</i>
<i>tendency, you won't hesitate</i>
<i>to attack Ichigo, Rukia or me,</i>
<i>whenever you can.</i>

142
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:45,999
<i>That's why those decoys</i>
<i>gave us the diversion we</i>
<i>needed to get past you.</i>

143
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:49,266
<i>If those had been your real</i>
<i>counterparts attacking us,</i>

00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:53,799
<i>they may have noticed the</i>
<i>difference and our plan</i>
<i>probably wouldn't have been</i>
<i>nearly as effective.</i>

145
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:57,666
But it's too late.
And I won't let you
go after Ichigo either.

146
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:02,133
Is that so? Then we'll just
have to do away with you first.

Impressive. You may be a fake,

eliminate this Mod Soul.

151
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:19,633
[gasp]

152
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:22,166
[struggling]
Dgh! Grrh!

153
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:26,399
Allow me to put you
out of your misery.

154
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:30,299
Ah. I'm surprised that
you're still alive.

155
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:36,833
<i>His movements. It's not just</i>
<i>an issue of him simply being</i>
<i>able to move fast.</i>

156
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:43,033
<i>It was as though when he made</i>
<i>a move, that movement was</i>
<i>somehow "cut out" of time.</i>

157
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:48,033
It seems I've been
toying with you and for
that I'm deeply sorry.

158
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:50,033
So then, let's end this.

159
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:52,599
Hado Number Four:
Byakurai.

160
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:58,866
Oh?

161
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,033
Hyaaah!

162
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:07,166
Uryu!

163
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:10,333
Orihime quick,
heal Uryu's wounds!

164
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:10,966
But!

165
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,299
I'll do what I can to give
you a little more time.

166
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,766
You, "give her time"?
Oh no.

167
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:23,933
Augh!

168
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:30,066
From the way you talk, it
sounds like you believe you
can somehow control time.

169
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:32,966
Oh no!

170
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:36,233
Now then, shall we
put an end to them?

171
00:12:46,748 --> 00:12:51,148
I've wasted too much time.
Let's finish this.

172
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:58,515
[Orihime]
Ichigo!

173
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:01,515
You all right, Orihime?

174
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:02,781
Rukia!

175
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:07,315
[Orihime]
I'm fine, but Uryu and
Chad are pretty beat up.

176
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:10,348
Ichigo Kurosaki.

177
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:14,948
<i>[Yoruichi]</i>
<i>You may only be Reigai,</i>
<i>but you're supposed to</i>
<i>be Squad Captains.</i>

178
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,781
<i>Is that really the best you</i>
<i>can do against just me?</i>

179
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,148
<i>How pathetic!</i>

180
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,681
Do you truly understand
the situation you're in?

181
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:25,315
If you don't,
then I'll show you.

182
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:28,015
Scatter, Senbonzakura.

183
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:32,715
Your refusal to accept defeat
is exactly like a real captain!

184
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:40,715
<i>[Inaba]</i>
<i>So you actually made</i>
<i>it back through.</i>

185
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:42,948
<i>That was quite</i>
<i>unexpected.</i>

186
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:44,481
Who are you?

187
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:48,581
Oh I see. So it was
Yoriuchi Shihoin,
wasn't it?

188
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:50,215
Hey! Didn't you hear me?!

189
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,681
Why of course!

190
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:57,581
If you had her helping,
it makes it much easier
to comprehend how you
could escape.

191
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:02,048
After all she probably gave up
her life, just to save you.

192
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:05,081
I said who the
hell are you?!

193
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:08,248
Now now, just calm down.

194
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,615
I am Kageroza Inaba.

195
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:14,815
I study the Precipice World
in the Department of
Research and Development.

196
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:16,915
You study the
Precipice World?!

197
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:20,448
Then you must be the
one responsible for
the disappearances!

198
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:23,715
And the one controlling
those Reigai!

199
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:25,648
<i>[Inaba]</i>
<i>Ohh!</i>

200
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:29,448
You even know
about my Reigai?
How intriguing!

201
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:31,081
What's intriguing!?

202
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:34,315
I've been immersed in
my research for years.

203
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:41,315
<i>As a result of my solitary</i>
<i>existence, I haven't paid</i>
<i>much attention to the</i>
<i>affairs of others.</i>

204
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,915
So I'm quite surprised
at this turn of events.

205
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:47,281
Enough of your
long-winded explanation!

206
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:48,081
<i>Oh?</i>

207
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,848
I really couldn't care less
about your stupid reasons
for everything you've done.

208
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:55,148
You got that?

209
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:58,981
But since you've
decided to hurt my friends,
I'm gonna take you out!

210
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,915
Not very patient, are you?

211
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:06,215
No matter, it saves
me time if we want to
get this over with!

212
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:10,048
<i>What's with his</i>
<i>Spirit Energy?!</i>

213
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:14,781
Hyaaaaaaah!

214
00:15:56,048 --> 00:16:02,848
Because I respect your strength
and how it allowed you to
defeat Aizen, I will not use
any cheap tricks against you.

215
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:06,815
But honestly, is this
all the power you
possess right now?

216
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:07,515
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>What...?!</i>

217
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:14,715
Don't hold back. You still
have a last resort, don't you?
Substitute Soul Reaper.

218
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,881
Heh! Listen to you
sounding all high
and mighty!

219
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:20,115
I would've used it even
without you asking!

220
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:24,048
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>Hold it! Ichigo!</i>

221
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:25,015
Here goes.

222
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,315
Hyyyah!

223
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:42,548
<i>Damn it! My Spirit</i>
<i>Energy is unstable.</i>

224
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:44,148
<i>I've got to finish this fast!</i>

225
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:00,381
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Getsuga!</i>

226
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:02,781
Tensho!

227
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:14,415
Haaaaaa!!

228
00:17:16,648 --> 00:17:17,448
What??!

229
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:27,181
So, was that your best?

230
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:30,915
Hmm heh heh heh heh.

231
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:35,981
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

232
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:40,048
Ichigo's definitely holding back
his strength as much as he can,

233
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:42,881
<i>because he's afraid of</i>
<i>losing his Spirit Energy.</i>

234
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:48,481
<i>But even so, Kageroza was</i>
<i>able to snuff out Ichigo's</i>
<i>Getsugatensho so easily.</i>

235
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:52,948
<i>These Reigai still possess</i>
<i>the fierce pride of their</i>
<i>original counterparts.</i>

236
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:56,348
<i>So the fact that this man can</i>
<i>command those proud warriors,</i>

237
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:59,415
<i>shows that his powers are even</i>
<i>greater than we imagined!</i>

238
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:06,681
Substitute Soul Reaper,
it certainly appears that
I have overestimated
your power level.

239
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:11,515
Or is it, that your Spirit
Energy has diminished more
than I predicted it would?

240
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:12,515
Shut up!

241
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:14,515
Sadly, in your
present state,

242
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:17,648
As a scientist, I no longer
have any interest in you!

243
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,981
Huaarghh!

244
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,581
Ichigo!

245
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:39,481
<i>[Inaba]</i>
<i>This is perfect.</i>

246
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:43,748
You two may prove
to be an obstacle
in my future plans.

247
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,348
Therefore, I'll eliminate
you right here!

248
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:55,215
Hey Ichigo! Kinda looks
like you two could
really use a hand here!

249
00:18:55,248 --> 00:18:55,781
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Renji?!</i>

250
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:56,515
Rgh!

251
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:57,415
[Nanao]
[shriek]

252
00:18:57,448 --> 00:18:58,015
Huh?

253
00:18:59,115 --> 00:18:59,715
Huh??

254
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:01,748
Let that girl go!

255
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:04,181
Rrgh!

256
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:08,015
That girl is mine!

257
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:16,481
This is not what
I expected!

258
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,081
Brother, it's you!

259
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:18,815
Byakuya!

260
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:22,748
Looks like he really
worked you over,
didn't he Ichigo?

261
00:19:23,415 --> 00:19:24,148
Shut up!

262
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:26,681
So I'm guessing you guys
are the real deal, huh?

263
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,215
Yer damn right we are!

264
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:30,048
But so how did
you two...?

265
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:32,748
Oh it's not just us.

266
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:48,015
Hey! It's them!

267
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:50,315
The originals.

268
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:54,881
For a petty underling, this
was some stunt you pulled.

269
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:56,748
It actually
surprised me.

270
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:58,948
Why Captain Kurotsuchi!

271
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:02,215
I honestly wasn't
expecting to see you
to arrive so soon.

272
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:06,048
You were tardy in your
report to me of the problems
in the Precipice World.

273
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:09,181
And because of your
laziness, I ended up
having to go and help

274
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:12,948
all these people I really
never had any intention
of wanting to help.

275
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:16,081
For this thankless job,
I will make you pay!

276
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,281
A million times over!

277
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:24,415
Surely you jest. You seem to
think you've won but I assure
you, you are mistaken.

278
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,315
But for tonight,
I will retreat.

279
00:20:29,515 --> 00:20:30,848
Damn you! Wait!

280
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,048
[Renji]
Ichigo! Don't.

281
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:33,881
Why not?!

282
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:37,448
The Precipice World
has now become his
personal domain.

283
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:41,648
To enter there without a plan,
you'd have to be more of a fool
than I can imagine.

284
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:47,581
Go ahead. If you wish to
die by committing such an
irrational act, I won't
be the one to stop you.

285
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:50,681
It would be quite a fitting
death for someone like you.

286
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:51,815
Bite me.

287
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:57,848
Once I return and I
have retrieved Nozomi,

288
00:20:58,381 --> 00:21:02,215
<i>Then I will be able to</i>
<i>completely show all of</i>
<i>you my true power.</i>

289
00:21:02,715 --> 00:21:04,115
Your true power?

290
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:10,315
<i>[Inaba]</i>
<i>Yes. When that occurs, not</i>
<i>only the Soul Society but also</i>
<i>the World of the Living,</i>

291
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:13,348
<i>will be forced to exist</i>
<i>under my control.</i>

292
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:27,548
So keep in mind, all you
Originals and you too,
Substitute Soul Reaper.

293
00:21:27,948 --> 00:21:30,715
Someday quite soon,
we will meet again.

294
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:37,481
That will not happen!
You will never control us!

295
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,834
<i>[Nanao]</i>
<i>We weren't expecting that</i>
<i>much interference.</i>

296
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:47,934
[Inaba]
That really couldn't be helped.

297
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:52,534
<i>Not everything has the</i>
<i>outcome that one expects.</i>
<i>That is science.</i>

298
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:57,000
<i>Besides, I assumed that it</i>
<i>would be nearly impossible to</i>

Captain Kuchiki, is there
anything you need during our
stay in the World of the Living?

<i>[Kuchiki]</i>
<i>I will need a place to reside.</i>

<i>A formal garden by a lake,</i>
<i>with seven rooms is the</i>

<i>Uh... Captain!?</i>
