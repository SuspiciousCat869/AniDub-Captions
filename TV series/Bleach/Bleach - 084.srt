-Kariya's plans for this world
are actually very simple.

00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:46,062
He wants to create
a new, clean, world.

00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:48,628
A world that will
be ruled by Bounts.

00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:50,128
-What are you talking about?

7
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:53,762
-When a Bount gains power by
sucking the souls from living

8
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:56,128
humans, it also
increases the power

9
00:01:56,162 --> 00:01:59,895
of all the other Bounts, because
of the multiplier effect.

10
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:02,328
Soon we will rule the world.

11
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:04,062
-That's what you think.

12
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:07,028
I'm not about to let you use
Keigo's life for that purpose.

13
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:12,362
-It's useless to defy us.

00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:16,328
Admit that you cannot defeat
the Bounts, young man.

-No, never.

-The fire in your
eyes spells danger.

17
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:24,828
Such power without
principle is dangerous.

18
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:26,895
You must understand, or die.

I won't let Keigo die.

of young ones, who

Farewell, young one.

I'm supposed to be

Whoa.

-I'm sorry.

44
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:41,695
I told Tessai it was urgent.

I can hardly feel
his pulse at all.

Can you put up a barrier
to gather spirit energy?

-Right away.

50

-Good.

51
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:01,695
Then I can handle
everything else.

-I knew that we'd
be in good hands.

It was very smart of them to
send a member of Squad Four.

-Impossible.

How did she escape
that attack in time?

00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:49,628
-What do we do now?

73
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:52,628
-So close.

74
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:54,595
But not close enough.

No, wait!

00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:27,795
The technique is
not perfected yet.

-You see?

83
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,128
I told you so.

84
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:31,828
You should have waited.

85
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:35,028
-What are you talking about?

86
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:36,462
-Fighting humans
requires patience.

87
00:05:36,495 --> 00:05:39,128
Maybe you should take a break.

88
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:42,162
-Are you forgetting
who's in charge here?

89

-Oh no, of course not.

-Just take a deep breath.

00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:53,295
Meditate for a moment,
and gather all the power

shut up and do your jobs?

Are you all right?

00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:05,528
-I'll be all right.

100
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:08,762
You see, we Mod Souls
are actually just pills.

101
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:12,428
No matter what happens
to our Gigai, we survive.

102
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:14,895
Well, I'm not saying
it doesn't hurt.

103
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:17,662
At any rate, we should
escape while we can.

104
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:22,462
-Happy now?

105
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:23,795
-Oh, yes.

106
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:24,895
-Absolutely.

107
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:27,528
It wouldn't do to
let the enemy escape.

108
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:28,195
-What?

109
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:28,695

think you're going?

-Oh, that's it!

114
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:41,628
Such timing!

115

Am I as beautiful as I feel?

What are you doing?

-This isn't a job
for an old lady.

-Old lady?

In fact, I feel great.

00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:04,028
-It's definitely a doll, but I
can't tell what kind of power

138
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:05,595
it has.

139
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:06,662
-Stop it.

140
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,628
Before this gets out of hand.

141

Are you out of your mind?

Old and ugly.

Too bad.

else I can do for you?

You've done well.

338
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,858
Don't feel like you
have to rush your life.

339
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:53,958
There's no shame in
cherishing the journey.

340
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,625
Farewell.

341
00:20:58,658 --> 00:20:59,125
-Hey!

342
00:20:59,158 --> 00:20:59,625
Old man!

00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:07,258
-I can't go on!

345
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,725
It's no good.

346
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:10,725
I'll never make it.

347
00:21:10,758 --> 00:21:13,358
They'll find me lying
dead in the street.

348
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:14,425
Ow!

349
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,225
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

350
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:17,358
-Hey Ririn.

351
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:18,725
Hey, wait a minute, what
are you doing out here

352
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:20,058
in the middle of nowhere?

353
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:20,725
Wow.

354
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:22,058
You look horrible.

355
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,225
You really ought to pay more
attention to your appearance.

356
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:26,825
And you call yourself a lady.

357
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:27,791
-Ha!

358
00:21:27,825 --> 00:21:30,458
Get to Uruhara's
shop on the double!

359
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:31,558
-All right.

360
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:32,958
Just take it easy with
the stick, will ya?

361
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,025
I didn't mean it.

362
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:34,958
-Just shut up and run!

363
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,925
-Rukia!

364
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,925
-Can someone please explain
to me what happened?

365
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,825
-Say, why don't
we just start off

366
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:53,891
with you telling me your name.

367
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:55,158
-Rukia.

-Ah.

370
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,491
Well that's a very nice name.

371
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:03,458
Worthy of being my new servant.

372
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:05,525
-His servant?

373
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,358
-So Rukia.

374
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:09,791
Would you like to work for me?

375
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:10,291
-Yes.

-Rukia!

379
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:17,858
-Stop.

380
00:22:17,891 --> 00:22:18,925
I can't breathe.

381
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,425
You're choking me.

382
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:22,925
-You don't know
what you're doing.

383
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:26,891
-No, Rukia!

-Since we're in the
world of the living,

386
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:10,481
we should buy some gifts.

387
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,181
Candy for lieutenant, an
electric razor for Ikaku,

388
00:24:13,215 --> 00:24:15,848
and I think Ichigo would
make a wonderful fighting

partner for the Captain.

got a real nasty streak.

00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:20,648
-Oh come on.

392
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:22,781
How can it be mean to
say what's on your mind?

-Someone took all of the snacks.

398
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:40,903
-How could they do that?

399
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,237
I'm starving!

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,003
-What's all the noise about?

-Sorry if we disturbed you.

402
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:49,503
But do you know what happened to
the snacks that were left here?

what happened to your snacks.

-Wait a minute.

Wasn't the snack--
