It hurts.

I can't move my legs.

RENJI NARRATING: Hanging
Dog, the 78th district

24
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:20,962
in South Rukon.

25
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:26,395
To the North, South, East, and
West, Rukon has 80 districts.

26
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:28,795
District One has the
highest standard of living.

27
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:31,262
So to be poor kids
like us, living

28
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,795
in a place like
the 78th district,

29
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:39,262
well, that made us pretty
much the lowest of the low.

00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:40,662
-Get out of here,
you street rats.

day was a challenge.

00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,662
And it wasn't the
kind of place where

35
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:49,128
grownups cut you slack,
just because you're a kid.

36

-All right.

pissed off this time.

-Then you better just
shut up, and keep running.

Who the hell are you?

74
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:11,962
-You want to stand
around asking question?

75
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:15,962
Or you want to get away?

76
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:17,062

Here.

This is your portion.

You're kidding, right?

Don't tell me you've
never even heard of it.

98
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:03,862
Then take it back, you shrimp.

Now look what you've done.

103
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:10,995
If you'd have let
me have it, I might

104
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:13,128
have given you some,
you stupid kid.

-Cut out the crying,
you little baby.

107
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:18,428
It was just a little candy.

108
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,728
It would have been
wasted on you, anyway.

109
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:22,962
You don't have an
ounce of spirit energy.

110
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:24,162
So what good are you?

111
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:25,328
Now just shut up already.

112
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:25,828

-What kind of a pathetic creep
steals from a little kid?

115
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:31,195
-Why you.

116
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:33,595
I'll teach you to mind
your own business.

117
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:34,095
Whoa!

118
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:37,828
-We may not get hungry.

119
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:39,562
But we can all smell,
and we can all taste.

120
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:40,828
You got that?

121
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:42,128
We're all the same.

122
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:46,495
And happiness should be
shared with every one of us.

123
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:48,362
If we hurt each
other, than we're

124
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:51,828
no better than those
horrible grown ups.

125

Oh!

133
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:09,162
RENJI NARRATING: I knew
she wanted it for herself.

134
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,295
But she give it
away, just like that.

135
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:12,962
That's the way she was.

136
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,262
But it's not like she was soft.

137
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:23,462
Rukia was tougher
than most men I know.

138
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:25,595
She didn't take any
crap from anyone.

139
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:27,528
She even kind of
talked like a man.

140
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:28,762
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Hey, Renji.

141
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:29,762
-Huh?

142
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:30,728
-Watcha doing?

143
00:07:30,762 --> 00:07:32,395
Did you come looking for me?

144
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:38,928
-Um, no, I, I just-- [scoffing]
why would I be looking for you?

145
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:40,862
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN):

-[laughing]

-You're the weird one.

150
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:49,695
You got a lot of
nerve, you know that?

151
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,328
I'm going to be a
soul reaper someday--

152
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:53,128
-It didn't matter
what she was doing.

153
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:55,628
There was something
classy about Rukia.

154
00:07:55,662 --> 00:07:57,095
-Stop laughing at me.

155

[panting]

156
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:14,662
RENJI (OFFSCREEN):
Rukia, what's the matter?

157
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,828
-Nothing.

158
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:16,862
I'm right behind you.

159
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:23,362
-Whoa.

160
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:24,428
Look at that rickshaw.

161
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,795
-That's the coolest
one I've ever seen.

162
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:27,762
It must belong to
someone famous.

163
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:30,362
-Check it out--
red leather seats

164
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:32,262
-It's so shiny you can
see your face in it.

165
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:33,095
-Whoa.

166
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:34,828
Look at that.

167
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:36,995
-Can you believe he's going
to become a soul reaper?

168
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:39,495
I remember when he was
still just a skinny kid

169
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:40,495
in the neighborhood.

170
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:41,262
-Yeah.

171
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:41,962
-Yeah.

172
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:43,128
Now he's the local hero.

173
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:44,695
-I'm going to be a
soul reaper, too.

174
00:08:44,728 --> 00:08:45,728
-Oh, yeah, sure.

175
00:08:45,762 --> 00:08:47,195
You don't have a chance.

176
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:49,295
Soul reapers have to have
a ton of spirit energy.

177
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,828
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): He's right.

178
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,262
The three of us
put together don't

179
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:54,095
have enough spirit
energy for that.

180
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:56,228
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Ah, I can dream, can't I?

181
00:08:56,262 --> 00:08:57,328
-Argh!

182
00:08:57,362 --> 00:09:01,262
Get your sticky fingers
off that paint job.

183
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:02,495
-Thank you, sir.

184
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:03,828
I'll be on my way now.

185
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:04,628
-Hey, look!

186
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:05,862
He's about to come outside.

187
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:07,262
-We're all rooting for you.

188
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:07,995
You can do it.

189
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:17,395
[applause and praise]

190
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,895
-Hey, Rukia, are you OK?

191
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:24,662
What's wrong?

192
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:27,628
What happened to you?

193
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:30,662
-What's the matter
with your friend?

194
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:35,628
I imagine you must be weak
from hunger, aren't you?

195
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:36,395
-No.

196
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:38,662
Why would you think that?

197
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:40,162
-Feeling hunger in
this world where

198
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:42,195
no one is supposed
to get hungry,

199
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:45,128
I was also confused
about it at first, too.

200
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:48,562
But it's a reality that we
all have to accept eventually.

201
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:51,062
I think what happened just
now is that your body felt

202
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:53,195
my spiritual pressure
when I passed by you,

203
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:58,095
and it instantly used
up all your energy.

204
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:01,362
Here, why don't you
eat some of these.

205
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,095
That should help to
restore your strength.

206
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,628
-Oh, thank you.

207
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:20,428
-[roaring]

208
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:22,828
[clapping]

209
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,295
-That's awesome, Renji.

210
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:27,228
You're going to get to be a
soul reaper someday for sure!

211
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:28,695
-You're damn right!

212
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,195
-Huh?

213
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,662
-[giggling]

214
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:33,495
-Whoa, yours is even
bigger than Renji's.

215
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:36,095
-Amazing, Rukia.

216
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:38,595
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Rukia, you when Renji are both

217
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:40,328
going to become
soul reapers, huh?

218
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:43,062
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Nah, I
wouldn't worry about that.

219
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:45,195
I'm not going to go
anywhere, you guys?

220
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,395
-Really?

221
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,028
-We're going to keep this
gang together forever.

222
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:48,895
-Excellent!

223
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,195
-That's fantastic!

224
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:51,195
-Right, Renji?

225
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:52,495
-Uh, sure.

226
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:53,495
Why not?

227
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,928
-Yay.

228
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:56,995
We're going to be
friends forever!

229
00:10:57,028 --> 00:10:57,928
-Forever!

230
00:10:57,962 --> 00:11:00,328
[giggling]

231
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:01,928
RENJI NARRATING: With
or without spirit

232
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:05,262
energy didn't seem to
matter so much back then.

233
00:11:05,295 --> 00:11:07,862
At least it didn't to Rukia.

234
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:10,895
We may have lived among
the lowest of the low,

235
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:12,362
but she always shined.

236
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:16,728
-Uh!

237
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:18,862
Renji, there's one
coming your way.

238
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:19,362
-OK.

239
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:20,962
I got it!

240
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:25,262
[grunting]

241
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:28,562
-Hey, you're just going to scare
all the fish away doing that.

242
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:30,928
-Aah!

243
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:32,062
-Now what are you doing?

244
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:35,195
Trying to make friends
with them down there?

245
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:41,995
-[gasping] No, I'm OK.

246
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:42,828
Thanks for asking.

247
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,262
-They're flowers.

248
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,528
-Flowers?

249
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:55,028
Ha!

250
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:02,762
Hey, check this
one out, you guys.

251
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:04,128
Am I talented or what?

252
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:06,895
If you've got that fire ready,
then we'll cook this baby up.

253
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:08,662
-Yeah.

254
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:12,995
-[giggling]

255
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:23,128
-Why are you just
standing around?

256
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:24,128
Get the fire ready.

257
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:25,628
-Whoa!

258
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,128
-Hey!

259
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,128
-Come on.

260
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:32,662
-Day after day, night after
night, we were always together.

261
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:35,362
And so, though we didn't
realize it at the time,

262
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:38,895
we had become a family.

263
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:40,995
That was what we had to do.

264
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,862
It's how we survived.

265
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:46,195
But we knew it was
still no kind of a life.

266
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:49,095
We were still pathetic
people, living pathetic lives

267
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:51,595
in a terrible, ugly place.

268
00:12:51,628 --> 00:12:53,962
All the grownups were
either thieves or murderers.

269
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:57,862
And all the kids
were delinquents.

270
00:12:57,895 --> 00:13:04,695
And to get out of life,
well, there was only one way.

271
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:05,195
-Renji.

272
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:13,062
I think we should
become soul reapers.

273
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,362
If we do that, then we can
live in the [inaudible].

274
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:23,462
I've had enough, lived in
this ugly place too long.

275
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:27,995
RENJI NARRATING: Each of us
came to this merciless town

276
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:29,462
on their own.

277
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:31,428
Each one of us had
struggled alone,

278
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:35,195
until finally we had come
together out of necessity.

279
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:38,862
In order to survive,
we became a family.

280
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:40,628
But in the end, that
cruel place had still

281
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:42,462
proven to be too
much for us, to much

282
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:45,328
for any makeshift
family of kids.

283
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:47,662
It had been 10 years
since Rukia had come.

284
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,428
And now we looked around.

285
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,128
And all the rest of
our friends were gone.

286
00:13:55,028 --> 00:13:57,795
Yes, let's becomes soul reapers.

287
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,798
Shortly after the day we
made that fateful decision,

288
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,431
we both entered the
soul reaper academy.

289
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:18,065
We quickly learned we were
different from the rest

290
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:21,865
of the spoiled brats
from noble families.

291
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:25,098
-Yes, yes, I know that one.

292
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,865
Let me give the answer, sir.

293
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,031
I know it.

294
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,665
-I'm glad to hear it.

295
00:14:29,698 --> 00:14:33,598
And in the future, if I need a
substitute, I'll think of you.

296
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:35,898
But as I am not
dead yet, I'll do

297
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:37,898
the explaining in
this classroom.

298
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:42,131
And you'll do the listening,
if you don't mind, young man.

299
00:14:42,165 --> 00:14:43,898
-What a total loser.

300
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,598
You'd think it's his first
time in a real classroom.

301
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:48,631
-Well, honestly,
what do you expect?

302
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:50,098
You know where he's from, right?

303
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:53,165
He's just district 78 trash.

304
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:55,298
-All right, quiet down.

305
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:57,631
Let's move on to the
next problem now, class.

306
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:07,398
-Renji.

307
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,131
-I, I was just studying.

308
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:10,531
I have lots of
extra work because

309
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:12,831
of this advanced placement
class I've been promoted to.

310
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:15,498
So I don't have much time
to hang around, like you do.

311
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,231
I've got so much work to do.

312
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:18,931
-About the other
students, I know

313
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:20,498
they were making
fun of you earlier.

314
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:22,265
But I liked your eagerness.

315
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:24,298
-Uh, oh?

316
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:25,298
-Keep it up.

317
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:27,065
Don't let a bunch
of stuffed shirts

318
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:28,631
keep you from being yourself.

319
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:29,531
You got it?

320
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:30,331
-What?

321
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:31,698
What do you mean, be myself?

322
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:40,198
-You know what I mean, Renji.

323
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,131
Most of the other students
here come from nobility.

324
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:45,398
They don't understand
the kind of existence

325
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:46,865
we had back in Hanging Dog.

326
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:48,831
So they'll never accept us.

327
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,865
And that's something
we can never change.

328
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:52,798
-That's true.

329
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:57,265
RENJI NARRATING: So even
though we had left the Rukongai

330
00:15:57,298 --> 00:15:59,931
behind, and it made
it into the academy,

331
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:04,898
there was still a huge
gap between us and them.

332
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,565
I swore then and
there I would make

333
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,431
them eat their words, somehow.

334
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:13,365
[panting]

335
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:14,231
-[screaming]

336
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,298
-Oh, sorry about that!

337
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:26,565
[panting] Rukia, guess
what just happened.

338
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:27,898
I passed the second exam.

339
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:28,965
Isn't that great?

340
00:16:28,998 --> 00:16:40,165
Now if I pass the next
one I-- (THINKING)

341
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:41,631
Those are [inaudible].

342
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:43,465
What are nobles doing here?

343
00:16:43,498 --> 00:16:46,431
-Well, it would seem
our deliberations

344
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,365
have been interrupted.

345
00:16:49,998 --> 00:16:52,831
Take a few days, and
consider the situation.

346
00:16:52,865 --> 00:16:55,031
We are looking forward to
hearing a favorable answer.

347
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:11,431
-(THINKING) This amazing
spiritual pressure.

348
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:12,031
It's so strong.

349
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,931
I can't even look into his eyes.

350
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,365
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Renji.

351
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:32,965
-Oh, uh, Rukia,
how are you doing?

352
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:35,998
You had some pretty important
looking visitors there, huh?

353
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:37,431
Sorry to interrupt.

354
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:42,031
So tell me, what was
that all about anyway?

355
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:44,031
Oh, so it's a secret, huh?

356
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:46,165
-That was the Kuchiki
family, Renji.

357
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,398
They want to adopt
me as their daughter.

358
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:51,365
They said that they're
going to let me graduate

359
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:53,531
right away, and
then, after that,

360
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:55,031
they can make
arrangements to put me

361
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:57,498
straight into one of the
13 court guard squads.

362
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:05,331
Renji, I don't know what to do.

363
00:18:05,365 --> 00:18:06,031
-Ah!

364
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:06,931
Rukia, what do you mean?

365
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:08,565
Of course you know what to do.

366
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:09,865
You say yes, Rukia.

367
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:11,498
This is fantastic!

368
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:12,265
Don't you see?

369
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:13,331
You're in.

370
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:15,365
The Kuchikis are a
powerful noble family.

371
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:18,098
And now you're going to
become one them. [laughing]

372
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,865
You're going to live
the rest of your life

373
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,165
in luxury, Rukia,
wearing fine clothes.

374
00:18:22,198 --> 00:18:25,865
Hey, I wonder what nobles eat.
[laughing] Man, I'm jealous.

375
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:28,498
And not only that--
[laughing] wow!

376
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:31,365
You're going to get to
graduate immediately.

377
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:34,265
This is wonderful
news, Rukia. [laughing]

378
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:35,265
-You think so?

379
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:38,831
-I'm practically
speechless. [laughing]

380
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:45,665
-Thank you.

381
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,198
RENJI NARRATING:
Rukia had finally

382
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:59,598
found a family, a real family.

383
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:02,431
And I knew I must not interfere.

384
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,165
That's what I had to
keep telling myself.

385
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:15,631
[gasping]

386
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:18,498
But now that I
think back, I think

387
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:23,031
I was just scared to lose her,
to lose the only family I ever

388
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:25,165
had.

389
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:28,465
Not only that, I didn't
want to face the fact

390
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:31,598
that I'm nothing more
than a stray dog.

391
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:33,598
And I'm so sick of it.

392
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:44,031
All I do is bark
wildly at the moon.

393
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:47,398
I don't have the guts
to actually bite.

394
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:51,898
[moaning]

395
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:54,898
-[panting]

396
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,965
-All this time I've been
blaming you for the fact

397
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:03,265
that Rukia has been imprisoned.

398
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:06,731
Every time I thought of
you it made my blood boil.

399
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:08,531
But I was wrong.

400
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:10,998
It wasn't you.

401
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:14,265
It was me from the start,
because I didn't stop Rukia

402
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,531
from going to the Kuchikis.

403
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:17,531
I didn't want her to go.

404
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:19,365
But I never imagined
that if she did,

405
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:23,465
she'd end up being a
condemned criminal.

406
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:25,165
I thought she would
find happiness.

407
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:26,698
I really believed that.

408
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:30,731
How could I have ever known?

409
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:34,365
And I wanted so badly to
surpass Captain Kuchiki

410
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:37,131
for taking Rukia from me.

411
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:40,098
From that first day I
saw him, I pursued him.

412
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:43,531
I trained with only
that thought in mind.

413
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:48,531
But even to this day, not once
have I been able to beat him.

414
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:51,698
He's just too strong.

415
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:55,465
As much as I wanted to, I
just didn't have the strength

416
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:58,898
to get Rukia back that way.

417
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:04,365
So Ichigo, now I'm swallowing
my shame and my pride.

418
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:08,198
And I'm asking you
to save Rukia. [gasp]

419
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:11,331
will you promise?
[gasp] I'm begging you.

420
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:13,131
Will you save her?

421
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:25,798
[weeping and gasping]

422
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:26,298
-Yes.

423
00:21:29,431 --> 00:21:31,731
RENJI NARRATING: Light a fire
to the fang that cannot be

424
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:36,531
reached, so that I do
not have to see the star,

425
00:21:36,565 --> 00:21:38,365
so that I do not
slit this throat.

426
00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:47,911
[music playing]

427
00:22:50,678 --> 00:22:53,044
-I am this century's premier
spiritualist [inaudible].

428
00:22:53,078 --> 00:22:54,444
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Huh?

429
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:56,378
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): This
positively reeks of bad things.

430
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:57,578
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
What about the fight?

431
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:58,211
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
That definitely smells

432
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,244
like bad spirits.

433
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,211
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
And my injury?

434
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:01,178
And Renji?

435
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:02,278
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): You kids

436
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:03,544
watching at home, just
you wait. [laughing]

437
00:23:03,578 --> 00:23:05,744
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Hey, what's the deal here?
