NARRATOR: Rurichiyo Kasumioji
arrived from the Soul Society

3
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:53,943
and transferred
into Ichigo's class.

4
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,843
Soon afterwards,
she was targeted

5
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,976
by a mysterious assailant.

6
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,843
Ichigo attempted to
identify the enemy,

7
00:01:59,876 --> 00:02:03,243
but the assassin took his own
life before he could do so.

8
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:05,476
It turned out
Rurichiyo was actually

9
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:07,743
princess of the Kasumioji Clan.

10
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:10,043
When her life was
perceived to be in danger,

11
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:12,609
her guardians took her to
the world of the living,

12
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:15,109
and now Ichigo has
been forced to accept

13
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:16,909
the task of serving
as her bodyguard.

14
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:27,876
-Oh, wasn't that
another fun-filled day?

15
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:30,309
-Indeed, Lady Rurichiyo.

16
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:33,476
-It's too bad I can't
say the same thing.

17
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:36,209
Ichigo Kurosaki, when
addressing the princess,

18
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:38,876
I find you have a rather
poor choice of words.

19
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,476
You should watch your mouth.

20
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:41,443
-Yeah, right.

21
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:44,243
Way I see it,
she's the one who--

22
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:46,343
hey, what's the deal, guy?

23
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:47,809
Come on, out of my way!

24
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:48,609
Quit it!

25
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:49,943
Why is he in my face?

26
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:52,276
-Because we didn't
care for your response.

27
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:53,176
-Fine, all right.

28
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,109
I get it, already.

29
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:00,443
I swear, yesterday you
guys were basically

30
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:04,243
on your hands and knees, and
now this is the thanks I get?

31
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:05,809
-What you're talking about?

32
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:09,309
Did Kenryu and Enryu ask you
to assist them with something?

33
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:10,276
-Uh--

34
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:11,709
-There's just one other thing.

35
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:14,809
Lady Rurichiyo has no
idea she's being targeted,

36
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:16,876
and we'd like to
keep it that way.

37
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:18,309
Ir would traumatize
her, and she's

38
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:20,943
been through enough already.

39
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:26,309
-No, they, uh, just wanted some
tips on relating to humans.

40
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:27,343
Right?

41
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:28,043
-Huh?

00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:29,443
-Uh, right.

teaching us some social customs

00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:34,109
from the world of the living.

45
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:34,643
Yes.

Uh, my Lady?

47
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:38,543
-Oh!

48
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:44,543
Ichigo, what is
this strange thing?

49
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:45,776
-Hmm.

50
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,209
My Lady, this device is
called a vending machine.

51
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:51,076
-What purpose does it serve?

52
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:51,643

-Go on, try it.

-But my Lady--

58
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:02,876
-I will be fine.

that sells different snacks.

Wow, Ichigo.

This world is brimming
with fascinating items

65
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,709
about this I know nothing.

00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:23,676
You will not hesitate to teach
me more about this place.

someone for a favor?

-I mean, OK!

71
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:34,276
I'll teach, uh, Rurichiyo
a little bit at a time.

72
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:36,543

I have a huge heart,
therefore I shall

76
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:43,609
forgive Ichigo's indiscretion.

Lady Rurichiyo.

I, lowly Kenryu, am
in awe of your grace.

-No need to overreact, Kenryu.

out a few more fascinating items

from this world?

what you're going to do yet.

-Hmm!

There's no need for you to
rudely point out the obvious.

to come up with a plan soon.

side, but welcome back.

Since we're

-You think?

00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:05,309
-Yes, it's truly scrumptious.

130

That's Yuzu for you.

134
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:13,209
Her cooking is always to notch.

135
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:15,576
-Aristocratic dinners can
be so formal and stuffy.

136

Isn't that right, Miss Kuchiki?

137
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:19,209
-Aristocratic?

-You know what?

139
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:21,943
Don't worry about it, Yuzu.

140
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:22,909
-But--

141
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,943
-She's just a little different.

142
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,109
Rurichiyo, what's wrong?

143
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:34,143
-I do not eat these.

144
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:35,976
-Oh, you don't like carrots?

145
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:36,643
I'm sorry.

146

-Now you listen up.

147
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,843
Farmers are out there working
very hard in the fields

148
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:43,676
to grow all these vesicles
vegetables, so eat everything

149
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:44,243
on your plate.

150
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,843
-Farmers grow all
of these things?

151
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,176
-You bet.

152
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:52,876
Just growing one of these
veggies takes a lot of labor.

153
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:56,543
-And if you eat them in some
curry, they taste amazing.

154
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,509
-Mmm.

155
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:00,943
-It's not a big deal, really.

156
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:02,576
-Yuzu, don't encourage her.

are you people?

-Pardon our late intrusion.

-Not cool, you guys.

consume lowly carrots.

163

-What?

00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:23,243
-I can't even recall
how many servants

I suppose in this case
you weren't aware,

-Now, listen.

173

It's you two sheltering
her like this all the time

174
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:42,372
that makes her totally
ignorant of reality.

-I warn you, this is
none of your concern.

and that's how you talk to me?

-Babysit?

00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:56,838
What's this about, Kenryu?

181

Answer me!

182
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:02,705
-Uh, I-- well, um-- uh,
with a Lady as noble

183
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:06,905
as yourself, we just thought
maybe we were short staffed?

184
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:07,938
-Hold on.

185
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:11,272
Have you been hiding
something from me?

186
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:12,238
-Ahh!

187
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:14,605
Umm-- no, it's just--

188
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:18,105
-Kenryu, Enryu, why won't you
ever tell me the whole truth

189
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:19,638
about anything?

190
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:22,005
-Uh, my Lady, I--

191
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:25,205
-If mother and father
were still here,

192

I know they would have told me
about farmers and food and all

the rest.

194
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,572
All this time, I
never gave any thought

195
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:38,438
to how our meals were
grown and prepared.

196

But I am not a full, either.

he speaks the truth.

-But my Lady, I--

-Oh, so you think this is none
of your business, huh, Ichigo?

You're at least half
responsible for this.

This is my fault, too.

back into a soul form.

When people constantly

eventually you start

it until they're gone,
