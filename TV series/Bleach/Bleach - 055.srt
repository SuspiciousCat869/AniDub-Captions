So the question that
needs to be asked

is why the hell aren't
you trying to save her?

Even if I did have
the time to try

00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:03,401
to explain the principle
to you, someone

I shall kill you,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

And then, once again,
I will capture Rukia.

And this time I shall
execute her myself.

Put me down.

I've got to go back
there and help Ichigo.

RUKIA: What?

59
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:47,767
-Well, one time, Ichigo told
me that he owed you a favor.

-He owes a favor to me?

ICHIGO: You know, Rukia
actually saved my life in a way.

63
00:05:58,301 --> 00:06:00,901
She changed my destiny.

64
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:03,701
That much is true.

65
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:06,201
If I hadn't met
Rukia, I never would

66
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:08,334
have become a Soul
Reaper, the ability

67
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,567
I have to fight the
way I do, and to be

68
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:12,934
able to protect everyone.

69
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:13,767
I owe her.

RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Because of me,

71
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:23,534
Ichigo's fate has been changed.

72
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,767
I've put him in terrible danger.

73
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:31,667
And nothing I do can ever
make amends for that.

74
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,967
-Why are you blaming
yourself for everything?

75
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:35,234
It's pointless.

76
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,734
You've always been like that.

77
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:39,767
No one else thinks
this is all your fault.

78
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:43,167
So why don't you quit
being so hard on yourself?

79
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,034
No one person could
be strong enough

80
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:46,967
to carry all of
that responsibility

81
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:47,801
on their shoulders.

82
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:50,034
Certainly not you, Rukia.

83
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:56,834
Share it.

84
00:06:56,867 --> 00:07:00,401
Share that burden with
Ichigo and with me.

85
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:04,134
Let us lighten your load until
you get your strength back.

86
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:08,767
That is the whole reason we
both made ourselves stronger.

87
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:12,634
Just have a little
faith in him, Rukia.

88
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:17,501

RENJI: Don't be foolish.

91

freeing a convicted criminal

and aiding in her

107

solved by capturing

But that is the least
of our problems.

What you two captains

is a crime of far
greater magnitude.

167
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:34,482
-We're all right.

168
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:35,915
Release the other
and return, Minazuki.

169
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:47,182
[groaning]

170
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:00,748
-Most of their wounds
are not life threatening.

171
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:02,548
The time spent in
Minazuki's belly

172
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,948
has accelerated the
healing process.

173
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:07,582
Take them to the relief
station and monitor them

174
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:08,815
until they awaken.

175
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:09,682
-Yes, Captain.

176
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:16,382
-Who is still up there?

177
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,115
Such strong spiritual pressure.

178
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:21,015
-Captain Kuchiki
is there, battling

179
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:24,448
against the Ryoka
who knocked you out.

180
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:26,982
The other captains
have all gone elsewhere

181
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,282
and are now fighting
among themselves.

182
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:33,482
Unfortunately, there's nothing
we can do now to stop them.

183
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,215
Come with me, Isane.

184
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:41,248
Right this way,
there's a certain place

185
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:42,382
that I would like to visit.

186
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:02,648
KYORAKU: That should do it.

187
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:04,815
We're pretty far
away from everything.

188
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:07,548
UKITAKE: Yes, far enough to be
out of danger-- for a while,

189
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:08,048
at least.

190
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:15,548
-Hey, Nanao, slow poke.

191
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:20,182
-You didn't have to leave
me back there, Captain.

192
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:21,615
[gasp]

193
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:32,748
-I must say, you got here
quicker than I expected you to.

194
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:35,048
-Chasing children.

195
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,715
It's been many years
since any mere juvenile

196
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:40,315
delinquent could
get away from me.

197
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:42,815
Let us finish this!

198
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,715
But I shall be using
far more than my fists.

199
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:16,248
NANAO (VOICEOVER): Head Captain
Genruysai Shigekuni Yamamoto.

200
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,048
Leader of Squad One.

201
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:20,682
Head Captain of all the
13 Court Guard Squads.

202
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:23,315
His spiritual
pressure is enormous.

203
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:25,082
Even two captains
together may not

204
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:27,582
be strong enough to
defeat such a man.

205
00:15:27,615 --> 00:15:29,382
I must help them.

206
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:31,248
There's Only one thing I can do.

207
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:49,115
-[gasps]

208
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:02,582
-Listen well.

209
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:04,248
Be gone from here!

210
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:10,515
I have neither the
time nor the patience

211
00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:13,915
to teach a mere infant
like you how to breathe.

212
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:27,115
-Take it easy,
now, little Nanao.

213
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:28,115
It's gonna be OK.

214
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:35,815
I'm so sorry.

215
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:38,215
I shouldn't have let you
follow us in the first place.

216
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:48,148
NANAO (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe it.

217
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:50,315
All he did was look
straight into my eyes,

218
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:53,182
and he completely
crushed my whole being.

219
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:57,182
I was so naive to
think I could help

220
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:59,748
Captain Ukitake and my captain.

221
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:03,482
I was worried that they would
have trouble defeating the head

222
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:04,515
captain.

223
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:07,382
Now I don't think
it's even possible.

224
00:17:07,415 --> 00:17:10,082
-Please be all
right, my captain.

225
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:17,182
-Your flash step is impressive.

226
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:19,448
Obviously, you've worked
long and hard on it

227
00:17:19,482 --> 00:17:23,248
to be able to cover so
much ground so quickly.

228
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:24,982
-Well, thank you.

229
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:26,915
YAMAMOTO: Looking
back, the two of you

230
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:30,782
always exhibited
exceptional strength.

231
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:33,282
You spent too much time
chasing girls, Shunsui,

232
00:17:33,315 --> 00:17:35,748
and your behavior was wild.

233
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:37,515
But you were intelligent.

234
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:39,682
And your ability to
see the truth far

235
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:42,782
outshone that of the
others in your class.

236
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:47,448
And you, Jushiro, you
had a weak constitution.

237
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:49,648
But you more than made up
for it with your daring

238
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:51,548
and your popularity.

239
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:53,848
Everyone looked up to you.

240
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:56,815
And when it came
time to battle, you

241
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:58,982
both defied the imagination.

242
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:03,515
No one else could hold a
candle to either one of you.

243
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:07,315
You had such strong
will-- training endlessly,

244
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:09,882
continuously holding
your strength.

245
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:11,782
My faith in you
was rewarded when

246
00:18:11,815 --> 00:18:16,248
you became the first captains of
this Academy, which I created.

247
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:21,148
You are my pride and
joy, like my own sons.

248
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:23,248
I believed in you.

249
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:25,882
And though we might have
thought different thoughts,

250
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:28,648
I always felt that we
walked the same path.

251
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,515
Now it appears I
was wrong about you.

252
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:41,182
I am deeply disappointed.

253
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:52,915
-Master Yamamoto.

254
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:55,448
-Do not say anything.

255
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:57,548
The time for words is long past.

256
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:03,482
Draw your swords.

257
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:22,082
What is the meaning
of this, you two?

258
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:24,815
Do not tell me you
intend to fight me

259
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:26,382
without even releasing
your Zanpakuto.

260
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:33,382
-We're still hoping to avoid
fighting at all, old man Yama,

261
00:19:33,415 --> 00:19:34,448
if we can.

262
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:36,115
YAMAMOTO: Silence!

263
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:38,515
I taught you better than that.

264
00:19:38,548 --> 00:19:41,482
You both know that there can
be no forgiveness for those

265
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,182
who defy justice.

266
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,548
KYORAKU: And you also
taught us that sometimes we

267
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:49,848
must carry out justice
on our own, Master.

268
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:51,282
UKITAKE: And that
is the reason we

269
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,615
carry these swords
in the first place.

270
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:55,782
Is it not, Master?

271
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:57,315
-Such foolish talk.

272
00:19:57,348 --> 00:19:59,582
You have no right to
decide for yourselves

273
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,015
what is right and wrong.

274
00:20:01,048 --> 00:20:03,682
It is your duty to accept the
true justice of the world!

275
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:06,915
-Well, then what is the
justice of the world, Master?

276
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:08,448
Who determines right and wrong?

277
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:17,115
-Did you not hear me before?

278
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:20,382
The time for words has passed!

279
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,382
[laughs]

the universe turn to ashes.

UKITAKE: Head Captain
Yamamoto, sir?

285
00:22:56,736 --> 00:22:58,103
What would I have
to do to attain

286
00:22:58,136 --> 00:22:59,469
a muscular body like yours?

287
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,903
KYORAKU: It is
truly magnificent.

288
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:04,236
YAMAMOTO: Well, you must
train each and every day.

289
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:05,269
KYORAKU: Maybe.

290
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:06,836
But it hasn't done
much for your hair.

291
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:10,403
YAMAMOTO: My hair
is magnificent too!
