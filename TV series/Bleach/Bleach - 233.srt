1
00:00:07,346 --> 00:00:13,233
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,633
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:23,533
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:28,400
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:31,033
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:21,602
A man calling himself
Muramasa caused all of
the Zanpakuto to take
their physical form, and

7
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:23,669
attacked the Soul
Society.

8
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:29,002
Without the use of their
Shikai, the Soul Reapers
were overpowered. In one
night, the Zanpakuto

9
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:33,336
delivered a serious blow
to the Thirteen Court
Guard Squads and
vanished.

10
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:38,402
And now, the Seireitei is
in a confused, precarious
state.

11
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:44,502
Meanwhile, Rukia was
searching the Seireitei
for Byakuya, who had gone
missing. Then, without

12
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:48,536
warning, Sodenoshirayuki
appeared before her.

13
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:58,969
Sodenoshirayuki. You are
now free... forever.

14
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:04,869
Rukia!!

15
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,369
That was quite a
spectacle.

16
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,202
Who the hell are you?!

17
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,569
Can't you tell? I'm
a Zanpakuto.

18
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:38,736
Hey, what are you doing?

19
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:42,102
Yeah, do you see anything
interesting out there?

20
00:03:42,136 --> 00:03:45,302
That is none of your
business.

21
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:48,369
What did you say?!
There's no need for
that attitude!

22
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:52,836
Hey, don't
ignore us!

23
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:54,502
Don't bother.

24
00:03:54,974 --> 00:04:00,869
There's no point fighting
with each other.
Remember, our real
enemies are over there.

25
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:02,969
Yeah but still...

26
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:08,636
<i>Heh. And they won't get</i>
<i>away next time. I'm gonna</i>
<i>crush that annoying</i>
<i>bastard.</i>

27
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,302
Yeah, you're right.

28
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:16,036
Now that I think about
it, I am kind-of looking
forward to killing the
one who calls me that

29
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:18,169
insulting nickname.

30
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:21,602
Right. We'll teach
them a good lesson.

31
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,269
Did you say you're a
Zanpakuto?!

32
00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:36,269
That's right.

33
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:41,569
Sodenoshirayuki,
you'd best make yourself
scarce at the moment and
leave this to me...

34
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:43,402
Thank you.

35
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:45,836
Hold it!!

36
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,602
Going somewhere,
Ichigo Kurosaki?

37
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:52,136
How do you know my name?

38
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:54,502
That is not important
right now.

39
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:57,836
What?! What are you up
to?

40
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:03,046
My goal is quite simple:
release all of the
Zanpakuto from the Soul
Reapers.

41
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:04,736
That is all I wish.

42
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:07,269
I see.

43
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:10,736
So you're the one
who's behind all of
this!

44
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:15,402
You know how Rukia can
get her Zanpakuto back!
Start talkin' now!

45
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:20,636
Tell me Ichigo, what
is a Zanpakuto?

46
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:22,502
What?!

47
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:28,836
Zanpakuto are individual
souls that are born
within the hearts of Soul
Reapers.

48
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:33,602
They draw their power
from the same source as
their Soul Reaper, and
are intertwined with

49
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:35,369
their master's soul.

50
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:42,236
Soul Reapers must reach
deep into their own
selves to find the power
hidden within.

51
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,635
They commune with their
Zanpakuto, bond together,
and harness their power
by learning their names.

52
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:54,651
What's more... A few
chosen Soul Reapers can
gain even more power. By
manifesting an

53
00:05:54,932 --> 00:06:00,902
incarnation of their
Zanpakuto, and
controlling it, they
wield the mighty Bankai.

54
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:06,736
You and the captains have
done this.

55
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:12,669
But living alongside Soul
Reapers is not the only
way for a Zanpakuto to
exist.

56
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:14,902
What are you talking
about?

57
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:19,536
I'm saying that every
Zanpakuto has free will,
just like you do.

58
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,536
They have free will?

59
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:28,111
Yes. Zanpakuto are not
dependent on Soul
Reapers. We are
separate entities.

60
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:31,869
Two distinct beings, no
one greater than the
other.

61
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:36,802
<i>Is that so hard to</i>
<i>believe?</i>

62
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:40,069
<i>More proof of how</i>
<i>arrogant you Soul Reapers</i>
<i>are.</i>

63
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:42,124
You've got it wrong.

64
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:47,915
<i>Your blindness is why</i>
<i>I'm here. I understand</i>
<i>how the Zanpakuto thinks.</i>

65
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,820
<i>I can see into their souls.</i>

66
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,169
<i>And I can grant physical</i>
<i>form to those who choose</i>
<i>to join me.</i>

67
00:06:56,636 --> 00:06:58,469
Impossible!

68
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:04,002
Any Zanpakuto who answers
my call will become
liberated from their Soul
Reaper, and manifest in

69
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:06,969
the world as their true
form.

70
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:10,402
That power is the gift
that I alone possess.

71
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:13,369
Why the hell would the
Zanpakuto listen to you?

72
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:18,902
Simple. Because
ignorant people like you
have oppressed them for
so very long.

73
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:20,836
You're wrong.

74
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:23,069
Huh?

75
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:26,201
What you're saying just
isn't the truth.

76
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,769
I have never looked down on
Sodenoshirayuki as my inferior.

77
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:33,269
Rukia!

78
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:36,269
Your Zanpakuto does not
share your opinion.

79
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:40,169
Clearly, Sodenoshirayuki
has confirmed what I'm
saying.

80
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:46,302
There's no need to push
yourself. You have served
your purpose well.

81
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:49,136
What do you mean?

82
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,902
Did you honestly believe
you were able to escape
the World of the Living
on your own?

83
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:55,602
What?

84
00:07:55,636 --> 00:08:01,502
My objective is to free
all the Zanpakuto from
their Soul Reapers. No
exceptions.

85
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:07,902
And in order to do that,
I needed you, Ichigo
Kurosaki, to find your
way here.

86
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:11,269
You're saying...
you used Rukia?!

87
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:15,836
Welcome to my world.

88
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:19,402
Ichigo.

89
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:23,302
I'll handle this guy. Just
stay put and rest up.

90
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,002
There's no way in hell
you're gonna get away
with this!

91
00:08:26,402 --> 00:08:27,769
Let's take this
elsewhere.

92
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:29,536
Whatever you want, boy.

93
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:33,902
Ichigo.

94
00:08:58,302 --> 00:09:00,936
Getsuga tensho!

95
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:15,402
Where is he?!

96
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:23,569
What?!

97
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:29,136
<i>Put down your sword.</i>

98
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:32,155
Damn it!

99
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:56,988
<i>This is useless.</i>

100
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:07,621
What is this?!

101
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:20,388
Damn it! What did you do
to me!?

102
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:30,688
Bastard!

103
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:41,066
Now hear my voice.
Follow your instincts

104
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:44,288
and
release your soul from
this body.

105
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:54,709
Discard your fear.

106
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:59,671
Look ahead. Go forth.
Do not stop.

107
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:07,288
Turn back, and you will
age. Hesitate and you
will die.

108
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:16,788
Come now. I know your
name... Zangetsu!

109
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:19,188
Aaaggghhh!!

110
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:29,755
What happened?

111
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:31,055
<i>Ichigo.</i>

112
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:41,288
Zangetsu. How can you
be here!?

113
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:52,321
Zangetsu, what the hell?
Why are you doing
this?!

114
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,055
Answer me!

115
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:59,788
What happened to the two
of us being one mind and
one body!?

116
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,155
Dammit!

117
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:32,721
I'm impressed you can
still move.

118
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:34,821
But, it's over for you.

119
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:49,688
Zangetsu, I don't
understand. You're
with him now?!

120
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:51,688
Dammit!

121
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:55,288
Getsuga tensho.

122
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:18,197
Captain Unohana!

123
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,564
Oh, Isane? Is something
the matter?

124
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:24,431
Yes Ma'am! I have a
field report from Squad
Twelve.

125
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:28,764
You're saying that the
Zanpakuto have somehow
become separate entities?

126
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:29,631
Yes.

127
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:31,464
What does that mean?

128
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:36,364
I'm not exactly sure of
the ramifications, but
master Mayuri came to
this conclusion only

129
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:39,464
after testing the
phenomenon on his own
body.

130
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:41,664
Could you share the
details?

131
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:42,431
Yes.

132
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:50,231
Hmmm.

133
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:56,064
Well, it would seem the
Zanpakuto's spirit really
has left my body.

134
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:02,131
Fascinating. Most
fascinating.

135
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:07,197
Master Mayuri, I was
under the impression that
Zanpakuto and Soul
Reapers were different

136
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:10,731
manifestations of the
same essential soul.

137
00:14:10,764 --> 00:14:16,064
Normally that is the
case. But now the two
have split into entirely
distinct entities.

138
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:17,664
That's impossible.

139
00:14:17,697 --> 00:14:23,197
That's why it fascinates
me! And don't act like a
know-it-all, you useless
idiot!

140
00:14:23,969 --> 00:14:29,931
Hmm... The real
question, is what
caused this change to
suddenly take place?

141
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:37,064
From what you're telling
us, it seems that our current
situation is actually worse
than I had imagined.

142
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:40,797
'Scuse me, but can I
ask a question about
something?

143
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:45,397
Since they aren't
connected to us anymore,
what'll happen if one of
the Soul Reapers defeats

144
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:47,431
a Zanpakuto in battle?

145
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:48,997
I don't know.

146
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:53,497
If that happened, is
there a chance we would
lose our Zanpakuto
forever?

147
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:58,797
It is possible, but without
more data, I can't tell you for
certain what would happen...

148
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,464
Oh no.

149
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:05,964
I understand. I suppose
the only thing we can do
is have faith in Captain
Kurotsuchi.

150
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:11,064
There's one more thing.
Master Mayuri had a request
for you, Captain Unohana.

151
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:13,031
What did he want?

152
00:15:13,064 --> 00:15:17,131
He asked if you would
provide him with data on
the Soul Reapers
currently receiving

153
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:20,497
treatment from Squad
Four, so that he can
analyze it.

154
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:23,764
Of course. I'll have it
sent to you right away.

155
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,164
And also...

156
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:29,997
He wants to start
compiling a data profile
on you, as well.

157
00:15:30,031 --> 00:15:34,697
You mean Captain Unohana
has to go all the way to
the Department of Research
and Development?!

158
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:39,797
That's right. He told
me he needs to start
collecting data on all
of the captains.

159
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:41,164
Very well then.

160
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:42,531
But Captain!

161
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:44,531
It'll be all right,
Isane.

162
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:46,631
Ma'am, but you--

163
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:52,497
You know Captain Kurotsuchi's
examination with be incredibly
personal and invasive.

164
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:54,764
Are you sure
about this, ma'am?

165
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:59,497
Isane, I'm afraid we are
in a race against time.

166
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:01,031
Yes, ma'am.

167
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:05,397
In return for my
cooperation, I ask that
you to report any new
findings to us

168
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,831
immediately.
Understood?

169
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:08,497
Of course.

170
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:10,531
Field report!

171
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:14,997
Large-scale combat has
been confirmed in the
Seireitei!

172
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:20,364
<i>The Spiritual Pressure</i>
<i>detected at the scene</i>
<i>belongs to Rukia Kuchiki</i>
<i>of Squad Thirteen, and</i>

173
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,397
<i>Substitute Soul Reaper</i>
<i>Ichigo Kurosaki!</i>

174
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:44,664
What's this?

175
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:10,264
And who might you be?

176
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:15,364
You're not Ichigo
Kurosaki.

177
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:21,164
No. What you're seeing
is the other soul that
lives within his body.

178
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:22,664
<i>Other soul?</i>

179
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:24,964
Getsuga...

180
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:27,697
...tensho!

181
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,931
Instant regeneration.

182
00:18:57,276 --> 00:18:59,443
This Spiritual
Pressure.

183
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,643
As I thought.

184
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,143
What is this?

185
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:35,943
You can't have it! I
won't give it to you!
I'm not giving this power
to you!

186
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,810
I will not let you steal
what belongs to me!!

187
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:45,176
Zangetsu.

188
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:57,543
Zangetsu--

189
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:10,410
Who is this man?

190
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,050
Zangetsu, why?!

191
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:52,284
I've grown bored with
your internal world.

192
00:23:52,317 --> 00:23:53,335
<i>What?!</i>

193
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:59,327
It's all buildings and no
greenery. I want to see
forests. I long for the
grandeur of nature.

194
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,350
<i>I can plant a garden or</i>
<i>something.</i>
