-Yeah?

AIZEN (VOICE OVER): If you
are reading this letter,

00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:15,999
then I am probably
no longer alive.

10
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:19,199
There is no one in Seireitei
whom I trust as much as you,

11
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:20,999
so I've written you
this letter to document

12
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:22,799
the truth I've uncovered.

MOMO (VOICE OVER): When I first
read the Captain's letter,

14
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:27,232
I couldn't believe my eyes.

15
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:29,932
How could something like
that possibly be true?

16
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:33,465
I didn't want to believe
it, but know I know.

17
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:35,165
It is true.

18
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,132
Everything he wrote was true.

If you can faint from
hunger, then that obviously

23
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:09,699
means that you have it, right?

24
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:12,465
The power.

25
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:14,499
-So you have it, too?

-Yes, just like you.

My name is Gin.

I'm pleased to meet you.

-Gin?

30
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:23,399
What a strange name.

31
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,465
-So your finally awake.

00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:35,732
-Captain, I-- what are
you doing here in my room?

33
00:03:35,765 --> 00:03:37,265
-Better take a
look around, idiot.

34
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,032
You're in the office,
not your room.

35
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:41,799
Since you're awake,
you can take over.

36
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:44,132
I'm completely exhausted.

37
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:46,765
-Maybe if you hadn't done all
the paperwork for Squad 5's

38
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,265
takeover yourself, you
wouldn't be so exhausted.

39
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:51,599
-Be quiet and just
finish it off, will you?

40
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:56,799
-It seems like you've
left out a few things.

41
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:59,099
What about all the details of--

42
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:02,499
-Didn't I tell
you to keep quiet?

RANGIKU (OFFSCREEN): I, uh--
I've been asleep a long time,

HITSUGAYA (OFFSCREEN):
Don't worry about it.

46
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:14,632
You have a classmate who's
fighting with your junior.

47
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:18,565
That can't be easy for you.

48
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:21,832
RANGIKU (VOICE
OVER): My classmate?

49
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:26,565
Captain, do you honestly
think he could have done it?

50
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,265
Was Gin really capable of that?

51
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:31,865
KOKICHIRO (OFFSCREEN):
Excuse me, sir.

52
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:34,899
I am Kokichiro Takezoe,
Squad 10, 7th Seat.

53
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:37,099
I'm looking for Captain
Hitsugaya and Lieutenant

Matsumoto.

55
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,699
May I come in?

56
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:40,565
-Yes.

57
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:41,832
What do you want?

58
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,432
-Sir, I beg your pardon, but
this is an urgent matter.

59
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:47,232
There's been an incident
at the prison that

60
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:49,132
requires your
immediate attention.

61
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:52,899
Sir, Lieutenant Abarai and
Lieutenant Hinamori, as well as

62
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:54,799
Lieutenant Kira, sir.

63
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:56,632
All of them have vanished
from their cells.

64
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,865
-Please forgive me, sir.

65
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,999
It all happened so quickly.

66
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,899
Lieutenant Hinamori
called out to me,

67
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,632
and when I turned
around, I was blinded

68
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:11,432
by ant intense white light.

69
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:12,765
That's all I remember.

70
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,699
When I woke up,
they were all gone.

71
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,032
I have no excuse, sir.

72
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:18,565
-It was Hakufuku.

73
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:20,265
-Hakufuku?

74
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:23,932
-I should've remembered that
Momo was a master of Kido.

75
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:26,465
If we had been serious about
wanting to restrain her,

76
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:27,899
we would have made
certain that we

77
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:30,765
sealed her spiritual
pressure, but we didn't even

78
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,965
think of taking that action.

79
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,465
We had no reason
because none of us

80
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:38,965
actually believed she would
ever take things this far.

81
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,365
-It's not as if she were being
threatened with execution,

82
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,632
so why would--

83
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:46,065
-There's only one explanation
that makes any sense.

84
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:47,532
-Huh?

85
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:48,199
-Rangiku.

86
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:49,465
-Yes?

87
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:50,265
-You're to go home.

88
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:52,199
That's an order.

89
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:54,299
I only hope I'm in
time to save Momo.

That makes number 52.

-Damn it.

102
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:15,499
I almost had the
bastard that time.

103
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:18,365
YORUICHI (VOICE OVER):
Ichigo, at the exact moment

104
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,865
of impact, you adjusted
to the enemy speed

105
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,365
and were able to
deflect his blade.

106
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,532
Then without missing a
beat, you instantaneously

107
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:29,532
countered with your
own unique attack.

108
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:32,132
It's obvious that you
no longer rely solely

on the power of Zanjutsu.

absolutely right.

-That's not good.

116
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,565
Have you caught a cold, boss?

117
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,199
-No, I'm sure there's probably
just a pretty girl talking

118
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:57,099
about me somewhere.

119
00:07:57,132 --> 00:07:59,932
-Somehow I find that
hard to believe.

-I'm sorry, did
you say something?

AIZEN (VOICE OVER):
What purpose does it

144
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:46,865
serve to have Rukia
Kuchiki executed?

145

And why do they keep moving
up the date of the execution?

In my search for the
answers to these questions,

00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:56,132
I came upon the truth.

00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,863
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): I had no
idea it was night already.

165
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:45,430
Man, this place is
so disorienting.

166
00:10:45,463 --> 00:10:47,697
I never know what time it is.

167
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:51,997
Huh?

168
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,530
What's with this hot spring?

169
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:00,130
My scars healing like crazy!

170
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:01,930
This is freaking awesome!

171
00:11:01,963 --> 00:11:05,730
What'll it do if I drink it?

172
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:06,930
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN): Ichigo.

173
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:07,663
-Hmm?

174
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:08,430
-How's the water?

175
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:09,663
Everything all right?

176
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:11,730
[mumbling]

177
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:12,663
-Nice, huh?

178
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:14,130
I'm glad to hear it.

179
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:16,430
[mumbling]

180
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:19,330
-In fact, it sounds so
good I think I'll join you.

181
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:20,230
-Yahhh!

182
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,663
[coughing] Are you nuts!

183
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:22,563
What are you doing?

184
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:23,630
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN): Why?

185
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:24,497
What do you mean?

186
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,597
Is something wrong?

187
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,463
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah, something's wrong!

188
00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:28,097
You just took your pants off!

189
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,863
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN):
What's the big deal?

190
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,763
Come on, loosen up, Ichigo.

191
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:32,930
Don't be so old fashioned.

192
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:34,163
You're such a prude.

193
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:36,130
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Cut--
cut it out, will you?

194
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,297
Stop making fun of me!

195
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,197
Ah, no!

196
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,630
Don't come in!

197
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:42,563
No, no!

198
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:45,197
-I don't know what you're
getting so worked up about.

199
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,163
-Uh--

200
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:46,997
-What?

201
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,597
Are you a little disappointed?

202
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,263
Come on, be honest.

203
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:51,397
You are, aren't you?

204
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,630
You little pervert.

205
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:55,130
-I am going to drown you!

206
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:57,097
[music playing]

207
00:12:00,597 --> 00:12:03,030
-Hey, this place looks familiar.

208
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:04,230
-How's that?

209
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,197
-I've been thinking
about it for a while now,

210
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,163
and I finally figured out
what it reminds me of.

211
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:13,797
It looks like the training
room under Uda Harashah.

212
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,897
-You picked up on that, huh?

213
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,030
We tried to model that
place after this one

214
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:18,930
when we built it.

215
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:20,397
-You built this place?

216
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,697
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

217
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,797
When Kisuke and I were kids,
we needed a place to play,

218
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,797
so we snuck off and
built this place.

219
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,063
It was our own little
secret hideout.

220
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:31,530
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Secret hideout?

221
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:32,563
this place is huge!

222
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:35,197
How'd you ever keep it a secret?

223
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,730
-It's a very long story.

224
00:12:37,763 --> 00:12:39,297
Back when the two
of us were kids,

225
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,230
we used to play here
almost every day.

226
00:12:41,263 --> 00:12:44,597
When we got older, he joined
the 13th Court Guard Squad

227
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,297
and I joined the Stealth
Force, but we'd still

228
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,363
come here to hone our skills.

229
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:50,563
-Wait a minute, Yoruichi.

230
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,763
You mean you two used to-- yaaa!

231
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:54,797
You scared the hell out of me!

232
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,130
Can't you even cross your legs?

233
00:12:56,163 --> 00:12:58,330
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN): I
always get the same reaction.

234
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,130
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah, just tell me more

235
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:01,397
about Mr. Hat-and-Clogs.

236
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,463
The truth, now.

237
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:05,363
The guy's really a
Soul Reaper, isn't he?

238
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:06,397
-Mm-hum.

239
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,630
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
I always wondered

240
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,330
how he knew so much
about the Soul Society,

241
00:13:10,363 --> 00:13:14,263
not to mention the fact
that he had a Zanpakuto.

242
00:13:14,297 --> 00:13:15,897
I want to know, Yoruichi.

243
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,030
I want to know the truth
about the guy who trained me.

244
00:13:20,063 --> 00:13:20,997
-All right, then.

245
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,863
He's the former
Captain of Squad 12

246
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:26,997
of the 13 Court Guard
Squads In addition to that,

247
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,597
he's the one who
conceived and founded

248
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,530
the Department of
Research and Development

249
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:33,330
and served as its first Chief.

250
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:34,563
-Are you serious?

251
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:37,597
I had no idea Mr. Hat-and-Clogs
was such a hot shot.

252
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,430
[music playing]

253
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,763
-I figured as much.

254
00:13:43,797 --> 00:13:45,430
KISUKE (OFFSCREEN):
That stuff was horrible!

255
00:13:45,463 --> 00:13:46,663
You trying to kill me?

256
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:47,697
Oh!

257
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,930
-Don't worry, I've
got a remedy that'll

258
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:50,530
take care of that
stomach of yours.

259
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,397
I'll get some from the guard.

260
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,063
Sit tight.

261
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:52,930
I'll be right back.

262
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:54,097
KISUKE (OFFSCREEN): That's it!

263
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,430
Oh, you really are trying
to kill me, aren't you?

264
00:13:55,463 --> 00:13:56,230
Ohh!

265
00:13:56,263 --> 00:13:57,763
-I wonder about those guys.

266
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:21,030
HITSUGAYA (OFFSCREEN):
I suspected

267
00:14:21,063 --> 00:14:21,963
I'd find you together.

268
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:28,863
-Captain Hitsugaya!

269
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:30,130
I--

270
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:31,463
-Hmm.

271
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:33,797
I figured you were behind
this, because out of the three,

272
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,630
Izuru's was the
only cell that had

273
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:37,597
been opened from the outside.

274
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,463
If you didn't want
to get caught,

275
00:14:39,497 --> 00:14:41,597
you should have
been more careful.

276
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,297
That was careless
even for you, Gin.

277
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,963
-It's funny that
you would accuse me

278
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:50,197
of being careless when
the fact of the matter

279
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,730
is I left him that way on
purpose so that you'd know.

280
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:59,030
-It's a good thing I
arrived before Momo.

281
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:01,963
I'll kill you before
she gets here.

282
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:03,897
Your blood will be on my hands.

283
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:14,530
Momo, no!

284
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:18,130
-I found you just in time.

285
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:21,263
I'm glad I'm not too late.

286
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:22,297
-Don't do this, Momo!

287
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,497
You're no match for him.

288
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,830
You'll just wind up dead.

289
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:29,130
Now stand back and
let me handle this!

290
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:30,430
What do you think you're doing?

291
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:36,830
-I'm about to take
revenge for Captain Aizen.

292
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,597
Why, Toshiro?

293
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,797
Why did you kill him?

294
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:48,930
There's no need to pretend.

295
00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:50,763
I know everything.

296
00:15:50,797 --> 00:15:52,763
The Captain wrote it all down.

297
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:55,130
It's here in this letter.

298
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,163
AIZEN (VOICE OVER):
Momo, the true purpose

299
00:15:57,197 --> 00:16:00,530
for this execution is not
to kill Rukia Kuchiki.

300
00:16:00,563 --> 00:16:03,597
She's merely a pawn in
a much larger scheme.

301
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,430
The execution was
contrived in order

302
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:11,597
to steal a certain object,
an object of great value,

303
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,597
the Sokyoku.

304
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,597
The Sokyoku's seal is broken
only for an execution.

305
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,697
In that one blade lies the
destructive power of a million

306
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,763
Zanpakuto.

307
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:26,597
It possess the defensive
ability to block

308
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,130
Zanpakuto of equal power.

309
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:32,697
More importantly,
when a Soul reaper

310
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,563
is crucified and then
stabbed with Sokyoku,

311
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,763
the blade's power grows
exponentially dozens of times

312
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:40,263
over.

313
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:45,663
The one who plotted
this execution

314
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:49,330
plans to use this power
to destroy the Seireitei.

315
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:53,230
Once that's done, they intend
to obliterate the entire Soul

316
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,363
Society as well.

317
00:16:54,397 --> 00:16:57,163
-He wrote it down, the
name of the person,

318
00:16:57,197 --> 00:17:01,130
the one who intended
to do all of this.

319
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:03,230
Toshiro Hitsugaya.

320
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:08,797
The letter goes on to say--

321
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,363
AIZEN (VOICE OVER): I have
no choice but to confront him

322
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,697
about this, so
I've called him out

323
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,997
to the sacred
Eastern Wall tonight.

324
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,830
I must do whatever
it takes to stop him.

325
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:21,763
-"If I cannot persuade him
to abandon this evil plan,

326
00:17:21,797 --> 00:17:23,230
then I'm resolved to fight him.

327
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:26,963
If I should die,
then it's up to you.

328
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:29,597
You must find a way to
accomplish what I could not,

329
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,997
kill him and save the Seireitei.

330
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,730
Please, this is
my final request.

331
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:38,097
I ask not as the
Captain of Squad 5,

332
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,663
but merely as a humble man.

333
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:45,697
Please, I beg of you--"

334
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,130
-Momo, let's not--

-[yelling]

336
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:00,134
-Don't be a fool!

337
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:01,434
Think about what you're saying!

338
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:04,434
If he dies, he wants you
to risk your life as well?

339
00:18:04,468 --> 00:18:07,001
Do you honestly believe
Captain Aizen would say that?

340
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:08,834
The Captain Aizen
I know would never

341
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,801
be stupid enough to face
unbeatable odds alone,

342
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,668
and if he did, he
certainly wasn't

343
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:14,768
a coward who would ask
his men to bail him out

344
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,534
because he couldn't
get the job done!

345
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:17,668
-I know.

346
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:20,168
But the Captain wrote
it all in his letter.

347
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:21,134
He did!

348
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,101
And I know it was
his handwriting.

349
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:24,568
I recognized it.

350
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:28,001
I didn't want to believe
it either, but it's true!

351
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:31,701
And this is what he wanted me
to do, so I'm going to do it!

352
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:40,701
I can't do it.

353
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:42,001
I can't!

354
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:44,368
[sobbing] I'm so confused.

355
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:46,268
I don't know what to do anymore.

356
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:50,034
I don't know what
to do, little Shiro.

357
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:52,601
-Momo, you can't.

I can't reason with her.

No matter what I say, it
just doesn't get through.

361
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:04,234
She's too upset to
think rationally,

362
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,468
but I know I'm right.

363
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:07,434
Aizen would never write
a letter like that.

364
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:09,568
Someone must have forged
it so that Momo and I would

365
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:10,901
try to kill each other.

Of course.

Damn him!

369
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,601
Only one person is
capable of doing all this,

370
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:32,934
and now you'll pay!

-Oh, my.

374
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:59,168
Who's have thought the Squad
10 Captain could be so cruel?

375
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:02,568
The girl was obviously suffering
from emotional distress,

376
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,868
so why'd you have to hit to
poor little thing so hard?

377
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:09,601
-Gin.

378
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:11,901
GIN (VOICE OVER): The
warning certainly came

379
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:15,734
at a convenient time for you.

380
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:19,934
-What exactly are
you after, Gin?

381
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:23,234
HITSUGAYA (VOICE OVER): The
words you spoke that day,

382
00:20:23,268 --> 00:20:25,134
they're etched into my memory.

383
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:28,334
GIN (VOICE OVER):
You're always the same.

384
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:30,734
You need to stop and
listen more often.

385
00:20:30,768 --> 00:20:34,268
You wouldn't want to
miss the last alarm, now.

386
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:37,534
It won't be long before you'll
never be able to hear it again.

387
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:44,134
-So Aizen wasn't enough for you.

388
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:47,901
You couldn't be happy until
you'd hurt Momo as well.

389
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:51,168
You slid your lies into
her mind like a dagger

390
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:53,968
and twisted them until they were
so painful that her hands bled

391
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,968
from gripping her sword so hard.

392
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:58,768
-I'm sorry, I'm afraid
I don't follow you.

393
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:03,934
-I gave you a warning.

394
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:08,301
I told you that if
you never hurt Mom,

395
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:09,368
I would kill you myself!

396
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,368
-This will never do.

397
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:24,834
If you insist on drawing your
sword in a place like this,

398
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:28,168
then I'm afraid you leave me no
other choice than to stop you.

you got to trust me this time.

I read about it

in the back of a manga.

It's the latest
Chinese medicine.
