RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): A
Menos Grande appeared,

3
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:54,886
and somehow he defeated it.

4
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,661
It won't take long for
the news to get back

5
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:03,027
to the Soul Society, Ichigo.

6
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:07,961
[screaming]

00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:13,027

00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:13,794
[yawn]

9
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:20,961
-What's the big idea of
waking up so early, fuzz ball?

10
00:02:20,994 --> 00:02:22,261
You have a nightmare?

11
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:23,727
-Oh, I'll say it's a nightmare.

12
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:25,294
Just look what your
sister did to me.

13
00:02:25,327 --> 00:02:26,394
This is an outrage.

14
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:28,261
I'm calling the stuffed
animal protection--

15
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:29,394
-Quit complaining.

16
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:31,161
They usually wash you
because you were filthy,

17
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,361
besides you shouldn't be
running around naked anyway.

18
00:02:33,394 --> 00:02:35,894
-Listen, the bath and
the froufrou outfit

19
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:38,461
were bad enough, but
then she took super glue

20
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:40,361
and stuck this flower to my ear.

21
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,061
-So?

22
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,427
-Oh, right.

23
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:45,827
Like you don't see the problem
with a boy wearing a flower?

24
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,361
Yeah, you're right, Kon.

25
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:52,161
That sucker's really on
there to say, isn't it?

26
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:53,394
Well, let's see.

27
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:55,727
I could surgically
remove your ear.

28
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:56,661
-Wha?

29
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:57,761
-Whoa, how'd it
get to be so late?

30
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:00,761
I've got to get moving.

31
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:01,894
Breakfast, here I come.

32
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:08,127
-What did I ever do
to deserve this kind

33
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:09,661
of humiliating treatment?

34
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:11,161
Aren't I on of the team, too?

35
00:03:11,194 --> 00:03:12,961
Am I'm not an equal?

36
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:14,894
Don't I deserve some respect?

37
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:15,694
Fine, then.

38
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,494
They don't want me around?

39
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:18,327
I'll fix them.

40
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:19,427
I'll take off.

41
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:21,561
I'll go on a journey
of my own to someplace

42
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:23,294
where I'm appreciated.

43
00:03:23,327 --> 00:03:25,527
Someplace where I truly belong.

44
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:29,127
-Hey, Rukia, time
to leave for school.

45
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:30,594
Hey, now.

46
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,194
I'm serious.

47
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:33,327
-I heard you.

48
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:35,727
I'm not deaf, you know.

49
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,461
-Hey, is something wrong?

50
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:40,061
-I'm fine.

51
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,694
I think I'm just a little tired
after yesterday's incident,

52
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:44,094
you know?

53
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:46,094
-You're not upset
about anything?

54
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:46,961
-No.

55
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,961
I'll see you at school.

56
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:51,061
-That's weird.

57
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:54,127
-Running away to start a new
life seemed like a good idea,

58
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:57,327
but I wished I'd remembered
to bring along a little lunch,

59
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:58,861
plus I don't have any money.

60
00:03:58,894 --> 00:04:00,261
Hell, I don't have any pockets.

61
00:04:00,294 --> 00:04:00,827
Huh?

62
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:01,327
Jackpot!

63
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,927
-Huh?

64
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:08,727
-Come on, pick me up.

65
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:10,461
You know you want to.

66
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:13,261
All girls love cute
little stuffed animals.

67
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,961
And these are
Orihime's classmates.

68
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:15,594
Perfect.

69
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:16,827
-Oh, look at that.

70
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,227
Someone left a cute little--

71
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:19,927
-Filthy stuffed animal.

72
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,127
-Huh?

73
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,361
Uh-oh.

74
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:26,127
I said that out loud, didn't
I. I just blew my cover.

75
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:28,461
-It just talked, didn't it?

76
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:29,061
-Yes.

77
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:30,327
It sure did.

78
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:33,294
-OK, Kon, let's think calmly
how to get out of this.

79
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:37,394
Get up and run like hell!

80
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:41,361
-No stuffed animal outruns
track star Rio Kunieda.

81
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:44,194
I run the 100 meters
in 12 seconds flat.

82
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:45,394
-Oh, why me?

83
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:46,894
All I wanted was
a little kindness.

84
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:49,827
Instead, I keep running into
people who want to stomp on me.

85
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,627
[humming]

86
00:04:57,661 --> 00:04:58,127
-Huh?

87
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:01,561
Hi, Rukia.

88
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:02,694
How are you?

89
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:04,227
-Oh, hey there, Orihime.

90
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:05,027
I'm fine.

91
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:07,161
-Can I walk with you?

92
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:08,961
-Of course, you can.

93
00:05:08,994 --> 00:05:10,961
I didn't know you were
an early riser like me.

94
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,661
Do you always come
to school this early?

95
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:14,094
-No, I'm usually late.

96
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:16,927
But somehow this year, I'm so
excited that I can't sleep,

97
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:19,694
and every morning I pop
out of bed all sparkly.

98
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:20,194
Yay.

99
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:21,261
-Nice.

100
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:23,294
-Summer's just the
best season, isn't it?

101
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,361
What are you going to do
for your vacation, Rukia?

102
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,994
-Uh, oh, I have no idea.

103
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,194
-There's a fireworks festival
in August and Tatsuki

104
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:31,727
and a bunch of us are going.

105
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:33,261
You should come
along with us, Rukia.

106
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:36,527
We go every summer, and
it's always really fun.

107
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:37,761
What do you say?

108
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:39,494
-The fireworks festival?

109
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:40,927
-Um-hmm.

110
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:43,861
In fact, we should ask
Ichigo to go with us, too.

111
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:45,261
It'll be just like
the time we all

112
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:47,261
went to see Don
Kanonji together.

113
00:05:47,294 --> 00:05:49,394
Now that was fun.

114
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:52,327
-Oh, yeah, that certainly
was interesting, wasn't it?

115
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,394
-Um-hmm.

116
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:56,294
Of course, Ichigo
came along that time,

117
00:05:56,327 --> 00:05:57,761
because his family was going.

118
00:05:57,794 --> 00:06:00,027
He can be so
thoughtful sometimes.

119
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:00,794
-Huh?

120
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,727
-And his family's so fun.

121
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:04,661
Sometimes I wonder how
he's related to them,

122
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:06,894
because he's so
serious all the time.

123
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:09,261
If I didn't know better,
I'd say it's almost

124
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:11,794
like Ichigo has a permanent
frown on his face.

125
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:13,027
-Yes, I know what you mean.

126
00:06:13,061 --> 00:06:14,494
Funny, though, I
always thought you

127
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,694
didn't like Ichigo
very much, Orihime.

128
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:19,661
-Well, let's just say when
you take a good look at him,

129
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:21,027
he has a really
interesting face.

130
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:26,794
I hope you come to the festival.

131
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:27,661
You'll have fun.

132
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:28,494
I promise.

133
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:30,594
-All right, I'll think about it.

134
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:48,994
-I'm ready to go, Tatsuki!

135
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:52,027
Give me your best fastball.

136
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:54,861
-Oh, I found you,
my goddess Orihime.

137
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:58,061
Things didn't work out so
well the last time we met,

138
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:00,194
but this time will be different.

139
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:02,194
All I have to do is just
lie there helpless right

140
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:04,061
in her path, and
when she sees me,

141
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:05,827
have no choice
but to pick me up.

142
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:08,627
Then my life will be complete
as she cuddles me and holds me

143
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,027
tenderly, in the valley
of stuffed pillows.

144
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:14,361
Yes, I have finally
devised the perfect plan

145
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:15,894
to achieve my goal.

146
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:18,361
Now to put it into action.

147
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:21,161
Oh, beautiful Orihime, your
awesome cuddles await me.

148
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:21,994
Wait!

149
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:23,627
This is not part of the plan.

150
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,594
-Pitch coming.

151
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:26,561
Dragon bazooka kick!

152
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:31,427
-Here we go!

153
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:38,261
-Orihime, how could you?

154
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:41,094
-Yeah, nice hit, Orihime, but
it was a pretty easy target in

155
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,927
and really the defense
didn't have a chance.

156
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:45,227
One measly run hardly
seems like a reason

157
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:46,327
to break out the champagne.

158
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:46,727
-Huh?

159
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,194
Oh.

160
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:54,294
-Are they playing or what?

161
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:55,594
-Yo, Ichigo.

162
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:56,961
Checking out the girls, huh?

163
00:07:56,994 --> 00:08:00,927
Oh, I gotcha,
staring at Orihime.

164
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:04,127
Ooh-wee, she is quite
the boobalicious babe.

165
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:07,761
-Hey, I thought I told you
to never do that again.

166
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:09,261
-Oh, right, like
you don't know it's

167
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:12,594
totally normal for teenage boys
to be obsessed with hot cuties.

168
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:14,727
-OK, I admit there's
nothing wrong with that.

169
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,961
-What did you say?

170
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:16,927
Oh, I get it.

171
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:18,594
Orihime's just not your type.

172
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,661
-Quit all that messing
around and get over here

173
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:22,261
and help me out.

174
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:22,794
-Oh, right.

175
00:08:22,827 --> 00:08:25,461
Sorry.

176
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:26,161
There.

177
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:26,961
That does it.

178
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:28,461
-Thanks a lot, Ichigo.

179
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:31,261
-Hey, that reminds me, have
you guys seen Uryu anywhere?

180
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:32,361
He's not in school today.

181
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:38,061
-Yeah, yesterday I
saw him in the park.

182
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:39,894
He was talking to himself
and running around

183
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:41,261
and acting like a weirdo.

184
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:44,427
It's like he was having some
battle with imaginary monsters

185
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:45,527
or something.

186
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:46,394
-Was Asano yesterday.

187
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:48,294
That could be trouble.

188
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,827
-Hey, now you mention it,
maybe that's his deal.

189
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:52,561
Maybe Uryu's in
some drama class,

190
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:54,161
and he was there
rehearsing for a play.

191
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:56,261
Come to think of it, there were
three other weird people there,

192
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:57,194
too.

193
00:08:57,227 --> 00:08:58,461
Those must have
been his co-stars.

194
00:08:58,494 --> 00:08:59,994
I think there was
even some kind of--

195
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:02,527
-Thankfully, Keigo's
a total idiot.

196
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:04,127
It looks like I
dodged another bullet.

197
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:20,827
-Uryu, what in the
world happened to you?

198
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,727
-I, uh, fell down the stairs.

199
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:29,494
-Hmm, whatever you say.

200
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:37,661
Well, take your seat
and turn to page 110.

201
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:38,761
-Don't let it bother you.

202
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:39,594
-Hmm?

203
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:41,561
-His injuries aren't your fault.

204
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:42,861
He brought it on himself.

205
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:45,427
Besides it would
have happened anyway.

206
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,294
-You've got to be kidding.

207
00:09:47,327 --> 00:09:49,761
I'm not the least bit
worried about Uryu.

208
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:50,894
-Interesting.

209
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:52,961
I never suggested you
were worried about him.

210
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:55,894
If you recall, all I said
was don't let it bother you.

211
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:56,861
-Why you.

212
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:04,761
-Do you think he was in a fight?

213
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:05,227
-Uryu?

214
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:06,161
No way.

215
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:07,861
I can't believe
he came in so late

216
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:10,561
in the middle of third period.

217
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:12,094
-All right, class, quiet down.

218
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:22,127
-Ichigo, ready to go
have lunch, big guy?

219
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:24,327
-I guess I'm ready,
but how about if I

220
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:25,594
invite someone new to join us?

221
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:27,594
-Oh, you want to invite
the new girl, I bet, huh?

222
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,694
Go mister.

223
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:30,861
-Hey, Urju, what's up?

224
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:32,727
You want to come have
some lunch with me?

225
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:34,961
-Ah, what is Ichigo doing
inviting the freakazoid

226
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,227
to eat lunch with us?

227
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,027
He must have blown a fuse
to do something so stupid.

228
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:40,027
I can't be seen with that geek.

229
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:41,427
Anyone but Mr. Bandages.

230
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:43,761
Ichigo, have you gone crazy?

231
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:45,661
-I think you're the crazy one.

232
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:46,561
-No thanks.

233
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:47,927
-Oh, how rude.

234
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:48,594
-Oh, come on.

235
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:49,594
It's no big deal.

236
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,027
Besides, Asano's buying.

237
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:52,427
-I'm buying?

238
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:53,827
-Well, if you insist.

239
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,261
-Oh, it's like that, huh?

240
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:08,561
-I've been under suspicion
from the very beginning,

241
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:12,194
and it won't be much longer
before they come for me.

242
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:13,261
-There she is.

243
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:14,027
Hey, Rukia.

244
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:15,394
Come on down.

245
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,694
Why don't you join us for lunch?

246
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:21,794
-Yeah!

247
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:22,727
Oh, wow.

248
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:23,794
-Jinta, stop.

249
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:26,161
You're supposed to
be helping me sweep.

250
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:28,294
-Nah, put a sock in it, OK?

251
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:29,761
Boys don't do that stuff.

252
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:31,994
Jinta swings, it's a home run.

253
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:32,494
Yay!

254
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:51,184
-Excuse me, Mr. Urahara,
Mr. Tessai, there's a cat.

255
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:52,718
-Is that right?

256
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:53,884
Well, let's see who it is.

257
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:56,151
Yes, it's Yoruichi!

258
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:58,584
You've come back.

259
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,818
Come here you little devil.

260
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:02,284
Let me take a look at you.

261
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:04,351
-Not just any cat.

262
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:05,551
It's Yoruichi.

263
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:08,251
That feline happens to
be the boss' best friend.

264
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:11,518
Whoa, it kind of leaves you
feeling sorry for the guy,

265
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:13,584
having a cat for a best
friend is pretty pathetic.

266
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:15,918
KISUKE (OFFSCREEN): You're
my fuzzy little troublemaker,

267
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:16,718
yes you are.

268
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,018
Now, who's your Daddy, hmm?

269
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:32,451
-Oh, this is the most
miserable lunch ever.

270
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:34,784
What am I'm doing with
these lameoids anyway?

271
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:38,584
It's like eating in a
graveyard or something.

272
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:40,484
-What's wrong?

273
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:42,384
-Oh, it's just you, Chad.

274
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:44,518
-You seem a little
on edge, Keigo.

275
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:45,318
-I am not.

276
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:46,518
Shut up.

277
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:47,018
-Hmm?

278
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:55,251
Hey there, Keigo, if
you're all done eating,

279
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:56,918
why don't you tell us a story?

280
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:57,718
-Aah!

281
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:59,184
No way, I'm not in the mood.

282
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:00,351
-Then get in the mood.

283
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:00,851
Pronto.

284
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:01,818
-No fair.

285
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:03,184
If you wanted happy
times, then you

286
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:05,784
shouldn't have invited that wet
blanket, Uryu, to eat with us.

287
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,018
But I'll do my best.

288
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:09,218
So there I was,
dudes, out on the town

289
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:10,818
on a Saturday night
trolling for Sushi.

290
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:11,951
The first place I went--

291
00:13:11,984 --> 00:13:15,218
-Hey, Ichigo, why did
you invite me to lunch?

292
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:17,918
It's because you're feeling
responsible for my injuries.

293
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,718
You're wrong, and you're
wasting your time.

294
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:22,718
I don't need anyone's
pity, and I certainly

295
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:23,951
don't want your friendship.

296
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:25,651
-Eat your lunch and shut up.

297
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:27,384
I just felt like it.

298
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:28,484
That's all.

299
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:30,151
It certainly had nothing
to do with sympathy

300
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,918
or because I like you.

301
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:34,384
Consider yourself lucky
to not be eating alone.

302
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:36,384
-Oh, I'm supposed
to be grateful here?

303
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:37,984
You have a lot of
nerve, especially

304
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,718
since I prefer eating alone.

305
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,151
-I prefer eating alone,
too, so why don't you

306
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:43,484
just look the other way?

307
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:44,784
-Why don't you look away?

308
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:47,484
This whole thing was your
idea in the first place.

309
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:49,084
-Man, these two are a lot alike.

310
00:13:49,118 --> 00:13:52,618
-I had a date with Destiny,
and Destiny had just

311
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:53,451
ordered the lobster.

312
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:56,584
Get it?

313
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:57,584
-Ta-da.

314
00:13:57,618 --> 00:13:59,684
It's a choco-sugar
jelly death tart.

315
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:02,518
It's eggplant cream sponge cake
with green bean jelly filling

316
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,418
and chocolate frosting.

317
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:06,951
-Ooh, how can you eat
stuff like that Orihime?

318
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:09,918
-The question is how
can she eat like that

319
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:11,251
and not be as big as a blimp?

320
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:14,451
-I guess her boobs
absorb the calories.

321
00:14:14,484 --> 00:14:16,318
-Hey, can I ask you something?

322
00:14:16,351 --> 00:14:19,751
Do you have a crush on Ichigo?

323
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:20,818
-Huh?

324
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:23,018
-I'll take that as a
maybe, but what exactly

325
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:24,718
is your relationship
with that guy?

326
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:26,851
-Well, he is my friend.

327
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:28,518
-Mahana, that's not
the kind of question

328
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:29,818
you ask straight out like that.

329
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:31,118
-I don't see why not.

330
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:33,251
It's the question you
wanted to ask her yourself,

331
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:34,818
but none of you were
willing to do it.

332
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:37,218
So I just did it for you.

333
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,184
-Hey, just who said I wanted to
know anything like that anyway?

334
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:41,818
-Well, I still want
to know the answer.

335
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:44,051
-What do you have against
Ichigo anyway, Michiru?

336
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,851
-It's not that I have
anything against him.

337
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:49,018
I just think there's something
kind of scary looking

338
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:50,584
about his face, that's all.

339
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:51,984
-Scary looking?

340
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:53,284
Well, I don't think so.

341
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:54,051
I like his face.

342
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:55,084
MICHIRU (OFFSCREEN): Really?

343
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:56,684
You must have changed
your mind then,

344
00:14:56,718 --> 00:14:58,918
because I know you used
to be afraid of him, too.

345
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:01,684
-Well, what's the story, Rukia?

346
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:11,984
-Ichigo and I are, uh--
Ichigo and I are just friends.

347
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:13,351
That's that's all
there is to it.

348
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:14,384
-For real?

349
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:15,584
-Yes.

350
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:17,818
-You mean you don't feel
anything special for him?

351
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:18,784
Not at all?

352
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,251
-No, there's nothing
else going on.

353
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,818
-That's too bad for us girls.

354
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:25,651
If Rukia liked Ichigo like
me, that would make two of us,

355
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:27,118
and we'd have so
much to talk about.

356
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:29,318
And if Tatsuki decided
she liked Ichigo, then

357
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:31,718
pretty soon we would
all start liking him.

358
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:34,018
And we could sit around and
talk about all the reasons

359
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:36,651
we like him, and it would be a
sure win for the girls' team.

360
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:38,218
-Someone stop her
before her nonsense

361
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:39,718
starts to make sense to me.

362
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:41,818
-Say, it's actually
not a bad idea

363
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:43,718
to have an affection
competition.

364
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:47,384
But I have to make sure I get
first dibs on the beautiful

365
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:48,351
smile of Orihime's.

366
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:50,618
So let's go with a one-on-one.

367
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:52,551
Just you and me.

368
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,918
Give it to me Orihime.

369
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:59,118
Not exactly what I had in mind.

370
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:02,418
-Just give it a rest, Chizuru.

371
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:04,951
-Anyway, Rukia, tomorrow
I'll be sure to bring you

372
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:06,584
some of my other
yummy desserts, so you

373
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:08,051
can try them out yourself.

374
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:10,884
Then we can enjoy them together.

375
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:12,151
-OK, I'll think about it.

376
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:15,118
-Aw, that's the same thing
you said to me last time.

377
00:16:15,151 --> 00:16:16,784
You keep saying that, Rukia.

378
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:18,584
I'll think about it.

379
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:19,151
-Oh, really?

380
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:20,484
I guess I do.

381
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,784
This is nice.

382
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:30,584
I know I don't belong here.

383
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:38,551
-What did I ever do to
earn such shabby treatment?

384
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:40,051
But none of this
would have happened

385
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:41,784
if it hadn't been for Ichigo.

386
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:44,384
You just wait, Ichigo,
because now I'll

387
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:46,884
use the deadly weapons that
weird hat and claws guy

388
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:49,618
has collected in his store
to get my revenge on you.

389
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:51,551
Heh, heh, heh.

390
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:52,218
Huh?

391
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:53,651
Ah, what's with you?

392
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:54,951
Trying to sneak up on me, huh?

393
00:16:54,984 --> 00:16:56,384
I'll make mincemeat outta ya.

394
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:58,784
Don't think you got a chance
just because we're both cats.

395
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,751
I'm a lion.

396
00:17:00,784 --> 00:17:02,884
Ha, scared you off already, huh?

397
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:03,651
What a pussy.

398
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:05,251
That was too easy.

399
00:17:05,284 --> 00:17:06,751
Now to steal me some weapons.

400
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:08,084
-Check it out.

401
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:10,484
Who knew Mod-Souls could be
put into stuffed animals?

402
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:11,484
-Huh?

403
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:12,784
-Hi, little fella.

404
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:13,818
-Little fella?

405
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:16,284
-Yoruichi here told
us all about you.

406
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:18,418
KON (OFFSCREEN): You mean
that stupid cat can talk?

407
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:19,518
JINTA (OFFSCREEN):
You know, coming in

408
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:21,018
through people's windows
is a serious crime.

409
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:22,651
Ururu, grab him!

410
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:24,151
KON (OFFSCREEN):
Wait, go of my leg.

411
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:25,051
Wait, stop that!

412
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:26,318
-One, two, three.

413
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:26,818
-Yow!

414
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:53,184
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Ichigo.

415
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:55,151
-Hmm?

416
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:57,118
What's up?

417
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:59,384
The Hollow?

418
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:01,151
-No, it's not that.

419
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:01,651
-Then?

420
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:12,418
-Ichigo, are you feeling OK?

421
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:13,684
-Hmm?

422
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:17,351
Yeah, now I feel great,
but why are you asking?

423
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:18,951
-No reason.

424
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:20,451
I'm just glad you're OK.

425
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:23,251
-Is there going to be
another one like yesterday?

426
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:28,184
If Menos Grande showed up
everyday, we'd be in trouble.

427
00:18:28,218 --> 00:18:35,651
-Rukia, you know you're
acting a bit strange today.

428
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:36,651
Did something happen?

429
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:49,151
-Uh, uh, it's just.

430
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:50,118
-Aah!

431
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:51,051
Aah!

432
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:53,884
-Huh?

433
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:54,751
Huh?

434
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,451
-Ichigo, forgive me.

435
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:57,984
I shouldn't have run away.

436
00:18:58,018 --> 00:18:59,851
I realize now that
my place is with you.

437
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:01,651
I'll promise I'll
never, ever do it again.

438
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:03,351
Oh, Ichigo, what was I thinking.

439
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:04,651
-Kon, I'm over here.

440
00:19:04,684 --> 00:19:07,384
And why did you run away
you worthless piece of fuzz.

441
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:09,518
-I won't make the same
mistake again, Ichigo.

442
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:11,718
The world was not kind to
this brave little wanderer.

443
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,084
Take me, take me
back to your room.

444
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:16,184
That's where I belong, and
that's where I'll stay.

445
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:18,918
-You want to go back, huh?

446
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,451
-Hey, what's wrong?

447
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:21,951
-Nothing, I'm fine.

448
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:24,418
It's obvious he's become
quite attached to you.

449
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:26,751
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): He's
become quite a pain in the butt

450
00:19:26,784 --> 00:19:29,584
if you ask me.

451
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:31,184
What happened to
you anyway, Kon?

452
00:19:31,218 --> 00:19:32,918
Your stuffing's coming out.

453
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:34,251
-I'm surprised he's still alive.

454
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:39,018
-Yeah, me, to, but I know
just the guy to fix him.

455
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:40,418
-What brings you here?

456
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:43,951
I need a favor and needle craft
is your specialty, isn't it?

457
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:44,818
-Can't help you.

458
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:45,751
-Why not?

459
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,318
-I don't have to
give you a reason.

460
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:48,284
-Good one.

461
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:49,951
Oh, I get the picture.

462
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:51,918
You won't do it,
because you can't do it.

463
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:54,451
With those hands all
bandaged up Mr. Handicrafts,

464
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,951
you're completely useless.

465
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:57,018
-How insulting.

466
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:59,784
These wounds are nothing.

467
00:19:59,818 --> 00:20:00,918
Give me that.

468
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,684
Now step back and watch
the work of a master.

469
00:20:03,718 --> 00:20:05,651
-Oh, what's happening to me?

470
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:06,784
I don't know if I like this.

471
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:08,984
-This is a piece of cake.

472
00:20:09,018 --> 00:20:10,051
It's finished.

473
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,151
-Nice job.

474
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:13,751
-You think?

475
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:15,918
-Is that thing really Kon?

476
00:20:15,951 --> 00:20:17,251
-Well, it used to be.

477
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,718
-What the hell do
we call him now?

478
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,451
-A nightmare.

479
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,551
-What have you done to me?

480
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:24,051
-I've replaced your stuffing
with a fire proof polycarbonate

481
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:25,484
blend and refurbished
your outer coat

482
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:26,951
with the broad
weave crushed velvet

483
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:29,184
brocade in the style
of Marie Antoinette.

484
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:32,751
-I'll never be able
to show my face again.

485
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:34,084
Huh?

486
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:36,218
I'm running away
again after all.

487
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:49,651
What you doing, Yoruichi?

488
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:51,951
Ah, checking the sky for rain?

489
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,751
-You can quit with
the act now, Urahara.

490
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:58,818
We both know what's
really coming.

491
00:20:58,851 --> 00:21:01,618
The two of them
are already here.

492
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:04,218
-Do you want to talk
about this before or after

493
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:07,084
you have your milk?

494
00:21:07,118 --> 00:21:11,084
-Hey, Rukia, I've
got your dinner here.

495
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:13,051
Huh?

496
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:14,418
Damnit.

497
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:16,951
Why does she always have to
disappear right at dinnertime?

498
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,418
-Thank you for everything.

499
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,084
-Rear conformity 113.

500
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:32,451
Neuro union
coefficient at 80.5%.

501
00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:33,884
Is this for real?

502
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,618
I didn't think we'd actually
finally her in a Gigai.

503
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:38,984
But it looks like the data
from the visuals department

504
00:21:39,018 --> 00:21:39,484
was reliable.

505
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:43,451
Rukia Kuchiki.

506
00:21:43,484 --> 00:21:46,251
Yes, we finally found you.

507
00:21:46,284 --> 00:21:46,751
Heh.

508
00:21:52,469 --> 00:22:02,502
[theme music]

509
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:53,736
[theme music]

510
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:56,436
Hi, I'm Uryu Ishida, home handy
crafts club president

511
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:59,269
and this episode did not
showcase my talents very well.

512
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:02,002
If the producers had just given
me more time like I asked for,

513
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:04,336
I could have come up with a much
cooler. . .aarrgh

514
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:06,736
Yaaahhhhhhh
