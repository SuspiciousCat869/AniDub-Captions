1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,333
The Zanpakuto. Its unique
shape and abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:20,500
The Soul Reaper is able to
harness the power of the
Zanpakuto by learning its
name and forming

3
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:21,933
a synergistic unit.

4
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:28,333
The Zanpakuto is born with
its Soul Reaper and dies
with its Soul Reaper.

5
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:31,066
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:20,302 --> 00:02:26,068
What's wrong with you?!
There's no way my
Zanpakuto would be in a
battle and be this weak!

7
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:31,035
Hah! Don't be so quick
to judge! This battle
has only just begun!

8
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:35,168
Not even close!

9
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:43,135
You stop right there!

10
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:47,935
We've got you
surrounded...

11
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,135
Yeah, sorry, but we're
gonna need to butt in.

12
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,368
Don't think you'll get
away from me!

13
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:20,468
<i>Bankai!!</i>

14
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,202
Was that...

15
00:03:36,335 --> 00:03:38,968
Byakuya?!

16
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:55,568
Captain Unohana. Many
new patients have been
arriving. We'll need
more help.

17
00:03:55,968 --> 00:04:01,035
I know we're short
staffed. We'll make do. Isane,
go do what you can to help them.

18
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:02,035
Yes.

19
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:09,168
Just one thing...

20
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:11,135
Yes, what is it?

21
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,968
Never mind.

22
00:04:16,368 --> 00:04:20,135
Excuse me. I'd better
go now.

23
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:32,002
We missed our chance to
capture two Zanpakuto at
once.

24
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:34,035
That is unfortunate.

25
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:37,568
Gotta give the Zanpakuto
credit. They're very
tricky beings.

26
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:43,068
An interesting pattern is
emerging in all the field
reports we've received so
far. No one has engaged

27
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:46,435
in battle against a
Zanpakuto belonging to a
Captain.

28
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:50,068
What uplifting
info. Thanks a bunch.

29
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:53,502
Yeah. Well, I'm sorry
but you know we have to
prepare ourselves.

30
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:58,068
You're right, but don't
sweat it yet. You're
worried about battles
that haven't even

31
00:04:58,102 --> 00:05:01,068
happened. We're all
gonna do our best to end
this.

32
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:04,902
Of course. But there is
one more thing...

33
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:07,935
Does it concern Squad
Six?

34
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:09,068
<i>Yes.</i>

35
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:12,102
At the moment, Lieutenant
Abarai is doing his
best...

36
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:16,302
But with their Captain
missing, the members of
Squad Six are extremely
anxious, and not

37
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:18,502
performing to their full
potential.

38
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:22,402
Well, great. This has to
be the worst time for him
to turn up missing.

39
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:28,435
I wonder... What
could've happened to
Byakuya.

40
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:33,568
He's never been easy to
read.

41
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,902
<i>Thanks for waiting!</i>

42
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:38,402
How is everything on your
end?

43
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:42,035
Everything is fine. I
just ordered the squad
members to get some rest.

44
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:44,268
Then I guess it's our
turn for a break.

45
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,502
Come on. Let's hurry.

46
00:05:45,535 --> 00:05:46,402
Right.

47
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:52,168
Where is he going?

48
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:08,835
Was that actually Byakuya?
Damn! I have to figure out
what's going on!

49
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:31,102
So far he's nowhere to be
found--I can't imagine
where he went.

50
00:07:31,135 --> 00:07:34,068
Well, you were so pushy,
he probably ran off to
hide.

51
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:38,402
You don't know what
you're talking about.
He's just very shy.

52
00:07:38,435 --> 00:07:40,468
I don't believe that for
a second.

53
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:45,368
Over there!

54
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:55,035
Hold on! What gives?
All right, wait up!

55
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,168
I was sure I saw him
standing there.

56
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:23,902
Yeah right. So he just
disappeared? You're
letting your eyes play
tricks on you.

57
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:28,002
Ah, man. Where are
you? Where could my
little darling have gone?

58
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:33,835
I'll bet I can find him
much faster than you can
That might shut you up.

59
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:39,168
Before you go looking, you
better get your eyes checked.
Or you'll be finding imaginary
people again.

60
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:41,968
My eyesight is just fine.

61
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:47,535
And at least I'm not the one
calling him "my little darling".
I think you might need to get
your brain checked.

62
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,535
Oh, really!

63
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:55,302
Well now, are you aware that
most of the goody goody types,
like yourself, also have boring
personalities?

64
00:08:56,868 --> 00:09:04,002
And for your information,
pushy, overbearing types like
you are usually petty and have
no personality at all.

65
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:05,168
Your breasts are flat!

66
00:09:05,202 --> 00:09:07,102
Well, you're fat!

67
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:12,468
Not even! You wouldn't know
a decent body if you saw one
and don't bother looking in
your mirror!

68
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:16,268
And you wouldn't know
anything about my breasts
because you've never even
seen them!

69
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:22,235
You scared me.

70
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:23,968
How long have you been
there?

71
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:28,068
Where is Muramasa?

72
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:31,202
Uh, Muramasa,
I haven't see him.

73
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:33,935
Why are you looking for
him? What's going on?

74
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:44,502
So what's his problem?

75
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:48,468
Don't ask me, I've never
been able to figure out
what that guy's deal is.

76
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:49,368
Mm?

77
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:53,835
Guess you haven't seen
your breasts, either!

78
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:56,535
That hurt!

79
00:09:57,235 --> 00:09:59,968
I am just petite!

80
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:01,568
Hey, come back!

81
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:06,868
Who's coming?

82
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:07,568
Huh?!

83
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:14,868
Hey, isn't that Ichigo
Kurosaki?

84
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:21,068
I remember that
name. Muramasa was very
interested in him for
some reason.

85
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:22,902
What's that?

86
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:25,102
Let's play a game with
him just for fun.

87
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:26,535
Hey!

88
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:30,402
What the hell?

89
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:40,802
Good evening, my friend.

90
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:44,002
Cheater! You were
trying to get a head
start.

91
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:45,602
Who the hell are you
two?!

92
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:48,068
You must be Ichigo
Kurosaki, right?

93
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:49,868
Yeah, so what do you
want?

94
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,535
Are both of you
Zanpakuto?!

95
00:10:58,602 --> 00:11:01,535
Men like this are my
specialty. I'll take care
of him.

96
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:07,102
What do you mean? You
don't have a specialty!
I'm beginning to despise
you. You always do that!

97
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,735
What are you crying
about?

98
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:13,402
Whenever you see a man,
you immediately try to
claim him. You're so
indecent!

99
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:16,935
You're right.
So what?

100
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:20,002
Growl!

101
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:28,802
Like that? Want to know
what will happen if it
touches you?

102
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:35,835
Getsuga tensho!

103
00:11:40,602 --> 00:11:44,135
Hey... I really do like
his little thingy.

104
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:47,568
I hate when you talk like
that. It's just so vulgar.

105
00:11:47,602 --> 00:11:51,902
No, Miss Petite, what you
hate is that you are
lacking in the looks
department.

106
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,968
Who's lacking,
big-mouth?!

107
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:59,468
You. Yeah. Why don't
you admit you're jealous
of my beautiful body?

108
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:03,368
Oh really?! How can I
be jealous of something
stuck to an empty head?!

109
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:05,568
Then what is it? What's
your gripe?

110
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:08,868
My gripe?! I've got a
list, starting with you
don't play fair!

111
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:12,868
<i>Relax already! How about</i>
<i>this, the first one that</i>
<i>can make him squeal wins?</i>

112
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:14,868
I don't like how you put
it, but fine!

113
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,568
It's about who's the
strongest!

114
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:21,302
Is this for real?! I
don't have time to listen
to you two argue!

115
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:22,968
Come back, you coward!

116
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:24,902
We're not through with
you!

117
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:29,268
You should be ashamed of
yourself for just running
away from a beautiful
woman like that, you loser!

118
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:31,368
Growl!

119
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:38,402
Keep on running, you
fool! It makes this
even more fun!

120
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:43,235
Dammit.

121
00:12:53,602 --> 00:12:55,435
You leave me no choice.

122
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:57,835
<i>That's enough!</i>

123
00:12:57,868 --> 00:12:59,535
Stop this at once!

124
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:03,135
<i>Rangiku!</i>

125
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,302
Ichigo, do you mind
if we trade places?

126
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:10,002
Huh?!

127
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:13,068
<i>These two need to be</i>
<i>personally dealt with by</i>
<i>us.</i>

128
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:14,535
Hope you understand.

129
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:19,202
All right.

130
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:44,623
Just as I thought,
Gillians.

131
00:14:12,356 --> 00:14:17,089
This really sucks. You
made me lose my boy toy!

132
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,789
Huh?!

133
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:20,756
You're so lame, really.

134
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:23,656
What are you trying to
say?

135
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:27,656
Wow, this is really
boring! You're still
just an annoying old lady.

136
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:33,589
Huh! You've become a catty,
blathering monster. I can't
believe I never saw this in you.

137
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,723
What do you mean, lady?

138
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:38,223
You sure seem to be
enjoying your new found
freedom.

139
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:41,389
Yeah, I am. I
am finally free.

140
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,623
And it's totally amazing!

141
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:48,756
When I'm with an old
woman like you, I begin to
feel old myself and that's
certainly no way to live.

142
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,289
Is that really you...

143
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:54,656
...Tobiume?

144
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,089
I really missed you.

145
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:00,356
Not me. I was glad to get
away from you.

146
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:07,123
What?! When we were
united, you were
always there for me when
I needed you the most.

147
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,089
We always trusted
each other, didn't we?

148
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:20,656
Tobiume... I'm taking you
back with me..

149
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:22,589
I refuse.

150
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,723
Why won't you?

151
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:29,123
I'm stronger on my own--I
cannot stay with someone
as weak as you are.

152
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:45,323
If you don't want to come
back voluntarily, I hope
you're prepared to be
defeated.

153
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:49,323
There's no way you can
beat me, old lady! You see,
I'm young and beautiful!

154
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:50,756
And you're all
washed up!

155
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,123
Well, aren't you
going to attack?

156
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:08,756
You believe I'll come back
to you by just standing there
staring at me with that pathetic
look on your face.

157
00:16:13,423 --> 00:16:18,389
How can you always think
that everything is going
to work itself out without
you doing anything about it?

158
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:25,089
You can't harm a fly.
People walk all over you
and you don't even say
a single thing.

159
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:31,756
You'll be waiting forever
if you believe that guy will
come back and beg for your
forgiveness.

160
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:34,723
He doesn't want to be
around you either, 'cause
you're weak.

161
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:09,289
Ha! Give up now or
you're going to be bald!

162
00:17:09,556 --> 00:17:14,689
Well, please make note of
my perfectly shaped head
I'm going to look fabulous
even without my hair.

163
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:19,756
I think you should just
give up and run away.
Or does the size of your
ass prevent that?

164
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:24,656
It's hard to believe
what comes out of your
mouth. It should be
wired shut.

165
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,256
You won't be able to run
away much longer!

166
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:40,623
Bakudo Number
Thirty-Seven!

167
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:42,723
Tsuriboshi!

168
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:46,523
Huh?!

169
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:53,189
Rangiku!

170
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:54,589
Watch where you're
going!

171
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:56,123
Stay out of my way!

172
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:59,389
Why don't you get out of
my face! Don't you have
somewhere else you could be?

173
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:01,156
You bumped into me
if you recall!

174
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:03,556
If you weren't so flabby,
you could've jumped away!

175
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:05,723
Something's wrong with
those two.

176
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:08,556
Yeah, they don't
seem to get along.

177
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:10,356
You got a problem?!

178
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,389
Do we really have to take
them back?

179
00:18:17,223 --> 00:18:21,289
Where are you, Byakuya?
Why have you hidden your
Spiritual Pressure?

180
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:31,589
That's odd. Feels like some
sort of presence. Where is
it? I can't even tell how
close it is.

181
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:33,289
What is it?

182
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:49,589
Something's not right here.
I know... this presence...

183
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:15,256
There you are!

184
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,723
Identify yourself!

185
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:22,623
Are you Ichigo Kurosaki?

186
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:26,089
That's right, I am. But
how do you know that?

187
00:19:27,089 --> 00:19:30,256
You seem to be reasonably
skilled.

188
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:31,489
Yeah, what of it?

189
00:19:31,689 --> 00:19:36,656
Muramasa warned me to
keep far away from you.

190
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:40,223
That's interesting. Why
would he do that?

191
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:45,356
That's what I'm determined
to find out, but there's
only one way to do that!

192
00:19:57,323 --> 00:19:58,523
<i>Bankai!</i>

193
00:19:58,556 --> 00:19:59,323
Hm?!

194
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:07,623
Did you say...
Bankai?

195
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:11,156
That's right. Now,
who are you?

196
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:14,489
Tell me, is your sword a
Zanpakuto?

197
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:15,789
Yes, it is.

198
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:21,456
So, a Zanpakuto. And
what is its name?

199
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:24,223
Huh?! Why do you want
to know that?

200
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:28,489
What's with all the
questions?

201
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:31,656
Apparently you're not my
master after all.

202
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,556
Thought that was obvious.

203
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:38,789
If you're not my master I
have no business with you.
Goodbye.

204
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:41,123
Wait!

205
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:49,756
You mean you're here searching
for your master, but you don't
have a clue as to whose
Zanpakuto you are?

206
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:59,156
No, I do not know who my
master is... And I do
not know my name.

207
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:02,423
You're kidding!

208
00:21:02,623 --> 00:21:04,423
Sennenhyoro.

209
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:05,423
What?!

210
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:09,523
I bid you Farewell.

211
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:20,156
Hyorinmaru! It's
Hyorinmaru!

212
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:27,289
<i>Toshiro!</i>

213
00:21:36,456 --> 00:21:40,423
Your name is Hiyorinmaru.
I am your master.

214
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:44,256
You are my Zanpakuto.

215
00:23:47,157 --> 00:23:50,657
Hyorinmaru, are you
telling me you've lost
your memory?

216
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,290
<i>That's right. I can't</i>
<i>remember anything.</i>

217
00:23:53,324 --> 00:23:56,957
<i>Well, welcome to the</i>
<i>club. I can't remember</i>
<i>anything either.</i>

218
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,557
<i>I don't know who I am...</i>

219
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,090
<i>I remember the first</i>
<i>three bars...</i>

220
00:24:00,124 --> 00:24:01,924
There's your
problem. Too much booze!
