00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:42,907
-The Head Captain has issued
a level one security order.

3
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:46,074
What good will it do for us if
the Punishment Force can't even

4
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,207
apprehend a single Ryoka?

00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:52,441
[laughter]

6
00:01:52,474 --> 00:01:54,374
-Well, Ritz.

7
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:55,341
Now let it fly.

8
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:00,307
MAN: Captain!

9
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:01,007
MAN: What's he done?

10
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,074
-Who did that?

11
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:03,541
-Has he lost his mind?

12
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:06,007
[groaning]

13
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:07,007
-Hold him down!

14
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:07,974
-Bastard!

15
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:08,474
-Grab him!

16
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:17,207
-What is this?

17
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,274
What was that you threw?

18
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,274
[shouting]

19
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:23,107
-What's he doing?

20
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:27,174
MAN: He's lost his mind.

21
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:31,474
-It was poisoned.

22
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:35,041
The Bounts must be behind this.

23
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:37,507
-What's wrong with you?

24
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,507
-MAN: He's dead.

25
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,474
MAN: How did that happen?

26
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:44,474
MAN: Captain, you
need to recover.

27
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:45,841
-Calm down.

28
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,841
One of the Bounts has the power
to control a person's mind.

29
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:51,174
I doubt this guy had any
idea what he was doing.

30
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:52,574
-How could the Bounts do that?

31
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:55,574
-It's possible that when he came
into contact with the Bount,

32
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:59,307
the Bount was able to
penetrate his mind.

33
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:02,174
(THINKING) If that's the
case, there may be others.

34
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:04,674
Did anybody else come in
contact with the Bount?

35
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:07,307
-There were a number of us
on patrol in the Higeshinejo

36
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:08,207
district when--

37
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:10,441
[groaning]

38
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:11,807
-Careful!

39
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:14,874
-What are you doing?

40
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:17,341
-Get him!

41
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:18,307
-Protect the captain!

42
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,574
-Captain, let us handle him.

43
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:28,441
-You shouldn't be fighting
wounded like this.

44
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,474
-(THINKING) How many of
them have been possessed?

45
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:34,874
-This doesn't make any sense.

46
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:37,774
One minute I can sense the
Bounts' spiritual pressure,

47
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:39,241
and then it
completely disappears.

48
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:40,441
-Yeah.

49
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:41,774
We've got to figure out
what it is they're up to.

50
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:43,341
-Do you have any ideas?

51
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:46,174
-All I know is when I get a hold
of those Bounts, I'm gonna--

52
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:48,307
-Whoa!

53
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:48,807
Ah!

54
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:50,674
[groan]

55
00:03:57,074 --> 00:03:58,441
-Man, what the
hell are you doin'?

56
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:02,874
-Ichigo.

57
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:04,874
These guys look
like Soul Reapers,

58
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,341
but they smell like Bounts.

59
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:07,807
RITZ: Ichigo Kurosaki.

60
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:10,641
It's time for you to die!

61
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:11,807
-You mean they're all Dolls?

62
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:28,841
That Bount Mabashi has a
Doll that controls minds.

63
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:30,841
These poor guys didn't
know what hit 'em.

64
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:38,641
-What's wrong with you guys?

65
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:39,274
Back off!

66
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:48,607
-They're acting
exactly like Rukia

67
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:51,707
did when she was being
controlled by that Bount.

68
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:53,341
-Damit.

69
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:56,274
[groaning]

70
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:08,774

71
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,207
[laughter]

72
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:12,707
-Excellent, Ritz.

73
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:16,941
Keep up the good work, until
every one of them is dead.

74
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:18,407
Ah!

75
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,441
This strong spiritual pressure.

76
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:22,341
Interesting.

77
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:23,607
-Are you sure?

78
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:25,007
-Yes, sir.

79
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,307
Some Soul Reapers have fallen
into the hands of the Bounts,

80
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:29,607
and they've begun
attacking their own men.

81
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:31,074
-How is that possible?

82
00:05:31,107 --> 00:05:33,274
-One of the Bounts has a
Doll that can enter the body

83
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:35,107
and control the mind.

84
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:37,874
I know it for a fact because
I encountered this Bount

85
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:39,074
in the world of the living.

86
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:40,341
-Hm.

87
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,774
Is there a way to
regain control?

88
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:45,874
-The Doll enters the body,
so it's difficult to get to.

89
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:46,707
While they're alive.

90
00:05:54,474 --> 00:05:56,841
-(THINKING) If I can defeat
the one controlling the Dolls,

91
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:59,807
it should bring the men who are
being possessed back to normal.

92
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:04,207
I've got to find that Bount.

93
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:05,041
Is someone here?

94
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:13,807
You're a Bount.

95
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,007
[laughter]

96
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,307
-I sensed a strong
spiritual pressure,

97
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,941
so I thought I'd take a look.

98
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:22,341
-Ha.

99
00:06:22,374 --> 00:06:26,474
I've found the
captain, haven't I?

100
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:28,574
You look a little
worse for wear.

101
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,441
You haven't been poisoned
by a Bitto, have you?

102
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:34,441
-So this is your doing.

103
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:39,107
-If I just let a living soul
sit after harvesting it,

104
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:41,307
it becomes rancid.

105
00:06:41,341 --> 00:06:42,974
-What?

106
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,241
-Don't worry.

107
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:47,907
You won't suffer long.

108
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:48,941
Oh, please.

109
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:50,774
Don't give me that look.

110
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:55,441
The poison is fatal,
and there's no antidote.

111
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:57,907
[grunting]

112
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:05,907
-Ha!

113
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:36,807
-Heh, heh.

114
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:38,307
I figured you'd put up a fight.

115
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:40,307
That's too bad.

116
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,307
You should try not
to move so much.

117
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:44,307
It makes the poison
spread faster.

118
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:48,774
-(THINKING) If I drag this
out, I won't stand a chance.

119
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:54,874
In that case-- Sting
all enemies to death.

120
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:57,974
Suzumebachi.

121
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,241
Not so fast!

122
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:14,241
-Damn you.

123
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:22,107
Ah!

124
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:23,307
Ha.

125
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:25,807
So this is the homonka
I've heard so much about.

126
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:27,574
It's very impressive.

127
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,574
I'm supposed to die if you hit
me in the same place twice,

128
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:31,874
right?

129
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:33,274
Ha ha ha.

130
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:35,874
If you want to finish me off,
then you'd better do it soon.

131
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:37,841
You don't have very
much time left.

132
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:44,207
So I'll just keep my
distance and relax

133
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,874
while I watch you die.

134
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:46,541
-You psychopath.

135
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:53,107
-Just die already,
and get it over with.

136
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:53,607
-Wait!

137
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:07,074
-Shuhei.

138
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:08,341
-Huh?

139
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:10,074
-It's just like you said.

140
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:12,541
This Doll, or whatever it
is that's controlling them,

141
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:14,807
has completely fused
with their bodies.

142
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:15,874
-Yes.

143
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:17,107
Which means they'll
probably be the same

144
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:19,107
when they regain consciousness.

145
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,141
-We'll move them to the Squad
4 barracks for observation.

146
00:09:22,174 --> 00:09:23,607
-Uh, what?

147
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:26,074
-Then Captain Unohana
can examine them.

148
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,641
She'll know best.

149
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:30,274
If anyone can help these men
in their present condition,

150
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:31,307
it's her.

151
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:35,074
I just hope it's not too late.

152
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,541
-Let's get them over to the
treatment room on the double.

153
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:38,107
MEN: Yes, sir!

154
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:48,748
UNOHANA: So, Squad
7 Captain Komamura

155
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:51,282
instructed you to bring
all these men here?

156
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:52,348
-Yes, ma'am.

157
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:53,948
We were forced to
knock them unconscious.

158
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:55,982
We don't know how many
others have been infected,

159
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:57,382
but we're hoping
you can discover

160
00:09:57,415 --> 00:09:58,648
how to make them normal again.

161
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:03,148
-This is amazing.

162
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:04,915
-Have you discovered something?

163
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:06,615
-Something inside
him is not only

164
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,982
controlling his mind, but his
entire nervous system as well.

165
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:11,615
It's impossible to
remove the dolls

166
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:13,048
while the men are fighting.

167
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:14,782
-There must be
something we can do.

168
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,982
-Right now, all we can
do is suppress the Dolls.

169
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,948
Bring anyone who is being
controlled by a Doll here.

170
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:22,148
Now we must bind them
before they wake up.

171
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:25,015
-Right.

172
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,048
-The procedure isn't
foolproof, and I'm not

173
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:30,148
certain of the outcome,
but we've got to try.

174
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:31,515
Make the preparations.

175
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,148
-Yes, ma'am.

176
00:10:46,282 --> 00:10:48,882
-The pain.

177
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,148
It's unbearable.

178
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:53,715
It's so dark.

179
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:55,815
I can't see.

180
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:57,815
I have to do something.

181
00:10:57,848 --> 00:11:00,515
But what?

182
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:05,748
I never thought that I
could be this helpless.

183
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:08,282
What should I do?

184
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:09,282
Save me, Yoruichi.

185
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:24,048
Of course.

186
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:25,815
That's it!

187
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:26,582
[crunch]

188
00:11:26,615 --> 00:11:29,882
[screaming]

189
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:30,382
-Yah!

190
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:35,248
-Yah!

191
00:11:50,348 --> 00:11:52,082
-Captain, no!

192
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:53,248
-I'll handle this one.

193
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:56,382
You just worry about yourself.

194
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,215
All right.

195
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:59,582
This ends here!

196
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,748
-We're out of beds in here!

197
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:02,948
You two, move that patient
into the next room!

198
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:03,682
Let's go!

199
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:06,282
Hurry it up!

200
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:06,782
-Captain.

201
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:07,282
Is he--

202
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:14,282
-What's going on?

203
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:17,615
Some other Ritz's aren't
responding to orders.

204
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:19,282
They must have knocked them out.

205
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:20,948
The only way they
wouldn't respond

206
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:23,882
is if the host bodies had
been knocked unconscious.

207
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:26,582
It's all pointless, though.

208
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:28,848
They can knock out as
many men as they want,

209
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:33,182
because with my increased power,
I can create unlimited Ritz's.

210
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:44,782
You know what to do, Ritz.

211
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:45,482
RITZ: Understood.

212
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:51,248
-This is almost too easy.

213
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:58,515
Probably about time I check
in on that little Soul Reaper.

214
00:12:58,548 --> 00:13:00,615
Just in case she hasn't
discovered it yet,

215
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:02,748
I'm going to teach her the
true meaning of despair.

216
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:09,582
-That's what happens
when you get me mad!

217
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:16,348
-It's time to use Bakudo one!

218
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:17,782
Sai!

219
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:21,948
[shouting]

220
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:23,882
-Renji, that was magnificent!

221
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:26,848
Who would have guessed you
were able to fight using Kido?

222
00:13:26,882 --> 00:13:29,582
-Yeah, well, I couldn't
use Zabimuru right here,

223
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:32,448
so I thought that-- hm?

224
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:34,148
What do you mean, who
would have guessed?

225
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:35,648
You're making fun
of me, aren't you?

226
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,782
-What are you talking about?

227
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:40,815
-I'm talking about the fact
that my ability to use Kido

228
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:42,215
should be no surprise.

229
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:44,282
I am a lieutenant, you know?

230
00:13:44,315 --> 00:13:44,782
-Right.

231
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:52,148
-There you are.

232
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:56,648
Ha ha ha ha.

233
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:04,582
So, this is where you've
been keeping yourself.

234
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:06,482
Are you still breathing?

235
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:10,615
Clinging to that
last bit of life?

236
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:14,115
I had planned on staying hidden
away until you were dead.

237
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:14,982
But then--

238
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:17,182
-Why didn't you?

239
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:19,482
Why did you come back?

240
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:22,248
-I realized that the Soul
Reapers had discovered a way

241
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:26,082
to incapacitate my precious
little Ritz's one by one.

242
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,848
Then I thought,
maybe if I hit them

243
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:30,582
with someone really strong,
who they can't knock out.

244
00:14:30,615 --> 00:14:32,548
Right?

245
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:33,682
-You want me.

246
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:35,382
I'm your victim.

247
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:36,982
-It's nothing personal, you see.

248
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:40,015
It's just that I can't bear the
thought of Ritz being harmed.

249
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,748
Don't tell me
you're still trying

250
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:48,182
to figure out how to
get in that second hit?

251
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:50,815
You'd give anything to
kill me, wouldn't you?

252
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:55,415
Well, you can just forget it!

253
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:56,315
Ah, ha ha ha!

254
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:58,582
MAN: Hold it!

255
00:14:58,615 --> 00:14:59,848
MABASHI: The Punishment Force.

256
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:04,082
-Captain.

257
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:05,582
Are you all right?

258
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:08,548
MABASHI: So, there are
still a few of you left.

259
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:10,082
-You're gonna pay for this.

260
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,148
-Your captain is in
danger, so you valiantly

261
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:14,048
rush to her rescue.

262
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:15,548
I find that touching.

263
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,915
-Don't you worry, Captain.

264
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,882
We're going to get you
to the treatment room.

265
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:22,315
-He sounds so sincere.

266
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:25,148
But is he really a
friend, or an enemy?

267
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:27,415
-You bastard.

268
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:29,015
-Ritz, now!

269
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:31,982
[groaning]

270
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:35,382
-Yes!

271
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:42,848
-Oh, what a pity.

272
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:45,848
Your men were all set to
whisk you away to safety.

273
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:48,782
But now they belong to Ritz.

274
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,815
Hold her down.

275
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:51,748
-What's wrong with you?

276
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:53,115
Let me go.

277
00:15:53,148 --> 00:15:56,048
-Tell me, how does it feel
to have your own subordinates

278
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:57,415
controlling you?

279
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:59,282
-You're insane.

280
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:01,648
-Even though you're
unable to move a muscle,

281
00:16:01,682 --> 00:16:04,582
your tongue works just fine.

282
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:06,882
I'm going to possess you.

283
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:11,248
Then I'm going to have Ritz
send you to your grave.

284
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:12,882
-I'll kill you.

285
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:14,282
-I don't think so.

286
00:16:17,548 --> 00:16:18,748
Ritz, now!

287
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:19,248
-Yes!

288
00:16:28,582 --> 00:16:30,282
-It's somehow ironic, isn't it?

289
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,515
Now, farewell, my dear captain.

290
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:40,348
-I am going to take
good care of you!

291
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:49,415
[shouting]

292
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:56,315
-What the--

[groaning]

-Homonka's second strike.

-You little witch.

296
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:19,315
How'd you do it?

297
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:21,182
You should be
completely paralyzed.

298
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:24,648
-Just who the hell do you
think you're dealing with?

299
00:17:24,682 --> 00:17:26,582
My body has already
completely counter-acted

300
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:28,015
that poison of yours.

301
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:36,282
-How can that be?

302
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:38,415
-I've studied all the
disciplines of the Punishment

303
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:39,882
Force since I was a child.

304
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:41,348
Including poison.

305
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:44,015
And over the years, I've
developed a resistance

306
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:46,715
to nearly every poison there is.

307
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:48,682
For those poisons I've
never encountered,

308
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:52,082
there's only one way to
neutralize them successfully.

309
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:55,015
And that is to fight
poison with poison.

310
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:57,982
Using Suzumebachi.

311

-Why did you pretend as
if you were paralyzed?

312
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:04,948
-I had to draw you in close.

313
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:07,782
In order to return my
subordinates to normal,

314
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:11,082
I had to make myself the
bait to lure you back.

315
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:14,448
I was willing to risk
everything for them.

[groaning]

-This is where it ends.

give up that easily?

Ritz, now!

-You forget that
I still have Ritz.

322
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:40,082
I'll finish you off this time!

323
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:42,048
What's wrong?

324
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:44,915
You're so terrified, you
can't move, aren't you?

325
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:47,315
Aren't you?

326
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:49,182
-You're pitiful.

-Damn you!

00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:52,282
Kill her!

Destroy her, Ritz!

00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:53,748
RITZ: Yes!

331
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:56,282
Yes!

332
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:57,248
MABASHI: No!

333
00:18:57,282 --> 00:18:57,748
What?

334
00:18:57,782 --> 00:18:58,748
No, Ritz!

335
00:18:58,782 --> 00:18:59,548
Not me!

336
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:00,348
Get away from me!

337
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:01,915
What are you doing?

338
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:03,115
Dammit, Ritz!

339
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:04,415
I told you to get her!

340
00:19:04,448 --> 00:19:05,448
-Yes, I understand.

341
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:06,148
-No, Ritz!

342
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:07,615
Why are you doing this?

343
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,382
[scream]

344
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,648
-You've obviously
forgotten that your Doll

345
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,315
is a double edged sword.

346
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:15,615
I learned what happens
when you become

347
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:18,382
too weak The Doll
senses the weakness,

348
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:19,982
and then turns on the master.

349
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:21,415
[scream]

350
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:22,348
-Help me, please!

351
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:23,748
Ritz, no!

352
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:25,648
[scream]

353
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:27,382
-It's useless.

354
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:30,082
Suzumebachi's poison will
consume your entire body

355
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:31,548
within a matter of seconds.

356
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:33,582
[screaming]

357
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:53,615
-What the hell just happened?

358
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:55,015
-They just passed out.

359
00:19:57,748 --> 00:19:59,182
-The Doll's presence
has vanished.

360
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:00,348
It's completely disappeared.

361
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:08,915
-Hm.

362
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:14,415
-What the-- will someone tell
me what's going on around here?

363
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:18,315
-I guess the Bount controlling
them must've been defeated.

364
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:19,748
Everything's going
to be all right.

365
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:27,648
-Mabashi's spiritual
pressure has disappeared.

366
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:29,548
Can't say I'm surprised.

367
00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:32,415
I always knew he didn't
have what it takes.

368
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:33,915
So long, loser.

369
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:39,948
-Heh, heh.

370
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:43,848
Now it's Mabashi's spiritual
pressure that's disappeared.

371
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:47,148
It looks like the enemy is
putting up a good fight.

372
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:49,248
Why don't you quit playing
these hide and seek

373
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,082
games, and come out?

374
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:53,182
I much prefer
talking face to face.

375
00:20:56,148 --> 00:20:57,448
-Hm.

376
00:20:57,482 --> 00:21:00,582
So you knew I was
there, did you?

377
00:21:00,615 --> 00:21:03,948
I tried to copy you and
hide my spiritual presence.

378
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:07,048
[laughter]

379
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:09,448
-Even if you hid your
spiritual pressure,

380
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:12,348
there's no way to conceal
your lust for blood.

381
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:14,415
I can smell it in the air.

382
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:15,782
-My apologies.

383
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,815
But it has nothing
to do with you.

384
00:21:17,848 --> 00:21:19,848
I was looking for Ichinose.

385
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:22,548
You don't know
where he is, do you?

386
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:24,282
-It's hard to say.

387
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:25,548
Perhaps he's dead.

388
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:28,015
His spiritual pressure
disappeared quite a while ago,

389
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:31,148
so I assumed one of your
cohorts had done the deed.

390
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:32,182
-Aw.

391
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:34,615
I was hoping to have
that honor myself.

392
00:21:34,648 --> 00:21:36,615
But since I can't
have him, I suppose

393
00:21:36,648 --> 00:21:38,782
I'll just have to
make do with you.

394
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:39,948
You understand.

395
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:43,048
it's the price you have
to pay for humiliating me.

396
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:45,348
-If I must, I must.

397
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:48,415
But don't make the mistake
of underestimating me.

398
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:51,215
You might just be
in for a surprise,

399
00:21:51,248 --> 00:21:54,082
because I have been given
a very specific job.

400
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:56,548
To send all the
captains to their grave.

Konjiki Ashisogi Jizo, the

Two giant monsters clash

coming soon!

416
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:18,346
Kenny, aren't you going to
look for the Bounts, too?

417
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,980
-Not interested.

418
00:24:20,013 --> 00:24:22,713
Just because you run around
chasing after something doesn't

419
00:24:22,746 --> 00:24:24,846
mean you're ever
going to find it.

420
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,046
Besides, there's only one
person I want to slash,

421
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,146
and that is Ichigo!

422
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,280
-What the hell?

423
00:24:31,313 --> 00:24:33,213
Why'd it get so cold?
