00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,266
[growling]

2
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:12,600
I'm not fallin' for
one of your tricks again!

3
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,166
[grunting]

4
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:20,200
[grunting]

5
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:27,733
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Ulquiorra.

6
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:31,500
I believe this is
what you wanted to see.

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,433
...My Hollowfication!

8
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:24,687
Hey! Ulquiorra!

9
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,487
What's the deal with
this one? Can I kill
her yet?

10
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,087
[gasping]

11
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,054
[laughing]

12
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,487
Huh?

13
00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:46,787
[grunting]

14
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:52,087
Uryu!

15
00:02:52,387 --> 00:02:55,054
Don't let yourself
get distracted.

16
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:59,154
You just focus on your
own opponent, Ichigo. I'll
deal with him.

17
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,954
Don't you worry, I can
handle his friend on my
own.

18
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,020
Like I said, I can
handle this guy on
my own.

19
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,187
<i>Uryu!</i>

20
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,754
I'm glad you're all
right.

21
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:35,254
Wait a minute, how did
you get here?!

22
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:38,520
You sure you wanna have
a conversation in the
middle of a fight, Ichigo?

23
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,387
It's simple,
really...

24
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:45,020
Mayuri Kurotsuchi treated
my injuries.

25
00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:48,520
He treated Renji first,
because he was in worse
shape than I was.

26
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:52,920
Renji, Chad and Rukia are
in the middle of battling
Rudobon right now.

27
00:03:52,954 --> 00:03:54,720
My pain was pretty bad...

28
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:55,820
Look out, Uryu!

29
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,154
Who the hell are you,
anyway?! You've got balls
thinkin' you can strike me!

30
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,087
I shot you with all that
power and it didn't stop
you? You're stronger
than I thought.

31
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:13,620
A lot stronger!

32
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,287
Is that right?

33
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,587
Let's continue this
somewhere with less
distractions.

34
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,087
Uryu, you sure
about this?

35
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,754
Absolutely. You deal
with him, I'll take
this one.

36
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:31,020
What a smart-ass.
Ulquiorra, I'll be back
once I'm done with this guy.

37
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,620
Do as you wish.

38
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:35,587
[chuckling]

39
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,320
Are you that concerned
about your friend?

40
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:44,187
He'll be fine...

41
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,720
...Unlike you.

42
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:54,287
I can't believe you're
that stupid! Comin' all
this way to get killed.

43
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,354
If you were going to be
so late, you shouldn't
have shown at all.

44
00:04:57,387 --> 00:05:00,854
That shows how little you
understand about what's
happening.

45
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:03,954
You think I got here
late because I hesitated,
right?

46
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:06,187
Isn't that true?

47
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,720
You've got it all wrong.

48
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:12,354
I'm only late because a
crazy scientist took his
sweet time healing my wounds.

49
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:16,254
That's too bad, I guess
you'll have to lay the blame
on that crazy scientist!

50
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:19,954
Because of him, you're
about to be ripped in
half by my hands!

51
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,287
Thanks for offering your
take on the situation...

52
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:31,687
...But I don't need any
more motivation to hate
him.

53
00:05:32,387 --> 00:05:35,654
You bastard... now
I'm gonna kill you!

54
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,120
[panting]

55
00:05:46,154 --> 00:05:47,854
<i>What's the</i>
<i>problem?</i>

56
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:53,654
Are you getting
frustrated? Is it the
god-like power of my
Arbol?

57
00:05:56,654 --> 00:06:03,554
Are you intimidated by my
Calaveras, and its ability
to create an infinite army
of loyal Exequias soldiers?

58
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,720
[grunting]

59
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:21,454
Hm. I was endowed with
powers of creation by Lord
Aizen, and in spite of that,
I could not become an Espada.

60
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:28,420
With that in mind, it is
absurd for rodents like
you, who possess a fraction
of my powers,

61
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,887
to defy the
Espadas!

62
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,120
Your life will end here,
Soul Reaper!

63
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:40,154
[grunting]

64
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,854
Forget about it!

65
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,520
Ha! I'm not fallin' for
one of your tricks again!

66
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,254
[grunting]

67
00:06:55,787 --> 00:06:59,487
Ha-ha! It seems like
you're pretty good when
it comes to running away!

68
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:06,487
[laughing]
Huh?

69
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:12,420
When it comes to avoiding
an attack, I'm quicker
than you!

70
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:15,020
[groaning]

71
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,720
How many would you like
this time?

72
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:22,687
Huh? Come on, is
that all you got?!

73
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:28,820
These things are nothing
more than an irritation.
They're hardly worth dodging!

74
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:32,554
I can't believe they're
not affecting him...

75
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:34,987
Ichigo...

76
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,587
Hmpf!

77
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,820
[grunting]

78
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:56,920
I'm puzzled by your
behavior. Perhaps the
presence of this girl
is the reason you

79
00:07:56,954 --> 00:08:00,454
won't put on your mask
and unleash your Hollow
powers.

80
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,020
If that's the case...

81
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,654
You're wrong.

82
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,254
She has nothing to do
with it!

83
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,087
Then prove me wrong.
Put on your mask.

84
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:14,287
Forget it!

85
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,020
[gasping]

86
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:21,720
Ichigo is hesitating to
release his full power.

87
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:28,154
If he does, Orihime won't
be able to withstand the
blast created by Ichigo's
Hollowfication.

88
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:36,554
Hey. You seem to be
distracted by something.

89
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,120
You're right.

90
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:40,754
And I don't have time to
fool around with you
anymore.

91
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:43,154
<i>The result will be the</i>
<i>same, anyway!</i>

92
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:47,554
Oh, really? I wouldn't
get too cocky. Who knows
what I might come up with?

93
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:50,387
You can scare me, you
little maggot.

94
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:55,554
You must think
this is a joke.

95
00:08:57,587 --> 00:09:03,187
[screaming]

96
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,320
Unlike my previous
attacks, this one is
aimed at your Reishi
bonds. It loosens

97
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:10,254
them... And helps
take them away.

98
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:13,454
It lets me penetrate even
an Arrancar's Hierro.

99
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,720
[growling]

100
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:20,587
[gasping]

101
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,254
You miscalculated,
moron!

102
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:26,487
[growling]

103
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:33,687
[panting]

104
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,787
<i>Well. Very impressive.</i>

105
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,154
You continue to fight,
even against such a large
number of my soldiers. I
must say, Soul Reaper,

106
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:45,354
you appear to have a
limitless supply of
energy...

107
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:52,087
However, this battle is
also limitless. You'll be
fighting me until you drop
dead from exhaustion.

108
00:09:55,054 --> 00:10:01,154
I'm being pushed back by
the army he keeps creating.
I can't get close enough to
make a direct attack.

109
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:06,087
He's right. At this rate,
I'll just keep using up my
energy until I collapse!

110
00:10:06,587 --> 00:10:11,754
[grunting]

111
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:15,420
[yelling]

112
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,854
[chuckling]

113
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:21,520
[trembling]

114
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,820
[screaming]

115
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,087
Huh?

116
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:38,387
Renji! Chad!

117
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:44,320
What's the matter? You
looked so cool and confident
before.

118
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:47,354
Now you're starting to
look a little nervous and
desperate.

119
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:50,987
You're about to find out
what desperation feels
like!

120
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,854
Huh? Heh!

121
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:55,254
For a small guy, you
got a big mouth!

122
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,554
I don't know what you
meant about taking away
my Reishi,

123
00:10:58,587 --> 00:11:01,887
but all that nonsense
isn't gonna save you
in the end.

124
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:09,287
You're nothin' but talk.
That other Soul Reaper
would've been a much
bigger challenge.

125
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,020
It's too bad for that crazy
scientist you mentioned, he
wasted his time saving you!

126
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:18,820
Hey, I wouldn't go
bad-mouthing that
scientist, if I
were you...

127
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:21,620
You might end up
regretting it.

128
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:23,154
The hell with you!

129
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
Heh! You're gonna need
to improve your aim!

130
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,420
You're wasting your time!

131
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:37,954
[grunting]

132
00:11:43,154 --> 00:11:45,054
Out of options, I see.

133
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,320
Let's put an end to
this game now.

134
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:53,154
<i>You know, when it comes</i>
<i>to being a slow learner,</i>
<i>you're right up there</i>
<i>with Ichigo.</i>

135
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:57,987
You think I was just
randomly firing my arrows
at you?

136
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,254
Huh?

137
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:01,387
I wasn't aiming for you
at all.

138
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,254
I created a field to
surround you.

139
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:12,320
You wandered right into
my trap!

140
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:16,387
Hold on a minute!
What's the hell's this?!

141
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:28,520
[screaming]

142
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:30,220
I warned you...

143
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:34,787
Remember? I told you not
to get too cocky, you don't
know what I might come up with.

144
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:49,550
Renji, Chad!
Thank you!

145
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,883
What's the problem? I
thought you would've had
this guy wrapped up by now.

146
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:56,050
I'm working on it. What
happened to the guys you
were fighting?

147
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,450
What do you think? We
took care of them, of
course.

148
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:01,350
And the two of us have
now become an invincible
team!

149
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:05,350
I'm thinking that Chad
must be quite annoyed to
have you as his big-mouth
partner.

150
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:08,583
What is it with this
lousy attitude? We came
to help you out, you
know!

151
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:11,317
I guess you must not have
noticed, but nobody asked
for your help!

152
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,017
<i>Nobody had to!</i>

153
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,117
[sighing]

154
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,983
Ah, reinforcements...

155
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:23,450
Nice try, but more Soul
Reapers aren't going to
change a thing. No matter
how many warriors you

156
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:27,917
send, I'll just keep
manufacturing additional
soldiers to hold you off.

157
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,317
Is that the deal? He
can just keep growing
soldiers?

158
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,517
They grow as if they
were some kind of fruit.

159
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,283
I don't think a plant
could produce fruit
indefinitely.

160
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,983
What do you mean? Of
course it can, if you
water it enough!

161
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:42,483
Plants are a lot more
complicated than that,
believe me.

162
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,817
More complicated than
you, that's for sure!

163
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,350
(Renji yelling)
It's nice to see they're
getting along so much
better now.

164
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:51,650
Just like a plant...

165
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:59,950
How are we going to fight
him, Rukia? He can keep
sending these troops
forever!

166
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:05,717
You two take care of all
these soldiers, and keep
his attention fixed on
you! I'll go after him.

167
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,617
We hear you. Let's go!!

168
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,383
[yelling]

169
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,017
El Directo!!

170
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:29,250
Normally, I can't use
Sprenger as an offensive
tactic, because it takes
too much time during a

171
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:31,850
one-on-one battle.

172
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:35,950
But in your
overconfidence, you
dropped your defenses.
That gave me an opening,

173
00:14:35,983 --> 00:14:38,250
and made my plan much
easier.

174
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:44,817
Damn you! You think
you're so smart, but you
haven't defeated me yet!

175
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,683
Interesting, you can still
stand. You continue to
surprise me.

176
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:49,983
Shut your mouth!

177
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:53,183
Watch it. You should be
very careful where you
step.

178
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:55,150
[screaming]

179
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,050
I should have mentioned,
that crazy scientist gave
those to me.

180
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,917
I surrounded you with
mines, especially
designed for Arrancars.

181
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:11,417
I hope he's
okay...

182
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:15,983
I guess I needed to
be specific with you...

183
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:20,650
I told you I wasn't
aiming at you before,
that I created a field
to surround you.

184
00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:22,817
Apparently, you
weren't listening
to me.

185
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,083
That field wasn't laid
there by accident.

186
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:31,817
I knew with pinpoint
precision, the exact
place where I'd set
the mines.

187
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,717
After gauging the
distance between us, I
built the field right there.

188
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,050
I wouldn't move too much,
for your own sake.

189
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:41,383
Damn it, you
bastard!

190
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:44,883
You're Yammy, the one
Szayelaporro talked
about, right?

191
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:47,517
That's right. Why is
that so important to you?

192
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,983
It's not, really. It's a
shame, though...

193
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:55,283
You're a worthy opponent,
but you're not going to
win this time. Your days
of rampaging are over.

194
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:01,583
[screaming]

195
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:03,817
Mala Suerte...

196
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:06,450
My condolences...

197
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,250
[grunting]

198
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:13,650
[screaming]

199
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:18,217
<i>On my way up here, I</i>
<i>snapped a few pillars at</i>
<i>each level, so the floors</i>
<i>would collapse more easily.</i>

200
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,150
<i>I imagine you'll fall</i>
<i>all the way to the bottom.</i>

201
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:30,950
Uryu! Are
you all right?

202
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:32,883
Sure! Do I look ill?

203
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:36,683
No, but we heard all
that commotion, and I--

204
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:41,750
Oh, you mean all those
explosions? They were
caused by mines that
Mayuri had me bring along.

205
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:48,517
I planted them earlier.
They go off if their Spiritual
Pressure sensors detect an
Arrancar anywhere within range.

206
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:53,783
I carved out the ceiling
of the level below and
placed them there. Yammy
fell for my plan. He

207
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:59,150
never suspected I was
driving him into a
minefield. Everything
went off like clockwork.

208
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:02,950
Did you doubt my
capabilities?

209
00:17:02,983 --> 00:17:05,783
Actually, I've never had
my doubts about you, Uryu.

210
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:11,550
The problem is, you talk
too much. You ramble on and
there's no way to block
you out.

211
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,317
Take care of
Orihime.

212
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,550
If she can't block my
Spirit Energy with her
Shun Shun Rikka,

213
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,917
I want you to protect
her with your life.

214
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:26,517
I would have done that
without you telling me.

215
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,750
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Ulquiorra...

216
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:37,683
I believe this is what
you wanted to see...

217
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,150
My Hollowfication!

218
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:45,317
[roaring]

219
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,483
[roaring]

220
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,617
Come back here!

221
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,017
Damn it! How far is
he planning to go?!

222
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:49,583
Wait a minute...!

223
00:18:51,017 --> 00:18:53,317
Are we above Las Noche's
canopy?!

224
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,750
<i>That's right.</i>

225
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:07,150
What's happening?

226
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:08,417
Mmm.

227
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,350
That Spiritual
Pressure...!

228
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:16,317
Ohh.. I can feel it!

229
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:19,850
It's Master Ulquiorra!

230
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:23,283
He's broken through the
ceilings canopy of Las
Noches!

231
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:29,383
Oh, no, Ichigo!

232
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:42,350
Under Aizen's orders, two
things are forbidden below
the canopy of Las Noches...

233
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:50,750
The first is... Gran Ray
Cero, which exists only
for... an Espada.

234
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:56,483
And the second is... the
sword release of Espadas
with the rank of four and
higher.

235
00:19:57,617 --> 00:20:03,383
They are both so powerful
that, if released, they
would threaten to destroy
Las Noches itself.

236
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:13,017
Imprison...
...Murcielago!

237
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:28,250
[gasping]

238
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:05,183
Compose yourself.

239
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,483
You must hold your
stance...

240
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:13,250
...Extend your
consciousness. Do not
let your guard down.

241
00:21:38,383 --> 00:21:40,717
You instinctively
used Getsuga.

242
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:44,950
A wise choice on your
part...

243
00:21:45,717 --> 00:21:52,250
If you hadn't reacted the
way that you did... your
head would be resting at
my feet right now.

244
00:21:52,283 --> 00:21:57,883
[panting]

245
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,030
Chad and I are completely
in sync with each other!

246
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:49,297
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

247
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,997
You can tell what I want
to do, even if I don't
say it, right?

248
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,597
<i>Hmm!</i>

249
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,864
No question, right?

250
00:23:53,897 --> 00:23:54,630
<i>Hm!</i>

251
00:23:54,664 --> 00:23:56,130
No moment of hesitation?!

252
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:57,530
<i>... Hmmmmm...</i>

253
00:23:57,564 --> 00:23:59,664
I can feel you in my
head!
