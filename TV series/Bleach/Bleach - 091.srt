THEME SONG: Woke up with yawn.

3
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,266
It's dawning.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,266
I'm still alive.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,733
Turned on my radio
to start up new day.

6
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:37,733
As god damned DJs
chattered how to survive,

7
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:44,633
amazing news got
over on the air wave.

8
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:49,600
Tonight love is rationed,
tonight across the nation.

9
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:55,133
Tonight love infects
worldwide-- almost another day.

10
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:59,333
She's a shooting star.

11
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:02,333
Good night.

12
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:05,833
Good night.

13
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:10,833
She's a shooting star.

14
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:11,333
Good bye.

15
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,733
Tonight love is rationed,
tonight across the nation.

16
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:30,233
Tonight love infects
worldwide-- almost another day.

17
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,233
See you some other day.

18
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,197
-To exact our revenge, we're
returning to the Soul Society,

19
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,997
where all Bounts
were first created.

20
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,997

[rumbling]

00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,430
-What was that sound?

23
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,864
-It seemed to come from
somewhere behind these walls.

24
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:10,930
Do you think it could be
Ichigo and the others?

25
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,264
It would have to be an
incredibly fierce battle for us

26
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:14,697
to be able to hear
the sound of it

27
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,997
right through this cave's
solid rock and stone.

28
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,097
-I can't stay here.

29
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,264
I've got to go and help.

30
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:24,030
-Rukia, you haven't fully
recovered enough to battle.

31
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:27,764
-I have to.

32
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:28,897
-Is something wrong?

33
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,597
What is it, Chad?

34
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:33,930
-No way.

35
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:45,730
[grunting]

36
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:46,964
-What did you say?

37
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:49,330
-Long ago, the Soul
Society conducted

38
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:50,764
a series of strange experiments.

39
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:56,864
It's never been quite clear
exactly what their purpose was,

40
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:59,864
but one thing we know for sure.

41
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:02,564
At that time, they
obviously thought of humans

42
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:04,897
as nothing more than
laboratory subjects.

43
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:10,430
The name of the one
who is responsible

44
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,230
for this great crime
is in the records.

45
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:16,564
And all of this began
because of his madness.

46
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,564
There was a sudden,
giant explosion,

47
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:31,830
and something, created by
an unexpected phenomenon,

48
00:03:31,864 --> 00:03:37,597
caused a mutation in certain
souls in the cycle of rebirth.

49
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,764
During that limited
period of time,

50
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:42,297
individuals with
strange new abilities

51
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,264
began to appear all over
the world of the living.

52
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:48,897
These were the Bounts.

53
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,997
At first, we tried to
cover up our differences,

54
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,730
not wanting those
around us to notice.

55
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:58,330
But it was not
something we could hide.

56
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:02,430
Even though we were still
human, we were ostracized.

57
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:07,030
We were labeled demons and
monsters and abused terribly.

58
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:09,397
We were forced to live
in a world of darkness.

59
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:19,164
Then when the Soul Society
learned of our existence,

60
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:24,364
they kindly gave us a hand,
and we were glad to accept.

61
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:28,064
But that was all just
a part of their plan.

62
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:31,464
We didn't know any of this,
of course, and so many of us

63
00:04:31,497 --> 00:04:34,230
tried for a very long time
to live alongside the Soul

64
00:04:34,264 --> 00:04:36,430
Reapers.

65
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:39,064
This underground labyrinth
was a virtual city

66
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:41,264
where many of our
comrades lived in secrecy

67
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,497
to escape persecution.

68
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,664
Did you notice how big it is?

69
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:48,864
That's how many of us
there were at one time.

70
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:53,530
But now, sadly, there are
only a handful of us left.

71
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:56,630
Do you understand what the
Soul Society did to us?

72
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:59,997
They attempted to annihilate
us, to erase is from history.

73
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,430
We will never trust them again.

74
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:04,630
Our only wish now is
for the annihilation

75
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:06,464
of the Soul Society.

76
00:05:06,497 --> 00:05:09,164
May they now be
exterminated just as cruelly

77
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:13,164
as they tried to
exterminate the Bounts.

78
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:14,664
Now at least you know the truth.

79
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,297
-It still doesn't
make any sense.

80
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,964
No matter what
happened, whatever

81
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:36,164
terrible things the Soul
Society may have done to you,

82
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:39,064
it doesn't give you
any right to take

83
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:42,830
the lives of your fellow humans.

84
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:45,930
I can't forgive you.

85
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:49,330
No, not for that.

have that kind of power left.

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,397
But that will end now.

-You bastard.

91

-Give this up.

92
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,797
You don't have anything
close to the power

93
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,330
you need to defeat me.

95

-Absorbing so many
other living souls

96
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,097
has increased my
power immeasurably.

97
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,564
There is no limit to how much
stronger we Bounts can become.

98
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:54,697
The Soul Society
and its Soul Reapers

99
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,730
are insignificant next to us.

100
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,830
Soon now, they will know
the taste of defeat,

101
00:06:58,864 --> 00:07:00,730
and they will all
kneel before us.

102
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:03,597
-Dammit.

103
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,030
Is this the end?

104
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:07,964
No.

105
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:12,797
I did not come all
this way by myself

106
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,264
just to have it end here.

107
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:27,964
I won't-- I can't let it
end in a place like this.

-Zangetsu-- it that the name
of your Zanpakuto, then?

00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:40,864
ICHIGO KUROSAKI
(OFFSCREEN): Shut up.

112
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:53,797
What do you think you're doing?

113
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,130
-A Soul Reaper's Zanpakuto is
another incarnation of himself,

114
00:07:57,164 --> 00:07:59,230
yes?

115
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:03,264
Perhaps, then, you consider
this sword as your partner.

116
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:05,964
Just imagine if you were
killed by that partner.

117
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:08,364
How ironic.

118
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:09,697
-Damn you.

119
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,897
-I think I'll kill you with
your own blade, Soul Reaper.

122
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,664
Zangetsu, tell me.

123
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:23,430
What do you think you're doing?

124
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:26,297
-You sound like you've lost it.

125
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,264
-Come on.

126
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:29,664
Show yourself to me.

127
00:08:29,697 --> 00:08:32,364
-What the-- what is this?

128
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:32,930
-Zangetsu!

129
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,497
Zangetsu.

130
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:53,230
-Are you prepared to do this?

131
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:57,630
-It may be that I've been
relying on you too much.

132
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:01,397
I've always had my Bankai
if things got too bad.

133
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,130
Kisuke Urahara
even told me that.

134
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:05,964
So I know I must have
thought that somewhere

135
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:09,397
deep inside my heart.

136
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,097
-Bankai is the state
of extreme readiness

137
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,264
that involves both
blade and pain.

138
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:19,797
You must not be afraid.

139
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,264
The slightest hesitation
will dim your blade.

140
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,430
Once before, you were
able to gain power

141
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:30,330
by demonstrating an
unwavering heart.

142
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:32,597
I will ask you once more.

143
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,664
What are you preparing
yourself to do?

144
00:09:35,697 --> 00:09:38,197
Why are you fighting this fight?

145
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,764
For whom do you seek this power?

146
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,597
ICHIGO KUROSAKI
(OFFSCREEN): Now I remember.

147
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,130
I remember that I wanted to
become a Soul Reaper in order

148
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:50,430
to protect those who
were important to me.

149
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,197
That's when I was able
to achieve Bankai--

150
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,964
by swearing on my
soul that I was

151
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:59,064
prepared to sacrifice my life.

152
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:03,630
Zangetsu, lend me your power
one more time-- the power

153
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:06,297
to protect everyone.

154
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,464
-I am that same power, Ichigo.

155
00:10:10,497 --> 00:10:13,764
Trust in yourself, and
the power is yours.

156
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:14,730
-All right.

157
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,064
-You-- what the
hell have you done?

158
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:24,097
-I'll show you.

159
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,164
I'm protecting everyone.

160
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:30,030
Bankai!

161
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:42,030
Zangetsu.

162
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:44,530
-So this is your Bankai.

163
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:55,097
-Master, watch out!

164
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,364
-Don't distract him, Ichinose.

165
00:10:57,397 --> 00:11:00,397
You just concentrate on
controlling the Senkaimon.

166
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,897
Master Kariya will be fine.

167
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:06,130
-Get up.

168
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:18,530
I can see you.

169
00:11:23,064 --> 00:11:24,530
[yelling]

170
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:35,464
-We're almost there.

171
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:35,964
-Right.

172
00:11:35,997 --> 00:11:36,464
OK.

173
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:37,364
Let's hurry.

174
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,364
I hope we're not too late.

175
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:00,830
-You dodged that one well.

176
00:12:04,697 --> 00:12:09,064
-I guess I should also give
you credit for a good strike.

177
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:12,597
-I think it's time we put
an end to this little dance.

178
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,597
-My thoughts exactly.

179
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:26,664
-Uryu?

180
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:27,964
-Ichigo!

181
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,264
-Are you all right?

182
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:30,997
-Orihime!

183
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,764
Chad!

184
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:32,664
Rukia!

185
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:34,364
And Uryu, too.

186
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:36,597
But I'm not so sure
about your new look.

187
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,764
-I've had enough of being
a burden to everyone.

188
00:12:38,797 --> 00:12:42,064
And now, finally, I can
look out for myself again.

189
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:44,930
-So you have all your
Quincy powers back again?

190
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,364
-Well, most of them,
but not completely.

191
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:48,297
-It's very old.

192
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,864
It was designed for battle.

193
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:53,330
It's a Quincy artifact, passed
down through generations

194
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,297
to a select few for
hundreds of years.

195
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,297
The Department of
Research and Development

196
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,797
discovered it and
saved it for study.

197
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,297
Go on.

198
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,297
Take it.

199
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,297
Perhaps it will help.

200
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:13,764
-Ah.

201
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,030
You'd better not miss with
your next shot, Quincy.

202
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:23,497
-Despite what you
may be thinking,

203
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,264
I didn't miss with
the last shot.

204
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:26,864
-He's back.

205
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:28,764
-[non-english speech].

206
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:31,730
Evidently, your powers have
been almost fully restored.

207
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:37,264
-Ichinose, is everything
prepared for us now?

208
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:39,497
ICHINOSE (OFFSCREEN):
Yes, master.

209
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,230
It's ready.

210
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:48,530
-[non-english speech]

211
00:13:48,564 --> 00:13:49,230
-What's this?

212
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:50,064
What's going on?

213
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,230
-Stay where you are, Ichigo.

214
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,197
-Uryu, we've got
to do something.

215
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,397
They've opened up the portal!

216
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,697
-No, it hasn't opened
completely yet.

217
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,864
-So what do you hope
to accomplish, Quincy?

218
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,730
-Be careful, Orihime.

219
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:18,364
-Thank you.

220
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:19,630
Sorry about that.

221
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:23,697
-Uryu doesn't seem to be
aiming his bow at the Bounts.

222
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,897
-You're right.

223
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,097
It looks like he's aiming
at that portal instead.

224
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,830
-What is this strange
feeling that's come over me?

225
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:38,097
ICHIGO KUROSAKI (OFFSCREEN):
Uryu, what are you doing?

226
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,497
-No time to explain.

227
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,097
Just let me do this now, Ichigo.

228
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,830
-Exactly what we needed, Quincy.

229
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:58,164
My thanks.

230
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,564
Now, we have no further
need of your services.

231
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:01,864
-Wh-- what do you mean by that?

232
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:03,730
-He means that by
firing through it,

233
00:15:03,764 --> 00:15:07,564
I've just opened the portal
into the Soul Society.

234
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:10,464
-So you knew what you were
doing when you fired that arrow?

235
00:15:10,497 --> 00:15:11,830
-Yes.

236
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:13,930
The Soul Reaper who helped
me to regain my Quincy powers

237
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:16,364
told me what the result
of this would be,

238
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:18,430
which also explains why
you were so determined

239
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:19,897
to capture me for so long.

240
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,397
-Now you know.

241
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,864
-A Bount who has managed
to gain the immense power

242
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:25,864
of concentrated
souls can open spaces

243
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:28,830
into different dimensions,
but he must still somehow

244
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:30,630
convert his body
into rashi in order

245
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:34,264
to pass through the portal
and into that new dimension.

246
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:36,997
-And as you know, we
Bounts unfortunately

247
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,197
do not have that power.

248
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,297
But we learned some
time ago that there

249
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,330
are a select few
among the Quincy

250
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:45,730
who can freely control rashi.

251
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:47,797
If we use an arrow
from a Quincy who

252
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,497
has that power as a conductor,
then rashi conversion

253
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,997
is possible.

254
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,630
-Then the arrow you fired--

255
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,997
-Yes.

256
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,630
The arrow I released just now
passed through the Senkaimon

257
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:01,230
and changed it into
a rashi conversion

258
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:04,364
gate that will allow the
Bounts to convert into souls.

259
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:08,630
-Uryu, why the hell are
you helping these monsters?

260
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:10,897
-That's not hard to understand.

261
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,630
I always believed you'd
come around, Quincy.

262
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:16,297
After all, isn't the
Soul Society just as much

263
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,897
of an enemy to the Quincies
as it is to the Bounts?

264
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,030
It was devastating
news when I learned

265
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:24,630
that you had lost
your Quincy powers

266
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:27,564
and were no longer
any use to us.

267
00:16:27,597 --> 00:16:32,564
Fortunately, Yoshino
managed to protect you.

268
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:34,897
For that, I am grateful to her.

269
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,464
She not only helped to
give birth to the Betoes.

270
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,297
Even in death, she was able
to influence you and bring you

271
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,764
back to me.

272
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:44,864
Now, against all odds,
you have succeeded

273
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:47,264
in regaining your Quincy powers.

274
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:51,230
Come, and walk forward with
me as befits the last Quincy.

275
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:54,964
-I think you've got
me wrong, Kariya.

276
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:58,097
The only reason I'm helping
you go to the Soul Society

277
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,897
is so I can settle all
of this with you there.

278
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,497
-So you have in mind to
try and avenge Yoshino?

279
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,164
Then you are a fool.

280
00:17:05,197 --> 00:17:07,464
I thought you were seeing
the bigger picture here.

281
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:10,397
-I am going to defeat
you, Kariya, on the honor

282
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,630
and by the pride of the Quincy.

283
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:14,297
-All right.

284
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,364
If that's what you want.

285
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:17,564
-Master Kariya.

286
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:20,130
-Now, I'm afraid you'll
have to excuse me.

287
00:17:23,697 --> 00:17:26,564
So Quincy, and you,
Soul Reaper-- we'll

288
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:28,430
be waiting on the other side.

289
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,730
Follow if you want to.

290
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,264
-Uryu, why'd you do that?

291
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:36,430
Why'd you help them, dammit?

292
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,264
-Ichigo!

293
00:17:40,297 --> 00:17:41,264
Uryu!

294
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:43,664
-Yoruichi.

295
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:44,330
-Oh, no.

296
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:44,997
We've come too late.

297
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,764
-Ichigo!

298
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:49,530
-Uryu!

299
00:17:49,564 --> 00:17:52,564
-What just happened here?

300
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:56,197
-Uryu, you've created
a serious problem.

301
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,097
-Uryu, why?

302
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,297
Why were you helping them?

303
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,764
-I'll tell you why.

304
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:03,997
I know you have your Bankai
back, but even with that,

305
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,330
do you really believe that
if we had continued to fight

306
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:09,664
we would have been able to
defeat someone so powerful?

307
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,797
-Well, I think that
if-- well, now,

308
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,664
we'll never know since
we didn't even try.

309
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:15,397
-It would have been
very difficult.

310
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,664
-But you don't know.

311
00:18:16,697 --> 00:18:17,897
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Listen.

312
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,597
This Quincy power is all
I have to defeat him with.

313
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,597
And yet, as great as a
Quincy's full power may be,

314
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,864
it is still not strong enough
to defeat Kariya, certainly

315
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:36,430
not at the level
he's reached now.

316
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:39,997
-That tool I gave you gathers
the rashi in the air around you

317
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,664
and channels through your
weapon with great force.

318
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:45,097
But with so little rachi
in the world of the living,

319
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,730
this may be all you can do.

320
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:50,130
Things would be very
different in the Soul Society,

321
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:52,530
where virtually everything
is made of rashi.

322
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,297
-So I knew what would happen
if I tried to settle this here.

323
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,197
It would have been pointless.

324
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,930
It will be different
in the Soul Society.

325
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:05,064
-But you have no
idea how shortsighted

326
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:06,297
your thinking is, Uryu.

327
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,464
Soul Reapers and Quincies
aren't the only ones

328
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:10,964
who become more powerful
in the Soul Society.

329
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:13,364
The Bounts also
become stronger there.

330
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:15,564
-But how can that be, Yoruichi?

331
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:17,164
-When they go to
the Soul Society,

332
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,597
where all matter
is made of rachi,

333
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,930
they can absorb all they
want from everything

334
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:22,864
that's around them.

335
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:24,497
-No way!

336
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,497
-This is not good.

337
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,964
-Uryu, do you do
you even know what

338
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:28,897
that tool is that Namu gave you?

339
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,730
Do you know how it works?

340
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:32,697
-Well, I know that it's
capable of bringing out

341
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,764
a Quincy's full power
very forcefully.

342
00:19:34,797 --> 00:19:37,030
And I know that it
isn't very stable,

343
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:38,430
although I get the
feeling that it

344
00:19:38,464 --> 00:19:40,764
could stop working at any time.

345
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:44,230
But I have got to hang on
to this power for as long

346
00:19:44,264 --> 00:19:45,797
as it is still working.

347
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,097
-I don't think you understand.

348
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,330
What you've started may
result in the destruction

349
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:50,297
of the entire world.

350
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:57,130
-Hey, what was that for?

351
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:59,964
-So why are we standing
around listening to you talk?

352
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:02,597
If we're going to the Soul
Society, then let's go.

353
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,397
-Ichigo.

354
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,764
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Right.

355
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:07,197
After all, you have serious
business to take care of, Uryu.

356
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,030
And we'll all go along
with you and back you up.

357
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:13,564
-You're all hopeless, but if
this is what you really want,

358
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:15,430
then fine.

359
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,164
-Thank you all.

360
00:20:17,197 --> 00:20:19,497
-Incredible.

361
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,464
[sighs]

362
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:21,497
-Well, why not?

363
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,864
As long as we've come this far.

364
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:25,464
In order to finish
this, though, we're

365
00:20:25,497 --> 00:20:28,097
going to have to mobilize
every Soul Reaper in the Soul

366
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,064
Society.

367
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,264
-When you really
think about it, that

368
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,630
might be the best
solution we have.

369
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,530
-It was in the Soul
Society that the Bounts

370
00:20:34,564 --> 00:20:35,864
were created to begin with.

371
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:37,230
It's true.

372
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:39,097
So if there are going to be
casualties and blood spilled,

373
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,130
then the Soul Society ought
to take some responsibility.

You're all right.

377
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:47,997
-Of course I am.

378
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,330
You can't kill me that easy.

379

Where are the

380
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,830
-Bounts?

381
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:52,830
-They all got away.

382
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:55,230
-Then we've failed--
not a beautiful ending

383
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:56,130
to our mission.

384
00:20:56,164 --> 00:20:56,797
-Dammit.

385
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,730
That hurts.

386
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:58,864
-We can still get
them, but it'll

387
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:00,664
have to be in the Soul Society.

388
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:01,430
Let's do it.

389
00:21:01,464 --> 00:21:02,730
-But how can we get there?

390
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:04,497
Chad and I don't
have that power.

391
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,097
-That isn't the only way in.

392
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,164
Don't forget, we still
have the Senkaimon

393
00:21:08,197 --> 00:21:09,697
here that the Bounts left us.

394
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,197
I think with some
adjustments, we

395
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,997
can probably use it ourselves.

396
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,597
-That's a relief.

397
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,497
-I'll report in.

398
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,064
Hello, Captain, it's me.

399
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:19,630
Yes.

400
00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:22,264
Everything's OK.

401
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:23,530
-Hey, what are you going?

402
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:25,330
-We're going along
with you too, you know.

403
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:27,030
You can't just
leave us behind now.

404
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:30,097
And besides, you're gonna need
Bount sensors more than ever.

405
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,930
-It's true.

406
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:32,130
You could actually be useful.

407
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:34,697
-As for me, I guess
I'll just go back home.

408
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,030
-Fine with me.

409
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:38,064
But don't forget, you'll be
there in the house all alone.

410
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,164
-Home alone, huh?

411
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,597
Oh, no way!

412
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,564
I changed my mind.

413
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,597
I'm going with you.

414
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,664
-All right.

415
00:21:49,697 --> 00:21:50,697
I've just kicked in
with the Captain,

416

and everyone's cleared
to make the trip.

-Well, it looks like
we're headed back

to the Soul Society.

419
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:14,130
-So this is what
rashi-filled air is like--

420
00:22:14,164 --> 00:22:17,097
better than I imagined.

421
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,030
Now, to begin
exacting our revenge.
