00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:51,541
NARRATOR: Soul Reapers,
the spiritual guardians

3
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:53,407
to the world of the living.

4
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:56,341
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

5
00:01:56,374 --> 00:02:01,141
of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

6
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:03,507
Hitsugaya and the others
managed to fend off

7
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,507
the Arrancars who
attacked Karakura Town.

8
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:09,807
However, they suffered serious
injuries during the battle.

9
00:02:12,574 --> 00:02:15,141
In order to overcome
his inner Hollow,

10
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:18,607
Ichigo turned to the
Visoreds, and with their help,

11
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:20,874
he begin training for
the decisive showdown.

12
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,541
Meanwhile, Ukitake's
investigation of Aizen,

13
00:02:27,574 --> 00:02:29,941
and those who joined his
defection from the Soul

14
00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:35,141
Society, revealed
their ultimate goal.

15
00:02:35,174 --> 00:02:38,741
MAN: This winter,
we shall fight!

16
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:42,007
Until then, we must
hone our skills,

17
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,107
and not rest until we
are prepared for battle!

18
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:51,474
-Yah!

19
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:08,774
-Well, it looks like time's up.

20
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:20,807
The next time,
give me a warning.

21
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:24,941
If you can Hollowfy for
longer, you should tell me.

22
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:26,874
-Well, what else did you expect?

23
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,741
You're the one who told
me to stay Hollowfied

24
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:29,974
as long as possible.

25
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:33,241
-We don't have time for
your dumb ass whining.

26
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:34,241
Now do it again.

27
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:39,941
You're still way too slow.

28
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,741
-How's he doing?

29
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:48,707
-He's increased his Hollow
time by half a second.

30
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:49,674
-Pretty good.

31
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,407
I mean, that is
pretty good, right?

32
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,507
-No.

33
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,807
All that work for a
lousy half second more?

34
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:59,241
Maybe he just doesn't
have any talent.

35
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:02,207
I mean, we've been
beating him up forever.

36
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,041
-We don't have a choice.

37
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:06,007
For now, all we can do
is keep training him

38
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:11,307
the best know how to, and
hope he gets it in time.

39
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:14,874
[crying]

40
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:15,907
-I'm worried.

41
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,541
Ichigo still hasn't
come home yet.

42
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:20,407
-I told you, quit your worrying.

43
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:23,374
He'll wander back as
soon as you forget him.

44
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:24,241
How can I forget him?

45
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:25,141
He's our brother.

46
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:26,474
We can never forget him.

47
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:27,641
-Oh, boy.

48
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,574
It's just a figure of speech.

49
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:30,341
-That's right.

50
00:04:30,374 --> 00:04:31,274
There's no need to worry.

51
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:32,874
When a young man
reaches that age,

52
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:34,674
he feels like rebelling
against the world,

53
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,274
and he needs to
find his own place.

54
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:38,207
-What do you mean, Dad?

55
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:39,607
-When I was in
high school, I felt

56
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:40,974
like it was me
against the world,

57
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:43,807
so I left home in
order to find myself.

58
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,541
I'd wander around the
schoolyard at night,

59
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:47,141
just looking for trouble.

60
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:49,241
Sometimes I'd go all the
way down to the beach

61
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:50,907
and scream out manly
stuff at the ocean.

62
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:53,274
[shouting]

63
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:54,707
-Is that what Ichigo's doing?

64
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:56,741
-I'm guessing that he's
screaming at the ocean

65
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:57,941
as we speak.

66
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:01,607
And thus preparing his
manhood for mating season!

67
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:03,307
-It's called puberty, Dad.

68
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:06,141
-So that's where he is?

69
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:08,707
-Look, I wouldn't put much
stock into what Dad says,

70
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,907
but Ichigo has always been
able to take care of himself.

71
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:15,674
Now, let's eat breakfast
before it gets cold.

72
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:17,274
-OK.

73
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:19,807
-The real problem is why
hasn't my darling new daughter

74
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:22,674
Rukia come home yet?

75
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:25,707
-You're more worried about
her than you are your own son.

76
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:27,007
Look, Rukia called me.

77
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,174
She said that she's really
busy with a school project,

78
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:31,074
so she's staying over
at Orihime's place,

79
00:05:31,107 --> 00:05:32,907
where they can work
on it together.

80
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:35,907
-My poor, sweet darling
little girl Rukia!

81
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:38,741
I thought I'd finally had a
new daughter to call my own.

82
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:41,141
It makes me so sad
when she's away.

83
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,174
-Will you stop it?

84
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:46,574
You're about to lose
two real daughters!

85
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:50,607
-So, Renji will be staying
with Urahara for a while?

86
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,507
-Yeah.

87
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,874
He made up some
excuse about why,

88
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:54,974
but I think he just
likes it there.

89
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:56,607
It's his second time
mooching off them,

90
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:58,474
so he's pretty
used to the place.

91
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:01,041
He said that he was helping
Chad with his training.

92
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,674
-Sounds like he's
secretly enjoying himself.

93
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:05,907
-Considering how strong
the Arrancars are,

94
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:07,974
it's pretty obvious we
don't have enough fighting

95
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:09,407
power on our side.

96
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:11,574
-OK, so what do we do?

97
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:13,774
-I believe there's
only one choice.

98
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,174
First of all, we've got to
work on improving our fighting

99
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:19,041
skills, or we're never going
to be able to win this battle.

100
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:19,541
-True.

101
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:21,007
Very true.

102
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,141
It's frustrating, but
the Arrancars' strength

103
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,607
is something we can't ignore.

104
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:25,307
-Yeah?

105
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:26,907
Well, I say bring it on.

106
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:29,041
The harder the battle
is to win, the more fun

107
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:30,074
I have while fighting.

108
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,541
-Then you're going
to have a ball when

109
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:32,541
the Arrancars come back.

110
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:33,707
-Damn straight.

111
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:36,674
However, if I were you
I'd try to get stronger,

112
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:38,841
otherwise you'll never get
back to the Soul Society.

113
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:40,574
-Speak for yourself.

114
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:41,641
Oh, no.

115
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:43,541
Look at the time.
if I don't hurry,

116
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:45,574
the stores will become
too crowded and busy,

117
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:47,707
and I won't have time to
get everything I want.

118
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,541
-Excuse me?

119
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,807
Stores?

120
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,274
-I'm going into
town to check out

121
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:53,374
all the wonderful
stores they have.

122
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:54,474
Did I say that out loud?

123
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:56,641
I meant to say I'm going
into town to check out

124
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,274
if anything strange
going on there.

125
00:06:58,307 --> 00:07:00,074
-But you just said you
were going shopping.

126
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:01,141
-Bye, Captain.

127
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:04,107
Don't wait up!

128
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:05,307
-That airhead.

129
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,574
It's always in one ear and
out the other with her.

130
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,107
-Since I'm in the
world of the living,

131
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:18,074
I might as well get
some shopping in.

132
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:21,374
Oh, how adorable.

133
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,474
I've got to go inside.

134
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:34,341
Oh.

135
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:38,774
Oh.

136
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:50,041
Hm.

137
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:52,707
Now, which outfit should I buy?

138
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:56,307
They're all so cute,
I just can't decide.

139
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:56,807
Wait.

140
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,241
I know.

141
00:07:58,274 --> 00:07:59,574
Excuse me?

142
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:00,507
-Yes?

143
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,207
-I think I'll just
take them all.

144
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:06,274
Oh, the world of the
living is so wonderful.

145
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:08,807
They have such nice stores,
with such great clothes.

146
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:10,207
And they're much
cheaper than they

147
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,041
would be in the Soul Society.

148
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:14,107
Oh.

149
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:15,741
This place has a lot
of cool stuff, too.

150
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:17,374
I'll just take a
quick peek inside.

151
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:22,374
-Uh, hi there.

152
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:23,407
Can I help you?

153
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:24,374
-Wow.

154
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:26,441
So much great stuff
to choose from.

155
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:26,941
Oh!

156
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:32,241
This is adorable.

157
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:32,974
Hi.

158
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,474
I'd like to buy this.

159
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:35,141
-Great.

160
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:36,107
A very wise choice.

161
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,441
-Oh, there's no need to wrap it.

162
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:38,474
I'll just wear it.

163
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:40,107
-Oh, thank you for
saving me the trouble.

164
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:41,574
I'm the world's
worst gift wrapper.

165
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:42,841
-Here you go.

166
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:43,574
-10,000 yen?

167
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:44,741
Let me go get change.

168
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:51,574
-Mm.

169
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:54,207
[whistle]

170
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,107
[whistle]

171
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:58,541
-Huh?

172
00:08:58,574 --> 00:08:59,607
Something's going on.

173
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:11,241
There's some activity happening
in North Karakura, block 11.

174
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:18,707
-Looks like a Hollow.

175
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,541
Or is it?

176
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:22,507
-It's just a Hollow, right?

177
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,241
If that's the case,
there's no need for us

178
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:25,674
to go all the way out there.

179
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:26,741
-I'm with you.

180
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,907
Rangiku is already
right there in the area.

181
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:29,707
-Good.

182
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:32,774
Let's leave it to her, then.

183
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:34,674
That noise is pretty
damn annoying, though.

184
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:35,241
-Yeah.

185
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,107
It's strange.

186
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:37,741
I wonder what it is?

187
00:09:37,774 --> 00:09:38,707
-Aw.

188
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:40,707
Why do I have to
be the closest one?

189
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:42,407
-I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

190
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:44,041
-Hold on a second.

191
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:45,541
I promise I'll be right back.

192
00:09:45,574 --> 00:09:46,174
-Huh?

193
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:47,307
-Wait.

194
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:50,841
On second thought-- you
take care of the rest.

195
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:53,441
-Just leave it to me.

196
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:54,907
-Huh?

197
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:56,107
What's going on?

198
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:59,374
-Nothing at all, sweetie.

199
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:03,841
Unless you want to
get something going?

200
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:05,941
-Now-- hold on a second.

201
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:07,441
Don't you want to
count your change?

202
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:21,974
-It's gone now.

203
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:22,474
-Huh?

204
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:33,907
-What is that?

205
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:40,841
[scream]

206
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:44,841
-A soul?

207
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:54,774
-Bring it on!

208
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:55,774
I'll kick your ass!

209
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:56,441
-Hey, wait!

210
00:10:56,474 --> 00:10:57,274
what are you doing?

211
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:58,341
-Let go of me, will ya?

212
00:10:58,374 --> 00:10:59,841
You're in the way, old lady.

213
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:03,107
-Old lady?

214
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:04,674
You little brat!

215
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,674
[shout]

216
00:11:20,441 --> 00:11:21,041
-Hey!

217
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:23,674
Stop right there!

218
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:25,374
-I already told you!

219
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:26,707
Get out of the way, old lady.

220
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:28,141
-You don't know
what you're doing.

221
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:30,574
That thing is not something
that you can handle.

222
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:48,241
What is this spiritual pressure?

223
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:02,934
This spiritual pressure--
it's not a Hollow.

224
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:04,128
It's...

225
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:09,434
an Arrancar.

226
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,834
What are you?

227
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:19,234
Your spiritual pressure is
pretty tame for an Arrancar.

228
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:20,967
-Beat it.

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,900
You're interrupting my meal.

230
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:29,434
-Hurry!

231
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,134
Run!

232
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,000
-Stay out of this!

233
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:34,934
-What are you, crazy?

234
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:38,400
It isn't safe.

235
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:39,800
-Let me go!

236
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,100
Hey, let go!

237
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:45,200
What do you think you're doing?

238
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:46,067
Put me down!

239
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,867
-Ha!

240
00:12:58,667 --> 00:12:59,134
-Ikkaku!

241
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:03,934
-Yah!

242
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,834
-You're dead!

243
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:10,800
-No, you are!

244
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,967
-Ikkaku.

245
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,734
-How boring.

246
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,434
I wouldn't even consider
that a good warm up.

247
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,500
-Heh.

248
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:27,100
It looks like he was
no match for Ikkaku.

249
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:28,167
-Yumichika.

250
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,534
Captain.

251
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:31,400
-We saw a sudden change in the
Hollow's spiritual pressure

252
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:34,467
pattern, so we hurried over
here as fast as we could.

253
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,467
Rangiku, you let
your guard down.

254
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,067
-I'm sorry, sir.

255
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,200
But this little boy--

256
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:40,467
-Heh.

257
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,567
You're an old hag, but you
just got scolded by a kid.

258
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:52,367
-Being called an old lady is one
thing, but old hag's a no no.

259
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,434
-Was that really an Arrancar?

260
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,467
-Yeah.

261
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,367
But his spiritual
pressure was murky.

262
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,000
He wasn't fully mature yet.

263
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:02,000
-Whatever his level
was, he was an Arrancar.

264
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:04,400
Therefore we have to
assume that Aizen sent him

265
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:06,034
here intentionally.

266
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,500
-It's about time.

267
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:10,367
-I'm reporting this to the
Soul Society right away.

268
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,700
-Fine.

269
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:14,000
And I'm going to perform a
Konso on this cocky little brat.

270
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:15,600
-Did you say Konso, old lady?

271
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:16,300
What's that?

272
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:17,567
-It's a soul burial.

273
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,934
And enough with the old lady.

274
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:20,367
You got it?

275
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,900
-Wait a minute, Rangiku.

276
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:24,834
I want to find out what he
knows about the Arrancar first.

277
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:26,967
You can take care of him later.

278
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,934
-Huh?

279
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:29,934
Well, OK.

280
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:31,967
If you say so, Captain.

281
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,300
-What?

282
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:34,900
Hey, kid, you're a captain?

283
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:35,734
-That's right.

284
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,367
-I don't believe you.

285
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,600
-You're almost the same as me.

286
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:42,034
-Then again, a
Konso sounds good.

287
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,334
-Ma'am, please.

288
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:44,567
I'm ticklish.

289
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,267
-I hear physical contact
is important in the world

290
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,434
of the living.

291
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,334
-Now, hold on.

292
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:52,567
You're going to get me fired.

293
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,400
-There's nothing to worry about.

294
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,967
-Oh, yes there is.

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,334
-Come on, just one little kiss?

296
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:58,567
-You have to leave.

297
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,400
Now.

298
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:01,234
-Hold on for just a minute, OK?

299
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,800
I need to grab my stuff.

300
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,167
Huh?

301
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,334
-Welcome back.

302
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:09,334
You came just in time
for the best part.

303
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:13,267
[laughter]

304
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,234
-Huh?

305
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:16,700
-Sorry I was late.

306
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,700
-I simply can't resist
those lips anymore!

307
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,134
Oh, there are my new clothes.

308
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,767
Fantastic.

309
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,300
Hey, you want to see?

310
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:35,234
[groaning]

311
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,467
OKITAKE: They sent
a new Arrancar

312
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,834
to the world of the living?

313
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:46,267
-Well, Captain Hitsugaya
wasn't really sure what it was,

314
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,167
so he requested our assessment.

315
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,800
-Looks like Aizen is making
his next move in Karakura Town.

316
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,200
-Then what should we do?

317
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:55,400
First we need to
analyze the report.

318
00:15:55,434 --> 00:15:57,167
I'll take over from here on out.

319
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,767
-Yes, sir.

320
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,234
I understand.

321
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,867
-I don't understand
all this crazy talk

322
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,334
about Konsos and
the Soul Society.

323
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:13,900
All I know is you
old guys are weird.

324
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:15,300
-We're not old.

325
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:18,134
I wouldn't even go as far
as calling us middle aged.

326
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:21,334
-What he means is to a
little kid, we look old.

327
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:23,500
Don't take things so literally.

328
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:25,767
-No, he definitely meant it.

329
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,967
There's something nasty about
the way he says the word old.

330
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,234
-Oh, brother.

331
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:31,500
Hey, listen, kid.

332
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:33,800
-The shine of your head is
blinding me, chrome dome.

333
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:36,167
-Chrome dome?

334
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,000
-Put a wig on, or something.

335
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,867
-What did you just say?

336
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,100
How dare you talk
to me like that!

337
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,400
I haven't done anything
to harm you-- yet!

338
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:45,767
-Hey, that's enough!

339
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,067
All right, look.

340
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,134
We've got a bunch of things
we need to ask you about,

341
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:51,767
and we don't need anymore
of your smart aleck answers.

342
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,700
You got it?

343
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,767
-Hmph.

344
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
RANGIKU: After you've
answered all our questions,

345
00:16:56,834 --> 00:17:01,034
we'll be taking you to a
place called the Soul Society.

346
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,034
-Yeah, right.

347
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,267
Well, I'm not going.

348
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,434
-Don't be afraid.

349
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,600
It's not a scary
place, I promise.

350
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:07,334
-I don't care.

351
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm still not going.

352
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:10,734
-Too bad, 'cause
those are the rules.

353
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:13,734
-If I said I'm not going,
then I'm not going!

354
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,900
Besides, there's still
something I need to do.

355
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,400
Bring it on!

356
00:17:18,434 --> 00:17:19,634
I'll kick your ass!

357
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:20,367
-Hey, wait.

358
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,134
What are you doing?

[shout]

360
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,967
-Let's change the subject.

361
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,900
When that Arrancar
first showed up here,

362
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:35,400
did you hear a strange
whistling sound?

363
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:35,967
-Yeah.

364
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,667
I did.

365
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,134
It was really annoying.

366
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,867
-Well?

367
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,800
-Yeah, I heard it.

368
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:44,300
-And did he say anything
to you directly?

369
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:45,667
-Naw, nothin' at all.

370
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,300
I was just minding
my own business

371
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,934
when he showed up, started
growling, and attacked me.

372
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:53,600
-I see.

373
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:56,300
-Looks like there's no point
asking anymore questions.

374
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,134
Doesn't look like the
kid's gonna be honest.

375
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:01,067
-It could just be a coincidence
that he ran into the Arrancar

376
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,300
when he did.

377
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:03,900
-It is possible.

378
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:06,834
Well, time to perform the Konso.

379
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:07,334
-Huh?

380
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:08,500
-No, don't.

381
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:11,034
I still have some things
I need to do around here.

382
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:13,134
I don't want to go anywhere yet.

383
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,300
HITSUGAYA: Rules are rules.

384
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:15,900
Now, don't make this
hard on yourself.

385
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:18,167
SHOTA: No, don't!

386
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,700
Stop it!

387
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:19,600
That hurts!

388
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:20,734
-Captain, wait!

389
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,434
Please, hold on for a moment.

390
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,900
I think this boy might be
feeling confused and frightened

391
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:26,300
by what just happened.

392
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:29,567
Maybe he'll be willing to answer
our questions in the morning.

393
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,900
-The old lady's right.

394
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:34,067
-From now on, just lady will do.

395
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,334
-Fine, then.

396
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,934
Rangiku, from here on,
you're in charge of him.

397
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,400
-Thank you very much, Captain.

398
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:40,600
-Oh, that's great.

399
00:18:40,634 --> 00:18:42,600
Just be careful
what you wish for.

400
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:45,400
-Well, at any rate, until we can
figure out exactly what Aizen's

401
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:47,800
up to, all of us need
to be on full alert.

402
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,600
Eyes open, guard up.

403
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:51,700
-Right.

404
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:53,067
IKKAKU: We'll head
on back, then.

405
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:25,934
-I can definitely do
it if I have this.

406
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,500
RANGIKU: Definitely do what?

407
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,234
-Get away from me!

408
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:33,334
-Hey!

409
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:34,734
You can't just take
other people's things

410
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:35,567
without permission.

411
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,700
Understand?

412
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:38,534
-Aw, man.

413
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,634
You sure are a stingy old lady.

414
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:41,367
Hey, knock it off!

415
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,434
That hurts!

416
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:44,534
-My name is Rangiku
Matsumoto, got it?

417
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:46,334
It's not old lady.

418
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,800
You can call me Rangiku.

419
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,567
-OK!

420
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,300
-Now then, what
were you planning

421
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:54,167
on doing after taking my sword?

422
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,667
-It's none of your business, OK?

423
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,767
It doesn't concern you.

424
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,134
-It absolutely concerns me.

425
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,067
An important part of
our job as Soul Reapers

426
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,267
is to protect souls like you
from all kinds of danger.

427
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,967
These swords are just as
important to us Soul Reapers

428
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,067
as our very own lives.

429
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,600
You wouldn't like it very much
if I took something important

430
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:14,834
from you without
permission, now would you?

431
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:15,634
OK, then.

432
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:16,600
Apologize.

433
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:17,734
-Huh?

434
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:19,867
-When you do something
bad, you apologize

435
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,267
by saying you're sorry.

436
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,467
Well, I'm waiting.

437
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,700
Apologize!

438
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:26,200
-OK, OK.

439
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:26,700
I'm.

440
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:27,634
Sorry

441
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:29,300
-Sorry, Rangiku.

442
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:30,900
-Rangiku.

443
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:31,567
-There.

444
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,800
That's much better.

445
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:36,000
By the way, what's your name?

446
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:39,734
Do you have any family?

447
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:45,534
What were you doing in a
place like that, anyway?

448
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,134
Not much of a conversationalist.

449
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:53,300
Tell me what this thing is
that you still need to do.

450
00:20:58,234 --> 00:21:00,434

that I'm looking for.

00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,534
-Who?

452
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,200
-I have got to find
her, no matter what.

453
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:05,167
-So who is it?

454
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,500
Things are going to get
dangerous in this town.

455
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:14,934
More monsters like that
last one could suddenly

456
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:17,767
reappear here at
any given moment.

457
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,034
Trust me, there is no way you
could stand up to one of them.

458
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,934
Look, won't you at least please
consider telling me your name?

459
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:33,334
-Shota.

460
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:35,400
I'm Shota Toyokawa.

461
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:36,500
-Oh, I see.

462
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:39,967
Shota, huh?

463
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,967
-It's that sound.

-That same spiritual pressure.

00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:03,967
Just like the Arrancar
from earlier today.

that Rangiku's soul

470
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,543
candy is behaving
kind of strange?

471

It was doing weird
things, and talkin' funny.

RANGIKU: Really?

It didn't seem so bad to me.

your soul candy, anyway?
