00:01:49,664 --> 00:01:52,464
-NARRATOR: Shusuke Amagai
was named captain of Squad 3,

3
00:01:52,497 --> 00:01:53,897
which had been
without a commander

4
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:55,964
ever since Aizen's rebellion.

5
00:01:55,997 --> 00:01:58,197
Izuru Kira organized
a party to help

6
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,964
Squad 3 get to know their new
captain, who they're still

7
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:02,431
a little unsure of.

8
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:05,031
Unfortunately, the
party came to an end

9
00:02:05,064 --> 00:02:07,764
when their new leader
couldn't handle his liquor.

10
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:10,497
Just then, an alarm
sounded that Menos

11
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,797
had infiltrated the Precipice
World, and the squad sprung

12
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:16,531
into action, leaving
their captain behind.

13
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:18,231
But the restrictive
current, which

14
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:19,897
should have been
quarantined, was

15
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,397
released, putting
the squad in peril.

16
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:24,564
Suddenly, Captain
Amagai awakened

17
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:27,531
from his drunken stupor,
and with impressive power,

18
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,464
saved the men under
his new command.

19
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:17,764
-We're early.

20
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,797
Sunrise is still
a few hours away.

21
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:23,631
The items I arranged
for haven't arrived yet.

22
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:25,497
We'll have to wait here
for the time being.

23
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:30,297
-I am hungry.

24
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:35,397
MAN: That's the last of it.

25
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:36,031
MAN: All right.

26
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:51,331
-Ichigo!

27
00:03:58,064 --> 00:04:00,397
Morning.

28
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:01,831
Uh oh.

29
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:02,331
Whoa!

30
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:08,631
-Another morning
with a headache.

31
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:12,064
Why can't I trade that old
man in for an alarm clock?

32
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:14,564
-Don't talk about your
father like that, Ichigo.

33
00:04:14,597 --> 00:04:15,931
It's disrespectful.

34
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,264
-Shut up.

35
00:04:17,297 --> 00:04:18,697
-Hey, Ichigo.

36
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:20,897
Did you know that
Ms. Hosaka moved out?

37
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:22,497
-Yeah, I saw the truck leave.

38
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:24,897
-She came over to say
goodbye yesterday,

39
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,864
and looked like she was in
a real hurry to leave, too.

40
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:30,197
I wonder why.

41
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:31,464
-My guess?

42
00:04:31,497 --> 00:04:33,364
She got tired of her neighbor
jumping through windows

43
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:34,331
every morning.

44
00:04:34,364 --> 00:04:36,397
-Nothing is further
from the truth.

45
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,597
She respects me.

46
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,431
(HIGH PITCHED) Before
I leave, Mr. Korusaki,

47
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:41,364
I just want to say one thing.

48
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:42,697
You're a great father.

49
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:43,397
See?

50
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:45,464
I relate to my children.

51
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:47,297
-You mean you're
chilish and immature.

52
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:50,164
-Sticks and stones
may break my bones,

53
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:54,664
but not like I'm gonna break
yours if you keep this up.

54
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:56,864
Oh, the glass stuck in
my butt just went deeper.

55
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,064
ICHIGO: Thanks for breakfast.

56
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,631
-Are you all right?

57
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:02,831
ICHIGO: Let's go, Rukia.

58
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:03,331
-Ichigo!

59
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:14,264
Why'd you step aside?

60
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:15,064
-Habit.

61
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:16,497
From living with my father.

62
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:20,764
-You could've slowed me down
with a clothesline, like this.

63
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:21,464
Hi Chad.

64
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,364
-You all right?

65
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:31,064
-If that's your attempt at an
apology, I graciously accept.

66
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,064
Hey, don't leave me.

67
00:05:33,097 --> 00:05:34,497
TATSUKI: Ichigo!

68
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:35,397
Oh, sorry.

69
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:38,197
-Hey, Tatsuki.

70
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,297
-Nice impersonation
of a pretzel.

71
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,431
-Salted?

72
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:43,297
-Why not?

73
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:45,431
-Ichigo, Tatsuki.

74
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:46,364
Morning.

75
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:47,864
-Hey.

76
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:50,364
-Looks like there's a
meeting going on here.

77
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:51,764
-I was showing my homework.

78
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:54,597
I think I've gotten
better in art class.

79
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:55,497
Look.

80
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:56,431
Ta-da.

81
00:05:56,464 --> 00:06:00,164
It's a tyrannosaurus doing yoga.

82
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:01,231
-Oh, yeah.

83
00:06:01,264 --> 00:06:02,097
Of course.

84
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:02,964
-Oh!

85
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:04,764
That is so avant garde.

86
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,431
-Is that the only
thing you think about?

87
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:18,331
-Show us what you drew, Rukia.

88
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:20,264
-This.

89
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,364
-Huh?

90
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:26,597
-Aw, they're cute
bunnies doing yoga.

91
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,797
That's so cute.

92
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:29,364
RUKIA: Yours is even
better, Orihime.

93
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:30,664
ORIHIME: Thanks.

[phone beeping]

95
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:33,797
-Rukia.

96
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:34,797
-Don't worry.

97
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:36,731
Its business as usual.

98
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:37,664
Ichigo?

99
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,197
-I guess so.

100
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:42,731
Be right back.

101
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:43,697
-What's going on?

102
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:51,597
-RUKIA: What is this?

103
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:52,764
-What's wrong?

104
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:55,564
-The number of Hollows
are steadily increasing.

105
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:56,864

106
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:57,797
No, 50.

107
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:58,931
-You're kidding.

108
00:06:58,964 --> 00:06:59,897
How can that be?

109
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,031
-I don't know.

110
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:02,797
Let's splut up and deal
with them separately.

111
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:12,736
[gurgling]

112
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:13,702
-I'm hungry.

113
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,736
-I have discovered what
the world of the living

114
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,002
calls a convenience store.

115
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:22,936
-Oh, is that so?

116
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:23,769
Quick.

117
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:25,669
Let me have something to eat.

118
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:29,236
-Well, the thing is--

119
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:30,036
-Come now, give.

120
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:32,169
I promise I won't be picky.

121
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,469
Hurry, I'm starved.

122
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,869
-The Gigai haven't arrived yet.

123
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:38,569
I couldn't buy anything.

124
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:39,736
-What?

125
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:41,102
-I'm terribly sorry.

126
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:42,669
I've contacted the dealer.

127
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:44,602
It shouldn't be too much longer.

128
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:45,136
-Argh!

129
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:45,936
No.

130
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:48,269
I will not wait any longer.

131
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,536
-You mustn't.

132
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,436
You need this veil to suppress
your spiritual pressure.

133
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:56,369
If your presence in the world
of the living is discovered,

134
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:57,936
it will be disastrous.

135
00:07:57,969 --> 00:07:59,869
-But--

136
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:02,269
-Please bear it a bit longer.

137
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:05,769
The Gigai I've arranged for has
a spiritual pressure cloaking

138
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:08,169
function.

139
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:11,836
But, that aside, Enryu is
preparing valuable tests

140
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:13,869
as we speak.

141
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:18,436
From here on out, it's important
that you do not leave my side.

142
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:19,369
Huh?

143
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:20,336
Gah!

144
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:23,936
-That Kenryu is so frustrating.

145
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:26,902
I will just have to find
something to eat on my own.

146
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:27,869
[screeching]

147
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:28,836
-Huh?

148
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:29,802
Who's that?

149
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:39,569
-How many of these Hollows
are there anyway, dam it.

150
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,602
RURICHIYO: Over there.

151
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,902
Over here.

152
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:43,802
-Huh?

153
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:44,769
Excuse me.

154
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:46,869
Are you the Soul
Reaper of this town?

155
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:47,636
RURICHIYO: A soul?

156
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:52,969
Unless you want
to be eaten, you'd

157
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:54,969
better get the hell
out of here now.

158
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:55,802
-No.

159
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,869
I am the one who wants to eat.

160
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:59,036
-You do?

161
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:00,502
Who are you?

162
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:02,436
-That is not important.

163
00:09:02,469 --> 00:09:04,436
What is important is--

164
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:05,336
-Hey.

165
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:07,236
You OK?

166
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:09,336
-Argh!

167
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:11,102
I hate this veil.

168
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:15,502
-Where are you from?

169
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:18,736
Who are you?

170
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:19,702
-Uh, ahem.

171
00:09:22,702 --> 00:09:24,636
-Uh.

172
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:25,402
-Well, come on.

173
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:27,469
What are you waiting for?

174
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:28,669
-I don't know.

175
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,836
-You are supposed to help me up.

176
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:31,336
-Oh.

177
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:41,769
-Now, you are about to
bring me something to eat.

178
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:42,736
And be quick about it.

179
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:43,302
I am starving.

180
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:44,936
[screeching]

181
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:45,502
-Hey!

182
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:46,869
Did you hear me?

183
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:49,136
-Stay back.

184
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:50,969
-Argh.

185
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:53,869
I said I want food now!

186
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:54,369
-Huh?

187
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,436
-It can't be helped.

188
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,802
Just find her quickly.

189
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:08,169
We can't let anything
happen to Lady Rurichiyo.

190
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:11,936
By the way, you brough too many.

191
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:14,136
-Don't you understand
what I mean

192
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:16,302
when I say that I am hungry?

193
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:18,369
-I'm beginning to get the idea.

194
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:19,669
-Food, food, food!

195
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,969
Hungry, hungry, hungry,
food, hungry, hungry!

196
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:23,936
-Stop!

197
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:25,669
Will you please let go of me?

198
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:26,536
MAN: Lady Rurichiyo!

199
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:30,002
-Ah!

200
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,336
-Hey!

201
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:39,202
-Take care of them.

202
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:39,702
-Huh?

203
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:43,169
[roar]

204
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:44,636
-Oh, no, Kenryu!

205
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:46,936
That Soul Reaper
has just been eaten!

206
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:48,102
-Yes.

207
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:51,202
It is his duty to protect
you, Lady Rurichiyo.

208
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,702
We must get you to safety.

209
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,002
-But he-- huh?

210
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:57,636
ICHIGO: Bankai!

211
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:13,036
Tensa Zangetsu.

212
00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:19,069
-Who is that?

213
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:22,569
Is he a Soul Reaper?

214
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:23,569
-No.

215
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:24,902
He's a substitute.

216
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:25,569
Ichigo Kurosaki.

217
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:41,619
-You're in my way!

218
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,485
Argh!

219
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,452
-Ichigo.

220
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:56,485
-Rukia?

221
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,519
-Why are you using
your Bankai and raising

222
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,552
your spiritual
pressure so recklessly?

223
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:04,785
-But those guys
down there-- huh?

224
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:06,152
-What's the matter?

225
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,919
-There were two strange Soul
Reapers down there, and a kid.

226
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:11,352
Where'd they disappear to?

227
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:12,985
-Don't worry about them.

228
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,819
We have to take care
of these guys first.

229
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:20,019
-Here we go again.

230
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:22,719
-Ichigo!

231
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:24,185
-Why are they here?

232
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:26,352
-It's starting to become
embarrassing that you still

233
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:28,285
can't control your
spiritual pressure.

234
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:29,552
-Let's make this quick.

235
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:31,719
We have to get back before
our next class starts.

236
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,419
-Thanks for helping out.

237
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:43,085
Those arrows are
handy for wiping out

238
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,585
large numbers of Hollows.

239
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:46,585
They're like a pesticide.

240
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:51,085
-I didn't come all this way just
to be insulted by you, Ichigo.

241
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:53,819
There were spiritual pressure
that I didn't recognize.

242
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:54,852
-Yeah.

243
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:57,452
I saw them, but just
for a few minutes.

244
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,252
-It seemed they used
some sort of bait

245
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:01,185
to lure those Hollows here.

246
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:02,919
-Hollow bait?

247
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:06,385
-Was it anything like that
kind of bait you used before?

248
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,985
-The composition's
probably different,

249
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,119
but the potency's the same.

250
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:14,885
-Did anybody see which
direction they went?

251
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,585
-No.

252
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:18,219
They disappeared.

253
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:19,652
-What were they
here for, anyway?

254
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:27,685
[beeping]

255
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:28,152
-Wow.

256
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:30,619
A princess?

257
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:33,885
-Ichigo said she spoke to
him like a princess, anyway.

258
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,319
-That's right.

259
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:36,752
-A princess.

260
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:39,552
-I mean, she was
bossy like a princess,

261
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,319
but not very lady like.

262
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,019
She kept screaming
about being hungry,

263
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:44,685
and ordered to me to feed her.

264
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:47,519
-Sounds like she
was patronizing you.

265
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:50,885
-A princess who'd make
Ichigo look silly.

266
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,385
Wait.

267
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:52,519
I got it.

268
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:55,452
Did she wear a revealing
black leather outfit,

269
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:59,585
with spiky black patent leather
boots, with lots of weapons?

270
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:03,152
And did she say something
like, who's hungry?

271
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:04,519
Me, that's who.

272
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,885
Like that?

273
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,885
-Orihime, that doesn't
sound like a princess.

274
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,519
It sounds like a dominatrix.

275
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:11,919
ICHIGO: This conversation
is ridiculous.

276
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,719
What are you fooling
with over there, Rukia?

277
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,052
-This?

278
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:17,952
I'm researching those two
Soul Reapers and the princess

279
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:21,952
you saw, but so far no luck.

280
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:25,919
[beeping]

281
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,385
-OK, enough already!

282
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:34,852
That beeping is so
damn irritating!

283
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:37,319
-You're pretty
irritating, yourself.

284
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:39,485
Soul Reapers have to pass
through the Senkaimon

285
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,452
to enter the world
of the living,

286
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,985
so there should be a record
of all such passages,

287
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:46,385
which I can access.

288
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:47,219
Argh.

289
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:49,885
This manual is so hard to read.

290
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,319
-Leave it to me, sister.

291
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:54,519
There hasn't been a manual
written yet that I can't read.

292
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:57,785
I happen to be known as the
world's number one manual

293
00:14:57,819 --> 00:14:58,652
reader.

294
00:14:58,685 --> 00:14:59,185
-What?

295
00:14:59,219 --> 00:14:59,919
No way.

296
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:01,285
-Shut up.

297
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:03,285
I was created by the department
of research and development,

298
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,385
so don't take me lightly.

299
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:06,152
-OK.

300
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:07,252
Give it a try.

301
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,019
-My please.

302
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:13,619
I'm finally back in heaven.

303
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:14,452
RUKIA: Hey.

304
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:15,785
-Huh?

305
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:16,419
-Well?

306
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:17,219
-Heh, heh.

307
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:17,885
Oh, yeah.

308
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,385
Right.

309
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:22,185
Hm?

310
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:23,152
Mm.

311
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:25,085
I don't know.

312
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:33,452
[groan]

313
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:34,319
-Hey.

314
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:35,052
Ichigo!

315
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:35,552
-Huh?

316
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,285
Now what?

317
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:38,252
-They're moving.

318
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:40,052
-The neighbor already moved out.

319
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:41,719
The truck left this morning.

320
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:43,085
-Moving in, not out.

321
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:46,585
A Gigai's moving in.

322
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:48,385
-Huh?

323
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,652
-Be careful with those boxes.

324
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:50,319
They're fragile.

325
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:51,552
ICHIGO: That guy!

326
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:54,485
-Wait for me.

327
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,285
-Please just put all
of the furniture right

328
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,852
in the middle of
the living room.

329
00:15:57,885 --> 00:15:59,585
I'll arrange it
all myself later.

330
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:01,119
-Hey!

331
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,752
Hey, you.

332
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:04,085
-Well, Well.

333
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:07,352
If it isn't the little low
life from the other day.

334
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:08,119
What do you want?

335
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:09,385
-Don't give me that.

336
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,385
Who the hell are you guys?

337
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:14,685
-I'm not obligated to answer
any of your questions.

338
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,085
-What was that?

339
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:18,619
You're the one responsible for
luring all those Hollows here,

340
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:19,285
aren't you?

341
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,585
-Not me.

342
00:16:20,619 --> 00:16:23,185
In fact, I have no idea what
you're even talking about.

343
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:24,419
-Don't kid around.

344
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:25,185
RURICHIYO: Ichigo!

345
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:26,619
-Huh?

346
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,085
-It is Ichigo.

347
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,252
Good of you to come.

348
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:33,252
Thank you for offering
your greetings.

349
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,252
-Is that the princess?

350
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:35,919
-Yeah.

351
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:37,085
Hey, wait a minute!

352
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,785
I never told you my name.

353
00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:40,619
How did you know it?

354
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:43,519
-Ever hear of a little
thing called research?

355
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:44,685
-Look, you--

356
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,385
-Insolent fool.

357
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:49,385
Isn't it obvious that there
is a whole world of difference

358
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:51,952
separating us and
the likes of you?

359
00:16:51,985 --> 00:16:54,552
-Huh?

360
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:58,619
-If I have further use for
you, you'll be contacted.

361
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:01,185
Lady Rurichiyo, it
will be dark soon.

362
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:02,452
-Huh?

363
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:05,952
-Hollows, like those from
earlier today, may appear.

364
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:08,952
Please return to the
mansion immediately.

365
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:09,752
-Very well.

366
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:11,185
I guess that's for the best.

367
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:14,619
See you again, Ichigo!

368
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:16,652
-His name should be Byakuya.

369
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,319
-My brother's not like him.

370
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:20,285
-Hey!

371
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,885
I'm not don't
talking to you yet.

372
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:26,019
-Ah!

373
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:27,419
Gah!

374
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:28,385
Hey, you!

375
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:30,919
Don't you put up
a barrier on me!

376
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:31,585
Hey!

377
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,219
I'm talking to you!

378
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,352
Damn him.

379
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:36,085
-Don't exhaust yourself.

380
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,719
We don't know who he is, but
his Bakudo sure is impressive.

381
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,519
I've got to get going.

382
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:43,585
-No, don't go without me!

383
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:44,219
Please, wait!

384
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:45,519
Take me with you!

385
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:46,085
-Quiet!

386
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,419
We're outside!

387
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:49,819
-No!

388
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:51,319
I can't tell you that.

389
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:52,785
No!

390
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:53,919
Trade secret.

391
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:54,552
Sorry.

392
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:56,352
I can't tell you.

393
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:58,085
-I already know it's true.

394
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,385
Admit it, that we definitely
a Gigai from your place.

395
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:06,985
-As I said, it's a trade secret.

396
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,752
I cannot answer you.

397
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:12,285
[groan]

398
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,285
-Tea?

399
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,319
-If we can't tell you,
we can't tell you.

400
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:17,652
There.

401
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:20,785
After all, we're the ones
who'll get scolded by the boss.

402
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:22,119
-Where's Urahara, then?

403
00:18:22,152 --> 00:18:23,552
I'll ask him.

404
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:25,219
-I'm not sure where he went.

405
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:27,819
He's been gone for
the past few days.

406
00:18:27,852 --> 00:18:32,619
But I'll be sure to tell him you
stopped by for a little chat.

407
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:34,052
Let's go, Ururu.

408
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:35,052
-Wait for me, Jinta.

409
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:47,528
-Hey, Ichigo!

410
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:50,395
Those guys are all
done moving in.

411
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:51,162
Huh?

412
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:52,162
What are you waiting for?

413
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:53,328
Aren't you going?

414
00:18:53,362 --> 00:18:53,962
-Naw.

415
00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:55,362
-What do you mean?

416
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:57,662
This might be your only chance.

417
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:00,595
If you change into a Soul
Reaper, you can go down there

418
00:19:00,628 --> 00:19:02,195
and break the barrier.

419
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,962
-Naw, it's OK.

420
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:05,728
-I can't believe this!

421
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:08,162
Do you know how much time
I've wasted keeping watch?

422
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:09,295
You sick, or something?

423
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:09,828
YUZU: Ichigo!

424
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:10,795
Dinner time!

425
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:12,562
-Ah!

426
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:13,962
Hey!

427
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:14,795
-Cam down.

428
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:17,028
I said it's all right.

429
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:19,295
-So you're telling me that
all that worrying I did

430
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:21,128
was for nothing?

431
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:21,628
It's dark!

432
00:19:25,928 --> 00:19:27,228
KENRYU: Lady Rurichiyo?

433
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:29,004
Lady--

434
00:19:58,538 --> 00:19:59,095
Shh.

435
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:03,095
Lady Rurichiyo is asleep.

436
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:06,895
Don't start crying just because
you were late with her meal.

437
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:08,462
I wouldn't worry about it.

438
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:14,762
Enryu.

439
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:18,528
You saw it today,
too, didn't you?

440
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:23,028
Substitute Soul Reaper
Ichigo Kurosaki.

441
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:27,128
His skill and power are genuine.

442
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:29,462
I'm sure he'll be able
to go up against them.

443
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:34,328
Coming to the
world of the living

444
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:35,795
was the best choice, after all.

445
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:40,262
-What?

446
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:43,095
The princess moved in next door?

447
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:44,995
Did you get to see
her too, Rukia?

448
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:46,928
-Yes, but I couldn't
get close to her

449
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:49,162
because she had
these two bodyguards.

450
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:49,995
-Oh.

451
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:52,128
She has bodyguards, too?

452
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:53,295
She's the real deal.

453
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:55,295
-So then, did you
find out anything?

454
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:56,495
-Naw.

455
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:58,662
They put up a barrier, and
haven't come out since.

456
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:00,995
-And you're just sitting
here doing nothing.

457
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:01,695
-Uryu?

458
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,595
You're here?

459
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,595
-You continue to amaze me.

460
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:06,062
-They're up to something.

461
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:08,895
That much is pretty
damn obvious.

462
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:13,228
Sooner or later, they're
going to come meddling.

463
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:16,495
-OK, take your seats, everyone.

464
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:19,062
All the students
are present today.

465
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:20,062
Good.

466
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:22,528
First I have an
exciting announcement.

467
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:25,528
We have new transfer
students joining us today.

468
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:28,428
And get this, there's
three of them.

469
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:30,262
Well, come on in, please.

470
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:41,028
-Huh.

471
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:45,962
-What is that?

472
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:46,995
-A giant?

473
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:48,662
-That girl has to
be in grade school.

474
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:50,095
-Two adults and a child?

475
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,962
-I am Kenryu.

476
00:21:54,995 --> 00:21:58,328
On my left is Enryu.

477
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:01,362
And so my right,
let me present--

478
00:22:01,395 --> 00:22:02,795
-Ahem.

479
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:06,362
I am Rurichiyo Kasumioji.

480
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:07,362
Pleased to meet you!

481
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:07,862
-Huh?

482
00:22:16,473 --> 00:22:20,340
[theme music]

483
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,650
ICHIGO: Was it
Kisuke who arranged

484
00:23:48,683 --> 00:23:50,383
for those guys to
move next door to me?

485
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:52,450
TESSAI: That is a trade secret.

486
00:23:52,483 --> 00:23:54,150
ICHIGO: Who arranged
the school transfer?

487
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,783
TESSAI: Trade secret.

488
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:58,417
ICHIGO: And why is Rurichiyo's
uniform so loose on her?

489
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,050
TESSAI: Blame that
on the boss's taste.

490
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:03,583
ICHIGO: He has really
hardcore taste.
