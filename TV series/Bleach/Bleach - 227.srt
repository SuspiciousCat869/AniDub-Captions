MIZUIRO KOJIMA
(VOICEOVER): Spring, a time

00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:14,800
when everyone sets off for
new places with their hearts

3

full of hope-- that's spring.

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,233
But the hope in my
heart had died long ago,

5
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:25,666
and not even the magic of
the season could revive it.

MIZUIRO'S MOTHER
(ON PHONE): Mizuiro,

7
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,600
why are you calling me again?

8
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:30,866
Didn't you hear a
word I had last night?

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,166
I specifically remember telling
you that I have a very busy day

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,066
today, and I don't
have time to talk.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,033
This is so like you, always
thinking of yourself.

12
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:41,700
You need to try putting
yourself in my shoes sometime.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,933
-Calling your mother again?

14
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,000
You're such a good son.

15
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,300
-I don't really have a mother.

16
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,533
I made her up.

17
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:01,033
-You know, you really
shouldn't talk like that.

18
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:03,433
You're going to make
your mother cry.

19
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:05,433
Here, your jacket.

20
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:11,533
It's your first day of
high school, isn't it?

21
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:13,466
Would you like me
to drop you off?

22
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:19,500
-Sure.

23
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,833
Thanks.

Come in, world!

00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:29,600
Are all of our cords
properly connected?

28
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:33,533
My world appears to
be spinning correctly.

Get out of bed already!

It's breakfast time!

Ichigo, what about
your breakfast?

00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:48,647
-Sorry, Yuzu.

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,947
I'll be back before noon.

I fried you an egg.

I have a moment of your time?

Please come in.

What can I do for you?

I'm impressed.

Wait.

If she's not here, why does
this room reek of liquor?

there's a lieutenants' meeting.

Looks like you haven't
even started yet.

How lucky.

seat while we wait.

-Oh, of course.

and wait for Rangiku?

those snacks, Yachiru.

some for the rest of us.

are like cannons

-Well, well.

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
The unimaginable has just
become a horrible reality!

165
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,347
-What's the matter?

166
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,313
-[groans] Our youth just ended.

167
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:37,013
-Hey, that's Mizuiro.

168
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:39,947
-Am I crazy, or is
Mizuiro kind of hot?

169
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,313
-He sure is.

170
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,980
-He's like, not pushy
or overly aggressive,

171
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:45,380
you know what I mean?

172
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:46,247
-Nothing bothers him.

173
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,247
I think that's so sweet.

174
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,247
-I know.

175
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,380
It's like he has
this healing quality.

176
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:53,580
[girls giggling]

177
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:55,580
MIZUIRO KOJIMA (VOICEOVER):
I don't feel driven,

178
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:59,580
because I don't have any
expectations, or any anger.

179
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:01,980
My smile is nothing
more than a pose.

180
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:05,913
I can give it to anyone,
anytime, anywhere.

181
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:15,580
ORIHIME INOUE: [humming]
Oh, this must be the room.

182
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:16,647
Let's see.

183
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,347
Where is Tatsuki?

184
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,513
TATSUKI ARISAWA: Think fast.

185
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:20,013
-Huh?

186
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:26,180
ENTIRE CLASS: Whoa.

187
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:29,013
STUDENT: Man, did you see that?

188
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:31,213
-Very good, Orihime.

189
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:34,080
-You'll never catch me
off guard again, Tatsuki.

190
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:37,280
-Good.

191
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:38,847
You passed the test.

192
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm impressed with how much
your reflexes have improved.

193
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:42,480
-Thanks to you.

194
00:10:42,513 --> 00:10:43,947
If you weren't such
a good teacher,

195
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,747
I never would have
learned anything.

196
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,747
But please stop with the
surprise attack test.

197
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,847
I'm worried you'll
scare everyone.

198
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,847
-[laughs]

199
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,847
-Oh, Zu.

200
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,347
[both screaming]

201
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,813
-[screams]

202
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:01,813
[crashing sound]

203
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:03,813
-Oh my gosh, are you all right?

204
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:04,613
I'm so sorry.

205
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:05,780
I don't even know your name.

206
00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:08,780
-(STAMMERING) It's a
pleasure to meet you.

207
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:13,847
I'm Chizuru Honsho, one of the
new students in this class.

208
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,947
-What'd you do that for, anyway?

209
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,647
Are you some kind of psychopath?

210
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,780
-Look who's talking!

211
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:21,047
What were you planning
on doing, sneaking up

212
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,847
on Orihime like that?

213
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,647
-Orihime-- that is the
loveliest name I've ever heard,

214
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,113
and so appropriate for
my lovely new Venus.

215
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,947
--[grunts] You need to back
off, you wacko airhead.

216
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,080
[screaming, crashing]

217
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:35,447
CHIZURU HONSHO:
That was nothing!

218
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,547
This violence will not
make my love waver!

219
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,913
TATSUKI ARISAWA: Oh yeah?

220
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,413
Then I'll show you some real
violence, you little pervert!

221
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:42,880
What do you think about that?

222
00:11:42,913 --> 00:11:43,880
Are you wavering yet?

223
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:45,380
How about this?

224
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,347
There's more where
that came from!

225
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:51,313
[weeping]

226
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,608
-Hey, come on.

227
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:55,108
Tell me what's the matter.

228
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:56,974
Did you see I brought
you some flowers again.

229
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,541
I picked them myself.

230
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:00,974
-Hey mommy, look.

231
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:03,274
That man over there is
talking to the flowers.

232
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:04,074
-Don't point.

233
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,441
I told you, it's not polite.

234
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,441
-What is it that's
making you so sad?

235
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:13,708
-It's just that
something's not right.

236
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:15,141
-Huh?

237
00:12:15,174 --> 00:12:19,008
-I'm afraid of the sky.

238
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,308
-The sky?

239
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:20,808
Why?

240
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:28,841
YUZU KUROSAKI: Hey Karin, what
are you just standing there

241
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:29,974
for?

242
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:32,541
We're going to be
late for school.

243
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:33,441
-[groans]

244
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:34,541
-What's wrong?

245
00:12:34,574 --> 00:12:36,308
Is it going to start
raining or something?

246
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:37,708
-Uh, I don't know.

247
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:39,541
There's something
strange about the sky.

248
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:41,974
I know that sounds weird,
but it seems heavy somehow.

249
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:44,141
--[gasps] You think it has
something to do with that

250
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:45,608
spooky old ghost again?

251
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:48,408
-What, you mean that ghost
who's standing right behind you?

252
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:49,108
-What?

253
00:12:49,141 --> 00:12:49,874
You're kidding, right?

254
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:50,374
Where?

255
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:02,198
NANAO ISE: Next, we need
to discuss the replacement

256
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:05,965
of the soul monitoring officer
stationed at the 3,600th access

257
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:08,365
on the world of the living.

258
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:10,331
The position is
currently being occupied

259
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:11,531
by a member of Squad Four.

260
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:13,631
But due to chronic back
pain, he has been out

261
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,198
on extended sick leave.

262
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:17,298
-Ah, a good swift kick
in the ass and that guy

263
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,165
will be back on his
feet in no time.

264
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,031
-Back pain is serious business.

265
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:23,365
We need to give him time
to rest and recover.

266
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:24,898
-Lieutenant Sasakibe?

267
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,231
-Yes?

268
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,498
-I would like to recommend
Rukia Kuchiki from our squad.

269
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:29,398
-Hmm.

270
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:30,498
Your reasons?

271
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:33,231
-Sir, Captain Ukitake
and I discussed it.

272
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:35,065
He feels Rukia would
benefit greatly

273
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:37,031
from being stationed as
an officer on the world

274
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:39,931
of the living, and gain much
needed experience as a Soul

275
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:40,865
Reaper.

276
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:41,898
-Interesting.

277
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:43,998
So it's Captain
Ukitake's recommendation?

278
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:44,865
-Yes, sir.

279
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:47,331
-Hmm.

280
00:13:47,365 --> 00:13:48,931
I'm going to approve this.

281
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:53,631
Rukia Kuchiki of Squad 13
will be the replacement.

282
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:55,398
Proceed to the next matter.

283
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:56,498
-Yes, sir.

284
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,631
As you know, we've been
looking for someone

285
00:13:58,665 --> 00:14:01,365
to fill the vacant lieutenant's
position is Squad Six.

286
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:03,631
The captains held a meeting
to address this matter,

287
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:06,431
and they've chosen Renji
Abarai, 6th Seat of Squad 11,

288
00:14:06,465 --> 00:14:07,398
to fill the position.

289
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,565
LIEUTENANTS: Huh?

290
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,065
-Huh?

291
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,398
That punk?

292
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,198
What a loser.

293
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:13,565
I can't believe
they think someone

294
00:14:13,598 --> 00:14:15,665
like that is
lieutenant material.

295
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:19,131
All that jerk'll do is scar
the name of the 13 Court Guard

296
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:20,531
Squads.

297
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:23,065
--[laughs] Then you'll fit right
in, because your bald head has

298
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:24,865
a scar on it too.

299
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:25,431
Whoa!

300
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,298
-Cut that out!

301
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:27,065
That's not a scar!

302
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,465
And quit calling me bald!

303
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:33,731
-You mean I'm being transferred?

304
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:34,665
To where?

305
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:35,665
-No, that's not it.

306
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:37,131
We're not talking
about transferring

307
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,198
you or anything as
extreme as that.

308
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:41,698
We're just sending you to
the world of the living,

309
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:44,398
just like that mission you
and I went on together.

310
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:47,498
You know, that was back when
you had first joined the squad.

311
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:49,531
You remember that, right?

312
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:50,898
-Uh, actually, I--

313
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,865
-You see?

314
00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:53,265
She doesn't even remember going.

315
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:55,898
The experience was
so bad, she probably

316
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:57,165
erased it from her memory.

317
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:58,665
Right, Rukia?

318
00:14:58,698 --> 00:14:59,665
-Well, uh--

319
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,431
-Argh!

320
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:01,631
Keep quiet!

321
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:03,965
Nobody asked you, so
why don't you just go

322
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:05,531
stick your head in
the sand somewhere!

323
00:15:05,565 --> 00:15:06,898
-Oh yeah?

324
00:15:06,931 --> 00:15:09,198
What do you think I am, some
kind of ostrich or something?

325
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:10,698
-Please stop.

326
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:11,831
[arguing continues]

327
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:14,098
-Your new post is in a
four-kilometer radius

328
00:15:14,131 --> 00:15:17,398
around Karakura Town, and
it's just for one month.

329
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:19,431
With your skills,
it should be easy.

330
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:20,798
I'm sure you can
handle it, Rukia.

331
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,065
-[gasps] Captain Ukitake!

332
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:23,931
-Oh-- Captain!

333
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,065
-You shouldn't be out, sir.

334
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,365
You need your rest.

335
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:29,465
-Well, that's kind of you,
but I'm feeling good today.

336
00:15:29,498 --> 00:15:32,098
Even though this is just a
month-long assignment, Rukia,

337
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,598
I thought you might be a little
anxious about being sent out

338
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:36,498
on your own for the first time.

339
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:39,165
So I came to see you off.

340
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:40,598
-Thank you, Captain.

341
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:41,798
-Please, Rukia.

342
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:43,398
It's nothing, really.

343
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:46,031
Have you told Byakuya yet?

344
00:15:46,065 --> 00:15:47,365
-Uh, of course.

345
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:53,631
I mean-- not yet.

346
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:56,531
Captain Kuchiki hates
it when I bother him

347
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:58,898
with every little detail.

348
00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:02,998
[sighs] So I was going to
leave without saying anything

349
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:03,931
to him about it.

350
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:09,131
-I see.

351
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:10,498
It's all right.

352
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:12,031
If that's what you
really want to do,

353
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:14,098
then I support your decision.

354
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:16,731
I'll tell Byakuya for you.

355
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:18,665
So go with a clear conscience.

356
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:23,165
-[gasps] Thank you, Captain.

357
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,431
I hereby promote Squad
11 6th Seat Renji Abarai

358
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:31,731
to the position of
Lieutenant of Squad Six.

359
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:34,565
Congratulations,
Lieutenant Abarai.

360
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:35,531
-Yes, thanks.

361
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:38,365
Uh, I mean, it is an honor.

362
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,165
I humbly accept, Lieutenant.

363
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:43,298
-You don't have to do so
formal with me, Renji.

364
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:45,765
-Well, are you happy, Renji?

365
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,898
With a promotion
like this, you've

366
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:50,465
gotten yourself one step
closer to Captain Kuchiki

367
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:51,831
and his sister.

368
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:53,565
-What do you mean?

369
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:55,765
-Isn't it about time
you talked to her?

370
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:58,431
-When are you going to get over
your insecurity with Rukia?

371
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:59,965
I mean, come on, Renji.

372
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:01,831
Even though she's
some kind of royalty,

373
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:04,565
you can approach her, now
that you're a lieutenant.

374
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:07,065
You haven't spoken for 40 years.

375
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:10,198
Don't you think it's about time
you patched things up with her?

376
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:13,131
-If you want to do that, then
I suggest that you hurry.

377
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,365
Rukia's just been assigned
a month-long station

378
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:18,331
in the world of the living, and
she's scheduled to leave soon.

379
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:19,565
-Oh no!

380
00:17:19,598 --> 00:17:21,565
You've got to hurry up, Renji!

381
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:23,565
-No.

382
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:26,565
I won't be officially promoted
until the ceremony a month

383
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:27,331
from now anyway.

384
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:33,265
So I'll wait until after that.

385
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:35,131
I'll surprise her
when she comes back,

386
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:36,965
and tell her that I've
been made lieutenant.

goodbye, cruel world.

have to happen?

This can't be happening!

This is like some kind
of horrible nightmare

that just keeps getting
worse and worse!

00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:31,298
How is it you're so
well-informed about all

00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:33,398
these juvenile delinquents?

You a friend of
Ichigo's or something?

415

-No, no, no, not me.

00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:44,498
I've never seen or met the
guy before today, honestly.

-Mizuiro!

-That's Kiego Asano.

438
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:22,598
He doesn't do too
well in school,

but he's a pretty smart
guy-- honest, likable, loyal.

at making up excuses?

You've got five minutes to come
up with something creative,

461
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,865
I think we're all
connected to this world

462

with countless cords.

want them, we're

terrified to remove
even one cord.

But the truth is, no
matter what we do,

sometimes it's just too hard
to maintain a connection.

to reattach the cord to
its original location.

I've got too much work, so
would you mind taking my camera

484
00:23:49,747 --> 00:23:51,980
and getting some pictures
for the Seireitei bulletin?

485
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,880
RENJI ABARAI: Of Rangiku
in a swimsuit, right?

486
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:55,613
TOSHIRO HITSUGAYA:

487
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:57,413
RENJI ABARAI: You mean
you don't want them?

488
00:23:57,447 --> 00:23:58,880
TOSHIRO HITSUGAYA:
Please get them.

00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:02,413
RENJI ABARAI: Should've
just said so from the start.
