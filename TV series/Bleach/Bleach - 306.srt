Don't tell me you really

It's hopeless!

Hyaaaahh!

00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:18,521
So what do you mean by that?

7
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:22,354
Take a look at this world!

8
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:28,621
<i>This world of yours used</i>
<i>to be full of hope,</i>
<i>filled with skyscrapers!</i>

9
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:31,921
Now it looks like the
rundown small town it is!

10

<i>This place has</i>
<i>sunk to a new low!</i>

11
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:46,854
The rain that continued to fall
on this world has subsided, but
now everything has submerged
itself into this ocean!

12
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:51,854
<i>And this all happened</i>
<i>because you lost hope and</i>
<i>stopped moving forward!</i>

00:02:58,654 --> 00:02:59,687
Augh!

14
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:06,321
I cannot leave you like this.
I know what has to happen.

15
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:09,421
I will rip out the
root of your despair!

It's been a long time, Ichigo.

18
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:32,954
What's with that look of yours?

19
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:36,154
Don't act like you
don't know me!

20
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,954
What? You again?

21
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:44,521
Heh.

22
00:03:45,554 --> 00:03:46,654
But how?

23
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,954
[Ichigo]
I watched you disappear after I
defeated you in our last fight!

24
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:58,687
Huh. So, did you forget?

25
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:07,854
I warned you. The only way
you could really control
me was to stay alive.

26
00:04:08,487 --> 00:04:11,721
At least until the
next time I showed up!

27
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,454
[gasp]
Damn!

28
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:20,687
And all this time,
I thought I had
destroyed you for good.

29
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:24,687
Oh really? Well,
too bad for you.

30
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:29,321
So what's up with the new look?
It looks ridiculous on you.

31
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:36,554
That's right. This is
your first time seeing
this form isn't it?

32
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:38,821
Hunh?!

33
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:42,287
This is exactly how you
looked when you defeated
Ulquiorra Shiffer.

[gasp]

35

I looked like he does?

36
00:04:57,454 --> 00:05:02,087
That's right. This form
is the manifestation of
your greatest fear.

37
00:05:02,354 --> 00:05:08,354
You feared letting your soul be
consumed by your destructive
impulse to become a monster.

38
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:12,921
<i>It's what prevented</i>
<i>you from Hollowfying.</i>

39
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:16,954
So then,

40
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:19,287
What is it that you
want me to do here?

41
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,954
Am I supposed to fight this
guy now and defeat him?!

42
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:27,654
No.

43
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:32,454
He is not the opponent that
you will fight against.

44
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,321
You will fight us....

45
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:35,321
...as one.

46
00:05:43,354 --> 00:05:44,654
Now what?!

47
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:49,687
I don't understand.
What's happening?!

48
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:00,254
This,

49
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:02,287
Is our true form, Ichigo.

50
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:04,654
We are the same.

That's quite impressive.

See ya!

157
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:16,687
<i>Who could she be?</i>
<i>Is she a friend of Ichigo's?</i>
<i>Their kimonos look similar.</i>

158
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:19,421
She's so beautiful.

159
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:23,887
<i>That stupid Ichigo.</i>
<i>He never even</i>
<i>mentioned her to me.</i>

160
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:30,754
<i>When you said you</i>
<i>"made it in time",</i>
<i>did you mean in time</i>
<i>to save those humans?</i>

161
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:36,221
<i>Or were you referring to</i>
<i>seeing me destroy Karakura</i>
<i>Town and creating the Ouken?</i>

162
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:40,287
Well, whatever the reason,
you were wrong.

163
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,921
What is it? Do you find it
difficult to speak to me?

164
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:47,487
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>Captain Aizen.</i>

165
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:51,054
Please excuse my
former colleague.

166
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:54,054
I'll get her out of
your sight immediately.

167
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:56,854
I really don't mind.
I'm in no hurry.

168
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:59,521
You can talk with
her right here, gin.

169
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:00,854
But I insist!

170
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:02,121
It's fine, really.

171
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:09,721
Well, well.

172
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:15,521
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>He is always such</i>
<i>an amusing child.</i>

173
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,963
[panting]

174
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:30,196
You arched your body
at the last second.
A useless effort.

175
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:33,496
[panting]

176
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:38,163
<i>He's strong.</i>
<i>And his speed is incredible!</i>

177
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:43,763
[Ichigo]
I couldn't react fast enough to
block with my Zanpakuto.

178
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:52,496
Eyagh!

179
00:14:53,963 --> 00:14:56,129
Now you see the
difference in our power.

180
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,396
You think you can force
anything out of me?!

181
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:01,763
Don't make me laugh!!

182
00:15:02,963 --> 00:15:03,729
Hyaaahh!

183
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,729
You won't get away!

184
00:15:07,796 --> 00:15:09,396
You need to shut up!

185
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,963
Whatever it takes, I
will get it out of you!

186
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:20,763
That's enough!

187
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:24,296
What the hell?!

188
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:32,363
Now! You will disappear
from this world of yours!

189
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:35,996
Yaahh!

190
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,163
Let go of me!

191
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,329
You seem pretty worn down.
Why'd you come?

192
00:15:57,763 --> 00:16:02,796
I lost track of your
Spiritual Pressure,
so I took the Senkaimon
to get the jump on you.

193
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:07,696
After all, I had a better feel
for where the real Karakura
Town had been transported!

194
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:10,796
I'm not asking how you
happened to get here.

195
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:16,163
I want to understand why
you would bother coming
here when you're in such
a weak condition.

196
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:17,729
Ugh.

197
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:22,896
You don't know?

198
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:25,196
Because you're here.

199
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:30,096
Finally, I can
ask you directly.

200
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:35,363
Tell me. Why did you choose
to go to work for Aizen?

201
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:45,129
Answer me! Why on earth did
you go and betray Izuru?
You betrayed his trust in you!

202
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:53,763
Is that really what
you want to know?

203
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:54,696
Huh?

204
00:16:55,763 --> 00:16:58,163
You're upset that
I betrayed Izuru?

205
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:01,563
Sounds to me like,
you're really talking
about yourself.

206
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:08,296
That's a shame.
You really should've
stayed where you were.

207
00:17:15,163 --> 00:17:16,696
Oh, Rangiku.

208
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:22,696
You're a pain.

209
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:34,729
<i>Damn!!</i>

210
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:36,729
<i>What's he thinking?</i>

211
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:38,863
<i>Why is he trying to kick</i>
<i>me out of this world?!</i>

212
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:40,729
<i>I don't have</i>
<i>time for this!</i>

213
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:51,563
Kheh.

214
00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:55,729
Getsuga
Tensho!

215
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:05,396
So you're back again.

216
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:06,896
Yeah, sorry!

217
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:09,896
But you should know I
don't give up that easily.

218
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:12,596
So I'm going to be
here a little longer!

219
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:15,363
"A little longer"?

220
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:18,929
Yeah! So what do you say we
get this party started!

221
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:23,096
I'm bringing all I've got!

222
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:28,496
Hyaaaaa!!

223
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:34,596
Hraaaaaah!!

224
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:44,763
What's changed in you?

225
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:45,963
Not sure.

226
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:48,529
But I'll tell ya,

227
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,363
My friends are counting on me!
I won't let them down!

228
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:01,963
[Tatsuki]
Okay Don Kanonji,
that's far enough.
Really. I can walk.

229
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:04,496
Oh no! You're much
too weak, girl!

230
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:05,763
I said...

231
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:07,263
Hm?!

232
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:08,329
I'm fine!!

233
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:16,663
You have got to
start paying better
attention when
people talk to you!

234
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:18,529
I hope I didn't
hurt your head.

235
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:19,763
[exasperated sigh]

236
00:19:19,796 --> 00:19:20,729
[Keigo]
Tatsuki!!

237
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,129
<i>[Tatsuki]</i>
<i>Keigo!!</i>
<i>I told you to run away!</i>

238
00:19:25,996 --> 00:19:28,696
What's with you?!
And where did you
get that sword?

239
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:32,763
I saw Afro Dude lying
in a heap back there,
so I borrowed his sword!

240
00:19:33,196 --> 00:19:36,863
I've never done kendo or
anything, but I figure it's
better than having nothing!

241
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:38,263
Who's Afro Dude?

242
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:40,763
I'll explain later.
Anyway let's get going!

243
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:43,129
So where's Chizuru? And
Mizuiro?!

244
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:45,896
When you left, didn't
you go looking for him?!

245
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:49,096
I found Mizuiro!
He's over there!

246
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:52,896
Chizuru's with him, too!
Now's not the time for
questions, Tatsuki!

247
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:55,063
We have to go now!...

248
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:58,196
I feel that guy's presence.
I sense him closing in on
us as we speak!!

249
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:24,063
[White Zangetsu]
So "everyone's waiting for you"?

250
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:28,363
<i>That may be important</i>
<i>to you, but it's really</i>
<i>of no concern to me.</i>

251
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:31,929
It's clear that's
how you think.
You've told me
all that before.

252
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:36,763
What happens to what you want to
protect is no concern of mine.

253
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:42,129
What you want to protect,
Ichigo, is not the same thing
that I want to protect!

254
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:43,496
But here's how I see it.

255
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:45,963
What I want to protect
has never changed.

256
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:50,363
It may be very different
than what concerns you,
but that's not the issue!

257
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:54,096
I will protect whomever
I want to protect!

258
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,929
And that's what you'll
use Getsugatensho for?

259
00:20:56,963 --> 00:20:57,896
That's right!

260
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:04,196
<i>What's this?!</i>

261
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:08,896
<i>It's his sword.</i>
<i>Something's different!</i>

262
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:19,363
Here's a question, Ichigo.
Earlier you said something.

263
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:23,363
If I keep knocking you down,
You'll keep getting up.

264
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:26,496
Right. So what are
you getting at?

265
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,596
Very well.

266
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:34,063
Then allow me to test you!

267
00:21:34,096 --> 00:21:35,896
I'm ready!!

268
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:37,529
Haaaaa!!

269
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,363
Hyaaaaaaa!

270
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:54,596
[panting]

271
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:04,496
[Isshin]
Hurry...

272
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:05,996
Ichigo!

273
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:48,604
[Keigo]
Quick Tatsuki!
We have to run!

274
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:51,104
<i>[Tatsuki]</i>
<i>But where can we go?!</i>
<i>He's going to catch us!</i>

275
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:51,770
Wait...

276
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:53,304
<i>You have a plan?</i>

277
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:56,304
To escape without a plan.
Such things can lead to love.

278
00:23:56,337 --> 00:24:00,604
As the two continue
their escape, they soon
find themselves in love
with each other and--

279
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:01,737
<i>[Tatsuki]</i>
<i>[punch] Die.</i>
