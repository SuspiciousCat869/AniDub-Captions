RUKIA KUCHIKI NARRATING: We
stand in awe before that which

00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:13,973
cannot be seen.

6
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:19,473
And we respect with every fiber
that which cannot be explained.

00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:32,839
-I sense strange
spirit energy close by.

00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,139
-You got a death wish, pal?

9
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:47,506
Nobody jumps one of
my boys for no reason

10
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:48,739
and lives to tell about it.

-Are you crazy?

-No way I'm taking
on that psycho.

-Now listen up you pond scum!

I guess somebody
left those flowers

for some kid who
got killed here.

That vase over there.

Why is it lying on its side?

00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:30,139
-I guess one of us
knocked it over when

we were skateboarding
through here.

coming to my defense.

It's the least I could do.

ICHIGO KUROSAKI NARRATING:
My name is Ichigo Kurosaki.

54
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:15,573
I'm 15 years old, so I'm
a high school student.

55
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:18,406
My family runs a medical
clinic here in town.

56
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,806
Maybe it's because
we're entrusted

57
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,473
with the lives of the
living-- I'm not sure--

58
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:24,373
but for as long
as I can remember,

59
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:26,873
I've been able to see the
souls of the dearly departed.

Always stay alert
when you enter a room

64
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:38,439
and you're late
for dinner again.

65
00:04:38,473 --> 00:04:39,706
-Come on!

66
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,806
Is that any way to welcome
your own son after he just

67
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,206
risked his life to help
a spirit find peace!

-Silence!

Oh, so it's the ghost's
fault now, is it?

00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:49,639
I suppose it was ghost
that left your room a mess.

When are you going to
show some discipline?

Just because you see
ghosts and I don't doesn't

73
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:56,406
make you boss of this household.

For any normal, healthy
high school kid,

84
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:13,973
the 7 o'clock curfew
is totally uncool.

-Ichigo, speaking of
uncool. you have a new one.

you been there?

You damn pest.

Poor Ichigo.

Dad or ghost, it's
always something.

-I think he's kind of lucky
to be able to see ghosts.

00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:35,339
I sort of sense their presence
sometimes, but that's about it.

-I don't see what the
big deal is with ghosts.

I don't even believe in them.

96
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,973
-[gasp] Karin, I don't get
how you can say something like

97
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:43,173
that.

98
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:45,473

power to see spirits, too.

Just seeing them doesn't
make me believe in them.

-Brr.

103
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:54,806
That's really cold.

KARIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, he said
he's seeing more spirits lately

than ever before.

ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN): What?

121
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,506
Why would he talk about
these things with you

122
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,139
two instead of coming
to his own dad?

-Wha--?

-For one thing, you're over 40.

127
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:36,839
And for another,
emotionally, you're

128
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:38,673
still at a preschool level, Dad.

129
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:39,306
Admit it.

130
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,339
-Oh, my dear wife.

131
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:41,973
Maybe it's because
they're hitting puberty,

132
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:45,173
but our daughters are being
so cold to me. (CRYING)

What do I do?

What do I do?

Hurry!

00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:07,139
-What is that thing?

00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:08,139
-I don't know.

00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:10,139
-Oh!

00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:11,639
-Come on!

-What was that?

00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:51,773
-Look at that.

-The sidewalk's burned.

another explosion.

186
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:24,616
I can't make any sense of
what happened out there today.

187
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,016
-Huh?

188
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,183
What the hell are
you doing here?

-Ah!

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,116
Put that thing away!

You're not slicing me up!

00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,650
Hey.

193
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:54,850
RUKIA KUCHIKI (VOICE):
It's getting closer.

194
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:56,383
-I feel it.

[gasp]

you're not a very good one.

199
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,316
For starters, you
shouldn't talk to yourself.

200
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,516
You kicked me.

201
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,983
But I can't be seen
by ordinary humans.

202
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:10,416
Are you saying you can see me?

203
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,150
-Well, considering
that that was my foot

204
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:16,083
I just planted in your
behind, you tell me.

205
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,983
-You were the one I
saw in town earlier.

206
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,016
I remember.

207
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,883
-Boy, nothing gets by you.

208
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,316
-How very strange.

209
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,183
You look normal, but you must
be defective in some way.

210
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:27,616
-I'll show you defective.

211
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:32,383
[grunts] Who are you?

212
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,183
-You want to know?

213
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:36,516
Then I'll tell you.

214
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,683
I'm a Soul Reaper.

215
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,016
-Oh, no.

216
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,850
Not again.

00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,016
[gasping]

218
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,450
-All right.

219
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,416
So you are something
called a Soul Reaper.

220
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,783
-Mhm.

221
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:03,916
-And you're telling me that
you were sent here on a mission

222
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,116
by something called
the Soul Society.

223
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,516
-Mm.

224
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,850
-To deal with demons like the
one we saw on the street today.

225
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:10,883
-Mhm.

226
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,316
-Which was chasing
after that girl's soul.

227
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,616
-Mhm.

228
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,816
-That's all believable to
me-- along with flying pigs

229
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,983
and the tooth fairy!

230
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:18,550
-How dare you?

231
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,283
Why wouldn't you
believe in Soul Reapers

232
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:22,750
when you just admitted
you can see spirits?

233
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,283
-I've never seen or heard
of Soul Reapers before.

234
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:28,116
And frankly, your whole
story is just too incredible.

235
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,683
I don't believe in
anything I can't see.

236
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:32,950
-Well, you see me, don't you?

237
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,183
-Well, that's true.

238
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:36,083
And I'd agree with the
fact that you're not human.

239
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:38,516
But why don't you go play
your Soul Reaper games

240
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,483
somewhere else?

241
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:40,550
OK, little brat?

242
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,016
Now run along.

243
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,050
-I'm a brat, am I?

244
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,583
Bakudo number one.

245

Scythe!

00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:53,116
-[grunts] I can't move.

247
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,650
What did you do to me?

248
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:56,050
-Paralysis.

249
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,183
I've used what's
called a kido on you.

250
00:11:58,216 --> 00:12:01,683
It's a high-level incantation
only we Soul Reapers can cast.

251
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:03,616
It's useless to
struggle against it.

252
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,783
You're just wasting your energy.

253
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:09,216
I may appear young to you,
but I have lived nearly 10

254
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,550
of your life times.

255
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,783
I would kill you on the
spot for your insults

256
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,750
if it were not
against my orders.

257
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:17,483
So you, little
brat, be grateful.

258
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:18,483
-You've got nerve.

It's that ghost from yesterday.

264
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:30,983
-No.

265
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,016
Please don't.

266
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,550
I don't want to be
sent to the underworld.

267
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,316
-You needn't worry,
because you are

268
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,683
bound for a better
place-- the Soul Society.

269
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:44,450
There, your soul
will be at peace.

270
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:55,350
-Where'd he go?

271
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:58,250
What did you do to him?

272
00:12:58,283 --> 00:13:00,750
-I sent his spirit
to the Soul Society.

273
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:03,016
It's one of the main
responsibilities of a soul

274
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,150
reaper.

275
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:07,250
People here sometimes
call it "passing on."

276
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:09,283
Now I'll explain to
you why I'm here.

277
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:11,883
And I'll use small words,
so you can understand it.

278
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,183
There are two types of
spirits in this world.

279
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:18,250
-Huh?

280
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:19,250
RUKIA KUCHIKI (OFFSCREEN):
The first kind

281
00:13:19,283 --> 00:13:20,783
are the normal
spirits called Wholes.

282
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:23,983
The ghosts that you see
are usually this kind.

283
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:26,883
The second kind are evil
spirits known as Hollows.

284
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,316
The Hollows attack
people, living or dead,

285
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,516
in order to devour their souls.

286
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,616
Any questions before I go on?

287
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,850
-First of all, why do
your drawings suck so bad?

288
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,816
-Ah!

289
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,816
You'll pay for this.

290
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,716
-Let us continue with
our method, monsieur.

291
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,416
There are two main
jobs for Soul Reapers.

292
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,183
First, to lead Wholes to the
Soul Society through Konso,

293
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:56,516
as I just did.

294
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,316
Second, to exorcise the
Hollows wherever we find them.

295
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,950
ICHIGO KUROSAKI
(OFFSCREEN): The Hollow

296
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:02,816
with the bug body
this afternoon.

297
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,350
Why was it chasing that girl?

298
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:05,516
RUKIA KUCHIKI (OFFSCREEN):
That I don't know.

299
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,316
We have yet to fully
understand what

300
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,050
motivates the Hollows to
do the things they do.

303
00:14:16,616 --> 00:14:22,816
-[sniff] I can smell it--
an especially tasty soul.

304
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,350
It's nearby.

305
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,016
[sniff] Along with the
smell of a Soul Reaper.

306
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:40,383
-[gasp] What was that?

307
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,316
-One thing we do
know-- there is still

308
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,883
a second Hollow prowling
somewhere nearby.

309
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,816
-Then what the hell
are you waiting for?

310
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,083
Go out and kill it.

311
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:52,316
-I would, but I can't seem
to detect its location.

312
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,250
Usually, I have
no trouble finding

313
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:55,816
a Hollow that's close by.

314
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,083
But here it's as if
my sense are being

315
00:14:58,116 --> 00:14:59,383
jammed by some powerful force.

316
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,683
-What are you, deaf?

317
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:02,616
There's something huge
howling out there.

318
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,283
That sound has to be a Hollow.

319
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:06,483
-Something howling?

320
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:08,116
What do you mean?

321
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,916
[howling]

322
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,750
-[gasp] Now I hear it.

323
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:14,716
Definitely a Hollow.

324
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,116
-That's what I've
been telling you.

-That's Yuzu!

Hey, wait!

00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:22,350
Untie me!

330
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:25,316
-This spirit pressure is among
the strongest I've ever felt.

331
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,383
How could I have not
have sense it earlier?

What happened?

336
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:40,450
-[gasp] Ichigo, Karin's bit.

337
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:46,350
[cries] Ichigo, you've
got to save her.

Got to break free.

-Fool.

350
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:18,783
You'll only get in the way.

-Stop!

356
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,416
The kido is too strong
for human to break.

357
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,683
If you keep trying, you'll
only cause damage to your soul.

358
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:42,583
RUKIA KUCHIKI (OFFSCREEN): What?

359
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:44,583
He's breaking the kido.

360
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:45,550
That's impossible!

-Ichigo!

00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,516
Get me out of here!

365
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,150
-[grunts] Karin!

366
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:04,383
-I found you.

367
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,316
[howling]

368
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,250
[shouting]

369
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:16,650
-Karin!

370
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:17,216
No!

371
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,850
-Don't worry.

372
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:19,816
She'll be all right.

373
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,783
The Hollow left
without devouring

374
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:23,183
either of your sisters' souls.

375
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:24,483
-Are you sure?

376
00:17:24,516 --> 00:17:25,483
-Yes.

377
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:27,216
It's Seeking a specific
soul to eat, one

378
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,716
with a much higher
concentration of spirit energy.

379
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:36,216
In fact, the Hollow earlier
was hungry for that soul, too--

380
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,416
not the girl's.

381
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,483
-But why?

382
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,750
RUKIA KUCHIKI (OFFSCREEN):
For some reason,

383
00:17:39,783 --> 00:17:41,816
most of your spirit energy
was hidden deep within you

384
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,916
until now, when you needed
it to save your sister.

385
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,816
That's why I didn't sense
anything unusual about you

386
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,050
when I arrived.

387
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,483
It also explains why the
Hollows haven't come after you.

388
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:55,483
The spirit energy you
have bottled up inside you

389
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:57,483
started to pour out
when you made contact

390
00:17:57,516 --> 00:17:59,516
with that young girl's ghost.

391
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,916
As a result, your
soul became exposed.

392
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,316
Those two Hollows today detected
your soul through that girl.

393
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,783
And they were using
her to track it down.

394
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:13,483
Which means the Hollows
are really after you.

395
00:18:13,516 --> 00:18:17,883
-Those things want me?

396
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,316
[howling]

00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:22,683
Get out of here!

399
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,083
ICHIGO KUROSAKI (OFFSCREEN): No!

400
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:27,016
So the vicious attacks on that
poor girl were because of me?

401
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,483
-That's one way to look at it.

402
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:30,616
-And now both of my
sisters could wind up dead,

403
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,383
and the whole thing is my fault?

404
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,050
-Help us, Ichigo.

405
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,450

-Coward!

409
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:42,050
Quit attacking others.

410
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:46,816
If it's my soul you
want, come and get it.

411

Fight me one on one,
you ugly bastard!

-[gasps] You are a fool.

418
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:22,783
How could you
possibly have thought

419
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:26,516
you were any match for a Hollow?

420
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,883
Did you really think that
everything would be over

421
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,316
if you gave them your soul?

422
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,750
One soul doesn't
satisfy them for long.

423
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:35,283
If you don't stop
interfering, we're

all going to end up as its food!

Do you want to save you family?

428
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:53,316
-Of course I do.

429
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,750
If there's a way,
then tell me how.

430
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:59,116
-It will only be temporary.

431
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,550
But you must become a
Soul Reaper yourself.

432
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,816
-What?

433
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,283
RUKIA KUCHIKI (OFFSCREEN):
You must take my Zanpakuto

434
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:08,750
and run it through to
the center of your being,

435
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:13,116
so that I may pour
my powers into you.

436
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,616
I can't guarantee
that you will live.

437
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,450
But if it doesn't
work, it won't matter.

438
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,783
-Then give me that

RUKIA KUCHIKI (OFFSCREEN):
How could this have happened?

444
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:00,783
I meant to give him
only half of my powers.

445
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:03,216
But somehow he's taken
nearly all of it.

What kind of being is he?

I've never seen a human with

That's what was jamming
my senses before.

I've never heard of a
human with enough strength

00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,116
to break the kido on his own.

453
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:24,283
And I have never
seen a Soul Reaper

454
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,816
wield such a huge Zanpakuto.

455
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,616
-You will pay the price
for hurting my family, you

This is your idol, Kon,
