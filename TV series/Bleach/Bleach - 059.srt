[theme music]

3
00:01:42,534 --> 00:01:44,667
-What incredible
spiritual pressure.

4
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,667
It just keeps getting
heavier and stronger

5
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:50,034
the closer we get to the top.

6
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:51,501
What do you think, Uryu?

7
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:52,834
Is it Ichigo's pressure?

8
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:53,901
-Yes.

9
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:56,334
I think it is, but I
can't tell for sure.

10
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:59,001
-If so, we'll know in a second.

11
00:01:59,034 --> 00:01:59,701
We're at the top.

12
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:08,001
Damn.

13
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:10,134
A dead end.

14
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:12,201
-We can't see a thing from here.

15
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:14,801
-I can still sense Ichigo.

16
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,901
No matter how much his
spirirtual pressure

17
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:19,601
might have changed, there's
no mistaking the scent of it.

18
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:24,667
This can't be anyone but
Ichigo, I just know it.

19
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:26,001
-That's strange.

20
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:26,801
-Huh?

21
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,234
-I don't sense Rukia at all.

22
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,501
I sure hope that doesn't
mean that she has already

23
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:32,901
been executed.

24
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,934
YACHIRU (OFFSCREEN): Well that's
because she's already escaped!

25
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:35,434
-Huh?

26
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:39,734
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Yachiru!

27
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:40,234
-Lieutanant!

28
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:41,234
You're back!

29
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:43,167
-Hi, guys!

30
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:45,601
Hi, Maki Maki!

31
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:46,901
-How lovely.

32
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,367
My old nickname.

33
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,701
What do you mean?

34
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:52,267
If Ichigo was able
to help Rukia escape,

35
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:54,067
why would he still be fighting?

36
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:57,101
-I think he's fighting
someone powerful.

37
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:59,534
Just freeing her is
not enough if you

38
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:02,234
know the enemy's going
to come after her.

39
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:05,401
Ichigo knows that, in
order to truly save Rukia,

40
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:07,767
he has to thoroughly
defeat his enemy.

41
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:09,667
He has to make them
completely give up

42
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:13,267
on the idea of executing her.

43
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,801
That's why Ichigo
is still fighting.

44
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:21,334
He's putting everything on
the line with this one battle.

45
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,801
-What the hell?

46
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:25,701
What is wrong with
you people anyway?

47
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:28,501
Why should Rukia's fate
mean anything to you?

48
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:30,201
You hardly even know
her, and yet you're

49
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:32,301
risking your lives to save her.

50
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,934
-Rukia is our friend.

51
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:35,167
Why wouldn't we save her?

52
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,234
-In fact, she's more
than just a friend.

53
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:42,067
Rukia's important to us, because
she's important to Ichigo.

54
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:44,334
-Ohirime, what?

55
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,767
-Think about it.

56
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:48,167
It's Rukia who
changed everything.

57
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:54,301
Rukia has changed Ichigo's life.

58
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,667
-Watch carefully,
Ichigo Kurosake.

59
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:53,567
What you see is what happens
when I abandon all defense

60
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:58,634
and risk everything
to kill my enemy.

61
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,734
This is the true
form of Senbonzakura.

62
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,667
Senkai.

63
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:18,101
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

64
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,201
Don't worry, though.

65
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:33,434
This is just your
funeral procession.

66
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,501
The thousand swords
all around you

67
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:38,501
will not attack you at once.

68
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:40,234
So relax.

69
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:42,867
This senkai is the
form I show to only

70
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:52,967
those special few
enemies-- --who

71
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:56,901
are truly deserving of my vow
to kill them with my own hands.

72
00:05:56,934 --> 00:06:00,334
You are only the
second to ever see it.

73
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:01,534
-I'm truly flattered.

74
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,767
-Here I come Ichigo Kurosake.

75
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:38,701
[screaming]

76
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:44,267
-Hey.

77
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:44,801
Ow.

78
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:47,534
Watch that.

79
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:49,934
-What could that spiritual
pressure come from?

80
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:55,734
-I think that we should move a
little farther away, Orihime.

81
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:57,667
There isn't very
much we can do here.

82
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:00,401
-I appreciate that, Uryu.

83
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:02,801
But I'll stay.

84
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:05,701
I want to be close to Ichigo.

85
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:07,367
-(IN HEAD) She knows.

86
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:09,534
She knows that with
her limited power,

87
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,201
if she tried to help Ichigo,
she's only get in the way.

88
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:15,267
Even if there were something
she could do to help,

89
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:19,934
Ichigo would surely
never want that.

90
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:22,301
She understands all
of that, and yet she

91
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:26,367
is still willing to stay here in
this dangerous place, waiting.

92
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,167
Hoping for your safety, Ichigo.

93
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,501
Always praying for your victory.

94
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:37,234
Always believing in you.

95
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:43,234
You had better win, Ichigo.

96
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:49,901
If you lose, I will
never forgive you!

97
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:57,834
Win, Ichigo!

98
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:47,801
-So fast.

99
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,534
I think he's gotten
even faster since he

100
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:52,767
revealed his senkai to me.

101
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:55,767
But still, it's
nothin' I can't match.

102
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,267
I can go a little faster, too.

103
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:09,967
-What's the matter?

104
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:13,634
You seem to be moving much
slower than when we started,

105
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,101
Ichigo Kurosaki.

106
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:16,567
-Is that a fact?

107
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:18,367
I can still block your sword.

108
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:20,834
When you move, it's almost
like it's still stationary.

109
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:26,834
-Hado four.

110
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:32,501
Byakurai.

111
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:02,430
[cough]

112
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,230
-It's over for you,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

113
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,930
-What'd you say?

114
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:16,196
My body-- I can't move!

115
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,130
-I gather you think my
movements became faster

116
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,063
after using my senkai.

117
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:24,130
That's not true.

118
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:27,263
All that technique does is
to compress my numerous sword

119
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:30,896
fragments into one blade, in
order to explosively increase

120
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,696
its killing capabilities.

121
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,030
I haven't gotten faster.

122
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,730
-So then are you saying that
what has actually changed here

123
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:42,530
is that I've gotten slower?

124
00:10:42,563 --> 00:10:45,263
-There's nothing for
you to be ashamed of.

125
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:48,630
You have defeated many
high level soul reapers.

126
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:50,763
You have gone far
beyond what anyone

127
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:52,563
thought you were capable of.

128
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:55,930
You even survived slashes
from the Senbonzakura.

129
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:58,130
But you can feel
it now, can't you?

130
00:10:58,163 --> 00:11:00,330
Your body is dying.

131
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:01,996
You're only a human.

132
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,063
Though your spirit
has not been broken,

133
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,363
there is a limit to
what you can endure.

134
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:08,296
You have reached that limit.

135
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,330
This is the end,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

136
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:21,030
-Move.

137
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:23,330
I have to move!

138
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:26,230
Move, dammit!

139
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:28,430
Why am I here?

140
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:31,330
Why have I come all this way?

141
00:11:31,363 --> 00:11:32,830
It's all for nothing
if I don't win!

142
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:39,330
I wanna win!

143
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:41,996
I need to win!

144
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,496
-Tch.

145
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,863
I thought I told you already.

146
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:52,730
It's a big problem for me
if you get yourself killed.

147
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,896
-That's impossible.

148
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,363
Who or what are you?

149
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:01,863
You want to know who I am?

150
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:07,330
I have no name!

151
00:12:07,363 --> 00:12:08,330
-Ah!

152
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:08,830
-Ha ha!

153
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,796
Ha ha ha ha!

154
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,230
Ichigo, what a complete
amateur you are!

155
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:21,730
Couldn't you tell?

156
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:24,230
You've been getting crushed
by your own bankai's

157
00:12:24,263 --> 00:12:25,496
spiritual pressure.

158
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,196
Every bone in your body is
creaking from the strain.

159
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,696
You really are a hopeless case!

160
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,163
So I'll show ya how
I use this bankai!

161
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:42,130
Hyah!

162
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,596
-A black getsuga.

163
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,063
-Ha ha ha!

164
00:12:58,096 --> 00:12:58,563
Yah!

165
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,496
Ha ha ha!

166
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,663
-This twisted
spiritual pressure.

167
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,096
That white mask.

168
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,863
Are you a Hollow?

169
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:29,196
-Who cares?

170
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,630
I don't have to
tell you anything,

171
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:33,063
because as soon as I finish
with you, you're going to--

172
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:33,563
-Disappear.

173
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,563
-Let go!

174
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:43,563
-Don't need you!

175
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:45,196
Stop interfering!

176
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,596
-You're the one
who's interfering!

177
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,063
Don't you get it?

178
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:50,063
I was about to kill him!

179
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,030
You will win if you
just leave it to me!

180
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,463
You fool!

181
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:57,463
Damn you!

182
00:13:57,496 --> 00:14:06,363
[screaming]

183
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,663
-Sorry about that.

184
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,163
That was an unwelcome
interruption.

185
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:28,563
-(THINKING) An interruption?

186
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:30,763
That's what that was to him?

187
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:33,296
I think he means that if he
had continued to fight me

188
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,630
in that form, then even
if he had defeated me,

189
00:14:36,663 --> 00:14:40,563
the victory wouldn't
have been truly his.

190
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:42,230
Very well.

191
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:46,163
I won't ask you to explain
what that thing was.

192
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:48,696
I don't think either of us
has enough strength left

193
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,763
to continue this fight
for very much longer.

194
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:57,730
We'll finish this off
with one final attack.

195
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,130
-All right.

196
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:04,496
But first, let me ask you
just one more question.

197
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,363
Tell me why.

198
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:07,896
Why wouldn't you save Rukia?

199
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:13,463
-If you actually
succeed in defeating me,

200
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,163
then I will answer
that question.

201
00:15:35,763 --> 00:15:36,496
Shukei Hakuteiken.

202
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:45,063
-That's incredible.

203
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:48,063
I'm sorry to
disappoint you, but I

204
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:50,563
don't have anything amazing
to compare with that.

205
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:54,130
Zangetsu only taught
me the Getsuga Tensho.

206
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:57,296
So the only trick that
I really have left now

207
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:02,496
is to compress all of my spirit
energy into one final attack.

208
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:14,296
Here I come, Byakuya Kuchiki!

209
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:20,230
Argh!

210
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:03,663
I won't fall!

211
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,196
-You wanted to know.

212
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,696
-Huh?

213
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,063
-Why I would allow
Rukia to be executed.

214
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:51,096
Criminals must be
brought to justice.

215
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,996
Once their punishment
is decided,

216
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,830
it must be carried out.

217
00:17:54,863 --> 00:17:57,496
That is the rule of the law.

218
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,296
-You honor the law?

219
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,596
Even over the life
of your own sister?

220
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,396
-Sympathy towards a relative.

221
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,563
What could be more pointless?

222
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:07,430
-How can you say that?

223
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:11,496
-Feelings and emotions have
no value compared to the law.

224
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,130
Luckily, I've
never been burdened

225
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:15,863
by such useless sentiments.

226
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:19,196
The Kuchiki clan is one of
the four great noble families.

227
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,263
We're duty bound to serve as
examples for all soul reapers.

228
00:18:23,296 --> 00:18:25,896
How can we enforce our
laws if we ourselves

229
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,363
are not willing to obey them?

230
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,963
-I'm sorry.

231
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:37,396
I still can't understand.

232
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,263
I swear, even if I
were in your position,

233
00:18:40,296 --> 00:18:43,163
I would fight the law.

234
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:46,463
I would fight until I
ended your stupid law!

235
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:48,730
-Hm?

236
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:51,463
(THINKING) Now I see.

237
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:54,230
I was never his true enemy.

238
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:56,230
What this child was
fighting against

239
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:59,796
since the very beginning was
the law of the Soul Society.

240
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,330
Ichigo Kurosaki, because
of your free spirit

241
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:13,130
and reckless abandon,
you have broken my sword.

242
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:14,863
You have my word.

243
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:17,796
I will pursue Rukia no more.

244
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,296
You have won.

245
00:19:34,663 --> 00:19:40,696
[screaming]

246
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:47,130
-I c just-- just
barely stand up.

247
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:49,063
Everything's spinning around.

248
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,963
[nervous laughter]

249
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:55,130
-Oh, I'm sorry, Ichigo.

250
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:56,930
I didn't mean to sneak
up on you like that.

251
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,696
And I'm sorry I have
such a hard head.

252
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,830
I was just trying to catch you.

253
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:02,896
-Orihime?

254
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,830
Uryu.

255
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:04,530
Chad.

256
00:20:04,563 --> 00:20:06,830
Ganju.

257
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:08,663
It's good to see you all.

258
00:20:08,696 --> 00:20:10,396
I'm glad you're OK.

259
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,696
-We're not exactly OK.

260
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,396
But then again,
compared to you, I

261
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,363
guess we shouldn't
really be complaining.

262
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:19,496
-Orihime, are you injured?

263
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,430
-Huh?

264
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:21,263
Yes.

265
00:20:21,296 --> 00:20:22,396
I mean, no, no, I'm not hurt!

266
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,830
I wasn't hurt at all.

267
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:24,963
I'm totally fine.

268
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:26,496
I wasn't of any use to
anyone, so I didn't even

269
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,463
get involved, actually.

270
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:28,396
Uryu protected me.

271
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,863
Mr. Kenpachi carried
me piggyback.

272
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,330
I wasn't hurt at all.

273
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,263
I was never really
in any danger.

274
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:35,730
Though it's nice of you to ask.

275
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:39,396
But-- mostly I was just
so worried about you

276
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,296
the whole time we were
separated, Ichigo.

277
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,163
I'm so sorry that I couldn't
do anything to protect you.

278
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:50,030
I'm just so glad that
you're all right.

279
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:52,930
Thank you for surviving.

280
00:20:52,963 --> 00:20:55,763
Thank you for
everything that you did.

281
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:01,996
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Thank you, Orihime.

282
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,530
-What are you going to do?

283
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,863
-What do you think?

284
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:17,230
Just stand back.

285
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:18,263
-But you can't.

286
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:25,730
Captain, you've just
broken down the sealed door

287
00:21:25,763 --> 00:21:26,996
into central 46.

288
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,996
Are you insane?

289
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,330
-And the alarm hasn't gone off.

290
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:33,463
Breaking down the door
should surely have activated

291
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:35,196
the alarm, but it didn't.

292
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,896
And where are the guards
who are always posted here?

293
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,296
Something's wrong.

294
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,330
Someone must have killed them,
and then dragged their corpses

295
00:21:41,363 --> 00:21:42,696
away.

296
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,196
Then once they got inside, they
must have resealed the door

297
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,863
and deactivated the
alarm behind them.

298
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:50,263
-Obviously they meant
to keep things quiet.

299
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:09,930
-No way.

300
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:11,130
What is this?

301
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,596
What happened here?

302
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:31,203
[theme music]

303
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:55,044
[theme music]

304
00:22:55,044 --> 00:22:56,105
RANGIKU (OFFSCREEN):
Captain, are you sure

305
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:58,671
it's all right for us to
barge right into central 46?

306
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:00,071
HITSUGAYA (OFFSCREEN): Why not?

307
00:23:00,105 --> 00:23:00,771
RANGIKU (OFFSCREEN): Well, there
are a lot of important people

308
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:01,905
up there, aren't there?

309
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:04,271
Hey, maybe if I touch up
my make up and act sexy,

310
00:23:04,305 --> 00:23:06,405
I'll get somebody
rich to marry me?

311
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:10,205
HITSUGAYA (OFFSCREEN):
Rangiku, go home.
