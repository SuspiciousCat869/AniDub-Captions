NARRATOR: Sosuke Aizen has
stolen the Hogyoku, an object

3
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:54,147
that can remove the barrier
between Soul Reapers

4
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,181
and Hollows.

5
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:57,314
He defected from
the Soul Society

6
00:01:57,347 --> 00:02:00,114
and began raising a
powerful army of Arrancars

7
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:01,981
in Hueco Mundo.

00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:04,081
Ichigo and his friends
managed to fight off

00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:08,381
the first wave of Arrancars,
they suffered major damages.

10
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:11,781
Aizen's ultimate goal
is to kill the Reio, who

11
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:14,347
is the king of the Soul Society.

12
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:17,947
He will destroy Karakura Town to
harvest the spirit energy that

13
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:20,381
gravitates to the area.

14
00:02:20,414 --> 00:02:22,647
The Arrancars plan
to mount their attack

15
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:26,314
on the world of the
living in the winter.

In anticipation of
the upcoming episode,

17
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:31,481
the Soul Reapers and their
friends undergo harsh training.

18
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:36,581
Ichigo, Chad, Uryu,
Rukia, and Orihime

19
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,781
are all preparing for
the final showdown

20
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:40,914
while Captain Histugaya's
advanced troops

21
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:42,414
in the world of
the living continue

22
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,214
to clash with
powerful Hollows, who

23
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:48,381
begin to appear more
frequently as the days go by.

Ah.

27
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,781
Just as I expected.

28
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:46,714
It's here.

29
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:47,714
-What are you doing?

30
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:01,081
-Well, everyone.

31
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:03,081
Take care of the place
while we're gone.

32
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:04,847
-Be sure that you get
plenty of nutrition

33
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:07,181
by eating three meals a day.

34
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,281
And don't forget to brush
your teeth after each meal.

35
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:11,347
Do you promise?

36
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:14,014
-I promise, but why
are you taking Chad?

37
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:17,747
I thought you were
just going to stock up.

38
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:20,714
-To help Chas
unwind, that's all.

39
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:22,514
If he focuses
solely on training,

40
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:24,547
then the poor boy
is gonna burn out.

41
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:27,714
He needs to get some fresh
air once in awhile, right?

42
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:29,114
Tell them, Chad.

43
00:04:29,147 --> 00:04:31,947
-I'd rather keep training, but
I appreciate your consideration.

44
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,014
-Fine.

45
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:34,447
Then hurry up and
bring him back, Kisuke.

46
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:37,481
There's still a lot of important
things I need to teach him.

47
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:38,514
-Renji.

48
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:40,581
You're just as short
tempered as usual.

49
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,014
I won'y miss that.

50
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:44,447
-Well, we should get going.

51
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:45,447
-See you soon.

52
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:47,981
-I'll be back.

53
00:04:48,014 --> 00:04:48,814
-Bye.

54
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,547
-Leave the shop to us!

55
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,214
-Have a nice trip, everybody!

56
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:55,014
-Kisuke's really good
at this, isn't he?

57
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:57,614
-Good at what, Ririn?

58
00:04:57,647 --> 00:04:59,514
-He says that his goal
is to help Chad unwind,

59
00:04:59,547 --> 00:05:02,747
but he really plans on
making him carry things.

60
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:03,681
-Oh, really?

61
00:05:03,714 --> 00:05:04,447
-Definitely.

62
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:05,681
-I see.

63
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:08,247
Well, the good news is
that, if Chad is with them,

64
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:11,114
he'll be able to carry back a
lot more than they usually do.

65
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:12,481
-Poor Chad.

66
00:05:12,514 --> 00:05:15,314
-How much are they
planning on buying, anyway?

67
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:16,947
Nobody even comes in this store.

68
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:17,447
-Jinta.

69
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,947
-Did I hear you say
something disparaging

70
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:31,847
about our lack of
customers, Jinta?

71
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:33,747
-A lesson learned.

72
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:35,647
-Be careful of what you say.

73
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:41,947
-This is not a place
you should be entering

74
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:45,547
without Lord Aizen's
permission, Patros.

75
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,514
-I'll tell you something.

76
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,847
I've grown tired of
your suck up attitude.

77
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:51,714
-Regarding?

78
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:53,247
-Lord Aizen.

79
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:56,814
Always with Aizen,
and the Espada

80
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:59,547
are all following suit as well.

81
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:01,247
I don't get it.

82
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,347
It makes no sense.

83
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:07,247
It's an unpleasant feeling.

84
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:09,281
He's nothing but a Soul Reaper.

85
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:11,647
Why should powerful
Hollows have to take orders

86
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:12,847
from a Soul Reaper?

87
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:15,147
It makes absolutely
no sense whatsoever.

88
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:21,581
Hollows eat souls and
crush Soul Reapers.

89
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,081
why?

90
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:25,014
Tell me!

91
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,181
Tell me why our
freedom was taken away

92
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:35,081
for someone like him.

93
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:37,881
You know Aizen used
Hollows in his experiments?

94
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:38,914
-I know.

95
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:41,114
So what's your point?

96
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:45,614
-Ever since he appeared,
this place has changed.

97
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:48,981
I have no intention of
following a Soul Reaper.

98
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:50,381
-I see.

99
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:53,581
-Ulquiorra, why don't
we use Hogyoku ourselves

100
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:54,981
and control the world?

101
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,681
Doesn't that make more sense?

102
00:06:57,714 --> 00:06:59,047
-Don't bother.

103
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,081
How can you control the
world when you can't even

104
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:02,247
become an Espada?

105
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:04,547
-So I don't have your support.

106
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:06,414
-Mm.

107
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:07,147
-Fine.

108
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:08,014
Then I've no choice.

109
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:15,114
Fortunately, I already
have two supporters.

110
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:21,414
-Patros.

111
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,714
You'll never get away with this.

112
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:33,681
-It's really too bad.

113
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:47,014
Without doubt, Be
Espada have fallen.

114
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:49,381
I never really
hated you, though.

115
00:07:49,414 --> 00:07:50,047
-Heh.

116
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:50,881
Easy.

117
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:51,881
-Yeah.

118
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:53,714
Pretty pathetic
furnace for an Espada.

119
00:07:56,881 --> 00:08:00,247
We're going to make Aizen
regret the day that he decided

120
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:02,681
to strengthen us with Hogyuko.

121
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:09,247
And then I will become king.

122
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:22,114
-Um.

123
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:23,247
-Hm?

124
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:24,981
-Could you please move?

125
00:08:25,014 --> 00:08:26,647
-Oh, sorry.

126
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:34,281
I just don't know what
to do when I'm suddenly

127
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,681
given so much free time.

128
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:39,647
-Um, could you move again?

129
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:42,047
-OK.

130
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:43,281
-Jerk.

131
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,114
You gotta train for the
final battle, right?

132
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:46,081
Then go do it!

133
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:47,314
-I know what I'm
supposed to be doing

134
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,481
without you having to tell me.

135
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:50,414
-Um.

136
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,347
-Hm?

137
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:52,981
-Could you move?

138
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:53,614
-Uh, OK.

139
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,714
-You're completely useless
when you're not fighting.

140
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,914
You know that, don't you?

141
00:09:00,947 --> 00:09:02,081
-What did you say?

142
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:02,947
-You wanna fight?

[growling]

144
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:07,347
-Ah.

145
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,414
The weather sure
is nice, isn't it?

146
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:11,447
-Yeah.

147
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:14,247
-But it's starting to get
boring without Ichigo.

148
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,481
It's so much fun teasing him.

149
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,314
-But last time you saw
him, all you did was yell.

150
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:20,881
-Is that what you call teasing?

151
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:22,381
-Of course it is.

152
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:26,114
He always reacts to it so
seriously, which makes it fun.

153
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:27,214
-I see.

154
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:28,581
-Well, I always thought
that the two of you

155
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:30,414
were having a lovers' quarrel.

156
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:31,981
-Of course not.

157
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:34,414
-But, honestly, it
would be nice of him

158
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:37,114
to show up here
every once in a while

159
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:40,781
-Oh my, you're really worried
about him, aren't you?

160
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,947
-Yes, I agree with Kurodo.

161
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:47,347
-It's not like that at all!

162
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:48,814
What's happening?

163
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:49,914
-Something's going on.

164
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:51,414
-What incredible
spiritual pressure.

00:10:11,014 --> 00:10:12,447
presence in Karakura Town.

167
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:15,214
I repeat, we have a
confirmed Arrancar presence

168
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,114
in Karakura Town.

169
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:22,281
We have confirmed the Arrancars'
presence at coordinates 3, 8,

170
00:10:22,314 --> 00:10:23,614
0, 0.

171
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:24,681
-We know.

172
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:26,547
I'm requesting a Gentei Keijo.

173
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:27,547
RIN: Don't worry.

174
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:29,181
We've already simplified
the procedures

175
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:30,381
to receive permission.

176
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:32,581
You should be granted
permission immediately.

177
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:33,681
-Understood.

178
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:35,481
Sure has gotten convenient.

179
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:38,914
Rangiku, Renji, Ikkaku,
Yumichika, acknowledge.

180
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:43,347
-Yes.

181
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:46,514
I have a confirmation, sir.

182
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:49,747
-Looks like things
will be fun again.

183
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:51,881
-I hope this one's
stronger than the last one.

184
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:56,114
-This is Renji.

185
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:57,647
I'm the furthest one away.

186
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:59,381
You guys just go on ahead of me.

187
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:04,947
-The Soul Reapers have
quickly sniffed us out,

188
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:06,914
and it looks like
they're on their way.

189
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:08,514
-What a letdown.

190
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:10,047
They all seem weak.

191
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:12,447
What should we do, Patros?

192
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:15,847
-I want you to handle
the Soul Reapers.

193
00:11:15,881 --> 00:11:18,447
They don't seem very powerful.

194
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:21,614
But they mustn't interfere
with our investigation.

195
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,714
-Tell me, is it true there's a
Soul Reaper in this town that

196
00:11:24,747 --> 00:11:28,081
actually knows how
to use the Hogyoku?

197
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:30,481
-That's what we've
come here to find out.

198
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:33,581
At this point, we've only
obtained the Hogyoku.

199
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:36,714
If we don't know how to use it,
then it's just a paperweight.

200
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:39,847
Someone from Los Noches will
come for us soon enough.

201
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:41,614
That's the real battle.

202
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:42,947
Act swiftly.

203
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:45,547
We'll rendezvous as soon
as the job is finished.

204
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:50,981
-What now, Captain?

205
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,014
-Keep a look out.

206
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:52,814
They're very close.

207
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,481
-Captain Hitsugaya, sir!

208
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:58,014
-Yes.

209
00:11:58,047 --> 00:11:58,747
They're coming.

210
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:06,781
-Heh.

211
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:08,514
How cocky of them.

212
00:12:08,547 --> 00:12:10,014
Well, they're going down.

213
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:11,381
Now stab, Erizo!

214
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:27,614
-The difference in
our power is obvious!

215
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,514
There's no need to
take you seriously.

216
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:33,347
Unfortunately, we
don't have time.

217
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:35,314
We need you to die here.

218
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:36,081
Freeze, Jaboli!

219
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:45,514
[humming]

220
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,347
-Yay!

221
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:49,481
Gee, ever since
Rukia and Orihime

222
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:51,347
went to the Soul
Society, things have

223
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:54,714
been so boring around
this dreary place.

224
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:58,881
I wonder if there's a paradise
level goddess anywhere?

225
00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:01,514
Perhaps over there!

226
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,114
Wait.

227
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:04,514
There's something!

228
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:05,181
Who are you?

229
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:08,847
-No.

230
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:10,714
Who are you?

231
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:11,214
-Kon!

232
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,148
-I see.

233
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:25,548
So that's your releases
Zanpakuto, is it?

234
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:26,348
-That's right.

235
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:30,415
This is my true form!

236
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:33,815
I'll end this with one shot!

237
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:36,548
-Rain over the frosted
heavens, Hyorinmaru!

238
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:42,315
[laughter]

239
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:51,682
-It's useless!

240
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,515
-Ha ha ha ha ha!

241
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,482
This is my Zanpakuto release!

242
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:10,482
-Yumichika, this fight belongs
to me, so don't interfere.

243
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:12,015
-Yeah, I've heard that before.

244
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:14,382
When are you ever going
to let me fight again?

245
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:15,782
-Not today.

246
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,582
Extend, Hozukimaru!

247
00:14:21,482 --> 00:14:23,315
-You're going to take
me on by yourself?

248
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:29,415
-You Arrancars.

249
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:32,282
As usual, you've got
some pretty thick skin!

250
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:32,782
Yah!

251
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:44,682
-Is that-- Hey, Kon.

252
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:45,815
What happened to you?

253
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:46,715
-Oh.

254
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:47,782
Renji.

255
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:48,982
-Tell me what happened.

256
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:52,282
-Some guy with incredible
spiritual pressure.

257
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:53,582
-It's an Arrancar.

258
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:56,115
Did you see which way he went?

259
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:58,082
-That way.

260
00:14:58,115 --> 00:14:58,882
-Could it be that--

261
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:13,282
-Stop there!

262
00:15:13,315 --> 00:15:15,482
This is no place for someone
of your kind, Arrancar!

263
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,815
-Yeah.

264
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:19,248
-We're gonna mess you up if
you don't stop right there!

265
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:23,248
You heard me.

266
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:24,482
Stop now!

267
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:25,982
-What do we do?

268
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:27,282
-He's dangerous.

269
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:29,115
It's going to be impossible
to take him on like this.

270
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:29,848
-I agree.

271
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:30,415
-Retreat!

272
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:31,115
-Hey, wait up!

273
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,082
-I understand
someone in this place

274
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:39,315
knows how to use the Hogyoku.

275
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:44,748
I'd like to meet him.

276
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:46,648
RENJI: He's not here.

277
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:48,948
-So, there are others here.

278
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,115
Who are you?

279
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:52,615
Squad Six Lieutenant
Renji Abarai

280
00:15:52,648 --> 00:15:53,815
of the 13th Court Guard Squad.

281
00:15:56,715 --> 00:16:00,682
-And where is the person who
knows how to use the Hogyoku?

282
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:04,082
-I told you that he's not here.

283
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:09,182
-Well, in that case I'll
just wait until he returns.

284
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,115
-I'm afraid I can't
let you do that.

285
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:13,715
No customers allowed in the
shop while the owner's away.

286
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:20,548
-Oh, but I'm not a customer.

287
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:23,548
En garde, Soul Reaper.

288
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:24,515
-Roar, Zabimaru!

289
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:31,448
-What are you doing, moocher?

290
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:32,115
-It's on!

291
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:40,815
-Ururu!

292
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:41,782
Get inside!

293
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:48,682
-They won't be any
safer hiding in there.

294
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:51,782
You see, if we fight here,
that shack will certainly

295
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:53,882
be crushed to pieces.

296
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:55,048
-You think so?

297
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,748
Because the store owner's
a pretty good carpenter.

298
00:16:57,782 --> 00:16:59,948
I don't think it'll be
that easy to knock down.

299
00:16:59,982 --> 00:17:02,148
Besides, there won't be
anything to worry about about

300
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:04,715
if I end all this
before that happens.

301
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:08,882
-Perhaps we should
test that theory.

302
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:10,682
-What should we do, Jinta?

303
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:11,948
-What should we do?

304
00:17:11,982 --> 00:17:14,848
We've gotta fight,
that's what we should do.

305
00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:17,248
Ururu, you stay down here.

306
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:18,115
-But--

307
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:20,348
-Huh?

308
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:21,082
-Hello.

309
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:23,282
[laughter]

310
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:24,215
-Hey.

311
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:25,448
-We're going out first.

312
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:27,248
We've got to assist Renji.

313
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:29,248
-Well, as moochers,
we believe that it

314
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,048
is our duty not
to hide like this.

315
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:33,015
-Good luck.

316
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:45,948
[shout]

317
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,915
-Roar, Zabimaru!

318
00:17:49,948 --> 00:17:50,415
-Too slow!

319
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:57,282
-Ho, ho!

320
00:17:57,315 --> 00:18:00,282
So you have a little
skill after all.

321
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:02,982
-More than just a little.

322
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,348
-Very well.

323
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:06,682
I wasn't going to unsheathe
my sword for the likes of you,

324
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:09,715
but you leave me no choice.

325
00:18:09,748 --> 00:18:10,548
I

326
00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:11,782
-Hope I don't disappoint you.

327
00:18:14,515 --> 00:18:15,148
Come on.

328
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:22,015
-Ha.

329
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:22,482
-Ah!

330
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:32,215
[cough]

331
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,782
-How weak.

332
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:41,182
My sword skill is
comprised of 20 levels.

333
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:44,515
That was the very lowest
I have, level one.

334
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:46,948
It was a gesture of respect.

335
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:49,048
But you're outmatched
if you can't even

336
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:51,382
keep up with that level.

337
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:52,282
-Bastard.

338
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:53,815
Don't get excited.

339
00:18:53,848 --> 00:18:56,148
I just let my guard down.

340
00:18:56,182 --> 00:18:57,248
-Nonsense.

341
00:18:57,282 --> 00:18:59,248
If that's the case,
then try handling this.

342
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:05,515
Ha.

343
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:08,015
Pathetic.

344
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:09,482
Huh?

345
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,582
-Things won't go
that easily for you.

346
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:13,782
-Oh, really?

347
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:15,015
Who are you?

348
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:17,115
-We're also keeping
an eye on the store

349
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:18,382
while the owner is away.

350
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:20,348
-You'll pay if you
don't leave right away.

351
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:21,915
And that's not just a threat.

352
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:22,815
-No, don't.

353
00:19:22,848 --> 00:19:23,782
Stop taunting him.

354
00:19:23,815 --> 00:19:25,715
-Be quiet.

355
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,182
-It is the job of
a moocher to defend

356
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:30,482
the household during
times like this.

357
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:31,382
-It's all right.

358
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:32,448
We won't do anything rash.

359
00:19:35,948 --> 00:19:37,182
-OK.

360
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:38,948
But I warned you.

361
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:39,915
-Here we go!

362
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:44,882
-Ah!

363
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:54,248
What is this?

364
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:55,748
-What are you lookin' at?

365
00:19:59,215 --> 00:19:59,682
-What?

366
00:20:05,982 --> 00:20:08,382
-We forced him into the barrier!

367
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,315
Now, Kurodo!

368
00:20:10,348 --> 00:20:11,282
-All right!

369
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:14,715
The Renji twins attack team!

370
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:15,882
-This is creepy.

371
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,548
-It's like looking in a mirror!

372
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:24,948
Roar, Zabimaru!

373
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:28,415
-You should give it up!

374
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:30,882
-I've got you!

375
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:32,382
Huh?

376
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:34,615
-You may look like
your counterpart,

377
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:36,948
but your spiritual
pressure's weak.

378
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:39,482
-Ah!

379
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:39,982
-Kurodo!

380
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:48,815
-Think you're pretty smart, huh?

381
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,248
Trying to trick me.

382
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:50,982
Take this!

383
00:20:54,815 --> 00:20:55,448
How impertinent!

384
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,082
How long will you last?

385
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,782
It's over.

386
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:14,248
-I don't think so.

387
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,982
-Apparently you didn't
understand what I said.

388
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:27,882
So let's up the ante.

389
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:28,748
Level two.

390
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:38,848
Not bad.

391
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,415
But it's still
just the beginning.

392
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:23,957
[theme music]

393
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:46,327
KURODO: We've had quite
a lot of scenes today.

394
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:48,494
Could it be that when the
spotlight returns to us,

395
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:49,727
they're going to kill us off?

396
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,427
NOBA: Kurudo, don't
say such things.

397
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:54,227
RIRIN: What an
ominous thing to say.

398
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:56,494
We are forever immortal!

399
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:58,294
NOBA: That's doubtful.
