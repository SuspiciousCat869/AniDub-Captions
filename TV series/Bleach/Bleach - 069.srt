00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:46,474
[clock ticking]

3
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:47,407
-[sigh]

4
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:56,174
[sighing]

5
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:07,907
-A Bount.

6
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:08,541
-I don't get it.

7
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:10,374
A Bount?

8
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:13,274
This Reishi probably
came from a Bount.

9
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,207
-That's great.

10
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:17,574
So what the hell's
a Bount, anyway?

11
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:18,541
-Hm?

12
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:20,007
-Hm.

13
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,674
-It was quite awhile ago.

14
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:24,607
When I was in the Department
of Research and Development,

15
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:27,941
I encountered some residue
that looked a lot like this.

16
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:30,007
It's a mysterious
Reishi that reacts

17
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,907
with special components
of a human soul.

18
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:35,174
Upon further
investigation, I traced it

19
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:37,541
to a tribe called the Bount.

20
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,907
-A tribe?

21
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,107
-I use that term for
lack of a better word,

22
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:42,707
because the Bount
are few in number.

23
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,341
They're like the
Quincy in that they're

24
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:46,441
human with special powers.

25
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:49,574
Quincies have the ability
to kill Hollows and destroy

26
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:52,274
their soul entirely,
which unfortunately

27
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:53,874
led to their downfall.

28
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,774
A Bount has the ability
to absorb human souls.

29
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:59,074
They do this for nourishment.

30
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:01,841
Another difference is the
Quincies are all born human

31
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:03,207
and die human.

32
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:05,174
Bounts, on the other
hand, are born human.

33
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:07,707
But somehow, by
absorbing human souls,

34
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,341
they have the ability
to live forever.

35
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:11,641
That's as much as
I could find out.

36
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:14,874
Unfortunately, I've never been
lucky-- or unlucky-- enough

37
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:16,574
to encounter one myself.

38
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:18,741
-So these Bounts never die?

39
00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:19,974
URAHARA: That's right.

40
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,241
The human souls which
they absorb as sustenance

41
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:23,641
give them eternal life.

42
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:26,974
That quality distinguishes
them every other living being.

43
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,341
Over the years,
they've also been

44
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,441
known by another
name-- vampires.

45
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:32,407
-Ordinarily.

46
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:33,874
But the Bount's
method of operation

47
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:35,841
is to extract the
soul from a human who

48
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:39,141
has died while the Konso
is being performed on it.

49
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:41,574
But that's not what I saw.

50
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,174
-Hm?

51
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:56,641
[grunt] You shouldn't interrupt
two consenting adults.

52
00:03:56,674 --> 00:03:59,574
-Did he consent to you
sucking out his soul?

53
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,741
Who the hell are you, anyway?

54
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,541
--[laugh] You'll
know soon enough.

55
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:09,141
-The Bount I saw was different.

56
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:13,174
This one was trying to absorb
the soul of a living person.

57
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,974
-And what about the person
who's had his soul sucked out?

58
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,074
What happens then?

59
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:19,441
-It's the same as
when a life is taken.

60
00:04:19,474 --> 00:04:22,574
The only thing that's
left behind is death.

61
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:26,141
-[gasp]

62
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:29,207
-Though we're still not
completely sure it's a Bount.

63
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:32,307
Could it be some sort
of mutation or variant?

64
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:34,807
-Well, you never can tell.

65
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,374
Hm.

66
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:36,874
-Hm.

67
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:43,207
-While you're sitting here
thinking, it's still out there!

68
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,374
Did you ever think there
might be more victims?

69
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:47,341
-You always get
right to the point.

70
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,441
Such a strong sense of justice.

71
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:51,841
-Cut the sarcasm.

72
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,541
URAHARA: So, I've been thinking.

73
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:54,107
Ririn?

74
00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:55,341
-Hm?

75
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:57,107
URAHARA: I think you should
go to Ichigo's place.

76
00:04:57,141 --> 00:04:58,341
-Huh?

77
00:04:58,374 --> 00:04:59,674
Come on.

78
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:01,707
-What are you talking about?

79
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:03,907
-I think it would be
best if Chad, Orihime,

80
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:06,374
and you had a little
extra support.

81
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,641
-But why?

82
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,641
-Hm?

83
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:10,507
-These Mod-Souls
will be very helpful,

84
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,841
because they all
contain Reishi sensors.

85
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:14,807
-Sensors?

86
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:15,941
-Hm?

87
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:18,574
-Specifically designed
to detect Reishi waves.

88
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:21,074
In other words, it
appears the enemy

89
00:05:21,107 --> 00:05:23,041
is now targeting living humans.

90
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,541
And seeing as how
you three humans

91
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,007
have such high abilities,
I'm sure the look on you

92
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,307
is very tempting prey.

93
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:33,041
Of course, there's no
guarantee they'll notice you.

94
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:35,307
So we must do what
we can to find them.

95
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:36,607
-Hm.

96
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,341
I see.

97
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:39,107
Wait a minute.

98
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:40,307
Where does that leave me?

99
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,941
-Well, you see, Uryu, as
I was trying to explain--

100
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:45,974
-You don't have any
abilities anymore.

101
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:49,907
-[groan] [sigh]

102
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:50,707
-Oh, yeah.

103
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,207
That's right, huh?

104
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:53,407
-Now, then.

105
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:56,874
Kurodo, I think you should
go to Orihime's place.

106
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:58,874
-Well, I guess if I must.

107
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:00,407
RIRIN: Stop staring, you perv.

108
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,807
-I'm sorry.

109
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:04,474
URAHARA: Noba, you go
with Chad to his place.

110
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:07,307
-[grunt]

111
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:09,707
RIRIN: Why are you
closing your mask?

112
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:12,407
[sigh] Fine, since I
haven't got a choice.

113
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,641
But once the trouble starts,
you better stay out of my way.

114
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:16,874
-What are you talking about?

115
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:18,474
You better stay out of my way.

116
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:18,974
-Yeah?

117
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:20,107
Really.

118
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:22,507
And who was the guy who
couldn't defend himself

119
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,507
against our attack.

120
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,941
Oh, that's right.

121
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:25,441
Ichigo.

122
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,507
-Why don't you shut up?

123
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,974
-I may have forgotten
to mention this before,

124
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:33,807
but I think it would
probably be best

125
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:36,674
to hide you in stuffed
animals to avoid suspicion.

126
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:38,407
-Stuffed animals?

127
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:38,907
-Really?

128
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:43,441
URAHARA: Good night.

129
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:44,374
Be careful out there.

130
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,374
YORUICHI: A sensor that
detects Reishi, huh?

131
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:53,641
So when did you think of
adding that little feature?

132
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:54,374
-Uh.

133
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:55,441
Oh, it's nothing, really.

134
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:56,807
Besides, you know what they say.

135
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:59,141
A boy scout is always prepared.

136
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,774
-If I didn't know
you better, I'd

137
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:03,041
say you knew the
Bounts were coming.

138
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:05,007
-It's a good thing
you don't know better.

139
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:29,674
NANAO: Captain.

140
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:30,741
Captain, wake up.

141
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:35,574
Captain Ukitake
sent me to find you.

142
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:39,041
He needs to see you at the
Center Library immediately.

143
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:42,174
Captain, I know you're
awake, so quit faking.

144
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:44,807
-Why do you have to use
such a harsh tone of voice?

145
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:48,574
A beautiful face like yours
should sound beautiful.

146
00:07:48,607 --> 00:07:51,507
-Captain Kyoraku, did you
hear what I just said?

147
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,507
-Yeah, I heard.

148
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,307
What's up?

149
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:55,341
Is it some tedious task?

150
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,041
-The material concerning
the item we're investigating

151
00:07:58,074 --> 00:07:59,441
has been lost.

152
00:07:59,474 --> 00:07:59,941
-Hm.

153
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:10,741
-Hm.

154
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:28,674
Hm.

155
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:35,841
[squeak]

156
00:08:57,974 --> 00:08:58,907
-Hey!

157
00:08:58,941 --> 00:09:00,407
Why are you both so quiet?

158
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:01,507
Make some noise.

159
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,907
People are going to
think their TV's broken.

160
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:08,341
You act like you've never seen
a stuffed animal talk before.

161
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:09,841
Hey, I've got an idea.

162
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:11,741
Why don't the three of
us from a trio, huh?

163
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:12,441
Huh?

164
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:14,241
What do you say? [laugh]

165
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:18,574
-Did something happen to you?

166
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:21,741
-[cries] Just listen.

167
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:23,674
RIRIN: I won't do it!

168
00:09:23,707 --> 00:09:26,141
No, no, no, no!

169
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:28,174
-You' can't be so picky.

170
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:29,541
The only stuffed
animals left are

171
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:31,707
some nasty, old,
drool-covered ones left over

172
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,641
from when Karin and
Yuze were just babies.

173
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:34,641
-Forget it!

174
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,307
-Ow!

175
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:35,974
What are you doing?

176
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:37,074
-Look at these.

177
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:39,141
If you think for a
minute you're getting me

178
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:41,541
into one of those disgusting,
ugly rats, you're crazy!

179
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:43,207
If you don't take
this seriously,

180
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,141
I'm gonna tell Kisuke.

181
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:46,341
-Yeah, fine.

182
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:48,974
Just give me some kind
of idea what you want.

183
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:50,041
Come on.

184
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,707
Tell me what to look for.

185
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:53,107
Maybe I can find it.

186
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:55,007
-Let's see.

187
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,007
Well, first of
all, it definitely

188
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,441
has to be something smart.

189
00:09:58,474 --> 00:09:59,907
And it's gotta be graceful.

190
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,507
It should be outwardly
cute, but not

191
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,774
so much as to overshadow
its inner beauty.

192
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:06,174
It should be classy,
but not too formal.

193
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,307
ICHIGO: [sigh] What a pain.

194
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:08,107
-And it shouldn't--

195
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:08,841
ICHIGO: This is good enough!

196
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:09,341
RIRIN: Oh!

197
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:30,074
[scream] What-- what is this?

198
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:34,974
-Well, it's a bird, I think.

199
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,474
-Have you any idea
what you've done?

200
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:39,941
-Once I change bodies,
I can't go back.

201
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:40,907
-Oh, really?

202
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:41,474
-I'm going to be
stuck inside this--

203
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,541
-That's too bad.

204
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:43,907
- --stupid bird for
the rest of my life.

205
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:45,674
-Hey, who's the new kid?

206
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:46,441
Wait.

207
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:47,907
Don't tell me it's Ririn.

208
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:51,674
[laughs] Here you've been
making fun of me all this time,

209
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:52,941
and look at you now.

210
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:54,807
How does it feel, huh?

211
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:56,807
You're just a talking
stuffed animal like me.

212
00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:59,741
And a pretty
stupid-looking one to boot.

213
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:02,574
[shout]

214
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:05,407
-You really ought to be
more careful what you say.

215
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:08,474
I'm in a really
bad mood right now.

216
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:12,007
-[cries] Got it.

217
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,341
-And since then, she started
acting all high and mighty.

218
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,107
And she bosses me
around all the time.

219
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:17,441
It's horrible.

220
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:20,907
Not to mention the fact that
I've got seniority over her.

221
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:21,874
-Hm.

222
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:23,241
Here.

223
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:23,741
-Mm.

224
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,807
Am I right?

225
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:33,074
I say she needs to
show me some respect.

226
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:35,107
I mean, am I the
older Mod-Soul or not?

227
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,841
How will we get
anything done if we

228
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,674
don't follow the proper order.

229
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:41,174
Matter of fact, I think
that if anyone deserves

230
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:43,907
to go to Orihime's house,
it was yours truly.

231
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:46,441
To have her hold me
close and stroke my fur.

232
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:51,741
But that stupid old man-- I'd
like to punch his lights out!

233
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:53,674
I'll just bet Orihime's
suffering right now,

234
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:55,307
not knowing what to
do, because she's

235
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,207
had that old man
forced onto her!

236
00:11:57,241 --> 00:11:59,007
I think we should rush
over there right now

237
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,207
and make sure she's
all right, don't you?

238
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:01,841
-No.

239
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:02,607
Not particularly.

240
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:04,174
-It's settled, then.

241
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,474
If we don't save Orihime
from this horrible fate,

242
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:09,074
then how can we
call ourselves men?

243
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:12,441
[laughter]

244
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:13,341
-Huh?

245
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:15,207
Did you hear that voice?

246
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:18,274
I think-- I think
that Orihime is

247
00:12:18,307 --> 00:12:21,341
in some sort of-- do you
think that he could have-- Or

248
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,774
is it possible he,
uh-- Maybe we should

249
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:27,841
look to see if
the-- [shouts] What?

250
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:29,474
-Peeping is a crime.

251
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:30,907
-Who said anything
about peeping?

252
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:32,974
I just want to look
through the window

253
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:35,907
to make sure
Orihime's all right.

254
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:36,807
ORIHIME: [scream]

255
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:37,507
-Whoa!

256
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,741
I've gotta rescue her!

257
00:12:38,774 --> 00:12:40,574
Here I come, my love!

258
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:41,074
-Hm.

259
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:53,049
-[shout] Huh?

260
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:57,258
-Aw, you're just so cute.

261
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:59,124
Can you believe
how cute you are?

262
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:01,691
-Well, I guest that all
depends on how you look at it.

263
00:13:01,724 --> 00:13:04,200
Although they do say that beauty
is in the eye of the beholder,

264
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,867
and far be it for me
to contradict you.

265
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,134
However, seeing as how
I'm the one inside,

266
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,567
I don't know if cute is
quite the word I'd choose.

267
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,134
-I'm sorry if you don't
like it, Mr. Kurodo.

268
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,534
But I think you look very nice.

269
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,700
You look avant-garde.

270
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:19,700
Very chic.

271
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:24,500
-Hm?

272
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,434

Kurodo.

274
00:13:27,134 --> 00:13:28,334
-Did you feel that?

275
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:29,200
-Whoa, hey.

276
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:30,967
Why'd everybody get so serious?

277
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,467
-A Bount.

282
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,634
They've come!

283
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,500
-A Bount?

00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:16,834
-It's all right.

285
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:18,334
They're far away right now.

-A Soul Reaper.

291
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,967
-I'm just a substitute.

-What business does a substitute
Soul Reaper have with me?

293
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,200
-We've got a small problem here.

294
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,734
You see, I can't let you eat
the souls of living people.

didn't interfere.

But what do I--

302
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,134
-It's all right.

303
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,100
She's just unconscious.

304
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,467
ICHIGO: Wait!

305
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,434
-She's not as vicious
as I expected.

306
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:32,367
But she's still a Bount, so
don't let your guard down

for a second.

How much further is it?

It's just up ahead.

I'm sure you have
some sort of plan.

BOUNT: My plan?

Even if I told
you, there's no way

your feeble mind
could comprehend it.

you're not leaving
