NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

5
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,397
who was kidnapped by Sosuke
Aizen, Ichigo and his friends

6
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,064
snuck into Wakomundo,
and infiltrated

7
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:59,430
Isane's fortress, Las Noches.

8
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:02,464
Upon entering the fortress,
the teams splits up,

9
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,830
and each are engaged
in battle against some

10
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:08,064
of Isane's most
powerful Arrancars.

11
00:02:08,097 --> 00:02:12,764
Uryu encounters Arrancar number
105, Cirruci Sanderwicci,

12
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:15,830
one of the Privarona Espada,
and a deadly opponent.

13
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:19,030
He uses the Seele Schneider,
the only bladed Quincy weapon

14
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:20,897
to fight Cirruci's
released state.

15
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,097
-Ah.

16
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,830
Oh uh.

17
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:32,797
-The way a Quincy battles is
by gathering all of the Reishi

18
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,864
from the surrounding area, and
then utilizing it as a weapon.

19
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:40,030
That which is the most powerful
embodiment of this method

20
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:44,130
is right before you,
the Seele Schneider.

21
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,864
All of your Reishi
belongs to me, now.

22
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:52,830
-Uh.

23
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:54,830
Not a chance, Quincy!

24
00:02:57,364 --> 00:03:01,164
-You should be aware that
Seele Schneider is not a sword.

25
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:03,030
-Ah, uh.

26
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:09,064
-Quincy's don't use any weapons
other than bows and arrows.

27
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:10,030
-Uh, ah.

28
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:18,330
NARRATOR: Meanwhile, Chad
was engaged in fierce combat

29
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:24,264
with Arrancar number 107,
Gantenbainne Mosqueda.

30
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:24,764
-Ah!

31
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:31,530
-Ee, et, oh!

32
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:34,430
Get on your feet, Yasutora Sado.

33
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,597
I know what you're
doing, hiding your power,

34
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,164
the true strength you process.

35
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:42,497
Yes, you are very strong.

36
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,764
Someone like you shouldn't
be fighting like this.

37
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:50,797
This should be a fair fight.

38
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,764
So use all your strength,
and don't hold back.

39
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,964
No answer?

40
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:04,764
Is that it?

41
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:06,430
You're breaking my heart, buddy.

42
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,264
Uh.

43
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:22,864
Uh, Uh.

44
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:25,397
-Sorry.

45
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,997
In truth, I wasn't
trying to hide it.

46
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,830
It's just that ever since
I came to Wakomundo,

47
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:37,064
I sensed something
about my power.

48
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:40,330
Something different from when I
was in the world of the living.

49
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,030
I was puzzled by
that difference,

50
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:53,430
and I wasn't able to control
all of my power until now.

51
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:56,597
But I have finally
gained control of it.

52
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,397
The time has come,
and I can fight

53
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,064
with my full power from now on.

[non-english speech]

55
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,064
-Ah, Uh.

56
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:12,564
-Take note.

57
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:15,597
What you see is my right
arm, but in its truth form.

58
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,764
-Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah bleh.

59
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:22,730
-Ah!

60
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:26,230
Uh, that's disgusting.

61
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:27,164
What's wrong with you?

62
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:28,897
You almost covered me in mucus.

63
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,297
-What are you saying?

64
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,297
This isn't mucus,
it's my special fluid

65
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,530
that makes everything it
touches super slippery.

66
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:39,264
-You mean this gooey
junk is infinite slick?

67
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,797
-Infinite?

68
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,030
What's that?

69
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:44,630
-You forgot, didn't you?

70
00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:47,064
After you used it, you gave
it a name, don't you remember?

71
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,697
-Oh, that's right.

72
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,097
You're smarter than
you look Ichigo.

URYU: [non-english speech].

74
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,730
-It's OK.

75
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:57,430
You shouldn't care so
much about who you are.

76
00:05:57,464 --> 00:06:00,397
-Well, I do care.

77
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,430
Come to think of it,
in the last battle,

78
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:05,064
I thought you ran out
of your infinite slick

79
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:06,664
in the middle of the fight?

80
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:08,630
-That's exactly what
I thought, but it

81
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:11,730
seems it was all stuck
up in there, somewhere.

82
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:14,330
Oh huh, what a waste.

83
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:15,664
Why did you come out now?

84
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:16,930
-Do you plan on collecting it?

85
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:18,097
-If we had a pail.

86
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,364
-It doesn't seem like
something you can recycle.

87
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:20,430
-I hope it don't dry up.

88
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:20,997
Doh!

89
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,030
-What's wrong?

90
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:22,897
-Eh, heh.

91
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,597
This is problematic.

92
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,930
Take a look.

93
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:30,297
This isn't infinite slick,
this is really my mucus.

94
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,264
Ha-ha ha-ha ha- ha, ha.

95
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:34,164
-Stop.

96
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:34,930
Don't come near me.

97
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:35,730
It's nasty.

98
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:37,330
-What are you saying, Uryu?

99
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,230
We're brother
warriors, two friends

100
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:41,697
who share the same mage.

101
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,097
Ha-ha.

102
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,330
-Why is it that you only get my
name right at times like these?

103
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,930
Wash your hands.

104
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:48,197
-Where?

105
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,397
-How should I know?

106
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,030
-Why?

107
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:50,530
Wait, Uryu.

108
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:53,364
-Ee-ah.

109
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:54,864
Huh?

110
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:57,864
This is Chad's
Spiritual Pressure.

111
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:00,364
But it can't be.

112
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:02,630
-Guess who it is?

113
00:07:02,664 --> 00:07:04,964
You're so absorbent, Ichigo.

114
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:06,064
-Ugh, uh.

115
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:08,497
Uh, ugh, uh-uh, eh.

116
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:08,997
Yow.

117
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:19,630
-It wasn't so
clear to me before.

118
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:22,564
No, I probably didn't
want to realize it.

119
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:25,064
Or maybe I didn't
want to accept it.

120
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:27,730
Something fundamental
has changed.

121
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:29,897
From the moment that
I came to Wakomundo,

122
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,230
it felt as if my inner power
suddenly began to stir.

123
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:36,130
The feeling it gave
me was unlike anything

124
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,364
I experienced when I
entered the Soul Society.

125
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:43,864
That stirring continued to
grow stronger and stronger

126
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:47,530
as I came closer to this place.

127
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:50,264
Then, when I was
hit by your attack,

128
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:53,397
I suddenly felt it settle.

129
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,530
It was the first
time it had, and I

130
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:58,664
thought that maybe that
stirring was anticipation.

131
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:03,530
The excitement of
anticipating that soon

132
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:06,830
I would have an
opponent, knowing

133
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:09,030
that I would fight using
all of my strength.

134
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:14,364
But ever since
arriving in Wakomundo,

135
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:16,530
my powers stirred
with excitement,

136
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:18,330
as if it had come home.

137
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,497
It felt like a rough welcome,
and the thing inside me

138
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,597
suddenly realized what it was.

139
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,030
But there's something I've
been wondering about ever

140
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:30,597
since the moment I
gained this power.

141
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,964
I thought to myself,
if my power's not

142
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:36,564
like that of the Soul
Reapers, or Quincy's, then

143
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:38,530
what exactly am I?

144
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:40,230
The questioning is done.

145
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:43,997
I found my answer.

146
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,097
I know why I'm not like them.

147
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,930
I'm different from Soul
Reapers and Quincys.

148
00:08:48,964 --> 00:08:52,097
My powers are closer
to that of Hollow's.

149
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:52,597
-Uh.

150

CHAD: [non-english speech]

Here it is.

152

This is my right
arm's true form.

153
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,930
And its true power.

154
00:09:11,964 --> 00:09:12,430
Mm.

155

-Ew ah.

161
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:43,464
Mm.

162
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:48,230
Hm, mm.

163

00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:57,464
Not only is his power
immense, but he's

167
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:00,164
fast enough to keep
up with my Sonido.

168
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:03,097
Uh.

169
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,530
Ew, ah, uh.

170
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,030
Uh!

171
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:21,897
I can block this.

172
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,197
I can.

173
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,064
Uh ew.

174
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:29,430
-You really did get slower.

175
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:30,030
-Huh?

176
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:33,897
Oh, uh, uh.

177
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,330
Uh.

178
00:10:36,364 --> 00:10:38,030
Uh ah, ugh.

179
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:40,497
Mm, uh, ugh.

180
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,530
His strength is incredible.

181
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:54,997
To him.

182
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,464
Mm.

183
00:10:57,497 --> 00:10:59,430
Raw, ah.

184
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:03,830
Ugh.

185
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:11,230
Mm.

186
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:15,664
He's become much faster
than he ever was before.

187
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:18,130
What do I do?

188
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:23,830
-I believe that in every
world, no powers are the same.

189
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:26,564
They are all different.

190
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:28,764
Power is like an animal.

191
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:32,264
Never predictable,
always changing.

192
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:34,897
Small advantages
are always gained,

193
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,964
no different than it
is with our battle.

194
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,397
-And what's your point?

195
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,197
-Whoever gains the
most advantage, wins.

196
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,630
-That's a good theory,
it's been well thought out.

197
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:52,430
But anyone can win.

198
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:57,664
Hmp.

199
00:11:57,697 --> 00:12:00,097
Huh?

200
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,064
Heh.

201
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:04,430
Hup, huh, ah, uh.

202
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,966
I can't dodge him completely.

203
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:22,330
-So, this is you true
form, and your true power.

204
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:31,430
You are strong,
I'll grant you that.

205
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:35,597
However, you haven't forgotten
about this entirely, have you?

206
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,097
-Ugh.

207
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,330
-You're not the only
one who has the ability

208
00:12:42,364 --> 00:12:44,697
to reveal his hidden power.

209
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,630
Get ready.

210
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:46,597
Rah, rah.

00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:45,371
-Sorry, Gantenbainne.

215
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:50,271
There's actually one thing
that I neglected to tell you.

216
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:52,405
This arm has gone
through a metamorphosis

217
00:13:52,438 --> 00:13:55,505
and become my right
arm's true form.

218
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:58,505
I know, without a
doubt in my mind,

219
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,971
that the spirit of Mirabello
resides within this arm.

220
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,171
Mirabello taught me
how to use power,

221
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:07,271
and to wield my strength
to protect others.

222
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:11,471
-And find a good use for
your big, strong fists.

223
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:13,505
Use them in a way
that helps our world.

224
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:18,805
-Mirabello was right.

225
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,905
I didn't understand at first.

226
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:23,005
But ever since I gained
the power that lay dormant

227
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:26,471
in my right arm,
I knew my purpose.

228
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:31,038
It was a defensive power.

229
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,571
It was during my
training, I looked deep

230
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:36,405
into the core of my being, and
it was there that I found it.

231
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:37,805
It was my defensive power.

232
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:42,405
-Ah, uh-uh uh, eh uh-uh.

233
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:43,805
-This is it.

234
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:54,538
This is Diablo.

235
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:57,905
[non-english speech] Diablo.

236
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:01,038
-Diablo?

Diablo, is it?

241
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:31,071
That's a pretty
pretentious name.

242
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:37,605
Isn't it, Yasutora Sado?

243
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:39,071
Ah, ah!

244
00:15:45,038 --> 00:15:45,971
Eh?

245
00:15:46,005 --> 00:15:48,038
That's enough.

246
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:49,005
Ey ah!

247
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,005
Not so bad, Sado.

248
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,038
-When I'm in a battle, I
always fight it full strength.

249
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:00,871
I don't know any other
way but to give it my all.

What do you know?

252
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:04,871
I suppose my only
choice is to bring

my power to its
maximum level as well.

power because you fought me

at full strength, Gantenbainne.

00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:48,071
Thank you.

278

of the battles that
are in my future.

I'll leave you alive.

Good luck, Arrancar.

282
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:13,138
It's very strange.

283
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,571
This doesn't make any sense.

284
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:17,538
I should still be inside
the building walls.

285
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:25,405
There was supposed to a giant,
domed roof within these walls.

286
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:27,871
Where has the ceiling gone?

287
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:30,305
And outside of these
walls it always

288
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:34,638
appeared to be night,
dark and unchanging.

how is it broad daylight?

And you want to tell me
exactly how you ended up

running in front of me?

304
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:16,009
-It's called seniority.

305
00:20:16,043 --> 00:20:18,109
-And just who made that rule?

00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:19,543
-Nuh, ah.

307
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:20,909
-Woa, what is it?

308
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:22,709
What's wrong, evil doer?

309
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,509
-It's nothing, let's get going.

310
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:25,276
Come on.

311
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,709
-Well, well.

312
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:38,276
At the head of
the pack, are you?

313
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,209
-Uh.

314
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:41,576
Mm.

00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:46,743

00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:48,176
-Heh, ha-ha ha-ha.

317
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:53,276
-Stop!

318
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:08,676
-I can handle it.

319
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:11,143
Mm, arg.

320
00:21:11,176 --> 00:21:14,609
His movements are slow.

321
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:17,343
He's skilled, I can tell
that by looking at him.

322
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:23,276
-What are you doing?

323
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:25,176
Turn, and run.

324
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:26,143
Ew, ah.

325
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:28,009
Run!

326
00:21:28,043 --> 00:21:30,409
-I shouldn't wait
for his first move.

327
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:36,909
I should win with one blow.

328
00:21:36,943 --> 00:21:40,343
Ew, ewt.

329
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:41,343
Oo, ah!

-What was that?

00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:57,276
-Uh?

333
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:02,809
-So that's the best you can do?

334
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,276
