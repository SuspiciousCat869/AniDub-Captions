NARRATOR: Ichigo
and his friends,

5
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:53,356

training and preparation

00:01:56,389 --> 00:02:01,023
when Aizen's elite group of
Arrancars suddenly appeared.

8
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:03,689
Captain Hitsugaya's
advanced troops and Ichigo

9
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,456
stood against the Arrancars,
but they ran into trouble

00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:07,489
fighting the Espada.

11
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,889
However, Aizen's
true goal was to take

12
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:15,989
Orihime Inoue to Hueco Mundo.

13
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,056
Orihime gives in to
Ulquiorra's threats,

14
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:26,689
and agrees to go to Hueco Mundo.

15
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:32,889
She is then given 12 hours to
say goodbye to only one person.

16
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:36,723
And so Orihime goes to Ichigo.

17
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:42,556
-Thank you, Ichigo.

-It was probably Orihime Inoue.

Come immediately, Ichigo.

What's this?

37
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:19,756
Why is everyone standing
here, in Orihime's room?

38
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:21,823
And where is she, anyway?

39
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:23,689
-Well.

40
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,123
-What is the status?

We have regulated

Ukitake?

46
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:36,423
I was looking for
the head captain.

47
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:39,389
-I had him switch to me.

48
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,623
-And your reason?

49
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:44,856
-Because I'm the last person
who saw Orihime Inoue.

50
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,956
Before she went
through the Senkaimon,

51
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:48,989
to return to the
world of the living.

52
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:54,056
Judging by your
reaction, it doesn't

53
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:58,156
appear as though she's arrived
there safely, as I had hoped.

54
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:00,323
-What's the meaning
of this, Jushiro?

55
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:03,089
Where exactly did
she disappear to?

56
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:03,989
Do you know anything?

57
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:09,256
-I'll give you my assessment.

58
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,423
The two guards I had
sent with her when

59
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:19,656
she went through the
Senkaimon came back alive.

60
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:24,489
According to them, it's
likely that Orihime Inoue

61
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:28,256
has either been
abducted, or killed.

62
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:29,023
By the Arrancars.

63
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:33,156
-Killed?

64
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:37,489
-Captain Ukitake.

65
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:39,823
I believe you're
jumping to conclusions.

66
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:41,689
-I understand.

67
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:43,756
I don't want to
believe it, either.

68
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:48,456
I'm simply stating the worst
possible scenario there is.

69
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:50,123
We think it more
likely, however,

70
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:54,656
that Orihime Inoue was
attacked by an Arrancar.

71
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,089
And then disappeared with him.

72
00:05:58,123 --> 00:05:59,089
-Are you kidding me?

73
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:01,189
Is that really all you have?

74
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:02,689
Orihime has disappeared.

75
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:06,623
You say that there's no proof,
and that she might be dead.

76
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:10,789
Well

77
00:06:10,823 --> 00:06:11,923
Take a look at this.

78
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,589
I was seriously injured
in yesterday's battle.

79
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,923
No one here could
heal my wounds.

80
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,656
But when I woke up
this morning, it

81
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,156
was already completely healed.

82
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:22,923
And not only that,
but on my wrist,

83
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:28,023
there's still some of
Orihime's spiritual pressure!

84
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:30,156
Are you still just going
to stand there and tell me

85
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,823
that she might be dead?

86
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:32,489
-I see.

87
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:39,323
That is most unfortunate.

88
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:40,356
-Unfortunate?

89
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,156
Wait, what do you mean by that?

90
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,656
If what you say is
true, then it would

91
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:48,823
be safe to assume that
Orihime Inoue is indeed alive.

92
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:52,323
But at the same time,
unfortunately, it also

93
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:54,856
means that this is
an act of betrayal.

94
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,389
-Act of betrayal?

95
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:59,423
-If you had been
abducted, she would not

96
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:03,323
have had the time to
visit you while you slept.

97
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,256
In other words, the fact
that she healed your wounds

98
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:09,223
before disappearing can
only mean one thing,

99
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:12,889
that Orihime Inoue had
actually volunteered

100
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:14,989
to go along with the Arrancar.

101
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:18,289
Of her own free will.

102
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:20,089
-You better take that back!

103
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:21,556
-Stop.

104
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:23,589
You'll just end up
worsening your position

105
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:27,389
if you say anything else.

106
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:28,656
Sir!

107
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:32,389
I understand what you're
saying, Head Captain Yamamoto.

108
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:34,989
Therefore, as a member
of the advanced troops,

109
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:37,956
and because I am the
lieutenant of Squad Six,

110
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:41,023
I will head over to Hueco Mundo
to bring the traitor, Orihime

-With this new
information, we now

00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:58,523
know that the Arrancars
are ready for battle.

All members of Captain
Hitsugaya's advanced troops

119

are to return immediately,
and defend the Soul Society.

120
00:08:08,223 --> 00:08:11,623
-Are you saying that
Orihime is to be

121

abandoned by us, Head Captain?

122
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:15,389
-Exactly.

123

We cannot risk the safety of the
entire world just to go chasing

with all due respect,

I can't follow that order.

168
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:02,823
This was on the ground outside.

169
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,223
-What is it?

170
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,923
-I have no idea.

171
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:08,289
-Don't pick up things if you
don't know what they are.

172
00:12:08,323 --> 00:12:10,189
-But it was just sitting
there, all alone.

173
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:11,823
Right in front of our place.

174
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,623
I had to pick it up.

175
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:14,189
Oh!

176
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:15,156
What are those?

177
00:12:15,189 --> 00:12:16,556
-Bandages?

178
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:17,756
From Ichigo?

179
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:19,456
Why would he go through
the trouble to send this?

180
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,656
-Why bandages?

181
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:21,156
Huh?

182
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:21,723
How come?

183
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:23,189
Why bandages?

184
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:24,089
Why?

185
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:25,956
Why, why, why, why bandages?

186
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:28,723
-That guy's an idiot.

187
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:30,323
-What should we do
to cheer him up?

188
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:32,189
-Let's bring him dinner.

189
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:33,489
-And what about some ice cream?

190
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:38,189
-No, before that he'll get
a big bear hug from me.

191
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:41,356
Ready, set, let's Ichigo!

192
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:49,589
How unfortunate, I missed.

193
00:12:49,623 --> 00:12:51,456
-Oh, that's too bad.

194
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:53,823
-Hey, Ichigo.

195
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,789
-Look, why don't you
have some dinner.

196
00:12:55,823 --> 00:13:00,256
Otherwise Yuzu won't be
able to clear the table.

197
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:01,623
-I'm sorry.

198
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,623
I don't really feel
like eating today.

199
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:06,523
-But Yuzu prepared all
of your favorite dishes!

200
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:08,523
You have to.

201
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:11,323
-I'm sorry, Yuzu.

202
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:12,289
-Oh, it's all right.

203
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:13,356
Don't worry about it.

204
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,423
I'll put it in the
refrigerator, and you

205
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:17,656
can eat it when you feel hungry.

206
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:19,123
All right, let's go.

207
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:20,523
Come on dad, you too!

208
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:21,956
-Huh?

209
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:22,623
Oh, OK.

210
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:29,956
-That is amazing, Ichigo!

211
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:33,989
You just apologized three whole
times, a new national record

212
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:35,256
for being pathetic!

213
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,089
What's wrong?

214
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,089
You're acting all gloomy again.

215
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,956
I know what it is,
you're constipated.

216
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:49,956
Well, believe me, there's
plenty of other things

217
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:51,656
to get down in the
dumps about, if you'll

218
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:52,589
pardon the expression.

219
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:59,789
Oh, you want to
fight, is that it?

220
00:13:59,823 --> 00:14:02,656
-Sorry, but could
you move, please?

221
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:04,923
-Sorry.

222
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:06,156
Sorry!

223
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:07,356
Hey, wait.

224
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,356
You're acting like you're
completely out of it.

225
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,023
Oh, you're palm reading, huh?

226
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:12,589
Let me take a look at mine!

227
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:22,356
-Well, well, Ichigo.

228
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:27,856
It's been awhile since I've
seen you last, hasn't it.

229
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:29,556
I was sad, thinking
you didn't want

230
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:31,923
to graduate with the
rest of your class.

231
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:35,389
You haven't been hospitalized
due to an accident, have you?

232
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:36,189
-Amazing.

233
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,223
-What do you have to say?

234
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:38,623
-Oh, she's pounding him.

235
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:41,823
-Well, say something
for yourself.

236
00:14:41,856 --> 00:14:43,889
-You changed your hairstyle.

237
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:44,689
-Yes, I did!

238
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:46,423
Thanks for noticing.

239
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:49,323
But I changed it
three weeks ago!

240
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:49,989
-Oh boy.

241
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,023
That has got to hurt.

242
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:53,523
-I know.

-Ichigo, Ichigo,
Ichigo, Ichigo, Ichigo!

245
00:15:05,123 --> 00:15:08,423
Hey, it sure has been
a long time, huh?

246
00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:09,956
-It really has been awhile.

247
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:12,756
What have you been doing
during the month you took off?

248
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,289
We were worried about you.

249
00:15:14,323 --> 00:15:17,289
You didn't even answer
your text messages.

250
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:18,589
-Oh yeah, sorry about that.

251
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:19,423
I was a little busy.

252
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,489
-What are you doing Mizuiro?

253
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:27,356
-Oh, I almost forgot!

254
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:29,689
I was able to get some tickets
for a premiere screening,

255
00:15:29,723 --> 00:15:31,189
if you'd like to come with me.

256
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,389
They're for Bad Shield 2.

257
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:35,423
-When is it?

258
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:37,889
-Oh, it's for the
5th of December.

259
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:43,589
-Yeah, it sounds good.

260
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:46,723
I think I should
be back by then.

261

-Huh?

262
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:48,189
-Thank you, Mizuiro.

263
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:53,223
-Huh?

264
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:55,689
-He'll be back by then?

265
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:56,189
-Ichigo!

266
00:15:58,956 --> 00:15:59,423
-Huh?

267
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:02,789
Tatsuki.

268
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:08,456
What is it?

269
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:09,323
Tell me what's wrong.

270
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:13,289
-It's Orihime.

271
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:14,889
She disappeared.

272
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:16,956
She's not at home, or anywhere.

273
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:22,389
Her entire presence
has disappeared.

274
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:23,223
-Huh?

275
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,389
-It's true.

276
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:26,723
I've been looking all
over the city for her.

277
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:28,189
But I can find her.

278
00:16:28,223 --> 00:16:28,756
She's gone.

279
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:34,256
But you know.

280
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,923
You know where she
went, don't you?

281
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:37,523
Admit it!

282
00:16:43,923 --> 00:16:45,989
-What do you mean by that?

283
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:49,123
Why would I know?

284
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:52,856
Besides, are you even sure
she really disappeared?

285
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,923
Why don't you just try
looking for her again?

286
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:56,323
-Cut it out!

287
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:57,923
I've always been
able to sense her.

288
00:16:57,956 --> 00:17:00,256
But her presence
has disappeared.

289
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:03,823
I can't sense her nearby.

290
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,989
For awhile now, I could
only faintly sense her.

291
00:17:08,023 --> 00:17:10,789
It was as if she was on the
other side of some wall.

292
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:13,823
But yesterday she suddenly
vanished without a trace.

293
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:16,956
And you know something
about this, don't you?

294
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:17,923
I know you do!

295
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:22,989
-Just cut it out.

296
00:17:23,023 --> 00:17:25,856
I told you already,
I don't know.

297
00:17:25,889 --> 00:17:27,123
-Yes you do.

298
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:31,656
And don't think I
don't know, either.

299
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,856
I've seen you.

black robe, and you

go around fighting

as other strange people
wearing the same get up.

with all the lies.

What are you trying to hide?

of your business.

lost your mind?

What am I?

Am I someone who
even matters to you?

314

Do you consider me your friend?

Are you really my friend?

when you were getting beat up.

crying, and tried to help you?

00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:41,789
-Oh yeah, what made
you think that?

333
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:44,456
-Because you thought
I would know a way

334
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:47,189
to get into Hueco Mundo.

335
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:48,623
And you would have been correct.

336
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:55,189
Come inside, Ichigo.

337
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:56,423
I've made some preparations.

338
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,389
I was afraid.

339
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:04,989
Afraid that Aizen would
go after Orihime's power.

340
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:07,989
So I left her out
of this battle.

341
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:09,689
But I was too late.

342
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:15,423
Taking her feelings
into consideration,

343
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:19,489
it was my mistake
to leave her out.

344
00:20:19,523 --> 00:20:23,856
I shall do anything I can in
order to try and help you.

345
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,556
-You sure about that?

346
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:26,989
I mean, after all,
you'd be going

347
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:29,356
against the Soul
Society's decision.

348
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:32,023
-Look, I'm here because I
went against their rules

349
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:32,823
in the first place.

350
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:39,123
-Well, you sure are
a sad sight, Ichigo.

-Hey, Uryu.

353
00:20:48,656 --> 00:20:51,856
Wait a minute, what
are you doing here?

354
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:52,723
-Isn't it obvious?

355
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,889
We're going to Hueco Mundo.

356
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,389
-But Chad.

357
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:04,623
-Kisuke already gave
us all of the details.

358
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:06,289
We're going with you.

359
00:21:06,323 --> 00:21:09,023
-Yeah.

360
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:10,356
-You can't.

361
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:12,723
Look, I appreciate your concern.

362
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:15,123
Both of you.

363
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:16,889
But you're just
not strong enough.

364

-Ichigo!

365
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,356
Now do you think that I'm
still not strong enough?

366
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,489
Believe in us.

367
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:43,389
-Chad.

368
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:45,423
-Don't take this on by yourself.

369
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:46,923
This is what friends are for.

370

-All right!

371
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:54,123
Are we all set?

ready, finally.

There are terrifying Hollows
waiting for you in Hueco Mundo!

Hey, Cone!

Why don't you come
