-Lord Aizen, please.

is about, isn't it?

Is this any way for a Director
General to act, Tosen?

33
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:42,239
-I simply believe that
anyone who disrupts the peace

With no moral

killing is nothing
more than murder.

I'm sure he already
knows about my situation.

150
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:52,439
He seems to know a lot of
things without my telling him.

151
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:55,972
Besides, if he knew a way to
deal with something like this,

152
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:57,806
then he would have
taught it to me

But he didn't.

And the fact that he
never said anything

156

means he doesn't know
how to stop it, either.

00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,806
-I know.

168
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:18,406
It can't go on like this.

169
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,906
-Uh-huh.

170
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:24,672
There.

171
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:26,572
That should do the trick.

172
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:30,206
You'd never find a wide to
take care of you as good as me.

173
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:31,206
-Why would you say that?

174
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:33,606
What are you,
campaigning for a job?

175
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,639
-What did you just say?

176
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:36,606
-Nothing!

177
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,672
I was just thanking
you for taking

178
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:40,106
such good care of my
friend, that's all.

179
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,539
-It was no big deal, really?

180
00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:43,006
In fact, it was my pleasure.

181
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,272
I wouldn't mind it at all
if your friend stayed here

182
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:46,572
for the rest of his life.

183
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,972
Is that a possibility?

184
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:48,906
Hm?

185
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:51,039
-It still wouldn't
be long enough.

186
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:51,506
-Huh?

187
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:52,139
Why?

188
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:52,939
What do you mean?

189
00:11:52,972 --> 00:11:55,172
Not long enough for what?

190
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:58,472
Are you talking about
love and marriage?

191
00:11:58,506 --> 00:11:59,872
Yay!

192
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:01,239
That's it, isn't it?

193
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:02,839
That's what you've
been hinting at!

194
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:03,939
Well don't worry.

195
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:06,106
You may have been a
terribly lonely man who

196
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:08,372
has never known
love up until now.

197
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:10,172
But that won't stop me.

198
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,972
I'm ready for a
serious relationship.

199
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:14,839
-You've only know
the guy 10 minutes.

200
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:16,006
-What are you yapping about?

201
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,739
-Nothing at all!

202
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:17,539
Really!

203
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:19,539
I have to go to school now.

204
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,472
See ya!

205
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:21,706
-Come back here
right now, Keigo.

206
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:22,939
I distinctly heard you
say something negative.

207
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:24,939
I won't have you bad-mouthing
my future husband!

208
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:29,672
-For goodness sake.

209
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:32,439
There seems to be an awful
lot of people absent today.

210
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:36,272
Ishida, Kurasake,
Kuchike, and Sado.

211
00:12:36,306 --> 00:12:38,139
This isn't the first
time for those guys.

212
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:40,139
I wonder what they're up to.

213
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:43,039
Well, since all of them
are Ichigo's friends,

214
00:12:43,072 --> 00:12:45,906
I'm sure they're not
doing anything terrible.

215
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:47,972
I think I'll just let it slide.

216
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:50,472
-Well I'm a friend of
Ichigo's, can I cut class?

217
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:52,939
-No, Mr. Asado, I'm afraid not.

218
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,372
Now class, let's get started.

219
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:57,072
Open your textbooks
to Chapter 6,

220
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:58,672
and being reading
from subheading

221

223
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:12,072
-Guess who?

224
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:15,039
-Why are you playing
silly games, Rangiku?

225
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:15,706
-Wow!

226
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:17,139
Captain, you're amazing.

227
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:20,639
You got it right
on the first try.

228
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:22,939
-You have a very
distinctive voice.

229
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:26,839
-What are doing up
here, playing hooky?

230
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,806
In this world, kids who walk
around in school uniforms

231
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,839
usually have to be in school.

232
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:33,406
-I was preparing my report.

233
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,106
-Tell them how we
kicked their butts

234
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:38,172
after gentei kaijo
was authorized!

235
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:41,372
-Those guys were small fry.

236
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:43,772
They weren't Vasto Lordes.

237
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:48,306
They probably weren't even
the rank below that, Adjuchas.

238
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,139
Don't you understand
what happened here?

239
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:53,072
Even I, a Captain, couldn't
defeat one of their Gillian

240
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:56,206
class without using
full strength.

241
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:58,439
We're out-matched.

242
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:00,239
These guys are
too strong for us.

243
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:04,172
-Yeah!

244
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,872
What's the matter with
you these days, Ururu?

245
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:10,606
You've got to get
with the program.

246
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,606
Who do you think
I'm doing this for?

247
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,772
It's for you, that's who!

248
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:14,739
-Oh.

249
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:19,272
-Your injuries have all healed,
sis, so try being happy, OK?

250
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:21,939
-But I, I just got
better, and I was

251
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:24,172
kind of hoping you would
take it easy on me,

252
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:25,539
and give me some
time to recover.

253
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:26,006
-Forget that.

254
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,006
Come on.

255
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,806
We got to get you
back up to speed.

256
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,239
Yeah!

257
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:32,939
There.

258
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,172
Put some effort into it!

259
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,639
-Can't we do this later?

260
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:36,739
My arm kind of hurts.

261
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:37,739
-All right.

262
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:39,206
That'll be enough
for today, Jinta.

263
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,306
Give her a break.

264
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:41,806
Hm?

265
00:14:44,906 --> 00:14:45,372
-Mr. Urahara.

266
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:49,006
-My, my.

267
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,839
What a pleasant surprise
to see you, Chad.

268
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:54,239
What brings you here?

269
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:54,772
-Please, sir.

270
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,006
Please help.

271
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,506
You must train me.

272
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:00,806
-I beg your pardon?

273
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,239
-That's it for that section.

274
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:03,239
This next part will
be on the test,

275
00:15:03,272 --> 00:15:04,306
so be sure and take notes.

276
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:05,639
-Ichigo.

277
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:09,206
What's happened to you?

00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:48,547
-Good job finding
this place, Ichigo.

281
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,247
My, so serious.

282
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,280
I wonder what that means.

283
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:01,914
Wait, have you finally
decided to join us?

284
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:05,380
I'm sort of impressed
you found our hideout.

285
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:08,380
I don't mean to put you
down, but it is a surprise,

286
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:10,380
considering how much
you usually suck

287
00:16:10,414 --> 00:16:12,380
at detecting spiritual pressure.

288
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:14,947
The bottom line is, I
figured you'd come here.

289
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,380
Eventually.

290
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:18,914
To make it easier for you, we
got together and pumped out

291
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:20,680
as much spiritual
pressure as we could,

292
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:23,147
to help you find your way here.

293
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,114
I guess it must have worked.

294
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:26,980
The fact that you're
here convinces me

295
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:31,047
that you finally decided to come
over to our side, am I right?

296
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,914
-Bite me.

297
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:36,714
-Ah!

298
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,714
-I have no intention of
joining up with you people.

299
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:44,347
I'm not that desperate,
so don't kid yourself.

00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,380
I'm here to use you, Shinji.

-Oh, is that so?

302
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,547
-I came here with
one purpose in mind.

And I'm not leaving
until I get it.

I want you to teach me how to
control the Hollow inside me.

After that, I'm out of here.

How so?

it out of you.

The boy turns out to
be a good fighter.

He seems to be

-Idiot.

319

You'd better get
your eyes fixed.

Can't you see Shinji's
only playing out there?

He's not even breaking a sweat.

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,247
-To be honest, it doesn't
look like Ichigo's bringing

323
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,980
everything he's got
to the fight, either.

324

-Yeah.

I figure that the guy's got
to be pretty freaked out.

Over what?

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,280
-It must be his Hollow.

330
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:44,314
Little punk's scared that
every time he fights,

331
00:18:44,347 --> 00:18:45,914
he's going to release
that inner Hollow

332
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:47,514
and he won't be
able to control it.

333
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:49,647
That's why he wants
it suppressed.

334
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,514
That makes him damaged
goods in my book.

335
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:56,914
Why are we trying so hard
to recruit this guy, anyway?

336
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:57,580
[sigh]

337
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,814
-Hiyori, where are you going?

338
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,280
You shouldn't interfere.

339
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:08,980
-Hachi, add on another
five more force fields.

340
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,080
-Yes, as you wish.

341
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,314
-Ichigo.

342
00:19:16,347 --> 00:19:18,280
You're finished.

343
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:18,780
-Shinji!

344
00:19:18,814 --> 00:19:19,780
Tag out!

345
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,980
Get moving.

346
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:30,914
I told you to keep
up the barrier.

347
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:34,514
-I know, but you didn't give
me enough time to do it.

348
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:35,614
-Fine.

349
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:37,447
Never mind.

350
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,080
Ichigo, let me
tell you something.

351
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:43,847
You've got the wrong
idea about this.

352
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,180
-Oh, is that right?

353
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:46,847
-It's true we've
been playing around

354
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,647
with the idea of letting you
become one of our comrades.

355
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,947
Problem is, it's
not your choice.

356
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,547
You're not the one who
makes the decision.

357
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,847
-What do you mean,
not my decision?

358
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,414
-It means the power to choose
is entirely our choice.

359
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:02,547
The bottom line is,
whether you want to join us

360
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,947
or not is completely up to us.

361
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,747
We look at your power, and after
we determine your strength,

362
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,880
we decide whether we want you.

363
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:11,947
Or not.

364
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,747
It's just that simple.

365
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,547
End of discussion.

366
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,814
So stop coming in here
and making empty threats.

367
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:22,580
You don't have any choice in
the matter, do you understand?

368
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:25,314
If you're powerful, we'll
let you join us, and show you

369
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:26,547
what it means to be a Visored.

370
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,780
We'll even teach you how
to control your Hollow.

371
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:32,347
But if it turns out you're
weak, then you can forget it.

372
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,780
We'll leave you to
become a Hollow,

373
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:36,014
and eventually you'll
die a pathetic death.

374
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,714
Hm.

375
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:44,914
Now, if you get the picture,
let your inner Hollow out.

376
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:47,747
Let's see how powerful you are.

377
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,014
-I won't do it.

378
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:53,480
-You still don't
understand, do you?

379
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:56,447
As I told you, it's
not your choice.

380
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:04,580
-Her inner Hollow.

381
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:06,947
-If you're just too much
of a wimp to Hollowfy,

382
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,547
then it appears I'll have to go
to Plan B. One way or another

383
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,914
I'll get it.

384
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:14,614
I'll drag your
Hollow out, even if I

385
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:17,780
have to end up
beating it out of you.

386
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,680
-Don't be impulsive!

387
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:25,480
-Think about what you're doing!

388
00:21:25,514 --> 00:21:25,980
-Hiyori!

389
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:32,080
-Tell me what
you're so afraid of.

390
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:34,147
A mask doesn't
make you a Vizored.

391
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,380
You still have to
control your Hollow.

392
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:38,480
Don't be afraid, Ichigo.

393
00:21:38,514 --> 00:21:41,547
Although it's true, I'm
not as nice as Shinji.

394
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:48,514
If you don't get over
your fear and Hollowfy--

395
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:49,514
[music playing]

396
00:21:58,747 --> 00:21:59,347
You'll be dead.

397
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:05,247
Because I'm going to kill you.

398
00:22:12,945 --> 00:23:43,483
[theme music]

399
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:45,716
-How on earth did you
build this secret room

400
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,116
inside the hospital?

401
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,850
-I got together with
a contractor right

402
00:23:48,883 --> 00:23:51,116
from the beginning, and
slipped it into the blueprints

403
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,516
on the QT.

404
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,783
-I hate to bring this up, but
do the zoning regulations even

405
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:55,850
permit that?

406
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:59,383
-That builder really
stuck his neck out.
