1
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,738
Yaah!

2
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:55,405
Hrg!

3
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:56,005
Ngh!

4
00:01:59,171 --> 00:01:59,805
Heh!

5
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:09,805
You have absolutely no chance
for victory, and maybe now,
you'll understand why!

6
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:12,805
D'augh!

7
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:14,338
What the...?

8
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:18,071
Heh heh! What's the
matter, Mr. Know-It-All?

9
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:22,305
How dare you attack me!

10
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:25,938
Oh my, surely you of all people
would have noticed by now?

11
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:28,571
I changed places with
my double a while ago.

12
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:32,605
How very disappointing.

13
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:36,638
As a fellow scientist,
I thought you'd be smarter.

14
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:41,838
But as it turns out you're
a fool who cannot even tell
the difference between his
enemy or his own creation.

15
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:45,538
Then you are the original?!
When did you make the switch?

16
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:47,138
Why do you need to know?

17
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:50,438
It's an irrelevant question,
really, but if you insist.

18
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:56,305
<i>I made the substitution</i>
<i>when the lieutenants in</i>
<i>your invading army left for</i>
<i>the World of the Living.</i>

19
00:02:57,271 --> 00:03:03,405
<i>Unfortunately for you,</i>
<i>my power is far beyond the</i>
<i>comprehension of someone with</i>
<i>such a limited intellect.</i>

20
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:05,471
Hrgh!

21
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:07,871
<i>Of course, not everything</i>
<i>went as I had hoped it would.</i>

22
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:10,671
<i>While I managed to swap</i>
<i>places with my Reigai,</i>

23
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:14,338
<i>the other captains who</i>
<i>were supposed to come and</i>
<i>liberate the Soul Society,</i>

24
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:16,071
<i>were taking forever</i>
<i>to get here.</i>

25
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:18,505
<i>As a result, everything</i>
<i>was delayed,</i>

26
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:21,538
and that's the reason
it took so long for
me to reveal myself.

27
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,605
Heh ha ha ha.

28
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:33,371
Wonderful. I admit,
you completely had me,
Captain Kurotsuchi.

29
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:35,105
However...

30
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:39,238
It's best not to forget,
no matter how clever you
think you are,

31
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:41,105
you're playing
on my field.

32
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,071
Such youthful arrogance!

33
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:46,738
D'augh!

34
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:51,371
I'll teach you a lesson,
my friend.

35
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:52,971
You've made one
small error.

36
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:54,938
Perhaps a fatal one.

37
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,638
You've pissed me off!!!

38
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:02,371
[gasp]

39
00:04:02,571 --> 00:04:04,171
I said, who are you?!

40
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:06,171
Huh?

41
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,271
Ichigo!

42
00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:10,438
Guys?

43
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:14,305
Does this mean...
I'm in the World
of the Living?

44
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:16,871
Yes, that's right.

45
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:21,638
Well hello there.
I see you've finally
come around, Ichigo.

46
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:23,638
Kisuke... Nozomi.

47
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:28,305
You said you were going
to defeat Kageroza.

48
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:29,071
<i>Huh?</i>

49
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:32,371
You promised you'd end this
quickly and come back to us!

50
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,005
Uh...

51
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:36,305
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:39,705
We all thought we lost you!
That you were--!

53
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:45,071
I guess I blew it, huh?

54
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:48,271
At least I was able to make
it back here in one piece.

55
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:49,738
Ah!

56
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,605
That reminds me, Renji.

57
00:04:58,638 --> 00:05:01,505
When I was stuck in there,
were you the one who rescued
me from the Cleaner?

58
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:03,638
Huh? That wasn't me.

59
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,405
All I did was bring you back
here after I found you passed
out in the Precipice World.

60
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:11,438
[Ichigo]
Then, who was that Soul Reaper?

61
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:18,238
[Kisuke]
So, Ichigo. You were swallowed
by the Cleaner, after all.

62
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:19,838
Uh?

63
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:22,305
Do you know something
about this, Kisuke?

64
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:24,305
Yeah, I do.

65
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:28,005
But before we get into that,
would you like some tea first?

66
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,305
Rrgh!

67
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:37,971
Agh!

68
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,805
Not a bad move, Inaba.

69
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:44,571
I had no idea, after all
this time, that you
excelled in close combat.

70
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:47,005
I wish I could say
the same for you.

71
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,405
Did you really think you
could capture me with
this silly little toy?

72
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:53,771
Oh come on!
Don't get so
full of yourself!

73
00:05:56,538 --> 00:06:00,071
That act was just designed
to buy me a little more time.

74
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:03,838
Let me guess...
For Ashisogijizo?

75
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:07,138
But if you recall, as I
mentioned to you earlier,

76
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,838
everything you see around
you is under my control.

77
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:17,771
Really? Because once my
Ashisogijizo strikes anyone,
it renders their limbs useless.

78
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:23,005
<i>Ordinarily, by this point,</i>
<i>I would expect you'd be</i>
<i>unable to move.</i>

79
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:27,205
But maybe not in this case,
since you're telling me you
were already prepared.

80
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:28,438
[chuckle]

81
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,138
I don't suppose you'd
mind if we gave it a
little test, then?

82
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:31,838
Huh?

83
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:34,571
Tell you what, I'll even make
it a sporting proposition.

84
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:36,171
I'll keep my eyes closed.

85
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:39,838
And if you find you're
able to move, you go
ahead and attack me.

86
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,571
Huhh??

87
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:43,605
Well? Come on!
I'm waiting!

88
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:44,571
Heh heh.

89
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:49,805
I'm not falling for any
of your mind games,
Captain Kurotsuchi.

90
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:51,871
<i>Your action</i>
<i>clearly suggests</i>

91
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:55,105
this is a trap to lure... me...?

92
00:06:57,738 --> 00:06:58,438
[gasp]

93
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:01,171
I'm opening my eyes!

94
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:02,638
Auggh!

95
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,005
[wet cough]

96
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:14,338
This can't be!
My body's moving!
So why...?!

97
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:16,871
This is the reason.

98
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:17,838
What?!

99
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:24,138
When I first attacked you,
I took the liberty of injecting
this drug into your body.

100
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,971
He he he he!

101
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:31,138
Can you tell?
It's very powerful.
It stops all thought processes.

102
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:34,305
Stops... thought?!

103
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:36,538
Heh heh!

104
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:43,171
If I had suddenly slashed at
you, your defensive instincts
would have probably allowed
you to avoid the attack.

105
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:48,205
Instead, I allowed you
time to think about
how I would attack,

106
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:50,771
<i>and therefore, how you</i>
<i>would deal with it.</i>

107
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:57,271
So you're saying you
used your drug to
muddle those thoughts?

108
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:04,738
Inaba. Do you know what a
scientist fears most in this
world, above all else?

109
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:07,705
It's oblivion, my friend.

110
00:08:10,238 --> 00:08:15,238
<i>We scientists measure our</i>
<i>lives in the ways we develop</i>
<i>and expand our knowledge</i>
<i>through myriad variations.</i>

111
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:18,238
<i>Nothing can take its place.</i>
<i>It's our very soul.</i>

112
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:22,438
I have done the worst thing one
scientist can do to another.

113
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:25,638
<i>I have altered the very nature</i>
<i>of your thought processes.</i>

114
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:31,505
When my drug takes full
effect, you will find that
your mind has completely
lost the ability to think.

115
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:36,238
Try as you might, you will
be unable to use the
knowledge you've accumulated
up to this moment.

116
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:39,738
Your mind and its
memories will be
consigned to oblivion.

117
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,105
Rrrgghh!!

118
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:49,271
[Kisuke]
Those who stray from
within the confines of the
fixed Precipice World

119
00:08:49,305 --> 00:08:52,071
are condemned to wander
within it for all eternity,

120
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:55,471
<i>until they are swallowed</i>
<i>by the Restrictive</i>
<i>Current, or Cleaner.</i>

121
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:56,938
[sips]

122
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,238
...And then perish.

123
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:01,905
This is something that you
are all well aware of.

124
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:08,771
Of course, there are several
ways to escape from it before
that happens, as demonstrated
by Captain Kurotsuchi.

125
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:13,671
<i>But to be swallowed by a</i>
<i>Cleaner and survive as</i>
<i>Ichigo has, is unheard of.</i>

126
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:15,838
Then what happened?

127
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:16,638
I don't know.

128
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:17,371
Huh?

129
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:18,938
How would I?

130
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:21,971
After all, as I mentioned,
it's never happened before.

131
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:24,538
I do plan to look into it.

132
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:26,071
[sip]

133
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:28,471
But I don't expect to
find a quick answer.

134
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:31,005
Well that's just great.
You're a big help.

135
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:36,871
<i>However, I did find out</i>
<i>the reason why Kageroza</i>
<i>is so obsessed with the</i>
<i>Precipice World.</i>

136
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:37,671
<i>[Renji]</i>
<i>You did?</i>

137
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:38,605
<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

138
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:40,971
Here's what I
discovered.

139
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:45,105
For years, Kageroza was
studying control and use
of the Precipice World.

140
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:48,505
But that alone was not
his most important
consideration.

141
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:49,971
What do you
mean by that?

142
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:53,171
I'm saying that his
intentions lay elsewhere.

143
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:57,405
The research was simply
an instrument needed to
achieve his true purpose.

144
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:03,205
He was trying to obtain specific
information that was hidden deep
within the Precipice World.

145
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:09,405
[Kagerosa]
[gasps, moans]

146
00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:17,471
Well, now.
What's the matter?

147
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:19,138
[choked growling]

148
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:21,438
What are you
waiting for?!

149
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,238
<i>Hurry up and</i>
<i>finish him off!</i>

150
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:27,871
HUAAAGHHH!

151
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:28,571
Hmm?

152
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,905
<i>[Kagerosa]</i>

Not only did he
out-maneuver me from
the very beginning,

155
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:45,905

Huh?

162
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:05,905
And how did you reach
that conclusion?

163
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:08,371
It's just that you
look... weak!

164

[gasp]

166
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,638
Rrrgh! No one

167
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:17,038

Huh! So the drug can stop
one's thought process,

170
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:31,505
but not emotions as strong
as hatred and anger.

171
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:34,205
Didn't expect that.
What a surprise!

172
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:37,805
Rrrgh.

173
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:38,771

<i>What does he have there?</i>

175
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:44,205

<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

179
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:57,071
I was able to determine
that Kageroza's objective in
studying the Precipice World,

180
00:11:57,105 --> 00:12:00,905
was to obtain
information hidden there
regarding Mod Souls.

181
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:02,405
Huh?

182
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:07,938
What are Mod Souls,
specifically?

183
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:10,138
I know! I know!
Here! Here!

184
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:12,371
I'll explain.
There's a history
involved.

185
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:16,638
Years ago, an experiment
took place.

186
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:20,038
The Soul Society came up with
a project called 'Spearhead'.

187
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:25,238
The plan was to place artificial
souls, specialized for battle,

188
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:27,605
inside the bodies
of deceased humans.

189
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:30,338
These bodies would then
be used as advance troops

190
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:33,005
whenever Soul Reapers were
forced to confront Hollows.

191
00:12:33,038 --> 00:12:34,238
Heh heh.

192
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,771
It's been a while
since you 'graced'
us with your art.

193
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:37,605
What was that?

194
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:38,371
Never mind!

195
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:39,438
It's not important!

196
00:12:39,471 --> 00:12:40,438
Keep going!

197
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:42,071
Your drawings
suck.

198
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:42,805
Huh??

199
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,671
I- I- I...

200
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:47,071
Blegh...

201
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:50,405
The project was
abandoned as being
reprehensible.

202
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:54,005
But the result of the
experiment was the
development of Mod Souls.

203
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:55,405
She's right.

204
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:57,505
Kon here is one
of the surviving
Mod Souls.

205
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:06,571
Guh... Gah!
Nnnngh... Sshh...

206
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:09,538
Oh my. Apparently you've
lost the power of speech,

207
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:11,505
which is extremely
unfortunate for me,

208
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:14,938
since I wanted to ask why you
possess Mod Soul technology.

209
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:18,305
[forced out]
Oh I can still speak,
Mayuri Kurotsuchi.

210
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:21,305
Clearly there's something
you haven't understood.

211
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:22,871
From the very
beginning...

212
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,805
...I've been operating
at a different level.

213
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:42,971
Agh!

214
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:45,205
Yaah!

215
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:47,438
Huaaghh!

216
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:57,971
YAAHHHHH!

217
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:11,152
YAAHHHHH!

218
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:13,119
Unh...

219
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:23,486
And what do we have here, hmm?

220
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:24,986
Hmpf!

221
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:27,719
In the simplest of terms...

222
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:30,952
What you're seeing is an
alternative use of Mod Souls.

223
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:34,086
So did that spark
your interest?

224
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:38,052
Oh yes. You made the Mod
Soul you just swallowed...

225
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,486
...take the fall.

226
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,152
It's suffering the effects
of the drug I injected you
with, earlier.

227
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:45,286
Yes. It's not a
perfect technique.

228
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,352
but it does get
the job done.

229
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:50,819
Huh?

230
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:56,919
Huh?

231
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,152
Stop!

232
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:02,452
Hmpf!

233
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,686
<i>[Uryu]</i>
<i>But how did you find out that</i>
<i>the Mod Soul data was hidden</i>
<i>in the Precipice World?</i>

234
00:15:10,186 --> 00:15:11,152
<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>Pure chance.</i>

235
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,786
I got suspicious.

236
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:16,952
It was when we went into
the Precipice World to
retrieve Ichigo.

237
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:22,186
<i>I sensed there was something</i>
<i>odd about the Reishi that</i>
<i>was lingering around his</i>
<i>unconscious body.</i>

238
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:24,719
<i>When I did an analysis</i>
<i>there on the scene,</i>

239
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:29,819
<i>I was surprised to find</i>
<i>fragments of previous Mod</i>
<i>Soul development data mixed</i>
<i>in with the Reishi itself.</i>

240
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:36,186
I realized that Kageroza had
used that data to create the Mod
Souls of the Squad Captains.

241
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:47,686
<i>[Nozomi]</i>
<i>You're absolutely right.</i>

242
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:48,586
Huh?

243
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,186
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Nozomi?</i>

244

Tell us, Kageroza.

245
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:06,552
How did you know that
the information on the
Mod Souls was hidden in
the Precipice World?

246
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:08,152
You might as well
spill it, pal.

247
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:11,886
You might think you can still
keep some things secret, but
with a little more time,

248
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,052
we're going to find
out everything anyway.

249
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,419
So why don't you tell
us who you really are?

250
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,786
[Orihime]
Nozomi?

251
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,119
<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>I see now.</i>
<i>You knew, didn't you?</i>

252
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:37,852
All right, then..
Let me tell you.

253
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:40,019
He's the one.

254
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:42,286
I'm the one.

255
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:46,519
...who originally
developed the Mod Souls.

256
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:50,752
You developed the Mod Souls?
Well that's just absurd.

257
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,752
I'm telling you
all the truth!

258
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:56,019
Explain yourself.

259
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,586
<i>When Project Spearhead</i>
<i>was scrapped,</i>

260
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:05,819
<i>it was decided that</i>

<i>supporting research done</i>
<i>up until that point,</i>

261
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:07,219
would all be
destroyed.

262
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,452
<i>The science behind the</i>

263
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:16,419
<i>The Mod Souls I was</i>
<i>striving to create, were to</i>
<i>be incubated from a portion</i>
<i>of a Soul Reaper's Reishi.</i>

264
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:20,019
<i>From that, they would</i>
<i>inherit the Soul Reaper's</i>
<i>mental structure,</i>

265
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:23,652
<i>but their physical</i>
<i>capabilities would be</i>
<i>far more advanced.</i>

266
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,386
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

267
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:29,319
This was sublime research,
years ahead of its time,

268
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:31,386
that approached the
realm of the gods!

269
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,652
However, your research
was too dangerous.

270
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:39,819
<i>Project Spearhead was</i>
<i>dispensed with because</i>
<i>the Central Forty Six</i>

271
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:43,952
<i>recognized the immorality</i>
<i>of using the dead as</i>
<i>implements of battle.</i>

272
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:47,352
<i>That was the reason</i>
<i>they presented.</i>

273
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:49,219
<i>But that wasn't</i>
<i>the real reason.</i>

274
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:56,252
The unrestricted power to
control the capabilities
of Mod Souls was judged to
be an unacceptable threat.

275
00:17:57,552 --> 00:18:00,952
You're correct.
The fools feared
my research.

276
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:03,819
I found that unacceptable...

277
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:07,586
<i>...and I determined I</i>
<i>had to take action.</i>

278
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:11,686
<i>Before everything</i>
<i>could be destroyed,</i>

279
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:14,886
<i>I converted the immense</i>
<i>amount of information I</i>
<i>had developed,</i>

280
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,719
<i>into special Reishi.</i>

281
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:19,486
<i>I then hid that Reishi</i>
<i>in the Precipice World.</i>

282
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:26,852
<i>[Nozomi]</i>
<i>After that, Kageroza spent</i>
<i>the next several years</i>
<i>studying the Precipice World.</i>

283
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:30,486
He then retrieved
the information from
inside the Cleaner.

284
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:34,452
So that's how
this came about!

285
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,152
[Kon] [nervous laughs]
Heh! Heh!

286
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,986
That explains
quite a bit,
actually.

287
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:44,319
It finally comes out that
this bastard is the one who
originally created Mod Souls!

288
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:45,186
Kon...

289
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:49,452
It all makes sense now.
It's no wonder you
couldn't trust me, Nozomi.

290
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:51,819
You're wrong!
That's not
the reason!

291
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:56,386
Then what is it?!
You've kept me at arm's
distance all this time,
pushed me away!

292
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:57,586
Come on, stop it!

293
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,219
It's
obvious!

294
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:02,919
You thought of me as
nothing more than one of
Kageroza's creations!

295
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:06,319
Please just listen to me!
He didn't create you!

296
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:08,852
And how in the world could
you possibly know that?!

297
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:11,119
Well... Because...

298
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:12,719

00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,119
I couldn't stand the idea
of losing everything...

303
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:37,486
of having my creations ripped
away from me, forgotten, and
buried in time.

304
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:42,019
Is that why you came up with
the idea of resurrecting
Project Spearhead?

305
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:43,686
That's right!

306
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,586
I will rule the
Soul Society!

307
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:48,152
You will bow before
my invading army!

308
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,019
Raaahh!

309
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,219
Their power has
skyrocketed!

310
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:14,852
[Kageroza]
Ha ha ha ha ha!

311
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:18,686
Until this moment,
my forces were
holding back their power!

312
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:23,052
Now you will see the true
capabilities of Reigai!

313
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:24,786
<i>Observe.</i>

314
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:37,419
He brought them
all back to life?!

315
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:38,752
Well...

316
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:40,619
They are Mod Souls,
after all.

317
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:44,719
As long as he retrieves
their core, he can make any
number of spares he wants.

318
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:47,852
I'm afraid it's much
more than just numbers.

319
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:54,019
I doubt even you could create
Reigai that would be able to
channel and withstand this
much Spirit Energy!

320
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,052
Shunsui!

321
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:58,519
Oh, boy. Here we go again.

322
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:02,419
Interesting.
This guy has got
my attention.

323
00:21:02,786 --> 00:21:03,919
Lady Yoruichi!

324
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:05,052
Right.

325
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:13,986
Ya-haa!

326
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:30,452
Soi Fon!

327
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:32,852
Agh!

328
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:43,052
In your current condition,
none of you can expect to win.

329
00:21:45,186 --> 00:21:47,919
Ha ha ha ha ha!

330
00:21:47,952 --> 00:21:52,519
Ha HA HA HA HA HA HA!

331
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:56,519
The truth is...

332
00:21:57,886 --> 00:22:00,352
<i>...out of all the Mod Souls</i>
<i>that have been created...</i>

333
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:05,452
...I was the first.

<i>Hey Nozomi, if you're a Mod</i>
<i>Soul, that means part of your</i>

335
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:53,795
It's definitely not your boobs,
so I'm guessing it's your--

00:23:53,828 --> 00:23:54,762
[squeaky punch]
