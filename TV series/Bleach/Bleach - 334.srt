1
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:54,658
Now my Raiku
is even stronger
than before!

2
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:58,367
It has the powers
of both Head
Captain Yamamoto's
Ryujinjaka--

3
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,377
--and the
Substitute
Soul Reaper's
Getsugatensho!

4
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:06,653
(Kageroza)
As strong as
you are, Head
Captain...

5
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:11,497
You won't be able
to remain unscathed
after an attack of
such immense power!

6
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,446
[evil laughter]

7
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,159
The time has
come! This ends
right now!

8
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:30,507
Oh no!

9
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,311
Get out,
Head Captain!

10
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:33,714
[gasp]

11
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:36,487
[fighting growl]

12
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:42,467
Out of my
way, girl!

13
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:48,681
No! What
are you
doing!?

14
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,462
Nozomi!!!

15
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:16,311
[struggling grunts]

16
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:22,825
[gasp]

17
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:24,663
Stop! It's
too much!

18
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:29,374
[struggling gasps]

19
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,717
What is she
doing?

20
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,790
Is she trying
to protect me?

21
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:40,866
[gasp]

22
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:45,042
You will not
survive if you
absorb any more!

23
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:47,981
Now stop
this!

24
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:52,658
[strained grunts]

25
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,835
Stop resisting!
Or you'll die!

26
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:57,838
[grunt]

27
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:02,716
Out of
the way!

28
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:04,586
[grunt]

29
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,443
[attack yell]

30
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,983
[attack yell]

31
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,073
Nozomi...

32
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:30,812
[gasp]
Ahh!

33
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:37,628
(Kageroza)
[grunt as he
hits the ground]

34
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:39,031
Head Captain!

35
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:40,935
Old Geezer!

36
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:43,909
[painful grunt]

37
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:47,016
Don't move, Head
Captain. We're
gonna take care
of you.

38
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:49,455
Hm?

39
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:54,633
Hey, Nozomi!
I got ya! Ah!
Ah! Ah!

40
00:04:56,503 --> 00:04:58,708
Or maybe
not...

41
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:01,481
Why..?

42
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:03,820
What do
you mean?

43
00:05:03,854 --> 00:05:06,359
Why protect
a Mod Soul
like me?

44
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:09,800
Do not get
the wrong idea,
foolish child...

45
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:15,914
(Genryusai)
It'll take over a thousand
years before I need to be
protected by someone like you.

46
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:20,057
Besides, you may be
a Mod Soul, but you
are still a young girl.

47
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:22,463
[touched sigh]

48
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:26,104
Huh!? Stop acting
like you don't care,
you Old Geezer!

49
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:29,612
[grunt]

50
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,516
(Rukia)
Head Captain!

51
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:35,124
Hey Geezer!
You okay?

52
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:37,497
Head Captain...

53
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,135
[angry grunt]
Damn it...

54
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:42,441
Rukia! He's
coming!

55
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,145
Right..!

56
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:51,528
[heavy breaths]

57
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,465
Huh?
(Ichigo)
[coughing]

58
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:57,442
[gasp]
W-where's
Kageroza?

59
00:05:57,475 --> 00:06:00,482
Ichigo...
Over there!

60
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:03,522
[gasp]

61
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,622
[grunting
and groaning]

62
00:06:21,763 --> 00:06:24,102
K-Kageroza...

63
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,775
That bastard
won't quit!

64
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:32,220
Nozomi...
You're okay...
That's good.

65
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:42,243
Heh, you know
it's useless.

66
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:45,651
(Kageroza)
You can't fight
me with your
broken Zanpakto.

67
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,622
[gasp]

68
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:50,495
[evil chuckle]

69
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:01,186
Substitute
Soul Reaper...

70
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:08,067
Why do you insist
on trying to stop
me from doing what
must be done!?

71
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:12,946
Nozomi doesn't
want to go with
you, that is
why...

72
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:14,516
...so get
lost!

73
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:18,792
(Kageroza)
Doesn't want
to? Really?

74
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:22,634
You're sure
that's how she
feels about it?

75
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,172
What do
you mean?

76
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:28,080
Are you that out
of it!? There's no
way in hell she
wants to go with you!

77
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:35,129
[chuckle]
the creator of Nozomi
and myself, in other
words, her father...

78
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:40,708
All his research
is about to be
completed...

79
00:07:40,742 --> 00:07:42,746
"Completed?"

80
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,721
You mean taking
over the World of
the Living and the
Soul Society!?

81
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:48,693
We're not gonna
allow that to
happen!

82
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:51,098
That wouldn't
make Nozomi
happy at all!

83
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:58,249
But it should, it
would please me,
so I think that would
make her happy as well.

84
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,257
Stop spouting
such nonsense!

85
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:04,362
Nozomi is nothing
at all like you!

86
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:10,876
[hearty laughter]

87
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:13,015
(Kageroza)
Forgive me...
[louder laughter}

88
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:14,952
What is so
funny?!

89
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:20,933
You. You talk as though
you understand Nozomi
completely, better
than I do...

90
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,302
[chuckle]

91
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,646
(Kageroza)
Unfortunately for you,
no one could possibly
understand Nozomi--

92
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:29,386
--better than
I do... No one.

93
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:32,291
Huh..!?

94
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:36,167
[sigh]

95
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,406
(Kageroza)
[laughter]

96
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,678
What are you
talking about?

97
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:42,949
It's quite
simple you
see...

98
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:47,727
(Kageroza)
Nozomi and I were both
born from the Reishi of
a single Shoul Reaper--

99
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,976
--Which makes us
much closer than
you think.
[laughter]

100
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,646
(Kageroza)
[increasing laughter]

101
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,019
So what's
that mean!?

102
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:01,323
Exactly what
it sounded like.

103
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:05,300
Hey, Nozomi!
What the hell's
he talking about?

104
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,972
I don't get
what this
jerk's saying!

105
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:11,379
[gasp]

106
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:13,819
At least say
something to us!

107
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,293
(Kon)
This is some
kind of joke,
right?

108
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:22,205
(Kon)
Come on, Nozomi
I'm serious!

109
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,109
Oh?
{gasp]

110
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:35,701
Well, it seems
you haven't
forgotten.
[laughter]

111
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:39,944
Hey! Quit
laughing at
everything!

112
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:42,384
You see, Nozomi's
always known that--

113
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:46,493
--if she was
captured, we
would become
one again!

114
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:50,334
And that she
would become
your enemy--

115
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:53,943
(Kageroza)
That's why she kept
trying to push all
of you away from her.

116
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:56,850
(kageroza)
To make things
easier for her.

117
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:01,026
Isn't that
right, Nozomi?

118
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,868
(Kageroza)
But sadly for you,
you began to feel
an attachment to--

119
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:10,079
(Kageroza)
--these people who
tried to help and
protect you, didn't you?

120
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,416
So tell me,
what's your
name?

121
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,485
(Ichigo)
Where are you
from?

122
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:14,422
I won't say...

123
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:16,327
(Nozomi)
Go away,
pervert!

124
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:19,400
(Nozomi)
Keep your
hands off me,
ya pervert!

125
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,840
Not my problem...

126
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:27,886
(Ichigo)
Look, don't worry about
it, Nozomi. From here
on, we'll protect you.

127
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,359
(Nozomi)
That won't be
necessary.

128
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:33,065
(Nozomi)
I'll fix things so
you won't have to
protect me!

129
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:40,048
(Nozomi)
If I enter the precipice
world, and close the gateway,
then no one will find me.

130
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,992
(Kon)
Ichigo and the others,
lll of us have said
we'll protect you!

131
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:47,397
(Kon)
Are you sure
this is what you
really want?

132
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:50,338
(Kon)
Lot's of good things
will happen if you
keep on living.

133
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:53,310
(Nozomi)
You lousy guys
are all alike,
you're perverts!

134
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:55,248
(Ichigo)
Don't go lumping
me in with him!

135
00:10:55,282 --> 00:10:58,990
(Ichigo)
Anyway... I don't
know why I want
to protect you.

136
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:04,970
(Ichigo)
Except that I heard a
voice, and it told me I'm
supposed to help you out.

137
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:11,084
(Nozomi)
[chuckling] Boy, you
really are an idiot,
aren't you?

138
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:14,325
(Nozomi)
I'm such a
burden...

139
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:17,365
(Nozomi)
Everyone here is
doing all they can
to protect me...

140
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,171
(Nozomi)
...but I don't
have the power to
protect them...

141
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:24,515
(Nozomi)
But then, when I
thought of how I
wanted to protect you...

142
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:27,554
(Nozomi)
Suddenly I had
this sword...

143
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:37,210
That's why she
wouldn't answer you
when you asked her
questions...!

144
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:41,419
I've heard enough!
I'm not gonna let
you manipulate her!

145
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:44,593
You can't just
come in here and
tell her what to
do or think!

146
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:50,540
Mod Soul! Nozomi is
me and I am Nozomi.

147
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:56,420
(Kageroza)
Go ahead! Ask
Nozomi if what I'm
saying is true!

148
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:58,625
Nozomi...

149
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:07,043
(Kageroza)
[evil laughter]

150

I slipped down

that for me!?

Why do I
always end up
getting saved--

306
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:56,536

But then I'm not able
to do anything to help
those who've helped me.

307
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,548
