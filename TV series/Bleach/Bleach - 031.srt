00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,587
-You seem to think just because
you fought me once before, back

4
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:48,987
there in the world
of the living,

5
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:51,287
that now you know my true power.

6
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:54,587
Well, let me tell you
something, you amateur.

7
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,921
Whenever captain or
lieutenant rank Soul Reapers

8
00:01:56,954 --> 00:02:01,654
are sent outside, severe
limits are placed on our powers

9
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:05,287
so that we won't adversely
affect the world of the living.

10
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:08,254
My strength right
now is five times

11
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:10,154
what it was that
first day we met.

12
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:14,121
So no matter how confident you
are or how strong you become,

13
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:18,787
there's still no way
you can defeat me.

14
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:19,854
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): I see.

15
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:26,954
I suppose that means
that last attack of yours

16
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:28,454
was you best shot.

17
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:44,887
Because that didn't have
any effect on me at all.

18
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:48,954
So thank you.

19
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:52,421
If all I have to worry about
is 11 more like that one,

20
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:54,787
then I think I'm going
to be just fine, Renji.

21
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,987
-I'm going to enjoy this.

22
00:03:31,554 --> 00:03:34,221
-Ichigo, you're hurt.

23
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:36,554
-Are you all right?

24
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:37,521
-Yeah.

25
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:38,987
It's nothing for
you to worry about.

26
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:45,454
-That's amazing.

27
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:47,454
I-I can't believe it.

28
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:49,654
How does he still remain
standing in the condition

29
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,621
that he's in?

30
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:56,554
-(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE) Damn.

31
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:59,021
My vision's getting blurry.

32
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:00,521
And my legs won't stop shaking.

33
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:07,554
Quit shaking, damn it.

34
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:09,921
-Heh.

35
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:13,254
You talk big, but it seems
that standing is about all

36
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,021
you can manage to do right now.

37
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:15,521
Heh.

38
00:04:19,454 --> 00:04:20,387
It's over.

39
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:29,587
If you didn't exist and
she'd never met you,

40
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:33,254
Rukia wouldn't have to
go through all of this.

41
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:34,187
[grunts]

42
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,654
[gasp]

43
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:36,287
-Move, Ichigo!

44
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:45,121
-You won't get away.

45
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:55,987
-Ichigo.

46
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,954
[gasp]

47
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:59,454
-No way.

48
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:01,954
This is impossible.

49
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:04,154
It's madness, trying to
take on a lieutenant.

50
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:16,387
-Izuru, this is--

51
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,521
-It's Renji's lieutenant badge.

52
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:20,321
-I know this looks
suspicious, but he

53
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:23,321
did disappear in the
middle of the meeting.

54
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:27,121
I was worried about him, so I
went to the Squad 6 barracks.

55
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:29,187
And this badge is
all that I found.

56
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:30,421
It was in front of his office.

57
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:37,054
-Now tell me, are the
captains aware of this?

58
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,554
-Uh, I haven't told them.

59
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:42,387
-I see.

60
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:44,287
-At first, I thought
about telling

61
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:46,954
Captain Aizen about
what I'd found,

62
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:49,854
but I didn't want Renji to be
punished because of something I

63
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,554
had said.

64
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:53,721
-Until we know exactly
what's going on,

65
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,354
that was a very wise decision.

66
00:05:56,387 --> 00:06:00,287
-Izuru, what could
this mean, for him

67
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:04,621
to remove this before he left?

68
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:07,921
-It must mean
something important.

69
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:13,154
Recently, Renji has been mulling
over the Rukia Kuchiki case.

70
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:14,354
All right.

71
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:15,954
I'll see if I can find out
what's happened to him.

72
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:49,321
-You stubborn fool.

73
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:52,087
You really want to
save her that much?

74
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,454
-You idiot.

75
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:57,687
No, not "want," I will.

76
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:00,287
-Don't mess with me!

77
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:02,787
Don't you understand Rukia
was condemned to die?

78
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:05,387
And that's because
you stole her powers.

79
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:10,554
Don't you get it, Ichigo?

80
00:07:10,587 --> 00:07:12,421
It's all your fault.

81
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:15,854
It's your fault that
Rukia is going to die.

82
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:23,254
-You think I don't know that?

83
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:27,821
That's the reason
why I will save her.

84
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:38,621
(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE) I think
I finally figured him out.

85
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:41,221
His limit is three attacks.

86
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:42,987
-OK, listen up.

87
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:45,721
Now, when it comes down
to the heat of the battle,

88
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:47,021
remember this one thing.

89
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:48,987
The stronger the attack,
the more limitations

90
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:51,287
will be put upon the
number of the attacks.

91
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,587
-How so?

92
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:57,187
-Well, let's look
at it this way.

93
00:07:57,221 --> 00:08:00,721
A revolver can be fired six
times, a missile only once.

94
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:02,854
In the same way, the number
of consecutive attacks

95
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:03,854
is always predetermined.

96
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,321
-(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)
Which means,

97
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:14,354
when he first extends
his Zabimaru, that's one.

98
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:18,654
After that, he can
use it two more times.

99
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,287
And then, after
the third attack,

100
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:24,654
his Zabimaru returns
to its original state.

101
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,954
So let's test it.

102
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:33,987
-Look, it doesn't have to be
the same number each time.

103
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:37,787
The crucial element is the
maximum number of attacks,

104
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,154
especially in a
prolonged battle.

105
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,921
That is when your
enemy will be forced

106
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,821
to use the maximum
number of attacks.

107
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,987
-You bastard!

108
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:54,387
-(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE) One.

109
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:57,554
-If you can determine the
maximum number of attacks,

110
00:08:57,587 --> 00:09:01,087
you'll know when
he's vulnerable.

111
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:03,387
-(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)
That's two.

112
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,754
-Remember, the key thing
for you to keep track

113
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:08,387
is the last of his
consecutive attacks.

114
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:11,121
Wait for the moment between the
start of a consecutive attack

115
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:12,287
cycle.

116
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:14,421
-(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)
And that's three.

117
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,154
-Damn it.

118
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:18,821
-At that point, your enemy
will be completely vulnerable.

119
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:23,521
-It's over, Renji.

120
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:30,021
-I told you.

121
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:32,887
There's no way that you'd
be able to defeat me.

122
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:41,521
[gasps]

123
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:44,787
-(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)
He dodged it.

124
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:45,287
But--

125
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,054
-You look totally
shocked that I was

126
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:53,454
able to counter your attack.

127
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:57,021
Looking for an opening between
thrusts is a good strategy,

128
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,087
and your timing was perfect.

129
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:04,154
So, why weren't you
able to beat me?

130
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,387
The answer is simple.

131
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:10,621
Because you must be
slower than I am.

132
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:11,887
You see?

133
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:13,621
You cannot overcome it.

134
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,287
You can;t overcome the
difference in our powers.

135
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:19,387
Now do you understand?

136
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:20,854
You cannot save Rukia.

137
00:10:30,554 --> 00:10:31,321
-Aah!

138
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:31,787
-Ichigo!

139
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:09,388
-That large release of
spiritual pressure just now,

140
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:13,755
I hope Ichigo's all right.

141
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:16,655
-Renji's spiritual pressure.

142
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:18,088
-Huh?

143
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:19,255
-The spiritual pressure.

144
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:20,355
-All right, follow me.

145
00:11:39,822 --> 00:11:41,755
-Ahh, Ichigo.

146
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:42,755
-Ahh.

147
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:44,988
-Look, Ichigo's alive.

148
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:45,888
He's alive.

149
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,155
-You're damned right.

150
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:48,855
Guess he must have
dodged the blow.

151
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:58,822
-You are truly stubborn.

152
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:13,188
-Why, you, you really
tried to kill me just now.

153
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:14,022
-You bet.

154
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:15,222
You got that right.

155
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:17,655
And now, get ready because
I'm about to drive you

156
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:19,922
right into a corner.

157
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:24,155
I'll just keep pushing you
and pushing you to teach you

158
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:31,855
that you can use this technique
anytime, anywhere to attack.

159
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:33,355
-Come on, get real.

160
00:12:33,388 --> 00:12:35,788
What just happened
was a total fluke.

161
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,355
There's no way I can keep on
using it whenever I want to.

00:12:39,755 --> 00:12:42,555
to use it whenever you want.

164
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:43,988
Now listen here.

165
00:12:44,022 --> 00:12:45,988
You are just on the
verge of learning

166
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:50,855
how to fight by being able to
summon your true Zanpakuto.

167
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:53,688
You have potential,
but your strength

168
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:57,288
is still only third or
fourth seat level at best.

169
00:12:57,322 --> 00:13:00,055
In order to stay evenly matched
with a lieutenant or someone

170
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:02,222
of higher rank,
you will have to be

171
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,055
able to use this
technique at will.

172
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:05,855
That's all there is to it.

173
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:08,588
-Easier said than done.

174
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,855
It just about took
everything out of me then,

175
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:13,988
and I don't even remember much
about what I actually did.

176
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:15,955
-I already know all that.

177
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:18,355
That's why we're
going to do it again.

178
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:18,855
Understand?

179
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:46,222
See?

180
00:13:46,255 --> 00:13:48,322
I am going to keep pushing
you and pushing you

181
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:50,322
so you can always
remember that attack.

182
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:51,888
Am I making myself clear?

183
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:57,755
-Wow.

184
00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:59,288
The subject just hit the rock.

185
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:02,255
-Oh, time to dispatch
the first aid unit.

186
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:04,188
-Damn it.

187
00:14:04,222 --> 00:14:04,722
He's pitiful.

188
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:12,355
So what's the
problem, Mr. Uruhara?

189
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:13,022
-Not yet.

190
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:30,022
-Damn it.

191
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:32,022
If he keeps this
up, I'll really--

192
00:14:59,922 --> 00:15:06,222
-I'm so disappointed,
Ichigo, so very disappointed.

193
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:10,855
Sadly, your sword
exhibits only fear.

194
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:14,355
When you counter, it's
because you fear being killed.

195
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:17,622
When you attack,
you fear killing.

196
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,655
And when you try
to protect someone,

197
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:22,022
you fear you could let them die.

198
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:26,055
At this point, the only thing
that your sword speaks of

199
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:29,255
is senseless fright.

200
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:31,055
And that's not good.

201
00:15:31,088 --> 00:15:34,222
What you do not need
in battle is fear.

202
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:37,055
Nothing will come of it.

203
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:40,322
When you counter, you
don't let them cut you.

204
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:43,655
If you protect someone,
you don't let them die.

205
00:15:43,688 --> 00:15:46,622
When you attack, you kill.

206
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,088
Understand?

207
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:49,622
Can't you see?

208
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:52,955
My sheer resolve to kill you
is reflected in my sword.

209
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:50,388
Yeah.

210
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:51,322
That's better.

211
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:02,488
-His Zanpakuto.

212
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,455
-It's howling.

213
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:06,688
-It's as if they're
crying out, as

214
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:08,888
if they can't wait to do battle.

215
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:40,355
-Huh?

216
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:00,422
[chuckling]

217
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,222
-Oh, yeah.

218
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:02,722
Now you've got it, resolve.

219
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:51,622
-Don't do it, Ichigo.

220
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:54,422
-Do you think he intends
to keep on fighting?

221
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:55,255
-I do.

222
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:56,388
But you see?

223
00:18:56,422 --> 00:19:00,955
He's acting differently
than he was before.

224
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:03,522
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

225
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:07,088
I found my resolve.

226
00:19:07,122 --> 00:19:10,022
This time, I will get you.

227
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:23,188
-(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE) What's
with him all of a sudden?

228
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:24,688
Was he like this the last time?

229
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:36,255
No, it's different.

230
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:39,722
That time, he was just radiating
spirit energy at random.

231
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:42,155
This time, it's
calm and controlled.

232
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:44,588
And without a doubt,
it's much stronger.

233
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:53,322
-(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE) When you
counter, don't let him cut you.

234
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:54,522
-Why you!

235
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:57,855
-(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE)
When you protect someone,

236
00:19:57,888 --> 00:19:59,355
don't let them die.

237
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:12,622
And when you attack him, kill.

238
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:30,888
-(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE) He got me.

239
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:33,255
What was that just now?

240
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:36,588
What was it, Zabimaru?

241
00:20:36,622 --> 00:20:37,588
Damn it.

242
00:20:54,822 --> 00:20:55,288
-Resolve.

243
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:58,588
-(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE) Resolve.

244
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:03,855
It hurts.

245
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:07,088
My body feels heavy.

246
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:08,455
I can't move my legs.

247
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:14,188
I can't left my arms.

248
00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:20,922
Damn it.

249
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:22,588
Have I lost?

250
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:23,088
Damn.

251
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:37,922

MALE ANNOUNCER

BOTH ANNOUNCERS

259
00:22:58,673 --> 00:23:01,140
-Izuru, Momo, you're going to
give everybody the wrong idea.

260
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:03,073
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): The
wrong idea about what?

261
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:05,540
RENJI (OFFSCREEN): I wasn't
talking to you, amateur!
