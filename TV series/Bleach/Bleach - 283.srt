1
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:07,633
Takaoni!

2
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:10,400
Ah!

3
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,366
We will finish this now.

4
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:14,333
Ryusenka!

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,666
Kubikiri Orochi!

6
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:28,474
Ready? Get em' Stark.

7
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:33,141
He's coming!

8
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:34,341
I can see that!

9
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,708
Slam! Tengumaru!

10
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:46,474
Play... Kinshara!

11
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,141
Wha!?

12
00:02:57,308 --> 00:03:00,374
These things are like flames!
There's no end to them!

13
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,081
Ah!

14
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,548
Agh, move around
all you want. I'll
still crush you!

15
00:03:10,314 --> 00:03:11,181
What-?!

16
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:19,381
[coughs]
Damn it!

17
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,481
Hey Rose!
Can you hear me?

18
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:23,214
What is it?

19
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:26,448
I figured it out!
They're not flames!
They're a Cero!

20
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:30,781
And they're dangerous
when they explode at
close range!

21
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,581
[gasp]

22
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,414
Damn it!

23
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:42,414
They're not Ceros.

24
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:49,681
Regular Ceros don't have
enough power to mortally
wound Hollows with the kind
of strength that you possess.

25
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:57,248
I took my own soul and
tore it into pieces and
I have made those pieces
obey me like partners,

26
00:03:57,348 --> 00:04:00,081
so that now I may
use them as weapons
to destroy you...

27
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:04,988
<i>These wolf-shaped warheads</i>
<i>are a deadly combination</i>
<i>of both of us...</i>

28
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:13,021
You see, that is our
Ressureccion, the true power of
Espada Number 1, Coyote Stark
and Lilinette Gingerback...

29
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:20,654
[howl]

30
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:31,121
[Coyote & Lilinette]
Let's go.

31
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:46,321
[panting]

32
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,121
[panting]

33
00:04:52,054 --> 00:04:55,421
This game's over.
Run, and I'll let
you live.

34
00:04:57,188 --> 00:04:58,188
[spits]

35
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:00,488
We don't run.

36
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:02,294
I see.

37
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:05,494
There's no choice.

38
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:08,261
I don't like the term
'finishing blow'...

39
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:11,261
But that's exactly
what this is.

40
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:14,428
[sharp exhale]

41
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:17,628
[gasps]

42
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:21,528
[pained breaths]

43
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,661
<i>[Lilinette]</i>
<i>Stark!</i>

44
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:35,328
What...
the hell...
is this?

45
00:05:41,694 --> 00:05:42,694
Check it out...

46
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:57,528
(Small CT pain gasp)

47
00:05:57,628 --> 00:05:59,028
<i>[Lilinette]</i>
<i>Stark, are you all right?!</i>

48
00:05:59,628 --> 00:06:01,561
I'll be fine,
don't worry.

49
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,134
<i>What are you talking about?!</i>
<i>He caught you from behind</i>
<i>and ran you through!</i>

50
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:07,034
Do us both a favor,
keep quiet.

51
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,301
<i>[Lilinette]</i>
<i>Don't act so tough!</i>
<i>You just took a</i>
<i>major blow!</i>

52
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:13,268
<i>Don't you think it's about</i>
<i>time we got serious?</i>

53
00:06:13,368 --> 00:06:15,201
<i>Just turn me loose,</i>
<i>I'll show 'em!</i>

54
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:20,868
The problem is,
we can't overdo it.
You're aware of that, right?

55
00:06:20,968 --> 00:06:24,201
<i>Of course! Stop</i>
<i>being so paranoid!</i>

56
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,201
And you stop being
so reckless!

57
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,434
What sort of move
was that, Captain?

58
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:33,268
Hiding in the shadows like
a coward doesn't suit you.

59
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:37,268
I'm surprised that you'd resort
to such a slimy technique.

60
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:40,368
Kageoni.

61
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:42,501
<i>[Shunsui]</i>
<i>But I wasn't</i>
<i>hiding anything.</i>

62
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:48,268
<i>Up until now, Katenkyokotsu</i>
<i>here just wasn't in the</i>
<i>mood to fight seriously.</i>

63
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:50,534
<i>That's why I get tired</i>
<i>of playing with her.</i>

64
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:54,268
You see, Katenkyokotsu
is quite mischievous.

65
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:57,368
She has the power
to turn children's
games into reality.

66
00:06:57,468 --> 00:07:01,568
And the worst part of
the whole thing is She
decides on the rules,

67
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:06,508
and everyone who enters
the domain of her Spirit
Energy is forced to abide
by those rules...

68
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:08,808
...Including myself, as well.

69
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:13,974
<i>In Takaoni, whoever's</i>
<i>on higher ground, wins.</i>

70
00:07:14,074 --> 00:07:18,174
<i>In Kageoni, the person whose</i>
<i>shadow gets stepped on, loses.</i>

71
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:22,241
Win and you get to live...
Lose, and you end up dead...

72
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,374
It's just as simple as that.

73
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:30,041
Can't argue with her;
she's too self-centered.

74
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,408
But always doing what she
wants can be exhausting.

75
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:37,808
Impressive!
You catch on
very quickly!

76
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:42,141
<i>He's so fast! I'm not sure I</i>
<i>can defeat him, one on one!</i>

77
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:43,074
<i>[Shunsui]</i>
<i>Takaoni!</i>

78
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,208
I explained this, didn't I?

79
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:50,341
In Takaoni, the
person on higher
ground always wins!

80
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:54,174
Whoa!

81
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,341
You'll have to excuse me;
I forgot...

82
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:00,141
<i>Those wolves are there</i>
<i>to protect you, aren't they?</i>

83
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:04,014
<i>[Lilinette]</i>
<i>Are you all right, Stark?</i>
<i>Your reaction time could</i>
<i>be a lot faster, you know!</i>

84
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:05,395
Zip it, kid.

85
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,548
<i>[Lilinette]</i>
<i>Oh yeah? My advice is the</i>
<i>only thing keeping you alive!</i>

86
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:10,181
I don't need this now!

87
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:14,181
Hm? Hey, are you talking
to that girl who's always
hanging around you?

88
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:17,148
Very interesting, that
means she still exists.

89
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:21,081
Why is that
so important?

90
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:23,214
If I recall correctly...

91
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:25,281
You split your soul into pieces.

92
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:29,248
Those pieces now follow and
obey you, and you use them
as weapons. Is that right?

93
00:08:30,181 --> 00:08:33,248
All of those wolves, then,
are just an extension of you.

94
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:35,514
It appears you've
been following along.

95
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:37,781
So let me ask
you something.

96
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:40,214
If I take out those
wolves, what happens?

97
00:08:40,314 --> 00:08:42,081
Would it damage
you directly?

98
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,481
Let's not find out.

99
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:48,514
Or more likely... Does it mean
that girl will disappear?

100
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,281
Who knows?

101
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:54,448
Come on, play along.

102
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:57,248
I gave you enough clues
to how my powers work.

103
00:08:57,814 --> 00:09:00,181
I never asked you for
that information.

104
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,688
<i>If I touch the ground,</i>
<i>he'll use his Kageoni on me.</i>

105
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:09,188
<i>And if I confront him</i>
<i>in the sky, he'll fight</i>
<i>using his Takaoni.</i>

106
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:11,121
<i>It's a no-win</i>
<i>situation!</i>

107
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:13,154
<i>[Lilinette]</i>
<i>Listen to me, Stark.</i>

108
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:15,054
What is it?

109
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,854
<i>I have an idea.</i>
<i>Take his bait.</i>

110
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:20,188
What are you saying?

111
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:23,054
<i>You'll see. Don't think about</i>
<i>it, just take my advice.</i>

112
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:24,288
[frustrated]
Hnh.

113
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:28,121
So then, What sort of game
should we play next?

114
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:31,988
You think two men fighting to
the death is just a game?

115
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,188
You're crazy!
You deserve to lose!

116
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:36,121
Takaoni!

117
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:38,454
<i>Here he comes!</i>

118
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:47,121
Guess I win!

119
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,454
Not quite!

120
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:52,854
Kageoni!

121
00:09:57,854 --> 00:09:59,321
Ready for another round?

122
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:00,354
Ah!

123
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:03,261
<i>[Lilinette]</i>
<i>We've got him , Stark!</i>

124
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:13,061
Lilinette!
Lilinette!

125
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:21,094
<i>Calm down.</i>

126
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:22,294
<i>I'm still here.</i>

127
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:24,661
[relieved exhale]

128
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:26,994
<i>What kind of reaction is that?</i>
<i>You were worried about me,</i>
<i>weren't you?</i>

129
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:28,994
I told you before, quiet down!

130
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:30,961
<i>Takaoni!</i>

131
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:31,994
Damn it!

132
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:35,828
<i>[Lilinette]</i>
<i>Stark!</i>

133
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:37,994
Ah!

134
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:42,661
Bushogoma!

135
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:51,361
Lilinette, speak up!

136
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:53,628
[Stark]
Where are you?!
Talk to me!

137
00:10:56,961 --> 00:10:57,994
Lilinette...

138
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,834
I have to admit, that
was extremely close...

139
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:15,034
<i>I didn't expect your</i>
<i>wolves to be the ones</i>
<i>coming after my shadow.</i>

140
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,001
And for a moment there,
I thought I was about
to be defeated.

141
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:22,634
<i>But the explosion that wiped</i>
<i>out your partner helped me</i>
<i>understand your powers.</i>

142
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:28,101
Your wolves could only drag the
things they had bitten, into
their circle of destruction.

143
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:32,234
As long as there were
objects surrounding me
and offering protection
from their attack,

144
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:35,901
the wolves would detonate and
disappear before reaching me.

145
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:41,868
My Bushogoma turned out to
be perfect for providing
that protection.

146
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:47,768
So.. It's finally just the two
of us facing off.

147
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:56,301
<i>[Stark]</i>
<i>I'm alone.</i>

148
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:08,041
Iro... Oni, 'Gray'.

149
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:09,608
[gasp]

150
00:12:15,174 --> 00:12:18,508
<i>Why do I have to fight</i>
<i>someone this strong?</i>

151
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,908
<i>I always envied the weak.</i>

152
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:29,874
<i>The souls of all my</i>
<i>friends diminished just</i>
<i>by being in my presence.</i>

153
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:33,274
<i>I was left alone</i>
<i>and isolated.</i>

154
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:39,108
In the depths of my loneliness,
we divided our soul into two.

155
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,874
<i>I can't recall what</i>
<i>our original form was.</i>

156
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:46,674
<i>Maybe it wasn't</i>
<i>like either of us.</i>

157
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:50,208
<i>In the end, I finally</i>
<i>realized it didn't matter.</i>

158
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:54,141
<i>It was the only way I could</i>
<i>escape the solitude.</i>

159
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,608
<i>That's why I</i>
<i>envied the weak.</i>

160
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,908
<i>You can stay with the</i>
<i>pack if you're weak.</i>

161
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:05,948
But since it wasn't possible for
me to be weak, at least I had a
comrade who matched my strength.

162
00:13:16,614 --> 00:13:17,881
<i>[panting]</i>

163
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:24,681
<i>Thanks to Lilinette's</i>
<i>last attack, he's</i>
<i>moving a lot slower.</i>

164
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:32,048
My wounds are not as severe,
compared to his. But I can feel
it. Something's not right.

165
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:34,948
Iro... Oni, 'Gray'.

166
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:40,681
When he cut me, it felt as if he
went deep enough to slice off my
arm... So why...?

167
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:43,881
<i>My arm is gray...</i>

168
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:45,814
<i>He has no gray on</i>
<i>his body.</i>

169
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:49,181
What's wrong?
Time for you to
make a move.

170
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:52,481
You have to say the
color you want to cut.

171
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,948
But you won't be
able to cut any other color,
except the one you announce.

172
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:01,048
<i>Lilinette...</i>
<i>I can still fight!</i>

173
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:03,488
White!

174
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:04,521
Ah!

175
00:14:08,954 --> 00:14:10,154
Well I'll be...

176
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:11,754
You guessed correctly.

177
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:18,888
In Iro Oni, you can very easily
take damage from the color you
announce. The way it works is...

178
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:24,554
<i>...The more risky the color is</i>
<i>to you, the more damage you're</i>
<i>able to deal to your opponent.</i>

179
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:28,654
As it turns out, white is the
color that would cause the
most damage to both of us.

180
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:33,688
I was planning to let you in
on the secret, bit by bit.

181
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:36,788
I didn't expect you
to figure out the
rules so quickly.

182
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:40,521
You really are quite a
difficult opponent.

183
00:14:44,054 --> 00:14:46,421
<i>I can't believe this!</i>

184
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:49,054
<i>Why do I have to fight</i>
<i>someone this strong?</i>

185
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:01,121
Black!

186
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:29,103
[pain]
Eyaaaahhhh...

187
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:52,103
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>Impressive... Are the two</i>
<i>of you responsible for</i>
<i>those piles of Hollows?</i>

188
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:57,236
<i>[Stark]</i>
<i>No... They just died</i>
<i>on their own.</i>

189
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:01,136
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>I see.</i>

190
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:08,343
You're new here.
You seem strong.

191
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:13,176
This is fortunate.

192
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:16,109
I'm looking
for comrades.

193
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,309
What a coincidence.
So are we.

194
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:24,343
Do you have other comrades
as strong as you?

195
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:28,243
Come with me,
if you want
to find out.

196
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:55,076
We accept
your offer.

197
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:02,309
It appears you won't
die, just from being
in our presence.

198
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:19,149
<i>Sorry...</i>
<i>...Lord Aizen.</i>

199
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:23,183
<i>[Stark]</i>
<i>It appears I won't be able</i>
<i>to repay my debt to you.</i>

200
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:29,016
<i>I'm not alone...</i>

201
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:33,316
<i>I'm not alone...</i>

202
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:41,283
I'm... not alone anymore.

203
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:46,516
Tell me something...
Do you have a name?

204
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:49,949
I'm Lilinette.

205
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:55,016
And what about you,
do you have a name?
You were once me.

206
00:17:58,283 --> 00:17:59,783
I'm Stark.

207
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,156
Stark, you say.

208
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:06,389
What do we do now?

209
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:08,756
We can do
anything.

210
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,089
Well then,
where should
we go?

211
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:14,056
Anywhere.

212
00:18:18,956 --> 00:18:20,423
We're both together now...

213
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,023
...forever...

214
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,823
Good work,
Captain Kyoraku.

215
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:49,723
Mm. I'm glad
you're both safe.

216
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:51,756
You haven't changed at all.

217
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,156
Hm?

218
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:56,489
You still tend to ignore
the basic code of honor...

219
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:59,189
...like interfering
with an ally's battle.

220
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:02,356
Heh.

221
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:07,829
Only amateurs would give
up a victory for the
sake of a code of honor.

222
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:11,129
As a Captain, I can't
afford such luxury.

223
00:19:11,763 --> 00:19:17,096
<i>There's rarely a</i>
<i>clear-cut determination</i>
<i>of a good side and a bad</i>
<i>side in these battles.</i>

224
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:20,196
<i>It's hard to pinpoint who</i>
<i>caused what, exactly.</i>

225
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:23,163
<i>Once war breaks out...</i>

226
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,863
...both sides
become evil.

227
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:44,329
Smash! Hagurotonbo!

228
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:50,963
Butcher Them!
Kubikiriororchi!

229
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:54,396
Did we
get her?

230
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:55,229
Not yet.

231
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:58,729
She's not gonna
give up.

232
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,863
[Toshiro]
Bankai!
Daiguren
Hyorinmaru!

00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:15,325
La Gota!

234
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:21,936
Ah!

235
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:34,069
Cascada!

236
00:20:39,736 --> 00:20:40,903
Ryusenka!

237
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:50,936
Tch.

238
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:55,836
Huuahh!

239
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:58,636
Heeahh!

240
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:08,909
Stop, that's enough...

241
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:10,743
...Gin.

242
00:21:14,676 --> 00:21:15,943
We will finish this now.

243
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:17,676
Excuse me?

244
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:24,976
Uh!

245
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:30,876
[gasps]

246
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:39,176
Lord Aizen...
What is it?

247
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:47,876
[gasp]

248
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:54,643
I'm done with you.

249
00:21:56,209 --> 00:22:00,109
Based on your performance...
It appears you're not strong
enough to fight for me.

250
00:22:01,776 --> 00:22:05,083
Gin. Kaname. Time to go.

251
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:49,095
No world is without sacrifices.

252
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:51,446
Doesn't he realize this?

253
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:54,950
The sea of blood covered in ashes.

254
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:58,943
We refer to this hell as the world.
