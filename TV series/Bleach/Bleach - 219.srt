NARRATOR: To prevent Sosuke
Aizen from wiping out

3
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:54,475
Karakura Town, the Soul
Reapers used four pillars

4
00:01:54,508 --> 00:01:57,408
to relocate the city and its
people to the Soul Society.

5
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:03,141
Chosen to protect the
pillars were Ikkaku Madarame,

6
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:08,875
Izuru Kira, Yumichika
Ayasegawa, and Shuhei Hisagi.

7
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:11,641
And the four soon found
themselves locked in combat

8
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,175
with Barragan's Fracciones.

9
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,908
The battle between Charlotte
Chuhlhourne and Yumichika

10
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:20,741
escalated into a
contest of beauty.

11
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:23,775
Yumichika struggled against
Chuhlhourne Resurreccion form,

12
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:27,041
Raina de Rosas, but
emerged victorious by using

13
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,075
Ruri'iro Kujaku, his
Zanpakuto's true form.

14
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:34,641
At the same time,
Izuru faced off

15
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:38,475
against Abirama Redder in
Resurrection form, Aguila,

16
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:41,741
and was forced on the defensive
by his enemy's Devorar Pluma

17
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,441
attack.

18
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:46,608
Biding his time
though, Izuru waited

19
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:48,608
for his foe to
come within range.

20
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:51,608
Using the power of his
Wabisuke to make Aguila's steel

21
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:53,775
wings many times
heavier, he finally

22
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:55,275
brought Abirama to the ground.

23
00:02:57,908 --> 00:02:59,308

00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:06,508

25
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,141
Get your legs crushed?

26
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:09,875
Was I too fast for you?

27
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:10,408
Heh.

28
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,441
Pathetic!

29
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:13,875
I wasn't even going
at my full speed.

30
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:15,341
-I should thank you.

31
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,508
-What?

32
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,841
-Your long-range attacks
were pretty tough to handle.

33
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,708
In fact, this whole
time I've been

34
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:25,208
trying to figure out how to
draw you into close combat.

35
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:31,041
You see, my Zanpakuto
only works on objects

36
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:33,375
connected to my opponent.

No!

40
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:39,475
No!

41
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:40,975
Aaaugh!

00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:42,475

Damn it!

45
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:50,975
What is this?

46
00:03:51,008 --> 00:03:53,575
My wings can't move!

47
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,675
-My blade doubles the
weight of anything it hits.

48
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,841
A second strike doubles
the weight again,

49
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,708
and a third doubles
it once more.

50
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:08,408
Now you felt the power
of my Zanpakuto Wabisuke.

asked what exactly

53
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:18,775
this weird-looking sword of mine
could cut, isn't that right?

54
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:21,208
-Nnngh!

55
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,675
Wait.

56
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,208
Please, don't.

00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:31,375

-Don't get what?

63
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:55,808
-Earlier, I thought
you told me you

64
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:58,875
were going to battle with all
the power of a lieutenant,

65
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:01,275
but right now I'd
peg your strength

66
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:03,975
at the level of a
Fifth Seat, if that.

67
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,741
So, what's really going on?

68
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:07,075
-Hmph.

69
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,475
Exacta!

70
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,608
You got it.

71
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:10,375
-Hmm?

72
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:12,375
I got what?

73
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:14,741
-As you just said, my
current power level

74
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:17,575
is exactly that of one
of your Fifth Seats.

75
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,841
It pleases me that
you guessed correctly,

76
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,708
but I should have expected
as much from a lieutenant.

77
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,975
So, you pass.

78
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:27,641
-What?

79
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,375
-That was a test.

80
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:32,341
I wanted to see whether or
not you could accurately

81
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,641
gauge my power level.

82
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:38,841
Because otherwise, what would
be the point of engaging you

83
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,308
at a more potent
lieutenant level?

84
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,975
It's a waste if you can't
tell the difference.

85
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:51,808
I was at a Fifth
Seat's level, but now--

What could this mean, I wonder?

You're fighting an
opponent whose abilities

are at the level of a
lieutenant's, and yet,

for some reason, you're
the only one who's lagging.

Would you care to warrant

-Man, you're a pain.

What are you trying to say?

00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:08,808
That I don't have what
it takes for the job?

You don't disappoint,
Lieutenant.

Provided I haven't misjudged
the strength of you

167
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:16,408
and your Court Guard
Squad, then you're correct.
