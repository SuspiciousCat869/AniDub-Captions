1
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:08,943
[gasping]

2
00:02:11,613 --> 00:02:12,780
[grunting]

3
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,527
Another restless night.

4
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:43,611
Well, let's get
started.

5
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:45,914
Okay Riruka, he's all
yours!

6
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:46,714
Huh?

7
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:47,916
Yeah, yeah.

8
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,185
Hey! Just a minute...

9
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:51,986
What?

10
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:56,191
Are you plannin' on puttin'
me in that dollhouse again?

11
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,593
Would that be a problem?

12
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:02,230
Don't worry. I went ahead and
gave you a free upgrade!

13
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,733
Ta-da..!

14
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:10,638
This cute birdcage here, will be your
training ground this time around!

15
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:12,874
Uh, I can't help but
think that going from a

16
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:15,210
dollhouse to a birdcage
is more of a downgrade.

17
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:21,482
Ginjo..!

18
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:24,919
Why do I have to go through the
same kind of training again?

19
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,188
I don't get it,
what's the point?

20
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:32,193
I suppose we do owe you
an explanation.

21
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:36,531
All right. Listen
carefully.

22
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:40,668
Do you know what the definitive difference
between you and the rest of us is?

23
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:42,937
Mm.

24
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:45,974
As Riruka already told
you...

25
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:48,209
Our group consists
exclusively of people who

26
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,678
were able to use the
power of Fullbring since

27
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:56,050
birth, or became aware of their
latent power as they grew older.

28
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,687
But your situation is different.
Unlike us, you

29
00:03:59,721 --> 00:04:03,057
must acquire Fullbring
through your own will.

30
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:08,630
For you... Understanding how to access your
Fullbring isn't an occurrence that happens

31
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:10,898
naturally as it does for
us.

32
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:13,167
Obviously at this point,
we can't expect you to

33
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,637
flip a switch and summon
up this power whenever

34
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,238
you want.

35
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:19,540
That's why it's necessary
for us to force you

36
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,542
into physical and mental
extremes, in order

37
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:23,778
to awaken this power in
you.

38
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:26,047
So unfortunately for
you, this trial by fire

39
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,516
method is the only way
that we can ultimately

40
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:31,185
help you to regain your
Soul Reaper powers.

41
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:33,788
Understand?

42
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,659
Yeah, guess
I'm stuck.

43
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:38,760
Right-now be a good
boy--Hm?!

44
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:40,261
But know this.

45
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:42,797
What?! More
complaining?!

46
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:46,100
I'm running out
of time, here.

47
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:55,543
Training like the last time
isn't going to cut it.

48
00:04:55,543 --> 00:05:00,014
I'd say that the best way to bring out my
powers, is to let me fight one of you.

49
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,918
[sighing]

50
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:05,787
Don't be ridiculous!

51
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:10,625
You were just barely able to awaken your
Fullbring the last time we trained!

52
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:13,127
You have to learn
your limits!

53
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:18,533
Where you're at now, Mr. Chicken here can
easily take you out. And it's not just him.

54
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:21,536
You'll have to deal with Mr.
Pork Mark Two as well!

55
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,671
Not that guy again.

56
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:26,908
It was no walk in the park
for you last time. Listen...

57
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:30,011
You've only just learned how to
Fullbring-if we don't take this slow, you

58
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:31,546
won't survive much
longer--

59
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:34,015
I appreciate the
thought.

60
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:37,652
But I've never gained any strength
by playing it safe during training.

61
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,168
There's only one way.

62
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:58,740
What is it with you?!

63
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:02,610
You're in this really big rush
to get in over your head.

64
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:05,880
That's because there are
people I want to protect.

65
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:08,583
I can't just stand around
doing nothing about it.

66
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:11,886
Mmm.

67
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:14,689
Boy do you look
convinced.

68
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,524
Shut it!

69
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:19,961
So you feel like you can't
stand around doing nothing?

70
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:22,230
Well, you just
might be right.

71
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:25,967
So let's double up your
training then.

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,604
But you understand if you
die, we're not to blame.

73
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:30,671
Right.

74
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:32,006
Hold it.

75
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,174
Huh?

76
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,188
Um...

77
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:52,059
Mr. Tsukishima?

78
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:55,096
What is it Shishgawara?

79
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:58,933
What do you plan on doing
next, sir?

80
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,535
Excuse me?

81
00:07:00,535 --> 00:07:05,239
Well you know, are we going after
Ichigo Kurosaki or Yasutora Sado?

82
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:06,908
[gasping]

83
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:10,912
Well, look at that, you distracted me
right as I was getting to the good part.

84
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:13,181
Oh, I'm sorry, sir!

85
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:16,617
They go to the same
school-that right?

86
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:19,487
Huh? Uh, what?

87
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,824
I'm talking about Ichigo
Kurosaki, Yasutora Sado,

88
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:25,893
and Orihime Inoue, who
we met the other day.

89
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:28,796
Oh right! Yes!They all
go to the same school.

90
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,067
Hmm...

91
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,670
Well that's good...

92
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,641
I need you to do me a
favor. Are you ready?

93
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,811
You're okay with all of
this Kugo?

94
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:46,214
Yeah, I mean, that's
what he's requesting.

95
00:07:46,214 --> 00:07:48,950
All right, now I've
heard everything!

96
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:49,784
Huh?

97
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:52,954
This guy wants to fight
us?!

98
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:57,625
Well you can count me out. I don't
see the point in helping him.

99
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,595
What's gotten into you?

100
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:02,530
I'm against it, as
well.

101
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,664
Hm?

102
00:08:04,932 --> 00:08:06,968
And why's that?

103
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:11,138
I can understand why he wants
to rush things along here...

104
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:14,208
But the faster we progress
this young man's training, the

105
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,644
more intense will be the
strain upon him.

106
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:20,982
If we attempt to force the awakening
of his Fullbring by rushing,

107
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:24,619
it's quite possible his power
could become completely unstable.

108
00:08:24,652 --> 00:08:29,624
All of us here except Mister Kurosaki
understand what that would result in.

109
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:35,963
It would be his death. The out-of-control
soul of the object will drive the

110
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:39,133
user's own soul out of
his physical body.

111
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,641
Precautions should be taken to
assure that it happens naturally.

112
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:50,611
Yeah. You have to admit
he makes a valid point.

113
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:52,513
That's beside the
point!

114
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:54,649
You just think back!

115
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:56,951
Remember what Kugo
said to you!

116
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:58,019
Hnh?!

117
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:04,158
Ichigo. We want to rid ourselves
of this power we have.

118
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:10,765
Don't think that any of
us go around joyfully

119
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:13,534
using this power we've
been endowed with.

120
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:15,670
To me it's been
a huge burden.

121
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,672
Stop, Jackie.
That's enough.

122
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:19,740
You claim you want to
protect people that are

123
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,943
dear to you, right? Those
are noble words. But if

124
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:26,280
you ask me, you're just a careless,
egotistical brat who jumps into situations

125
00:09:26,514 --> 00:09:28,883
without realizing that you're
gambling with your life, here.

126
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:32,587
Every time I'm forced to
use Fullbring, it upsets

127
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:34,956
me. So you won't find me
agreeing to use it to

128
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:37,658
help this naive idiot get
what he wants!

129
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:46,534
Well so much for that.
Hey, Yukio!

130
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:47,802
No thanks.

131
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:49,770
I haven't said anything
yet.

132
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:53,207
You were about to ask me to go and
bring Jackie back here, weren't you?

133
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:55,610
Why not let her do as she
wants?

134
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:56,777
Mm.

135
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,516
You know, sooner or later, we'll
need Jackie's help with all of this.

136
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:05,987
I agree with you. Pardon
me for a moment.

137
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:16,797
You heard them Ichigo. Sorry, but I guess
we'll have do things one step at a time.

138
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:20,601
Riruka! Do your thing!

139
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:31,145
This time Giriko's powers
will take effect in only

140
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:34,081
ten minutes instead of
fifteen, so be careful.

141
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:34,949
Right...

142
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,652
Now I permit you!

143
00:10:51,098 --> 00:10:53,668
Oh, boy, so it's
you again, kid?!

144
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:55,536
Hey there.

145
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:59,607
Well, this won't be
as easy as it was the

146
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,143
last time. This here's my pal, Mr.
Bone-Skin.

147
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:07,682
I'm not called Bone-Skin, Pork! Get it
right-it's Mister Chicken, ya Pork Rind!

148
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:12,620
Baw-wah!-Hi there! I'm
Mister Chicken.

149
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:14,021
It's a pleasure.

150
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,530
So you prefer iced
coffee?

151
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,902
Did Kugo send you?

152
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:28,936
Yes.

153
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:34,675
Ms. Jackie-you know he
needs us, don't you?

154
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,977
But doesn't it
bother you at all?

155
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:39,847
Are you asking if I'm
alright with helping him?

156
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,182
No.

157
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:48,923
With the powers
you have...

158
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:54,128
Hmm. Here's a story for you.
There was once an

159
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:57,932
old man who suffered a
deep wound in his leg.

160
00:11:57,932 --> 00:12:01,535
After that he could predict changes
in the weather by the level of

161
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:07,808
pain in that very leg. So as a result,
he never got caught in the rain.

162
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:09,877
What's the point of the
story?...

163
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,715
When you get to be my age, you learn
to live with things that disgust you.

164
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,120
So can I adjust like you?

165
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:21,622
That... I don't know.

166
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,194
Are you having second
thoughts, perhaps?

167
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:39,540
[gasping and trembling]

168
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,945
I don't know.

169
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:49,583
It's just that I haven't been able
to get myself to embrace my powers.

170
00:12:57,713 --> 00:13:00,382
[squawking]

171
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,551
[laughing]

172
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:04,353
[screaming]

173
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,622
Uh!

174
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:07,589
Ah!

175
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:13,796
[panting]

176
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:18,267
That was close. I guess I forgot
about that technique of yours, kid.

177
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,369
Don't let him
near you, Bone-Skin!

178
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:23,439
My name's not
Bone-Skin, you dumb pig!

179
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,216
I'm sure I got cut,
but when I came to...

180
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:36,785
There wasn't any blood
or any kind of wound.

181
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,525
I don't know why,
but for a second there...

182
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,794
I thought of that
person as a friend.

183
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:50,332
So if what Orihime said is true, does
that mean that the person after us

184
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:53,469
possesses the ability to
manipulate memories?

185
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,509
I wonder if the attacker who slashed Uryu
is the same one who slashed Orihime.

186
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:06,115
I should go have a
talk with Uryu.

187
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:08,384
Uh!

188
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:13,622
So, am I their
next target?

189
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:15,157
Who's there?!

190
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:23,332
Should I fight? No. I can't allow
myself to be taken out, just yet.

191
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:27,669
[panting]

192
00:14:27,703 --> 00:14:32,741
[grunting and fighting]

193
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:34,076
Kugo.

194
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:35,310
What is it?

195
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:37,446
Do you feel it? That
Spiritual Pressure.

196
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,680
Do you mean Chad?

197
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:43,085
Whoa! Ginjo! What'd you
just say?!

198
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:44,219
Huh?!

199
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:46,488
Did something happen to
Chad?!

200
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:49,725
If you don't pay
attention, you'll die!

201
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:52,161
[grunting]

202
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:53,362
[cackling]

203
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:56,165
[screaming]

204
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:57,399
[sighing]

205
00:14:57,433 --> 00:15:00,335
Man, why'd you go
and say that?!

206
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:02,604
You know hearing that will
wreck his concentration!

207
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:04,206
Ah, shut up.

208
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,074
Ginjo!

209
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:08,377
Calm down, I'll tell
you what's happening!

210
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,613
Someone's Spiritual Pressure
is closing in on Chad.

211
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:14,416
Someone? You mean...?!

212
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:23,091
It's that guy again!
Ginjo, let me out of here!

213
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,793
I have to go help Chad!

214
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:26,628
I can't.

215
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:28,664
Right now, you need to
concentrate on your

216
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:30,799
training. Don't forget
that you can't get out

217
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,302
of there until you take
out your opponents.

218
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:36,071
Damn it! That's not a
priority right now!

219
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:37,606
Chad's in danger!

220
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:42,177
Oh yeah? So what you're saying is
that Chad can't take care of himself?

221
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:44,446
That's not what I'm
saying at all!

222
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,317
Ichigo, what is it that
you want to protect?

223
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,785
Is it the lives of your
friends--?

224
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:52,187
Are those two
arguing again?

225
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:53,722
Seems like it.

226
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:57,626
If Chad were weak, I'd be rushing over
there right now to help him myself.

227
00:15:57,626 --> 00:16:01,497
But he's fine. So we should keep
doing what we need to do here!

228
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,734
That's all there is to it. I'm sure
that's what Chad wants us to do as well.

229
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:08,203
Didn't I tell you?

230
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:10,572
First he says he trains
so that he can protect

231
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:13,141
others. But then decides
to quit the moment he

232
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:18,247
hears a friend is in danger... This is all
about his selfish desire to play the hero.

233
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,281
What?!

234
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:22,618
Suppose you do leave
here right now.

235
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:26,421
You get there in time, but then what?!
Since you barely know how to

236
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:29,258
Fullbring, you can't
help him at all.

237
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,693
You're too impulsive.
That's why I don't want

238
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:34,263
anything to do with a
wannabe hero like you!

239
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:39,067
You say I won't be of any help?
Maybe you're right... But I have

240
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:42,804
regained some fighting
power, if only a little bit.

241
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:46,174
If I just stay in here, without
at least trying to help out...

242
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,677
I'll be left with
nothing but regret!

243
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:58,554
[gasping and trembling]

244
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:02,024
[screaming]

245
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,668
You'd regret it?

246
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:15,637
Fine then. If you want to
go-then go.

247
00:17:16,238 --> 00:17:20,576
I couldn't care less. But, if you want to
get out of there, then do it yourself.

248
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,344
[grunting]

249
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:25,614
If only this were that
simple.

250
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:26,748
Is it time?

251
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:31,653
Yes, it is. Time
tells no lies.

252
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,389
[squawking]

253
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:44,499
[grunting]

254
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:49,705
[grunting]

255
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:51,573
Damn! Not again!

256
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:54,409
[growling]

257
00:17:55,777 --> 00:18:00,082
This means I'm not goin' anywhere unless I
can find a way to defeat these two clowns.

258
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:02,651
[panting]

259
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:06,755
[growling and roaring]

260
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:09,224
[grunting]

261
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:15,364
I don't get it! Why didn't that work?
I released it just

262
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:18,233
like Getsugatensho, but its
power isn't even close!

263
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:22,337
When you have such a lame
weapon-what's there to regret?

264
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:27,209
Shut up and let me think! This isn't the
same as the sword I always fight with!

265
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:29,344
That's it!

266
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:33,749
This thing doesn't have a blade. I was
initiating my attacks way too soon!

267
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:37,586
If I charge it more with my Spirit
Energy than I did with Getsuga...

268
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,356
All right then, let's
do this!

269
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:45,360
[growling]

270
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,034
[grunting]

00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:56,438
[growling]

272
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:07,582
Uh!

273
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:14,690
Ow.

274
00:19:14,723 --> 00:19:16,391
[groaning]
Hey!

275
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:17,092
Huh?

276
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:19,661
You broke my birdcage!

277
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:23,432
He learned how to produce
that much destructive

278
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:26,501
power in such a short time.
Impressive.

279
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:30,372
I'm done. So, now I'm
gonna go help my friend.

280
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:33,709
Hold on.

281
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:35,143
Huh?!

282
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:43,318
Yeah, I'm fine. I was followed,
but I was able to lose them.

283
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:46,521
I think everything
should be okay for now.

284
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:48,724
All right. Glad to hear
it.

285
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:54,429
So don't worry about me-Okay? Just
continue on with your training.

286
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:57,232
Yeah, okay. Take care.
See ya, Chad.

287
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:59,034
Mm.

288
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:04,606
That was weird. I know I was followed,
but that was it. I didn't have

289
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:08,744
the feeling that I was about to
be attacked. What was that...?

290
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,750
I'd say it went well.

291
00:20:14,783 --> 00:20:16,384
Nicely done...

292
00:20:16,418 --> 00:20:17,586
Sir!

293
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:21,656
All right, then,
let's keep goin'!

294
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,026
Your training this time will
take place in this fish tank!

295
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,228
Whatever you say.

296
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:30,298
You're being awfully obedient...
So no complaints?

297
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:33,769
I expected to hear you whine
a little more. What's up?

298
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:36,204
Nothin'. Let's
just do it.

299
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:38,073
Fine. Here we go.

300
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:46,481
Ichigo...

301
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,450
Now, I permit
you!

302
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,199
Welcome.

303
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:08,103
Oh, so it's you. Not the
plushie this time, huh?

304
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:10,772
That's 'cause we figure that
you've moved past fighting them.

305
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:16,444
I haven't introduced
myself to you, have I?

306
00:21:16,478 --> 00:21:19,648
I'm Jackie Tristan. You
ready?

307
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,052
Ichigo Kurosaki.

308
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:27,088
I sure as hell am.

309
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:29,357
Nice. I like your
determination.

310
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,495
Aren't you going to
attack?

311
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:36,431
You haven't shown me
your Fullbring yet.

312
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:38,099
How naive.

313
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:43,071
This may be just a training session, but
you need to see me as your real enemy.

314
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:46,408
Would you have said the same
thing on a battlefield?

315
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,078
Yeah, I would...

316
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:54,583
Oh, really?
Unbelievable.

317
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:56,351
All right, I'll start.

318
00:21:57,752 --> 00:22:00,021
Dirty Boots.

319
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:04,793
Uh!

320
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,996
You totally ruined my
birdcage!

321
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:50,931
I'll pay you for it
later, okay?

322
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,000
No way!-That was my
favorite one!

323
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:54,801
Gimme a break!

324
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,971
Fine, I'll forgive you if you go just
this once and eat donuts with me!

325
00:23:58,005 --> 00:24:00,907
Donuts? Wait,
wait... donuts?!
