00:01:47,547 --> 00:01:49,008
-A cockatiel that's cursed?

5
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,108
-Uh huh.

6
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:51,641
All of the people that
have owned this bird

7
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:54,408
have got into these really
terrible situations and died.

8
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:55,542
-Wow.

9
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:56,308
Are you serious?

10
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,475
That's not a good sign.

11
00:01:57,508 --> 00:02:00,441
-Hey, [? shegale, ?]
you want to take him?

12
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:01,675
-So please, tell me.

13
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,808
Just how stupid
do I look to you?

14
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,008
Here's an idea.

15
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,875
Why don't you set him free
or dump him someplace?

16
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:08,641
-Well, that would be too cruel.

17
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:10,875
-Well, how about you,
Chad, what do you say?

18
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:13,508
Isn't he cute?

19
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,708
-Hey, knock it off.

20
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:17,008
You know Chad's got a
weakness for cute things.

21

[screech]

22
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:21,875
-Ah!

23
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,208
[screech]

24
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:23,708
-Whoa!

25
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:34,175
-We shall continue it.

26
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,575
We shall continue
our quest to devour.

27
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:39,741
In order to fill the
emptiness of our existence,

28
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:44,108
we must continue our neverending
quest to hunt them down.

29
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:47,041
And above all, it is the
spirit of a soul reaper

30
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,208
that is most delicious.

31
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:52,341
Once you have tasted it,
you will never forget it.

32
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,975
You will crave it always.

[groaning]

34
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:06,775
-Ah!

35
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:09,275
-We-- Ch, Ch, Chad?

36
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:12,575
-Yeah, are you all right, buddy?

37
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:15,741
-Yeah, I think I'm OK.

38
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:16,841
-You're OK?

39
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,108
Then how come you're
bleeding, bro?

40
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:21,708
-Thank you so much
for saving me.

41
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:22,775
-Hm?

42
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:25,008
-Hello there, my name
is Yuichi Shibata.

43
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,108
So what's your name, mister?

44
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,008
-What?

45
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,175
Did you hear that?

46
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,641
That, that bird is talking
just like a real person.

47
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:32,841
-Yeah, I heard it.

48
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,941
It is cursed.

49
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:37,941
-I'd really like to
know your name, mister.

50
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:41,041
-Sado Yasutora.

51
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:42,741
I'm 15 years old.

52
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:44,041
-Check it out.

53
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:45,441
Chad's interested in the bird.

54
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,608
-Jeez, there's not even a
trace of that burn left.

55
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:54,508
It's nearly healed
in just one day.

56
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,808
-Don't be so surprised.

57
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:57,741
I got the best grades
in my Kido class,

58
00:03:57,775 --> 00:03:59,341
and I have a talent for it.

59
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,341
Healing your wound was easy.

60
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,641
-You got graded?

61
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,808
So what then?

62
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:06,041
There's a school
for soul reapers?

63
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:07,975
-Huh?

64
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:09,775
You could call it that.

65
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:12,041
Tell me, how do I
drink from this thing?

66
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:14,641
-Uh, you got to
poke a hole in it.

67
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:16,475
You just use the sharp
end of your straw.

68
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:19,108
-What straw?

69
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:21,041
-So, you're together again.

70
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:22,008
-Huh?

71
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,941
-Uh huh, you two
seem pretty chummy.

72
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:27,808
-Mizuiro, shut up.

73
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:31,441
Come on, does it really look
to you like we're chummy?

74
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:32,808
-Maybe.

75
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:36,208
Well, to be honest, you two
do appear to be pretty close.

76
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:39,108
But people are going to talk,
and if they talk enough,

77
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:41,008
everyone will think
that you're an item.

78
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,208
-Whatever.

79
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,975
If I really cared about
what people think,

80
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:47,008
then I guess I would have dyed
my hair black a long time ago.

81
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,208
-Yeah, that's true.

82
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:50,775
-So this is the straw.

83
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:51,875
It's short.

84
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:55,075
But now I have to know,
where do I poke it?

85
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:56,208
-Hi there.

86
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:58,075
How you doing?

87
00:04:58,108 --> 00:04:59,741
-Why, hello there.

88
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,241
You're, um, Mizuiro?

89
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:03,508
-That's me.

90
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,875
I guess we haven't been
properly introduced.

91
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:08,641
I'm Mizuiro Kojima
I really like--

92
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,441
-Picking up chicks.

93
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,175
-Huh?

94
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,108
Ichigo, that's not cool.

95
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:14,908
-Watch it-- he may look like a
dork, but he's a real player.

96
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:15,575
Seriously.

97
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,108
-Cut it out!

98
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:19,741
You'll permanently
damage my reputation.

99
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:23,275
Besides, Ichigo, you know older
women are really more my style.

100
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:25,375
-Like I said Rukia,
watch this one.

101
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,275
-Huh?

102
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:28,975
[grunting]

103
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:31,108
-Eh, just forget it.

104
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:33,841
-What's this, Rukia Kuchiki,
the hot transfer student,

105
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,041
is here with you guys?

106
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:36,141
How did that happen?

107
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:37,441
-Ichigo picked her up.

108
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:38,808
He's the one who
brought her here.

109
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:39,341
-Huh?

110
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,075
I did not.

111
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:41,041
-Ichigo did?

112
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,408
Ha, ha, what a guy.

113
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,508
Good job.

114
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,708
-Well, I guess.

115
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:48,041
It's really no big deal.

116
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:49,341
-Huh?

117
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:49,908
Greetings.

118
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:51,108
I'm Keigo Asano.

119
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:53,441
Welcome, lovely lady, to
this garden of manliness.

120
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:54,708
-Uh, hello.

121
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:55,641
-Yeah!

122
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:58,341
Lunch party, right
here, right now!

123
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,975
-So party noodles and juice?

124
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:00,808
-Shut up!

125
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:02,008
It's the feeling that counts.

126
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,841
-So, Rukia, if you find
yourself needing anything,

127
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,075
you just call on me.

128
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,141
I'm here for you.

129
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:07,641
-Oh?

130
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:08,141
Great!

131
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:09,408
Open this.

132
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:10,075
-No prob.

133
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,775
Your wish is my command.

134
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:12,308
Huh?

135
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:14,008
-Hey, Chad.

136
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,375
-Hm.

137
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,708
-So Chad, what's
with the bandages?

138
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:18,975
-Whoa, you got hurt.

139
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:19,675
How?

140
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,241
What happened to you?

141
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,575
-I had a mishap.

142
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:24,341
A steel beam fell on my head.

143
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,308
-A steel beam, for real?

144
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:29,075
-My hand got hurt when a
motorcycle ran into me.

145
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:31,875
The rider that hit me
got banged up pretty bad.

146
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:34,575
The force of the collision threw
him off and he was knocked out,

147
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:37,541
so I picked the guy up and
carried him to the hospital.

148
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,608
-Well no wonder you
were late to school.

149
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:41,175
-The only thing
I wonder about is

150
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:44,741
what exactly is
your body made of?

151
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:47,575
-Hey, so where did
you get that bird?

152
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,175
-My name's Yuichi Shibata.

153
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,075
It's nice to meet you.

154
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:54,708
What's your name?

155
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:55,908
-That is amazing!

156
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:58,341
I mean, the way this bird
can talk is phenomenal.

157
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,741
My name's Keigo Asano.

158
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:02,175
Keigo Asano, can you say that?

159
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,341
-So Chad, just where
did you get this bird?

160
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:13,008
-Someone gave me him.

161
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,341
-Hold it, there you
go again, getting lazy

162
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,575
and cutting your story short.

163
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:17,508
Come on!

164
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,241
That's a bad habit
you have, Chad.

165
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:19,741
Now explain.

166
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,308
Spill it.

167
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,641
-That was the whole story.

168
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,941
-There you go, just
like you usually do.

169
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:26,175
You never share the details--

170
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,908
-Don't worry.

171
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:30,341
You're right, there is
something in that bird,

172
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,375
but I don't think it's evil.

173
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,741
It's probably just
a lonely soul,

174
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:37,408
you know, one that
didn't have many friends.

175
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:40,375
But we can't leave it or
it might become a hollow.

176
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:43,741
Tonight we need to
perform a Konso.

177
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,008
-Oh, great.

178
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,775
That's just what I need,
another sleepless night.

179
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:49,875
-It doesn't help to complain.

180
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:52,608
-Yeah, I know.

181
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:53,975
RUKIA (THOUGHTS): How odd.

182
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:56,208
Ichigo was concerned
about the safety of others

183
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,108
and sensed the soul's process.

184
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:59,675
Maybe he's beginning
to understand

185
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,341
what it means to
be a soul reaper.

186
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,208
-Here you go.

187
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:05,875
-Oh, thank you.

188
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:09,175
-I got to tell you, back
in eighth grade, that

189
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:13,108
was when I first met Chad.

190
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,575
The color of my hair always
got people's attention,

191
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:19,175
but not in a good way, and
I'd end up in these fights.

192
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,875
Actually, the day I
met Chad, his timing

193
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:21,975
couldn't have been better.

194
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:23,541
I was in the middle
of this little scrap.

195
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:26,775
PUNCHING

196
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:28,641
These guys really
meant business.

197
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,875
-Hyah!

198
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,175
-Ah!

199
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:31,675
Ugh.

200
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,075
-Hey!

201
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:39,875
Who the hell?

202
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:42,341
Huh?

203
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,341
Ah!

204
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,808
Uh!

205
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,775
Hold on to him!

206
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:50,241
-Go ahead, [? Ashiba,
?] let him have it!

207
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:52,076
-Die!

208
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:57,316
[punching]

209
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:09,041
-And that was the
day I met Chad.

210
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:11,975
And Chad never fights
back, no matter

211
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:13,675
how much people egg him on.

212
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,541
-He's an odd one.

213
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:16,041
-Yeah.

214
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:20,775
-This juice tastes good.

215
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:21,275
-Enjoy.

216
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,475
I'm home.

217
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:29,641
Move, Ichigo!

218
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:31,575
Out of the way!

219
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:33,408
-Hey, what's your hurry?

220
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:34,941
Where's the fire, Karin?

221
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,608
Hey.

222
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,308
-Welcome home, Ichigo.

223
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:39,775
-So what's got you
both so worked up?

224
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:40,941
-An accident.

225
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:42,941
There was a big car
wreck down at the corner.

226
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,375
-The big car wreck?

227
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:45,841
-I just told you, four cars!

228
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,108
So you can't take that many?

229
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:49,175
Well, here's a news flash,
they got to go somewhere.

230
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,541
We can't treat them all
here, we're a small clinic.

231
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:54,875
Listen, tell your boss this is
a request from Isshin Kurosaki.

232
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:58,708
He'll find me some hospital
beds that are open, no problem.

233
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:00,275
Just do it!

234
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,208
-Uh, hey dad.

235
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:04,408
-Damn stupid idiots, they
wouldn't know a stethoscope

236
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:05,608
from a cellphone.

237
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,375
-So is there anything I can Do

238
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:09,341
-No.

239
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,775
Just assume that fetal position
and stay out of the way.

240
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:19,508
-Dad, we've got this one last
patient that needs treatment.

241
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,008
-Right.

242
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,041
[groans]

243
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:22,208
-Man, this guy's as
big as they come.

244
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:23,308
[grunting]

245
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:25,541
-Ichigo, come here
and get to work.

246
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:27,208
-You bet.

247
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:30,208
Uh, Chad.

248
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:30,708
-Hm?

249
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:48,841
-Whoa, what a horrible wound.

250
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,141
-So, what happened
to you out there?

251
00:10:51,175 --> 00:10:53,008
This looks like a
pretty nasty burn,

252
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,575
but I think I can help you out.

253
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:55,875
-I've got this feeling.

254
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:57,441
-With this wound,
you're going to have

255
00:10:57,475 --> 00:10:58,741
to take it easy for a while.

256
00:10:58,775 --> 00:10:59,575
-That's good.

257
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,008
-Huh?

258
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,208
-I'm fine now.

259
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:03,375
Thanks for helping.

260
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:03,941
-What!

261
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:05,441
You are crazy!

262
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:07,875
Do you have any idea how
much blood you've lost, son?

263
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:10,075
[groans]

264
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:11,775
-I told you.

265
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:14,508
-Yuzu, Karin, get a
bed ready for him.

266
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,341
-Right.

267
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,508
Time to go to bed, Mr. Giant.

268
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:22,741
-Did you feel it?

269
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:23,808
-Of course.

270
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:26,741
I felt it all the way
in here, and yet I

271
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,741
sense no evil in Chad's bird.

272
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:33,108
But I sense that Chad's wound--
it really reeks of a hollow.

273
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:40,275
[groans]

274
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,075
-Uh!

275
00:11:59,108 --> 00:11:59,575
Uh.

276
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,599
-Morning, Ichigo.

277
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:23,066
Breakfast is ready.

278
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:25,099
-So, hey, is Karin up yet?

279
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:26,699
-She didn't want to eat.

280
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:28,339
She said she's not
feeling so good.

281
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,572
I'm worried.

282
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:31,305
-Really?

283
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:32,172
Karin's sick?

284
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:34,072
That's not like her.

285
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:34,572
-Ichigo!

286
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:35,072
-Huh?

287
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:36,005
-Bad news!

288
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,105
Chad's disappeared
from his room.

289
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:37,739
He's gone.

290
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,005
[breathing heavily]

291
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,939
-Ichigo!

292
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:44,905
-Huh?

293
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:46,805
Rukia.

294
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:48,739
-So you got any idea
about where he might be?

295
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:49,405
-No.

296
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,805
You got any info?

297
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,039
-Not yet.

298
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,439
There's no news from the
Soul Society about a hollow,

299
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:57,305
and I'm not sensing
anything either.

300
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:58,872
When hollows aren't
chasing souls,

301
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:01,205
they can hide themselves
between this world and the Soul

302
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,239
Society.

303
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:03,839
When a hollow is between
those two worlds,

304
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:06,239
like the one on the left,
it can't be detected.

305
00:13:06,272 --> 00:13:09,005
What that means is that we won't
be able to locate that hollow

306
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,772
and deal with it until it
shows up to attack Chad.

307
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:13,172
You understand?

308
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:14,572
You got it?

309
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:16,172
-I think I can understand those
kindergarten drawings of yours.

310
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:16,639
-Uh!

311
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:17,272
-Ugh!

312
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:18,472
I think I got it.

313
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,705
A hollow's targeting Chad
to gobble up his soul.

314
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:22,839
But if we wait for it to
show up and attack him,

315
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:23,739
it'll be too late.

316
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:26,905
I've got to think.

317
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,005
I got an idea.

318
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,805
We'll use Chad's bird friend.

319
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,672
Can we use that bird
to help us detect

320
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:33,072
the presence of a hollow?

321
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,639
-No, that's impossible.

322
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:36,072
[sigh] Hm.

323
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,372
-Ich- igo, what's this
sensation I'm feeling?

324
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:05,539
-You sure are nice, mister.

325
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:06,539
-Hm.

326
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:08,939
-But I need to apologize
to you and help

327
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:11,005
you understand something.

328
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,305
Please listen?

329
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,505
Everyone who has ever owned
me ends up with bad luck.

330
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:19,972
-Yeah, I know.

331
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:21,205
-I'm sorry.

332
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,572
I should have told you.

333
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:23,572
It's not--

334
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:25,039
-Don't worry about it.

335
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,039
-So please, mister, forgive me?

336
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:30,505
And abandon me-- just
leave me here and go.

337
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,005
-Hm.

338
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,705
-Go ahead, mister.

339
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:37,372
-I can't do that to you.

340
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:40,372
[chills]

341
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:42,372
[coughing]

342
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:48,139
-I- chi- go.

343
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,972
[struggling]

344
00:14:51,005 --> 00:14:54,339
-I have got to tell him.

345
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:56,872
-He's trying to feel
the soul in that bird.

346
00:14:56,905 --> 00:15:00,239
Even I can't sense such a
weak soul at this distance.

347
00:15:00,272 --> 00:15:03,772
And that human soul is partially
eclipsed by the bird's soul.

348
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:06,205
To hone in on it
from so far away.

349
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:12,872
He's done it.

350
00:15:12,905 --> 00:15:15,439
-Oh yeah, I got you!

351
00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:18,272
-Ah, wow.

352
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:19,372
[grunts]

353
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:20,772
-He saw it.

354
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:23,472
Spirit ribbons, rays
of spirit energy.

355
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,205
But only a high level
soul reaper can see those.

356
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,672
Can it be?

357
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:32,605
Is he really developing into
a soul reaper that quickly?

358
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,205
-I think we somehow ditched him.

359
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:37,039
-Listen, mister,
you're in danger here.

360
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:40,139
-Don't worry, I'll be fine.

361
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,972
If nothing else, I should be
sturdy enough to handle this.

362
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:44,472
Huh?

363
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:46,439
[creaking]

364
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:49,372
-Huh?

365
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:51,839
[crash]

366
00:15:51,872 --> 00:15:52,505
It's found us.

367
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:53,572
Let's get out of here.

368
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:55,305
-Oh, mister!

369
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:58,339
-Don't worry, we're
going to make it.

370
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:01,739
[shattering glass]

371
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:05,105
[breathing heavily]

372
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:07,072
-There!

373
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:07,572
It's Chad!

374
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,372
Hey, Chad, stop running away!

375
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,172
You need my help, hold up!

376
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:18,705
-Ichigo!

377
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:19,905
-Karin?

378
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:22,439
What are you doing Here
You look really sick.

379
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:23,339
[thud]

380
00:16:23,372 --> 00:16:24,239
-Uh.

381
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:25,739
-Karin?

382
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:28,172
-Ichigo, you need to
get Karin home now

383
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:30,705
so we know she'll be safe.

384
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,539
I'll handle them.

385
00:16:32,572 --> 00:16:33,405
-Hm?

386
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:34,605
What, are you kidding me?

387
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,172
I can't just leave you.

388
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:38,339
-Just do as I say.

389
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,772
I know what would happen
if we leave her here.

390
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:43,039
You'd be worrying about her
when you fight the hollow,

391
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:45,105
and that cannot happen
here, no matter what.

392
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:48,672
Go on, get moving.

393
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:51,905
Get her home, and
get back here quick.

394
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,705
-Rukia, I hope
you know right now

395
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:57,105
you don't have the strength
to fight a hollow by yourself.

396
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:03,572
Please, don't risk
yourself for my sake.

397
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,072
-Don't be stupid.

398
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:08,205
A veteran soul reaper never
takes any unnecessary chances

399
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:08,905
with a hollow.

400
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,305
Now, go.

401
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,272
-Right.

402
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:17,839
[breathing heavily]

403
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:19,439
-You're going to be
all right, Karin.

404
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,205
You just hold on and
hang in there, OK?

405
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:26,505
-Ichigo, I came to
tell you, I saw it.

406
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:29,839
I saw the memories of the
spirit possessing that bird.

407
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:32,139
Maybe it was because
I'm the closest in age

408
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:33,472
to that human soul.

409
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:36,172
His strongest memory flowed
into my mind, and I saw it all.

410
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:40,072
I saw exactly what he
saw-- his mother's murder.

411
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:41,039
[screams]

412
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:43,205
-It happened right
in front of him.

413
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,905
You must tell him that if
he goes to the other side,

414
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,372
she'll be there.

415
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:48,805
You've got to help
that poor boy!

416
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,105
Please do it!

417
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:55,039
Don't let him be alone anymore.

418
00:17:55,072 --> 00:18:00,239
All the terrible pain
he's had, it needs to end.

419
00:18:00,272 --> 00:18:02,539
[breathing heavily]

420
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:03,372
-Damn!

421
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:05,272
I can't even catch up with him!

422
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:08,239
This Gigai I have is
worthless, I can't even fly!

423
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:09,972
Next time I get
a temporary body,

424
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,339
I'll make those R&D imbeciles
give me one stronger than this!

425
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,539
This Gigai's legs
can barely run,

426
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:18,372
and its heart and lungs
are slowing me down.

427
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:19,205
This is bad.

428
00:18:19,239 --> 00:18:21,272
[breathing heavily]

429
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:22,239
[grunt]

430
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:23,672
-You smell good.

431
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:47,972
You smell wonderful, delicious.

432
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:50,705
Time to eat your soul!

433
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:52,105
-Uh!

434
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:52,805
Uh.

435
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,505
-So you're still alive.

436
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,739
You're tougher than
I thought, and you

437
00:18:56,772 --> 00:18:58,305
can see me quite clearly.

438
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,705
That makes me curious.

439
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,139
Just who are you?

440
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:02,639
-Uh!

441
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:03,139
-Ah!

442
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:08,872
-Heh, uh!

443
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:11,039
Ruler, the mask of
blood and flesh,

444
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:12,905
all things of the
universe that fly.

445
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:14,205
That which takes-- ah!

446
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,972
In the name of truth
and temperance,

447
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:19,272
dig your claws into the
wall of [inaudible] dreams!

448
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:23,239
[inaudible] 33, kale fire crash!

449
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:25,205
[explosion]

450
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:26,705
-I did it.

451
00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:28,672
I got my powers back.

452
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:31,572
Huh?

453
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:33,039
Ah!

454
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,972
[explosion]

455
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:36,239
-What's going on?

456
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:37,105
Hear that?

457
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:38,372
-It's attacking her.

458
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:39,572
-Hm?

459
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:42,139
-It's that young lady who
was chasing us before.

460
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:44,572
The monster is
attacking her right now.

461
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:47,005
It's going to hurt
her really bad.

462
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,939
-You, just stay here.

463
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:50,005
I got to do.

464
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,372
-What are you going to do?

465
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:52,739
-I'm going to help her.

466
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:53,639
-Wait!

467
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:54,605
Please!

468
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:56,739
Don't go, it's
just too dangerous.

469
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:57,472
-Hm.

470
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:58,039
-No, don't.

471
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,539
Don't do it!

472
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:00,305
Don't go!

473
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:01,572
You don't understand.

474
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:02,572
Wait.

475
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:03,972
It's not me I'm worried
about, it's you.

476
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:06,505
I really don't care what happens
to me, but you're nice, mister.

477
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,939
It's just that I
don't want to see

478
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:09,305
you get hurt like
all the others!

479
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:12,005
He's a monster, and you won't
even be able to see him!

480
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,005
He will kill you!

481
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,639
Don't do it!

482
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,209
No, please, stop!

483
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:17,176
He'll get you, too!

484
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:19,176
Don't go!

485
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:20,143
-Oh, no.

486
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:22,209
My spell, it didn't
even hurt him!

487
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:24,476
-Heh, heh, heh, I see.

488
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:25,976
So that's what you are.

489
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:28,576
I know that spell, it's
a soul reaper's spell.

490
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:33,043
But yours was so weak it
had no bite to it-- too bad.

491
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:33,976
-Uh!

492
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:35,543
It's just as I thought.

493
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:37,543
My Kido hasn't
recovered its force.

494
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:39,109
My spell has no effect.

495
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:43,743
-My, my, a tender little
soul who's lost her power.

496
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:47,409
Mm, and you do
smell so delicious.

497
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:51,543
This is bringing back
such wonderful memories.

498
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:53,509
You see, I've already
had the pleasure

499
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,976
of devouring two
other soul reapers who

500
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:00,409
tried to help this boy pass
on to the Soul Society.

501
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:04,676
And I assure you, they
were mighty good eating.

502
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:06,043
-The boy?

503
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:08,709
You mean the human soul
that's in that bird?

504
00:21:08,743 --> 00:21:10,076
-That's right.

505
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:11,409
-What's your problem?

506
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:14,076
Why is it you've pursued this
poor kid so relentlessly?

507
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,276
Tell me why!

508
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:17,909
-I might be more inclined
to give you an answer

509
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,743
if you were to let me
have a little nibble.

510
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:22,143
-You hollow scum.

511
00:21:22,176 --> 00:21:25,076
[evil laughter]

512
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:30,943
[crying]

513
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:34,876
-Don't worry, Karin.

514
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:37,876
-You've got to tell that
boy, if he passes on

515
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:39,776
he'll be able to see his mother!

516
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:42,443
You just have to let
that poor boy know.

517
00:21:42,476 --> 00:21:44,709
Don't let that boy
be alone anymore.

518
00:21:44,743 --> 00:21:46,980
Please don't let that happen.

519
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:49,446
He deserves to be at peace.

520
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,797
[crying]

521
00:21:57,718 --> 00:22:02,318
THEME SONG: Nobody
knows who I really am.

522
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:06,484
I never felt this empty before.

523
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:11,251
And if I ever need
someone, I'd come along.

524
00:22:11,284 --> 00:22:16,518
Who's going to comfort
me and keep me strong?

525
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:21,133
[singing in japanese]

526
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:32,025
[singing in japanese]

527
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,984
-Ichigo's really learning how
to win friends and influence

528
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:01,118
hollows.

529
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:02,351
And Rukia's still test
driving her new Gigai,

530
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:03,818
so she's mixing it up, too.

531
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:06,284
But how are they going to hand
this hollow hooligan his hat

532
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,551
and give him a big show?

533
00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:09,351
-Hey, bucket head, you
better get back to your store

534
00:23:09,384 --> 00:23:11,418
and make sure that licorice
root shipment came in.

535
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:12,251
We're out of here.
