[theme music]

3
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,202
NARRATOR: Soul Reapers.

4
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,402
The spiritual guardians to
the world of the living.

5
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:56,135
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

6
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:59,235
of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

7
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:01,935
Sosuke Aizen, who
betrayed the Soul Society

8
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,668
and left the
[inaudible] in chaos,

9
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:06,168
has set his plan into motion.

10
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:09,035
Arrancars have arrived
in Karakura town.

11
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,202
Using the Hogyoku, Aizen
has created these Arrancars

12
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:14,702
by shattering the boundary
between Soul Reapers

13
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:15,702
and Hollows.

14
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,168
Meanwhile, Vizords,
Soul Reapers who

15
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:20,502
have awakened the powers
of their inner Hollow

16
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:23,002
have appeared and
confronted Ichigo.

17
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:25,002
-Besides, it's too late.

18
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:27,202
Once the symptoms
appear, Visords

19
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:29,368
can never become normal again.

20
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:32,535
And no matter what you may
think, the die is cast.

21
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:36,035
You're already on
our side, Ichigo.

22
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:38,068
NARRATOR: Once Aizen's
gang of Arrancars

23
00:02:38,102 --> 00:02:41,835
appeared in Karakura town, they
moved into position to attack.

24
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:44,402
They were immediately
engaged by the advanced team

25
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:47,802
of Soul Reapers, led
by Captain Hitsugaya.

26
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,168
-Dance!

27
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,768
Sode no Shirayuki.

28
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:53,435
NARRATOR: Ichigo and
Rukia were attacked

29
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:55,202
by the Arrancar, Di Roy.

30
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,168
He was quickly
frozen and shattered

31
00:02:57,202 --> 00:03:00,402
by Rukia's powerful
Zanpakuto, Sode no Shirayuki,

32
00:03:00,435 --> 00:03:02,802
which can freeze anything
on land and in the air.

33
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:06,002
But no sooner had she defeated
Di Roy than she and Ichigo were

34
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:08,635
confronted by an even
more dangerous Arrancar,

35
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:10,068
named Grimmjow.

36
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:12,402
Now the entire team
is under attack.

37
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:14,168
Edrad confronts Ikkaku.

38
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:15,902
Renji takes on Eelfor.

39
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:19,835
And Hitsugaya and Rangiku face
off against Sawlong and Nakeem.

40
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:22,068
As both sides begin
to battle, they

41
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,668
start to reveal the
extent of the true powers.

42
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:30,235
-What's the matter, Soul Reaper?

43
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:32,968
If that's the best you've
got, you better give up now.

44
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:40,868
-You were so busy trying to kill
me, I didn't catch your name.

45
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:42,735
-I just realized,
there's no point

46
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:45,935
in giving out my name to
somebody I'm about to kill.

47
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:48,368
-Is that right?

48
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,902
It seems that you and I operate
with very different rules

49
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:54,002
of etiquette.

50
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:56,502
Maybe it's the fact
that you're part Hollow,

51
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:59,868
but we let our opponents know
the name of their killers.

52
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:02,835
It's something I teach
every pupil I train.

53
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,635
If you're prepared
to die in battle,

54
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:07,335
you should want to die knowing
the name of the person who

55
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:09,002
defeated you.

56
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:11,835
So allow me to introduce myself.

57
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:17,368
I'm Ikkaku Madarame.

58
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:19,668
Third Seat of the Zaraki Squad.

59
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,502
I won't bother
spelling it for you.

60
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:26,435
I doubt your brain can
absorb that much information.

61
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:31,002
Just know that I'm the one
who's about to kill you.

62
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:31,968
[fight sounds]

63
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:43,735
Come on you coward!

64
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:46,168
Are you afraid to
use your Zanpakuto?

65
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:50,035
Don't tell me you wear it
on your waist for show.

66
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:52,902
-We Arrancars have iron skin.

67
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:54,968
There's no sword that
can penetrate it,

68
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:57,035
because it acts as our armor.

69
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:58,368
Your weapon is useless.

70
00:04:58,402 --> 00:04:59,668
I can take you barehanded.

71
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:00,768
-Is that so?

72
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:09,268
Good reflexes.

73
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:10,068
That's important.

74
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,468
You're going to need them.

75
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:14,102
But I don't think they're going
to work quite as well after I

76
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:16,035
cut off one of your arms.

77
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:16,535
-Huh?

78
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:22,968
I can't believe it.

79
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:27,102
Forced to draw my sword
against a mere Soul Reaper?

80
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:28,568
Disgraceful.

81
00:05:28,602 --> 00:05:29,968
-Offended, are you?

82
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:32,635
You'll have to release it
if you expect to defeat me.

83
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:41,768
-What's going on?

84
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:43,202
Who are these guys?

85
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:46,935
-Weren't you listening just now?

86
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:48,902
He's Ikkaku Madarame.

87
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:51,768
He's the Third Seat
of the Zaraki Squad.

88
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:53,768
He also happens to be
the second strongest

89
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:57,002
man in that squad, the most
feared squad in the Soul

90
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:58,002
Society.

91
00:05:58,035 --> 00:06:00,235
-Wait, you were
there this afternoon.

92
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:01,368
Hey, come on!

93
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,902
Aren't you going to go
out there and help him?

94
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:05,735
Come on.

95
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:07,002
You are his friend, aren't you?

96
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:13,235
-Don't you see what's going on?

97
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,202
Look how happy he is.

98
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:17,202
He's having fun.

99
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:19,902
It's been a long time since he's
fought such a strong opponent.

100
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:23,035
He's forced to use
all of his training.

101
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:24,568
-Huh?

102
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:27,802
-He would be furious if
I interfered in any way.

103
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,368
So I don't intend
to help him out.

104
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:31,968
You understand?

105
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:32,768
-No!

106
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:34,535
This makes no sense at all!

107
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:35,602
Check out his opponent.

108
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:38,202
He's a massive killing machine.

109
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:41,068
Is there some guarantee
your friend will win?

110
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:41,902
-There isn't.

111
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,102
-What the hell's wrong with you?

112
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:45,002
Aren't you going to feel
guilty if your buddy dies,

113
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:47,435
and you didn't do
anything to help?

114
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:48,768
-That's a risk each of us takes.

115
00:06:55,202 --> 00:06:58,002
But he'd die doing
what he loves most.

116
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:12,835
-His style is rough, but
his skill is undeniable.

117
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:15,468
He provokes me just
enough to be annoying.

118
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,902
He keeps his sword in
his left hand to attack,

119
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,468
and a scabbard in his
right hand to defend.

120
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:21,902
He's easy to read.

121
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:22,902
An open book.

122
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:29,602
Since I know which
arm he'll attack with,

123
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:32,268
I can easily anticipate
his offensive strategy,

124
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:34,868
and look for
weaknesses to exploit.

125
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:37,068
Punching through his defenses
and finishing him off

126
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:38,035
should be easy.

127
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,568
Here comes his
attack from the left!

128
00:07:54,068 --> 00:07:54,902
He switched hands!

129
00:08:10,102 --> 00:08:10,568
[grunting]

130
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:23,002
-Darn, I missed.

131
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,468
I was trying to
chop your head off.

132
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:26,268
I aimed too high.

133
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:28,268
-Who is this guy?

134
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:30,635
He made me think his
attacks were predictable,

135
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:33,068
just so he could
catch me off guard.

136
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:36,268
And just as I made my
move, he switched his sword

137
00:08:36,302 --> 00:08:39,735
to his other hand,
and slashed my face.

138
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,168
That's a crazy way to fight.

139
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:44,635
It's possible to score big.

140
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:47,468
But he's liable to
end up dead himself.

141
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:49,335
That's not fighting to win.

142
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:53,368
That's fighting for sport.

143
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:57,635
At first glance it may
seem clever, but it's not.

144
00:08:57,668 --> 00:09:00,302
It doesn't make any sense.

145
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:04,068
He exposed himself in
order to lure me in.

146
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:06,502
This guy thinks this is a game.

147
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:10,202
He doesn't take the
danger seriously.

148
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:13,502
Is that all your
life means to you?

149
00:09:13,535 --> 00:09:15,535
-That slap move,
where you focused all

150
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:19,002
your spirit energy into your
hand was pretty effective.

151
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:21,735
Hey, you even knocked
out a couple of my teeth.

152
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:24,002
Ah well, whatever.

153
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:25,402
When I'm done
here, I'll just get

154
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:28,302
Akon to give me a deal
on some replacements.

155
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,102
All right.

156
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,735
So let's get back to business.

157
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:33,335
Are you ready for
the second round?

158
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,602
I think I've got you
figure it out now.

159
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:42,768
Another five or six strikes
is all it should take.

160
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:44,368
And then you'll
release your Zanpakuto,

161

-Oh really?

163
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:51,968
I've underestimated you.

164
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:54,402
I guess there's no
point in holding back.

165
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:57,035
You won't be satisfied
with anything less.

166
00:09:57,068 --> 00:10:00,702
I should just release my
Zanpakuto to fight you, right?

167
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:02,335
-That's about the
size of it, now

168
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,635
that you know how
tough I really am.

169
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:05,602
-Fine.

170
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:07,535
A fool like you
who loves to battle

171
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:09,235
needs to be taught a lesson.

172
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:13,068
You need to know what it's like
to feel uncontrollable fear.

173
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:15,068
Something so
terrifying it makes you

174
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:17,402
tremble all the
way to your bones.

175
00:10:17,435 --> 00:10:19,602
After this, you'll
never find it fun

176
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:22,868
to pick a fight
with an Arrancar.

-I reveal my secret power,
and all you can say is that?

181
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:26,468
This, my naive friend,
is what happens

00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:28,602
when an Arrancar
releases his Zanpakuto.

183
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:32,702
-Not good.

184
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,535
In fact, it's really bad.

185

-I recall you said
it was a courtesy

186

to tell an opponent the
name of this killer, right?

Is he an Arrancar too?

But he's not like that last one.

192
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:28,635
That guy was arrogant
and inexperienced,

193
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:29,802

An Arrancar's
Zanpakuto is sealed

with the core of his
power in his body.

It's completely different
from you Soul Reapers.

209
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:38,235
We Arrancar take
on our true forms,

210
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:41,002
and reach our full power,
through the release

of our Zanpakuto.

212

You were so anxious for me
to release my Zanpakuto.

Well here it is.

-The destructive
power of the enemy

has vastly exceeded estimations.

220

We need to put up an area freeze

The cost of the

will come out of
the mission budget.

224
00:14:34,702 --> 00:14:36,935
Unfortunately a
number of souls will

225
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:38,335
be caught within
the target area.

226
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:42,368
The protection of those souls,
as always, is our top priority.

00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:44,335
-Understood, sir.

A weakling like you, with
such low spiritual pressure,

You should give up now.

A truly wise warrior knows
when to admit defeat.

And though you didn't
win, you fought well.

surrender now, I will

would be this much

I guess there's no choice.

I really didn't want
to use this here,

You can decide if
it's effective or not.

off your ugly head.

He cut through my Volcanica!

291
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,676
I can still beat him.

292
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:22,443
His Bankai doesn't increase
his kido, his speed,

293
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:25,109
or his defensive abilities.

294
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:27,443
The Bankai is just a
huge mass of power.

295
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,576
A pure destructive force.

296
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:33,043
But it's only as effective
as the warrior who uses it.

297
00:20:37,476 --> 00:20:40,109
There's a flaw in his strategy.

298
00:20:40,143 --> 00:20:42,476
His reliance on
the power of Bankai

299
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,676
makes him slow to
counter my attacks.

300
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:58,009
He may be fearless,
but he's not stupid.

301
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,109
I need to find a way
to outmaneuver him

302
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:02,009
before he can cut off my limbs.

303
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,909
I have the will to win.

304
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:07,043
He'll never beat me in a
battle of pure strength.

305
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:09,843
It will be power versus power.

306
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:12,076
And I am fully armed.

307
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:13,743
Hm?

308
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:15,709
Wait a minute.

309
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:18,576
His Zanpakuto is
getting stronger.

310
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:21,443
His spiritual pressure
is increasing.

311
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:24,376
-Hozukimaru is
finally awakening!

312
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,109
He's such a slow starter.

313
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:28,943
He's usually asleep
when I use my Bankai.

314
00:21:28,976 --> 00:21:32,276
And he takes his own
sweet time getting up.

315
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:35,043
But he's no good to me
unless he's fully awake.

316
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:36,376
That's when his power activates.

317
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:39,409
I'll have to force him awake
by slashing up my enemy,

318
00:21:39,443 --> 00:21:41,943
or letting him slash me up.

319
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:45,576
I can monitor his progress
by watching the dragon slowly

320
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,876
light up on the blade.

321
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,276
When it's completely red, his
power will be at full strength.

322
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,543
When that happens, I
can start cutting you up

323
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:56,109
like a turkey on a platter!

325
00:22:04,076 --> 00:22:05,043
-Are you ready?

326
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:05,509
-Uh-huh.

GRIMMJOW: It's time for
Grimmjow's Arrancar seminar.

329
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,067
Each of us has a number
to go with our name.

330
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,400
For instance, I'm
Arrancar number 6,

331
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,167
also known as Grimmow.

332
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,800
This will be on the test, so
make sure you pay attention.

333
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,033
-Uh, Professor, what about 15?

334
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:01,800
Which one's 15?

335

337
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:16,367
-Excuse me, sir.

338
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,833
I wanted to clear
something up with you.

339
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:20,233
When I'm not
available, you don't

340
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:23,333
have to fill in for me anymore
at lieutenant's meetings.

341
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:25,000
-Part of a captain's
duty is to make

342
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:28,600
sure all of the lieutenant's
responsibilities are being met.

343
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:32,433
-If that's true in every case,
Captain, then tell me this.

344
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:35,300
Whenever Rukia's not available
and has responsibilities,

345
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:38,267
do you represent her at the
female Soul Reaper Association

346
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,800
meetings?
