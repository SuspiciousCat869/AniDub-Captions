Now then.

00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,733
Shall we get on with it?

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,833
Captain!

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,100
Yeagh!

5
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:08,899
Huh?

6
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:09,832
Hm?

7
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,632
Damn! Damn!

8
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,132
DAAAAMN!

9
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:28,699
Brother, are you...

10
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:32,366
[sigh] What are they
doing down there?

11
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:36,932
Well... the good news is, no
matter who lives and who dies,

12
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:40,532
I'll still acquire some
excellent research
specimens afterwards.

13
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,532
That was an impressive Cero.

14
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,932
That damn bastard.
I guess he still
has some power left.

15
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:51,266
[Byakuya]
It seems so.

16
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:54,566
You said he was
almost finished.

17
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,632
From over here,
it certainly doesn't
look that way.

18
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:02,699
Your assessment of
his condition has
proven very foolish.

19
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:07,999
Ha! I wasn't wrong. I told
ya all that guy needed was
someone to finish him off!

20
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,666
The only foolish part was
thinking (that) you could handle
it!

21
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:15,866
<i>Is that so?</i>

22
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,366
You doubt my abilities, do you?
Why don't you judge them for
yourself!?

23
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:30,699
Good idea.

24
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,499
I've always wanted to
fight you! And now's
as good a time as any!

25
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,166
Huh?
Huh?

26
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,866

00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:20,032
Now then.

31
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:22,166
Shall we get on with it?

00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:36,699
Hrrrnghh...
Ahh!

Hah??

34
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:42,966
He is persistent.
What a nuisance.

35
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:47,066
Heh heh heh heh...
Hah hah hah hah hah hah!

36
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:51,399
That hurts... You two are
starting to piss me off.

37
00:04:51,432 --> 00:04:52,599
Ha ha ha ha!

38
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:55,932
What's with him? Has he
gone crazy or somethin'?

39
00:04:56,332 --> 00:05:01,699
Unforgivable! Unforgivable!

40
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:07,366
Unforgivable!

41
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:08,966
[gasps]

42
00:05:18,032 --> 00:05:19,332
What happened?!

43
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:21,699
[gasp]

44
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,866
What is that!?

45
00:05:36,432 --> 00:05:42,199
Very good, you two. By all
means, keep annoying me.

46
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,632
Heh heh heh heh heh.

47
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:49,966
The name of my Resurrección
is Ira. I'm a beast of rage!

48
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:53,632
Anger fuels me,
it becomes my strength!

49
00:05:54,532 --> 00:06:00,666
Come on! Keep at it. Make me
angrier! //

50
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:06,199
It will only make
your deaths... that
much more pathetic!

51
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:10,632
My word... Those two are
making things difficult.

52
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,932
I wish they'd just hurry up
and kill each other already.

53
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,599
I mean, if he gets
any larger...

54
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:21,332
it'll be difficult
to dissect his body.

55
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:23,332
Raagh!

56
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:44,599
Kaname!

<i>[Sajin]</i>
<i>Kaname!!</i>

58
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,132
<i>Come back, Kaname!!</i>

59
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,332
Have you forgotten?
You once told me why
you became a soul reaper.

60
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:45,932
<i>Wasn't it for your friend who</i>
<i>lost their life? Wasn't it to</i>
<i>carry out your justice?!</i>

61
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,299
I thought I had made
it clear to you.

62
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:52,832
My eyes can only see one path,
and that is the path with the
least amount of blood.

63
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,466
<i>Justice is always there.</i>

64
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:59,266
And the path I
follow is justice!

65
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:07,532
rrrr...RRAHH!

66
00:08:10,332 --> 00:08:14,166
Friend of Kaname Tosen,
you whose name I do not know,

67
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,999
<i>What would you have done?</i>
<i>What would you have said to</i>
<i>stop him?</i>

68
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:28,166
Captain Komamura...

69
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,966
Do you think
he'll come back?

70
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:34,032
Or is Captain Tosen
gone for good?

71
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:36,632
He'll be back.

72
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:43,032
<i>[Sajin]</i>
<i>But we must find a way to</i>
<i>open his eyes to the truth.</i>

73
00:08:57,532 --> 00:09:00,632
Well at least now
you are leaving us.

74
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,532
Hiyori!!

75
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,132
Hiyori...

76
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:31,299
I'm so sorry Shinji...

77
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:32,999
Don't speak...

78
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:35,999
I... did
hear you...

79
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:39,299
But I just couldn't
hold back.

80
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:51,099
How ferocious.

81
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:57,032
Your eyes look as if they've
come back to life for the first
time in a hundred years..

82
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,599
<i>...Shinji Hirako.</i>

83
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:06,366
[pained panting]

84
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:15,499
[Aizen]
Do you hate me?

85
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,832
If you do, by all means attack.

86
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:28,766
I'll make an exception,
And I'll only fight you
with my sword.

87
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:33,099
Hachi.

88
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:33,866
Yes, Shinji?

89
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,099
<i>Sorry to ask you this in</i>
<i>your current state, but</i>
<i>please take care of Hiyori.</i>

90
00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:43,799
Do whatever you can
to keep her alive.

91
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:45,866
At least until
Ichigo returns.

92
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:47,599
Yes.

93
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:52,866
Shin... ji.

94
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,366
"Until Ichigo returns", eh?

95
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:08,932
You must trust that
boy quite a lot.
How very touching.

96
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:11,499
Yes, that must be
unfathomable,

97
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:14,966
...For someone who doesn't even
trust his own people.

98
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:20,732
You don't get it. Trust is the
same thing as reliance.

99
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:22,866
It's a fault of cowards.

100
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:26,766
I have no need for
such weakness.

101
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,866
That's pretty rich coming
from a guy who surrounds
himself with henchmen.

102
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:34,399
But you trick your subordinates
into trusting you.

103
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:36,966
With that fast-talking
silver tongue of yours.

104
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,099
Not quite.

105
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,132
I have many subordinates, many
who've pledged themselves to me.

106
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,799
But I've never asked
for any of their trust.

107
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:54,332
<i>Yes, I've asked for their</i>
<i>allegiance. But faith is</i>
<i>another matter altogether.</i>

108
00:11:55,999 --> 00:12:01,432
<i>In fact, I always told them</i>
<i>to never trust anyone...</i>
<i>including myself.</i>

109
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:09,866
Unfortunately, though, I've met
no one who is strong enough to
actually heed that warning.

110
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:17,399
All creatures need to obey.
No one can survive without
trusting someone;

111
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:21,166
someone they feel is
better... more worthy
than themselves.

112
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:31,032
<i>To avoid that responsibility,</i>
<i>those who are worthy look</i>
<i>even higher, searching for</i>
<i>more superior beings.</i>

113
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:38,832
<i>And those superiors do</i>
<i>the same, looking for</i>
<i>even stronger individuals</i>
<i>they can believe in.</i>

114
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,166
That is how all
kings are created.

115
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:49,466
It is also...
how gods are born.

116
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:56,699
<i>But please, don't believe</i>
<i>me yet, Shinji Hirako.</i>

117
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:02,866
I am going to take my time,
and show you which god you
should have faith in.

118
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,866
And afterwards,
you'll decide
what to believe.

119
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:26,253
I'm surprised.

120
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:31,420
Frankly, I never
expected Lord
Aizen to go to
the front lines.

121
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:36,387
However, since Lord Aizen
has made his move,

122
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,487
I suppose that I
should take you on
with my true power.

123
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,853
Your true... power?

124
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,453
You mean your Bankai.
Very well, then I
shall use mine also.

125
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:49,620
My Bankai?

126
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:50,520
Hm?

127
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:52,087
Ridiculous.

128
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:57,420
Lord Aizen has granted
me a power that is far
more powerful than a
simple Bankai.

Hollowfication.

Is that... Is that
Hollowfication,

It is.

150
00:16:54,653 --> 00:17:00,720
It's different...
Ichigo Kurosaki did not
Hollowfy by his own choice.

151

He's not the same as you.

Depraved?

155
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,553
How is it depraved for
Soul Reapers to become
closer to Hollows?

156
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:29,220
That's a simplistic
judgment from one who sees
all as soul reapers as good
and all hollows as evil.

157
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:31,520
You're wrong!

158
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:35,653
You betrayed your comrades,
you betrayed your friends,
you even betrayed your
followers.

159
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:41,487
All for the sake of
gaining excessive power.
That is the definition
of depravity!

160
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:44,053
Sajin...

161
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,987
[gasp]

162
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,587
It seems I didn't step close
enough to you. A naiïve mistake.

163
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:03,420
Not quite. I instinctively
dodged your blade by a hair.

164
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,420
<i>Once you've drawn your sword,</i>
<i>always position yourself to be</i>
<i>able to sidestep an attack.</i>

165
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:20,520
Captain Tosen, you taught me
that. In fact, it's because of
you that I was able to--

166
00:18:29,553 --> 00:18:33,653
<i>[Kaname]</i>
<i>What's wrong, Shuhei?</i>
<i>Why have you called me here?</i>

167
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:37,853
You wished to speak with me.
What's troubling you?

168
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,020
Captain Tosen...

169
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:45,853
I beg you, relieve
me of my post as a
seated officer!

170
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:49,520
Ah. I understand.

171
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:55,687
Don't worry about your
mistake during training
yesterday. Everyone
starts off like that.

172
00:18:55,887 --> 00:19:02,020
This is different!
I didn't fall behind because
I made a mistake or
because I was careless...

173
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:05,420
I was... I was just afraid!

174
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:12,053
<i>My right eye was wounded</i>
<i>when I went to the World of</i>
<i>the Living for a drill.</i>

175
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:23,653
Since then, I've been unsteady.
Whenever I draw my sword,
whenever I face an enemy,
I lose my confidence!

176
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:31,253
Captain Tosen... I'm just...
I'm too afraid to do battle!

177
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:37,187
You're afraid of battle,
are you?

178
00:19:41,853 --> 00:19:44,853
<i>That's exactly why you</i>
<i>should remain an officer.</i>

179
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:50,887
The most important asset for a
warrior is not power... No...

180
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,387
It is a heart that
fears conflict.

181
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,987
A heart,
that fears?

182
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,587
That's right.
Even I fear
entering a
battle.

183
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:02,320
You, Captain Tosen?

184
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:07,087
I cannot see.
How could I not be
afraid to fight?

185
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,987
Gripping my sword...
even taking a step
forward like this...

186
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,487
it's incredibly terrifying.

187
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:24,553
Fear gives you the courage
to raise your sword, it
gives you the strength and
will to fight for others,

188
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:26,687
for those who
also fear battle.

189
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:33,653
Those who are unafraid to
hold their swords in battle,

190
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:35,987
don't have the right to
hold them at all.

191
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:37,820
(ct stunned)

192
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:41,720
Shuhei... if you are truly
afraid of fighting...

193
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:48,587
Then you have already
gained something
invaluable to a warrior!

194
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,253
But now...
I don't
understand,
Captain Tosen.

195
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,120
Those were
your words.

196
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:06,887
So why discard
everything for
mere power?!

197
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,653
What is it you fear now?!
Tell me, Captain, where is
that fear that guided you!?

198
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,087
Ngh... Agh...

199
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:20,887
Cap... tain...

200
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,053
<i>Why...?</i>

201
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:34,020
I am afraid.

202
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:38,353
I had the same fear
for a hundred years.

203
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:42,053
The fear of assimilating
and dying as a Soul Reaper.

204
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,587
