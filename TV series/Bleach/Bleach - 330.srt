1
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,519
[Ichigo] So uh,
that's the
situation.

2
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:57,893
Her family is going through
some pretty hard times and
had to live apart.

3
00:01:58,127 --> 00:02:00,766
And Rukia's the only
relative she could go to.

4
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:02,536
[sobbing]

5
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:03,338
[crying]
Bawww!

6
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:04,808
Please let
her stay!

7
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:07,648
It's so sad. it's just
like in the movies!

8
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,452
You've got it, Yuzu!

9
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:13,795
Even if her story wasn't
like a movie I'd let her
stay here 'cuz it's so sad!

10
00:02:14,196 --> 00:02:15,665
This is worse
than any movie.

11
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:17,837
Watching you two is like
watching a bad rerun.

12
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,478
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me, okay?

13
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:25,287
How am I like
a "movie"?

14
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:26,255
Good question.

15
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:30,231
Wow! With you two here,
it's as if I have four
daughters instead of two!

16
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:32,736
You see this, honey?!
Daddy's got his own
little harem now!

17
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:38,316
Just so you know, the words
"harem" and "daughters" are NOT
supposed to go hand in hand,
you dirty old bastard!

18
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,288
It's just his way of
saying we're happy
to have you here.

19
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:42,458
[chuckle]

20
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,197
Thank you.

21
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,306
So we're gonna head
out to do some
shopping for awhile.

22
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:50,877
If you need anything,
just call us.

23
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:54,651
Ready?

24
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:55,386
Yup!

25
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:56,589
Dad-your shoes!
Put them on!

26
00:02:56,623 --> 00:02:57,725
Oops, almost
forgot 'em!

27
00:02:57,758 --> 00:03:00,288
Nozomi.
What's up with you?
Something wrong?

28
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:00,732
[door closes]

29
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:02,402
No. it's nothing.

30
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:03,437
[phone beeping]

31
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:04,773
Another one?

32
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:06,711
[Ichigo]
How many times
is that today?

33
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:10,519
You stay here, and watch
TV or something, okay?

34
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:14,628
[Ichigo]
Hey Kon,
take my place!

35
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,600
[Kon]
Huh? Uh, right.

36
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:22,913
[Orihime]
Heeeyy!

37
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:23,815
Hnh?

38
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,354
Oh hey,
Orihime, Chad.

39
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,359
Hey there Kon.
What are you up to?

40
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,296
Oh, uhh,
not too much.

41
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:31,700
Is Nozomi at home?

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,503
Uh...
Yeah.

43
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:36,009
She's probably pretty bored.

44
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:37,646
Would ya mind
keeping her company?

45
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:45,429
Kon was acting
kinda strange.

46
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:46,499
Hmm.

47
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:55,385
So then, present
your update.

48
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:59,394
Sir. We've lost all
contact with the captains
that were there.

49
00:04:00,663 --> 00:04:01,866
Hmm.

50
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:08,747
I will rule the Soul Society!
You will bow before my
invading army!

51
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,952
Ha ha ha ha ha!

52
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:14,961
Until this moment,
my forces were holding
back their power!

53
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:16,899
Now you will see...

54
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:19,471
the true capabilities
of Reigai!

55
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,716
Sir, wait!
If we lose you...

56
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,720
You're our
Head Captain!

57
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:29,928
The Thirteen Court
Guard Squads are
bound to fall apart.

58
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:33,669
We must fall back and
regroup for the time being.

59
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,943
Rrr.

60
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:40,785
[Renji]
However...

61
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:45,462
It's very unlikely that
our captains would be
defeated so easily.

62
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:50,573
And the transmission
that Kisuke received
may not reflect the
situation completely.

63
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,012
The situation is dire.

64
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:58,023
In assessing our resources,
besides the lieutenants in
the World of the Living,

65
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:02,533
the only other battle-ready
force we have, is Ichigo
Kurosaki and his group.

66
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:06,909
We must prepare at once,
to defend against an assault
by the invading army.

67
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:08,479
Understood sir.

68
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:13,523
Head Captain, we've also been
receiving reports of an
increase in Hollow sightings.

69
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:18,869
The balance of power between
the World of the Living and
the Soul Society has changed.

70
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,708
It's natural that more
Hollows are appearing.

71
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:25,483
What we have feared the most,
has now become reality.

72
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:28,156
Though our fighting force is
small, we'll still stop them.

73
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:32,732
Defending the World of
the Living from Hollows
is our sworn duty,

74
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:37,643
but we must also stay alert
for any possible attack by
Inaba's invading army.

75
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:38,746
Yessir.

76
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:45,527
They will
be fine.

77
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,699
Right...

78
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:51,407
[Ichigo]
Hyaaaah!

79
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,429
[Ikkaku]
Damn it.
You killed it already?

80
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:02,131
Huh?!

81
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,603
Ikkaku, you're okay
to be out here?

82
00:06:05,003 --> 00:06:06,908
Sure, c'mon!
You know me!

83
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:10,949
By the way, how's that
Mod Soul girl you're
watching doing?

84
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,954
Well she's...

85
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:16,462
To be honest with you,
she's been looking
pretty tired lately.

86
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:17,932
Is something going on?

87
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:20,003
Hmmm...
Hmmm...

88
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:21,841
Hm?
Hm?

89
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:27,186
[crowd of shoppers]

90
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:38,845
[Nozomi]
Out of all the Mod Souls
that have been created...

91
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:42,987
...I was the first.

92
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:47,664
So, what am I supposed
to say to her now...?

93
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:49,468
Here you go!

94
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:49,935
Huh?

95
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,506
We're doing
a promotion!

96
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:53,511
Oh... thanks.

97
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,753
Here have one!
We're doing a
promotion!

98
00:06:57,753 --> 00:06:58,822
[Kon]
What is this?

99
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:03,231
Hmm??

100
00:07:04,768 --> 00:07:06,172
It's falling apart.

101
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:10,514
Why'd I even take one?
This sucks.

102
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:12,619
Hm?

103
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,829
Hmmm.

104
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:22,173
If you're not going to make
them right from the start,
then don't make them.

105
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,080
[exhausted sigh]
Aahhh.

106
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:26,249
Huh?

107
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:29,556
Where the hell
have you been?!

108
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,062
Huh? Oh! Sorry...

109
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:35,202
Since you weren't here,
I've had to stay a Soul
Reaper this entire time.

110
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:37,073
Hurry up and swap
back willya!

111
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:38,276
Uh Sure.

112
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:41,550
What can I
use this for?

113
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,019
Oh, the spicy
mayonnaise?

114
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:45,057
I'd just mix it
into the chocolate.

115
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:48,899
Orihime, That doesn't
sound like a good combo.

116
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:54,578
[sigh]

117
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:01,727
[Kisuke]
So you're asking
me about Nozomi?

118
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:05,235
Yeah. Don't try pretending
like you didn't know about her.

119
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:07,307
Well, Okay.

120
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,250
I have to admit I did find
it odd that I didn't sense
any Spirit Energy from her
when we first met.

121
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:17,127
Also there's the way she went
about healing Ichigo's wounds.

122
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:21,270
Seeing her do that, made
me feel pretty confident
that she was a Mod Soul.

123
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:25,079
At first I thought
she was using Kido.

124
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:27,851
But I quickly realized it
was something different.

125
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,292
That's when I concluded
the following.

126
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:34,700
Her powers are due to
her being an artificial
life form.

127
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,373
So then, I'd say
she's a Mod Soul.

128
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:40,813
However...

129
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:46,693
The real question is, why is
Nozomi wanted by Kageroza?

130
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:53,809
Once I return and I
have retrieved Nozomi,

131
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:58,018
Then I will be able to
completely show all of
you my true power.

132
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:03,763
We'll have to get an answer
from her sooner or later.

133
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:06,737
Right.

134
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,011
Yay, it's done!

135
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:11,715
My own special creation:

136
00:09:11,748 --> 00:09:13,185
Choco-nomiyaki!

137
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,258
Choconomi...
yaki?

138
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:19,198
Is this more in the
category of a chocolate?

139
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:21,236
or an
okonomiyaki
instead?

140
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,808
Uhh... I'd say
it's more like...

141
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,879
Hong Kong style
fried noodles!

142
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:27,182
Now I'm really
confused.

143
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:31,892
Well?

144
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:33,362
Delicious.

145
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,400
It is?!
Al-right!!!

146
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:39,075
Hey Orihime, could
you come back and
make dinner too?

147
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:40,745
Huh? You sure?

148
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,349
Sure! You should
cook all you want!

149
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,453
I'll love to
adopt a cutie pie
that's like you!

150
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:46,391
[Ichigo]
Cut that out,
ya dirty old man!

151
00:09:46,424 --> 00:09:49,397
Oh yeah? Take this!
Choconomiyaki!

152
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:54,743
Hnh?

153
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,713
Oh!

154
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:00,856
Hey.

155
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:04,330
Hi.

156
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,374
[Orihime]
Hey Nozomi!
C'mon!

157
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,479
She's waiting for you.

158
00:10:11,713 --> 00:10:13,250
Uh... right.

159
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:42,514
[gasp]

160
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,492
[breathing hard, struggling
to walk with his injuries]

161
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:02,491
What are you
worrying about?

162
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,467
Didn't I tell you?

163
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:10,911
Everything in the scheme
of all this is going
just as I've planned.

164
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:16,322
It's Nozomi?
Well it's only a
matter of time.

165
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:17,391
Unngf!

166
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:18,561
[coughs]

167
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:21,935
I'll be all right.
You'll see.

168
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:28,583
The originals aren't fools.
I expected to suffer wounds
like these from them.

169
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:30,120
Ah!

170
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:35,932
I will make sure that
your dream will finally
become a reality!

171
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:41,577
[forlorn sigh]

172
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,549
This is
depressing!

173
00:11:43,582 --> 00:11:46,455
It feels wrong!
All this just
isn't me!!

174
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:49,562
What's happened?
Why're you yelling?

175
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:51,132
Rukia!

176
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:54,239
Please help me sweetie!
Give me a good punch!
Punch me!

177
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,943
Owwww!!

178
00:11:58,282 --> 00:11:59,284
Feel better now?

179
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:02,991
Ya see, I asked you to
punch me, not kick me.

180
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:08,604
[female announcer]
Attention shoppers! Right now,
everyone in our store gets a
free "I'm the Man!" Lion!

181
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:09,907
[growly male voice]
I'm the man! Rwaah!

182
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:11,343
[chuckle]

183
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:12,546
[Ichigo]
Hey, Nozomi!

184
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:14,650
What's wrong?

185
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:16,589
Nothing, just
looking at stuff.

186
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:19,261
Now we're
all set.

187
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:21,633
We've picked up
everything we
need for dinner.

188
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,537
All right, let's go
home then, okay?

189
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:24,940
Sure.

190
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:26,109
Mm?
Hm.

191
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,216
Ichigo!

192
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,254
Damn.
Another one?

193
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:32,490
Gotta go!

194
00:12:32,524 --> 00:12:33,526
Need help?

195
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,427
I'll be fine!

196
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:39,172
Rwaaaarrr!

197
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,610
Waaaahhh!

198
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:46,287
Damn! What's taking
Rukia so long?

199
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,055
[Uryu]
Duck!

200
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:53,035
Hey. You okay?

201
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:55,373
Thanks. Guess I
owe you one, Uryu.

202
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,912
What do you think
you're doing anyway?

203
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:03,058
Playing games? It's a good thing
I was passing by right now.

204
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,262
Everything's fine, really.

205
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:09,171
Hey, since you're in the area,
why don't you come over to my
place for dinner tonight?

206
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:12,211
Why're you asking ME over?
You're creeping me out.

207
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:16,119
Actually, Orihime's making
dinner for us. And uh...

208
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,193
You see... Well,
it's about Kon.

209
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:20,563
Is something
wrong with him?

210
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,705
I wouldn't say anything's
wrong exactly, but he's acting
like he's got no energy.

211
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,311
Well can you blame him?...

212
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:32,455
Think about what must be going
on in his head now that he
knows Nozumi is a Mod Soul,
exactly the same as he is.

213
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:35,729
You can't expect him to keep
behaving like he used to.

214
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,504
That's why I figured the
livelier things are at home,
the better for him.

215
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:43,012
I never knew you had the
heart to think of other
people's feelings.

216
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:46,653
Hey now, are you trying to
make me sound like I'm some
kind of insensitive jerk?!

217
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,092
Umm-mmm-mmm-mmm!!

218
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,431
[Kon as Ichigo]
Wow, This is delicious, Orihime!

219
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,203
So tasty! You're a
culinary genius!

220
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:56,107
Haha! You
really think so?

221
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,312
Ichigo sure
looks energetic.

222
00:13:58,346 --> 00:13:59,481
More like
weird!

223
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:03,323
He said he had "no energy".
Look at him now.

224
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:05,227
I know, he's
really perked up.

225
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,000
Hey! Are you two statues
tasting this great food?

226
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:10,171
Or have your
taste buds left
the building--

227
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:12,477
If it were up to me, I'd have
him lose all that energy.
because Orihime's food's too
good for you stuffed shirts?

228
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,345
Mmm.

229
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,384
Hey Nozomi!

230
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,623
I hope you're eating,
'cuz you won't grow if
you don't eat your food!

231
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,395
Especially your boobs!

232
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:21,296
[Uncomfortable

233
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,098
Hrk!

234
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:25,171
Hey! Sorry! I didn't
mean to say that!

235
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,576
You're right. Weird.

236
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,247
Weird's an
understatement.

237
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:31,185
Wow! This fried fish!

238
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:33,624
So where's Ichigo?
The way it tickles the taste
buds is out of this world!

239
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:38,167
[Ichigo]
Question her?
What's this about?

240
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:39,804
Just this.

241
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:43,144
We should know why
Kageroza is pursuing
her so relentlessly.

242
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:46,185
What sort of threat
does she pose to us?

243
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,557
With our showdown with
Kageroza looming,

244
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,162
we thought it best that we
question her thoroughly.

245
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:56,474
I don't think any of us feel
confident that we know enough
about Nozomi to act decisively.

246
00:14:56,807 --> 00:15:01,384
We'd rather learn as much as we
can about her, to help us avoid
any more casualties.

247
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:02,420
That's all.

248
00:15:03,723 --> 00:15:06,095
This course of action
isn't a decision reached
by just the three of us.

249
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:10,638
We're saying this to you
on behalf of the surviving
Thirteen Court Guard Squads.

250
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,643
Look, this isn't personal.

251
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,847
I get what
you're saying.

252
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,584
But hold on.

253
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:21,328
Maybe there's stuff
she's not ready to
share with us just yet.

254
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,432
I'm going to protect her.

255
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:25,371
Can we please just leave
it at that for now?

256
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:29,145
[Ikkaku]
Sounds noble, but this is
no time for talk, is it?!

257
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,252
[Yumichika]
Keep in mind that it was
Kageroza's invading army

258
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:35,626
that wiped out the
captains of the Thirteen
Court Guard Squads.

259
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:40,170
And we'll be battling
that same invading army
here in Karakura Town.

260
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:44,111
This time, the
casualties probably
won't end with just us.

261
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:49,524
Well! It's quite
ironic, isn't it?

262
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:50,526
How's that?

263
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:54,133
You see, when they
originally conceived
of Project Spearhead,

264
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:58,142
it was specifically intended
to prevent Soul Reaper
casualties from occurring.

265
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,249
But instead of the
project doing what it
was designed to do,

266
00:16:01,283 --> 00:16:05,592
many Soul Reapers have
suffered greatly in trying to
protect that Mod Soul girl.

267
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,897
That's about as
ironic as it gets.

268
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:10,670
I understand
your point.

269
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,775
[Ichigo]
But here's what
I believe.

270
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:15,681
I think as long as
Mod Souls are born
into this world,

271
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:17,753
they've got a right
to keep on living too.

[light snoring]

273
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:36,728
[sigh]

274
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,806
[Kon]
Heh. Heh. That explains
quite a bit, actually.

275
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:47,317
It finally comes out that
this bastard is the one who
originally created Mod Souls!

276
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:51,293
It all makes sense now.
No wonder you couldn't
trust me, Nozomi.

277
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:53,598
You're wrong!
That's not the reason!

278
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:54,600
Then what is it?!

279
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:56,337
It's obvious!

280
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,379
You thought of me as
nothing more than one of
Kageroza's creations!

281
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:03,587
Please just listen to me!
He didn't create you!

282
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,729
[Nozomi]
Out of all the Mod Souls
that have been created...

283
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:12,272
...I was the first.

284
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,297
Augh! That idiot!

285
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,493
But instead of the
project doing what it
was designed to do,

286
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:40,936
many Soul Reapers have
suffered greatly in trying to
protect that Mod Soul girl.

287
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:43,374
That's about as
ironic as it gets.

288
00:17:56,437 --> 00:17:58,942
You've got attitude,
but you're useless.

289
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,414
I guess you're
just like I am.

290
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,617

Rwaahh!

It's all my fault.

If I die, no one
will have to get hurt.

00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:46,078
Huhh? What's this?!

311
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:49,084
Wait a second! Is that a...?!!

312
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:52,058
Rwaaahh!

313
00:19:55,866 --> 00:19:56,567
Mmn...

314
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:57,202
Huh?

315
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:13,472
Haaaaa!

316
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:17,146
Hah!

317
00:20:22,457 --> 00:20:25,866
[panting]

318
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,907
What is happening?

319
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,153
Hey Nozomi. I thought
you said you didn't
have a Zanpakuto.

320
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,990
That's what I thought.

321
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:41,199
So just what were you
doing wondering around
so late anyway?!

322
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:45,843
I'm such a burden.

323
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:47,179
Not that again!

324
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,083
But it's different
this time.

325
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:52,691
Everyone here is doing all
they can to protect me.

326
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:54,997
But I don't have the
power to protect them.

327
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,041
But then, when I thought of
how I wanted to protect you,

328
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,713
Suddenly I had this sword.

329
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,049
Huh?

330
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,889
[chuckle]

331
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:13,504
Ah ha ha ha ha,
ha ha ha ha!

332
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:14,072
What is it?

333
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,147
You're so right!
What was I so
worried about anyways?

334
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,619
Getting all worked up
about what to say to you.

335
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:21,120
Huh?

336
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:22,791
Here's what I say!

337
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:26,265
We were born as Mod Souls,
but let's not let that
stop us from living!

338
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:27,935
Right!... Huh?

339
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:31,242
Hnh? Hey now, what's
this lion doing here?

340
00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:32,946
He's cute!

341
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:36,855
Do you want this
messed up little guy?

342
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:37,824
Mm!

343
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:40,096
Alright then!
He's all yours!

344
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:41,699
Ya mean it?!

345
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:45,540
Uh-huh, but he's kinda
falling apart, ya see his
mane unraveled and fell off.

346
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:49,683
I like him
that way.

347
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:51,554
Here.

348
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,605
What do you think?

349
00:22:00,073 --> 00:22:02,845
Hah? Ha hah!
You are such a kid!

350
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:04,249
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

351
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:08,691
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

352
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:10,195
Stop laughing, pervert!

353
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,230
Sorry.

354
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:48,311
[Ichigo] [whisper]
Hey Uryu, how'd the dinner go?

355
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,850
[Uryu]
It went fine. Right after
Orihime finished cooking,

356
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:53,255
I secretly snuck in
the kitchen and added
a lot of spices,

357
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:55,059
so it all tasted
pretty good.

358
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:57,264
[Ichigo]
Now that you mention it,
I haven't eaten.
Can I have some?

359
00:23:57,297 --> 00:24:00,327
[Uryu]
I have no intention of
feeding someone who
went and hid in his room.

360
00:24:00,361 --> 00:24:01,729
[Ichigo]
So you knew about it, huh?
