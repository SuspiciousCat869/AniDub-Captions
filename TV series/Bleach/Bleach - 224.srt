ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
I'm Ichigo Kurosaki,

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,866
and other than having the
ability to see spirits,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,200
I used to be an ordinary
high school student.

4
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,633
But the day I met
Rukia Kuchiki, I

5
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,400
was given the powers
of a Soul Reaper

6
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,433
in order to protect the
world of the living.

7
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,833
As I began my work as a
substitute Soul Reaper,

8
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:21,300
I found myself thrown into
a never ending battle.

9
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,000
In the midst of everything,
my best friend, Orihime Inoue,

10
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:27,166
was abducted by ex-Soul
Reaper captain, Sosuke Aizen.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,400
My friends Chad and Uryu
joined me as a raced

12
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:30,733
to rescue Orihime.

13
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:33,000
Once we arrived in Hueco
Mundo, we entered a fight

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,200
with powerful enemies
known as Arrancars.

15
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:37,233
We were too late to
keep Aizen from entering

16
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:39,900
the world of the living, but
luckily, the 13 court guard

17
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,966
squads were already
there to stop him.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,733
An all out war was
about to begin.

19
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:47,700
[theme music]

20
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:31,357
NARRATOR: One after another,
Baraggan's Fracciones

21
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,223
were defeated by the
efforts of Captain

22
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:34,423
Komamura and the lieutenants.

23
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,557
Nirgge Parduoc
learned that looks

24
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,057
can be deceiving,
ultimately defeated

25
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,123
by Omaeda's greater speed.

26
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:46,623
And the last of the
Fracciones, Ggio Vega,

27
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:49,723
using his Resurreccion
form, Tigre Estoque,

28
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:52,257
gradually pushed
Sui-Feng into a corner.

29
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,090

31
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:07,157
-You're in the way.

32
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,057
What is this?

33
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,623
You can't appear out of nowhere.

34
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:14,090
Now fly away.

35
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,590
-Who told you to come rescue me?

36
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:32,757
As I was fighting him,
I was holding back,

37
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,323
because I wanted to gauge
the strength of an Arrancar's

38
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:37,557
Resurreccion attack.

39
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,523
-Don't you mock me.

40
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:48,923
Look, you.

41
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:51,057
I'll show you what
true strength is!

42
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,823
Behold, Tigre Estoque's
actual battle form.

43
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:07,990
This is Tigre Estoque Sabre!

44
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,457
-Sorry.

45
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,723
Victims of my Suzumebachi
are killed by the two stings

46
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:24,390
that I deliver.

47
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:27,390
But I'm betting
you only felt one.

48
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,990
-Dammit.

49
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:43,790
[scream]

50
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:18,523
-Let's go again, Shall we?

51
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:19,023
-Heineko!

52
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:31,123
-I told you it's no use, honey!

53
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,157
RANGIKU (VOICEOVER): I can block
these attacks with Heineko.

54
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,523
Now, how do I use
it against them?

55
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:41,523
-Excuse me.

56
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:51,190
-You're wide open!

57
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:15,723
HITSUGAYA (VOICEOVER): Looks
like Sui-Feng and Omaeda took

58
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:17,823
care of their
opponents, but Rangiku

59
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:22,490
has got her work
cut out for her.

60
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:24,623
-Something on your mind?

61
00:06:24,657 --> 00:06:27,190
-Nothing you need to
concern yourself with.

62
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:28,557
-Worried about your subordinate?

63
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:34,557
If you're going to fight
me, you should concentrate.

64
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,457
If you don't-- You're dead.

65
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,923
-Prove it.

66
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,990
-Nice move there, friend.

67
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:08,123
Hey, what do you know?

68
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:10,557
You can use a sword.

69
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,490
-I don't like to, though, if
I have a choice in the matter.

70
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:15,523
-Terrific.

71
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:17,257
Let me know how that
works out for you.

72
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,557
-Well, this should be fun.

73
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,057
-Hey, uh, you two mind if I
sit this one out for a while?

74
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,290
-Excuse me?

75
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:42,323
-What sort of nonsense is that?

76
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:43,123
-Come on.

77
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:45,157
This chick is a total loser.

78
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,057
She can't win this.

79
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,157
It's three on one.

80
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,423
She doesn't stand a chance.

81
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:50,523
This isn't even a contest.

82
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,290
Hey, you, girly.

83
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:53,657
I'm not gonna hold
it against you

84
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,290
if you need to run
and get your friend.

85
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:57,723
If this were three against two,
you'd at least have a shot,

86
00:07:57,757 --> 00:07:58,757
know what I'm saying?

87
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:07,157
I said, you don't
stand a chance!

88
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,023
Nice try.

89
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:17,057
You don't have what
it takes to handle me,

90
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,357
let alone the three of us!

91
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:33,257
-What?

92
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,023
It's you.

93
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:41,757
Momo.

94
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:53,557
-What's the matter,
Captain Aizen?

95
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,190
Is there something
troubling you?

96
00:08:57,223 --> 00:08:58,657
-Oh no.

97
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,623
It's nothing, really.

98
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:02,623
Certainly not worth mentioning.

99
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:17,123
-Youe spiritual pressure
wavered for a moment.

100
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,590
-What are you talking about?

101
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:22,057
-Something happened.

102
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,557
-News to me.

103
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:29,957
(IN HEAD) Momo.

104
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,590
Why did you come here?

105
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,323
-Momo.

106
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,857
Are you-- Are you OK now?

107
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,357
-Yes.

108
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:12,823
You needn't worry, Rangiku.

109
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:14,190
It's true.

110
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:17,357
As you can see, I've come
here as the lieutenant

111
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,023
of Squad Five.

112
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:22,523
But when I say that,
I mean I've come here

113
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:25,123
as someone who does not
take her title so lightly,

114
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:28,590
like you once told me.

115
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:31,723
My days of taking orders
from Captain Aizen are over.

116
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:37,357
I have accepted the truth.

117
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,957
He betrayed the Soul Society.

118
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,023
He is our enemy.

119
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,690
-Yes, he is.

120
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:51,990
I'm glad that
you've come around.

121
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:54,323
(VOICEOVER) Momo, can you
even hear yourself? (OUT LOUD)

122
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:55,323
Now, let's go!

123
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:57,323
-Right!

124
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,590
RANGIKU (VOICEOVER): You just
called him Captain Aizen.

125
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:03,990
-Just be careful.

126
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:05,090
OK, Momo?

127
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,057
EMILOU: You done yet?

128
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,190
You're boring me
to death over here!

129
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:16,590
-Tobiume!

130
00:11:24,023 --> 00:11:25,857
-Oh, I get it.

131
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,890
The blast I got hit with came
from that sword of yours, huh?

132
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:31,890
Not bad.

133
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:33,557
Not bad at all.

134
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,457
And she's a lieutenant, no less.

135
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,290
Not that it matters, though.

136
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,090
An extra lieutenant doesn't
really change the equation.

137
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,357
Hah!

138
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,223
Now come on!

139
00:11:52,257 --> 00:11:53,490
We've wasted enough
time on this.

140
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:56,790
Sung-Sun, Mila Rose, let's
put an end to these fools

141
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:59,623
and get back to Master
Harribel already!

142
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:01,590
-She never shuts up.

143
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:05,090
-You're the one who's been
putting up all the fuss.

144
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:06,090
-Although--

145
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:07,557
-You do have a point.

146
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,123
-Sorry, cow!

147
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:13,723
Time to die!

148
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,757
What the-- what is this?

149
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,023
-When I struck you before, you
didn't give it any thought,

150
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:28,223
did you?

151
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,890
How my Tobiume blasted into
you from out of nowhere.

152
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,090
The three of you are
considerably stronger

153
00:12:42,123 --> 00:12:43,657
than I am.

154
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,623
In order for me to get in
close enough with Tobiume,

155
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:50,490
I had to conceal both
my physical presence

156
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:53,990
and spiritual
pressure with Kido.

157
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,823
And while I was hiding
myself, I took the opportunity

158
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:58,423
to set a Kido net
around Rangiku.

159
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,823
Truthfully, though,
I never imagined

160
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:05,290
it would ensnare
all three of you.

161
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:09,923
-You little--

162
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,757
-Now snap, Tobiume.

163
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,940
-Whoa.

164
00:13:31,974 --> 00:13:33,640
Would you listen to that?

165
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:36,907
They must really be going
at it over there, huh?

166
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,307
Hm.

167
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,840
So, Espada, how about it?

168
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:43,407
I'm thinking it's time you
and I got down to business.

169
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,974
-I'll pass.

170
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:50,074
-Aw, come on, now.

171
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:51,607
Don't be a buzzkill.

172
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,307
Show me a little love.

173
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,307
-You act like you're
itching for a fight,

174
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,940
but you're not playing
for real yet, either.

175
00:13:57,974 --> 00:14:00,940
You haven't even drawn
that other blade of yours.

176
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,740
-I only pull that one out
when there's not enough room

177
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:05,974
to work with the bigger blade.

178
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:07,840
You see, they're
not meant to be used

179
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:09,940
in conjunction with each other.

180
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,940
-Is that a fact?

181
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:13,507
It's interesting
you should say that.

182
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:23,674
Seeing as how you've been
shifting your sword from one

183
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:26,240
hand to the other so much.

184
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:29,040
And I don't know if
you're conscious of it,

185
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:30,407
but your right?

186
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,040
I notice that it doesn't extend
quite as far as your left sword

187
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:37,407
hand does, in case
you didn't know.

188
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,307
You've got a long and
short sword on ya.

189
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,307
You're ambidextrous.

190
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,340
Swing each arm a
bit differently.

191
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:45,474
But you claim you're
not a dual wielder?

192
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:49,007
You must take me for a fool.

193
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,407
-Hm.

194
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,474
Yeah, you got me.

195
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:54,974
Thought I had compensated
enough for the difference

196
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:57,207
between my left and my right.

197
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,607
Those are some sharp
eyes you have there.

198
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,440
Little spooky, actually.

199
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:07,074
And you're quick, too, huh?

200
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,374
-That's incredible.

201
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,374
You adjusted your sword arm
in a fraction of a second.

202
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:13,340
I can't even tell
them apart anymore.

203
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:14,740
-Well, thanks for
the compliment.

204
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,707
-Hm.

205
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,174
-You're not gonna go and give
your friend a hand over there?

206
00:15:37,207 --> 00:15:38,507
-Of course not.

207
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,707
Two against one would be unfair.

208
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,040
-Look, I know that sounds nice
and all, but Starkk is no joke.

209
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:46,940
That old man is gonna die today.

210
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:48,674
-Oh, I have faith in him.

211
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:50,940
Shunsui can more
than hold his own.

212
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:52,440
-You're gonna be sorry.

213
00:15:52,474 --> 00:15:54,107
Your friend is a dead man.

214
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,907
Don't say I didn't warn you.

215
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,640
-I appreciate your candor.

216
00:15:57,674 --> 00:15:58,940
It's very kind of you.

217
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:03,240
I'll just have to pray
it doesn't come to that.

218
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:05,507
-Yeah, sure, awesome.

219
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,640
Anyway, you gonna
fight me, or what?

220
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:08,574
-Absolutely not.

221
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:09,540
-Wha--

222
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:11,707
-I'll not raise my
hand to a child.

223
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,040
In fact, I don't think you
should be on this battlefield

224
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,974
to begin with, if you must know.

225
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:16,640
-A child?

226
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:17,740
Are you kidding me?

227
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:20,440
Age means nothing to
an Arrancar, you idiot.

228
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:24,507
-I'm aware of that, but it
doesn't change matters for me.

229
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,040
In my eyes, you're
still a child.

230
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:29,240
And a girl, at that.

231
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:32,040
I simply can't fight you.

232
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,007
If you're that determined
to force a confrontation,

233
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,940
I'm afraid I'll just
have to send you home.

234
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:39,540
You should be off
doing kid things,

235
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:41,774
like kicking a ball around.

236
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:43,274
-Heh, heh.

237
00:16:43,307 --> 00:16:44,274
OK.

238
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:45,874
I get the picture.

239
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:47,707
Mock me all you want, boy scout.

240
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,707
But like it or not, it's on!

241
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,940
-Well, that didn't work.

242
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:04,474
-You're pretty good.

243
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:12,040
Are you ready to get
serious now, or what?

244
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:16,207
-I already told you that's
not going to happen.

245
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,840
-In that case, I have a
question for you, Mr. Espada.

246
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,474
-What is it?

247
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,740
-If I drew my
other sword, do you

248
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:26,040
suppose you'd have
a change of heart?

249
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:28,440
-Spare me the pretense.

250
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:31,107
I know that you're
strong enough already.

251
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,007
There's no way I can
handle both swords.

252
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,674
-You don't say.

253
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:40,274
Well, then, two swords it is.

254
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:42,707
-So, that's how it's
going to be, huh?

255
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,740
-Are you sure you're
all right, Momo?

256
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:07,107
-Yes.

257
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,307
Sorry about that.

258
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,874
I had never used that
combination of techniques

259
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:12,507
before.

260
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,674
-Don't sweat it.

261
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:15,507
It was amazing.

262
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,707
That was Fushibi.

263
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,374
Number 12, wasn't it?

264
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:21,707
It's the first time I've ever
seen one quite so intricate.

265
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,840
-Yes.

266
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:25,774
I first wove Shakkaho
together with Fushibi,

267
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:29,907
then used Bakudo number 26,
Kyokko, to make them invisible,

268
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,340
before carefully stretching
the combination out

269
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:34,840
into a wider net pattern.

270
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:36,407
RANGIKU (VOICEOVER): Incredible.

271
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,974
Having the ability to
combine several of these Kido

272
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:41,574
in her own unique fashion?

273
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:45,507
Her skills have
improved exponentially.

274
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,440
-It was pretty
difficult to concentrate

275
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:50,574
under the circumstances.

276
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:53,607
But I'm glad it
worked out in the end.

277
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,007
RANGIKU (VOICEOVER): Hm.

278
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,107
Thank goodness.

279
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,640
She's in better
shape than I thought.

280
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:04,135
-Thrust, Cierva!

281
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:06,006
-Eat your fill, Leona!

282
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:07,439
-Strangle to death, Anaconda!

283
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:13,873
-It can't be!

284
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:29,039
I didn't think my attack would
be enough to outright defeat

285
00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:32,173
them, but they're
virtually unscathed.

286
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:35,706
-Their injuries heal when
they take Resurreccion form.

287
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:38,406
That's how they've all
managed to make it this far.

288
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:39,439
-Bite me.

289
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:42,739
You really think
you're all that, huh?

290
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:43,673
-Here it comes.

291
00:19:43,706 --> 00:19:45,139
-Just leave it to me!

292
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:49,973
-It's huge!

293
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:50,473
-Tobiume!

294
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:55,839
-Heineko!

295
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:07,506
-Forgive me, Rangiku.

296
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,273
-Their strength has ratcheted
up, just as I feared it would.

297
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:13,206
If you and I aren't
careful here,

298
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,806
they're going to obliterate us.

299
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,673
-I understand.

300
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:19,039
I'll factor that in as
we're taking care of them.

301
00:20:19,073 --> 00:20:21,106
-Hm.

302
00:20:21,139 --> 00:20:22,739
-You're going to
take care of us?

303
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:25,306
You girls really
know how to bug me.

304
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:28,373
Quit fluffing your egos,
and let's go, already!

305
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:31,206
-Hold it.

306
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,939
Stop letting yourself get
all bent out of shape.

307
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:35,206
It isn't helping any.

308
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,539
-She's right.

309
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:39,639
As far as I can tell, the
only overblown ego around here

310
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:40,939
is yours.

311
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,573
-Aw, shut up!

312
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:45,839
I don't need to be taking any
of this from you two, either!

313
00:20:45,873 --> 00:20:46,906
-Quiet, Sung-Sun.

314
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:49,206
You'll just make it worse.

315
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:51,773
[sigh] We need to do something.

316
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:53,673
This is getting out of hand.

317
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:54,739
-Yeah, smart ass?

318
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:56,373
And what would that be?

319
00:20:56,406 --> 00:20:59,106
-We're going to need
to step up our game.

320
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:01,273
-No other choice, really.

321
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:02,106
-Man.

322
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:04,306
I Can't freakin' believe this.

323
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:06,839
We're really going to waste
it on this pair of losers?

324
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,816
-Chimera Parka.

325
00:21:24,406 --> 00:21:28,839
-What the--

326
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:30,339
What is that?

327
00:21:59,873 --> 00:22:01,639
What in the world is that?

330
00:23:45,913 --> 00:23:47,013
MOMO: Come on, Rangiku.

331
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:48,813
We can take that thing.

332
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:50,847
RANGIKU: You got
a plan worked out?

333
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,980
MOM: Yes.

334
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,180
If we're able to probably
combine our Kido,

335
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:56,980
I think we can create a
monster every bit as grotesque.

336
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:57,847
RANGIKU: Ew!

337
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
No thanks!
