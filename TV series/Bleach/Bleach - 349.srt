1
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:54,863
[female announcer] Time is up.
As predetermined earlier,

2
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:58,800
since use of Fullbring was not detected
within the 15 minutes allotted,

3
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,670
"Crazy Beast Mode"
will now be activated.

4
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:04,272
Please! Urgh!

5
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,808
Aughlblghl!

6
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:11,313
This is cruel. Don't!

7
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:17,586
Huh?! What the hell's this?

8
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:24,960
[roar]

9
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:40,809
[growl]

10
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,881
Graaagghh!

11
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:57,325
Now what do I do?!

12
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:02,230
I need to manifest this Fullbring
thing using my Combat Pass.

13
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:05,100
But how
do I do it?

14
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:08,270
What did he say again?

15
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:10,572
Use your pride!

16
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:11,573
Ah!

17
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:12,774
Hunh?!

18
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:15,810
Think back Ichigo!

19
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:19,848
Remember those times when you had all
that pride in your Soul Reaper powers!

20
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:24,719
That Combat Pass will respond to
what you possess in your heart!

21
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,622
Think back to then! Do it!

22
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:32,827
The moment I was proud of
my Soul Reaper powers?

23
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:35,196
Think back.

24
00:03:59,721 --> 00:04:00,955
Everything.

25
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:07,629
I was proud at every moment!

26
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,165
[gasp]

27
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:11,166
Hnh?!

28
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:26,281
Wait! This is...
Zangetsu's guard!

29
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:36,891
Is that Ichigo's...

30
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:39,127
His Fullbring.

31
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:42,130
[growling]

32
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,568
That's right.

33
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:50,271
I'm sure you feel that
every battle you've fought

34
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:52,107
is deeply etched into
your soul and memory.

35
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,811
And that same memory has also been etched
into the soul of that tool in your hand.

36
00:04:57,178 --> 00:05:00,115
Each time you hold your
Combat Pass after a battle,

37
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:04,152
that Combat Pass etches the memory of
that specific battle into its soul,

38
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:06,254
where it remains
recorded forever.

39
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,326
The experience of having fought
countless battles creates a

40
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:14,229
huge advantage to such warriors
when they achieve Fullbring.

41
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:17,265
Even though you've lost your
Soul Reaper powers,

42
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:21,202
Your Combat Pass still remembers
that power you possessed.

43
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,271
Never forget that.

44
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,775
[roar]

45
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:49,898
[roar]

46
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,834
Hurrh?!

47
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:00,942
[gasp]

48
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,249
Damn! I guess that wasn't
the way to use it.

49
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,085
[growl]

50
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:21,830
So, this guard-shaped spirit energy only
comes out when I'm actually holding it.

51
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:23,231
[gasp]

52
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:24,899
[roar]

53
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:35,877
It didn't cut him.

54
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:38,146
So this guard doesn't
have that kind of power.

55
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:43,685
I should've known. You can't cut somebody
by just hitting them with a guard.

56
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:47,288
Hraaghhrrhh!

57
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:48,323
In that case!

58
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:50,925
Augh!

59
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,566
But, hold on. I'm thinking that this thing
can be used just like any guard can!

60
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:02,737
[gasp]

61
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:04,973
What was that
sensation just now!?

62
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:06,040
[gasp]

63
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:07,842
Huh?

64
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,577
Mmm?

65
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:12,013
[chuckle] You catch on quickly.

66
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,585
As this fight goes on, I see your mind
becoming more focused on the task at hand.

67
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:18,086
Heh.

68
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:22,924
And unlike a minute ago, when you
could do absolutely nothing at all,

69
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:26,961
a tiny glimmer of hope has turned you
into a totally different fighter.

70
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:35,203
So then is that change from instinct or
from all your experience? I wonder, Ichigo.

71
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:41,309
I can do this. I definitely
recognized that sensation!

72
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:43,244
Idiot!

73
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:45,280
You're charging in too close!

74
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,149
[roar]

75
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:57,926
That sensation was
Getsugatensho!

76
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,893
Huaaah!

77
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:01,329
Ouaagh!

78
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:07,969
Wow.

79
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:09,771
Ichigo.

80
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:11,673
You did it!!

81
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:13,074
[giggle]

82
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:14,008
Oh!

83
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:14,876
[embarrassed]

84
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:18,346
I won!

85
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:21,549
I don't believe it.
at this rate,

86
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,285
I just might be able to regain
my Soul Reaper powers!

87
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:33,761
Hey! I passed the test didn't I?

88
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:36,064
So it's time to let me
the hell out of here!

89
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:39,701
Oh! Unh!
Oh all right then.

90
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:42,003
[Giriko]
No. Not just yet.

91
00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:43,104
Huh?

92
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:45,039
Now what?!

93
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:48,142
If that was truly an
expression of Fullbring,

94
00:08:48,176 --> 00:08:50,979
then the requirements
of the timer have been

95
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,881
met and Mr. Pork should
soon return to normal.

96
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:58,586
We must observe that take place
before releasing Mister Ichigo.

97
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:04,225
Ah yes.

98
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:07,128
You see?! We're done!
Now get me out!

99
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:09,130
[pleased]
Ah!

100
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:13,001
All right already! I guess
I can let you out now!

101
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,903
You almost
seemed pleased.

102
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:22,877
Huh?

103
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:24,746
What're you doing up there?

104
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,114
Hah-ah-

105
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:27,115
Ah-choo!

106
00:09:27,148 --> 00:09:27,749
Whah?!

107
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:29,584
Ugh. Gross.

108
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:31,119
Achoo!

109
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:32,887
Euuugghh!

110
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,655
Hm?

111
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,663
Hah! All I have to do
is sneeze on an object

112
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,965
to undo my Dollhouse
Fullbring spell!

113
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:46,167
I think got that without
you explaining!!

114
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,302
Look at me! I'm
soaked in snot!

115
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:49,737
So, you want a towel?

116
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:52,940
Well whatta you think?! You knew
this would happen, didn't you?!

117
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:57,311
Hm?!

118
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,583
I wasn't able to turn off its spirit
energy on my own, it did it itself.

119
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:06,087
Is there a time limit to how
long it can be activated?

120
00:10:07,722 --> 00:10:09,023
[Rukia] [through static]
That can't be!

121
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,924
Huh!?

122
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:16,731
Ichigo wouldn't, he would never succumb
to the temptation of the enemy!

123
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:21,669
I can't hear it anymore.

124
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:24,005
What the hell was
that just now?

125
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,276
That sounded like it was...
Rukia's voice!

126
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:31,345
What's going on?

127
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:55,303
Really? Her?

128
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:58,039
But she's a girl!

129
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:01,676
Mm-hm. Yeah, you're right.

130
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:04,278
And she will be
our next target.

131
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:06,114
I see...

132
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:10,251
But I don't think you're up to
handling this, Shishigawara.

133
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,254
You couldn't attack
a girl, could you?

134
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:17,658
What?! No, I can do this!
Just watch me!

135
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:28,002
Chad's not back.
He's been gone awhile.

136
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:32,940
And Ichigo didn't come to school
today either. I hope they're okay.

137
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:37,044
But the bread I left for
Chad was gone, so I guess

138
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,148
he is coming back home
once in a while at least.

139
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:43,551
I'll show him I'm useful!

140
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:46,721
Whatever it takes,
I'll beat her to death.

141
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:49,257
That'll prove to Mister
Tsukishima how useful I can be!

142
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:50,958
Hello!

143
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:51,893
Ah!

144
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,330
My name is Moeh Shishigawara
from Miyashita High School!

145
00:11:57,031 --> 00:12:01,169
Excuse me, but would you
mind dying a little for me?

146
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:04,739
[Moeh] Making the first move
is vital when you're killing!

147
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:08,910
Now turn around!
C'mon do it! Turn around!!

148
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:12,213
As soon as she turns around and
sees me, I'll give it to her good!!

149
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:14,882
Rrrr!

150
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,587
Ah!

151
00:12:22,924 --> 00:12:24,225
Whatta knock out!

152
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:28,763
Huh?

153
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:30,665
Damn!

154
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:32,133
She's hot!

155
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,601
Ah...

156
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:36,204
[Moeh] Aw c'mon, man...
Are you serious?!

157
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:39,040
She's too hot for words!
Is she really human?!

158
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:41,108
She's so hot, she
totally blew me away!

159
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:44,612
No, wait! My eyes must
be playing tricks on

160
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:46,914
me! There's no way anyone
can look that hot!!

161
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:50,852
It could be that my senses are shot because
I haven't scoped out any girls in a while.

162
00:12:51,686 --> 00:12:53,988
Um, you okay
down there?

163
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:57,992
Take another look.
She isn't all that.

164
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:02,763
[punched]

165
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:07,568
I can't! No way! There's
just no frickin' way! Agh!

166
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:09,103
I can't look her in the face!

167
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:09,737
Hm?!

168
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:14,909
Sorry, Mister Tsukishima. But it
looks like.... this is it for me.

169
00:13:18,246 --> 00:13:19,080
Eesh!

170
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:21,282
Wait! What am I thinking?!

171
00:13:21,282 --> 00:13:23,551
I can't just give up like this!

172
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:25,753
Mister Tsukishima showed
me that picture of

173
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:27,989
her because he believed
I could handle this!

174
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,857
Agh!

175
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,563
If I don't see this job through to the
finish, I can never call myself a man!

176
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:38,866
Oh! He's getting up.

177
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:42,770
Yo! Listen up you!
Say your prayers, woman!!

178
00:13:42,803 --> 00:13:46,807
I, Moeh Shishigawara, have
come here to take you down!

179
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:49,010
Down to where?

180
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,811
Gaaghh!?

181
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:53,848
She didn't get what I said?!
She can't be human!

182
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:56,117
I didn't know someone like
her could even exist!

183
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:01,923
No! Me "Take you down"
you know? As in kill!?

184
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,793
When I say "Take you down" I mean
that I came here to kill you!

185
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,962
Just I like I did
your four-eyed buddy!

186
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:13,067
So are you the one
who attacked Uryu?

187
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:18,606
What's with her? Now she's
acting all different.

188
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:20,841
Answer me.

189
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:29,583
This is good.

190
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,986
With all this tension in
the air, I can fight.

191
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:35,189
You already know the
answer to that, don't you?

192
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:39,860
After all, I pretty much gave it
away there by saying "four-eyes."

193
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:42,263
That's true.

194
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:46,600
Then, I want you to tell
me about your friends.

195
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:50,638
For a girl that's so hot you sure
do ask some stupid questions!

196
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:53,007
I'm not tellin' you squat
unless you make me!

197
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:55,242
Think you can beat
it outta me?!

198
00:14:55,843 --> 00:14:57,345
[Shukuro]
Okay, that's enough.

199
00:14:58,012 --> 00:14:58,746
Hn?

200
00:14:59,113 --> 00:14:59,880
Uh?

201
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:07,321
Mister Tsukishima!

202
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:12,834
The person who
attacked Ishida,

203
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:15,236
would be me.

204
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,445
This whole thing ain't right!

205
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,315
First, you kidnap me,
then ya brought me here,

206
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:29,717
and now that you're done with
me, ya give me "see ya"?!

207
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,352
What the hell's
with that?!

208
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:35,256
Y'know that is just rude!
It blows!

209
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,159
So then what'ya
want from me?

210
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:42,230
Money! I should be paid
for my pain and suffering!

211
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:47,235
Pay me and I'll keep my mouth shut about
what went on. Sounds fair, right?!

212
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:48,202
Huh?

213
00:15:49,771 --> 00:15:51,673
I bet that nut job grabbed
you just like she

214
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:53,541
did me and then dragged
you over here too!

215
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:57,278
What you kids are into nowadays,
I don't even have a clue.

216
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,181
But her parents gotta
be nuts as well.

217
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:02,450
But regardless of that,
I'm not budging from here

218
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:05,553
until I get some cash for what I went
through and you should try to get--

219
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:06,788
Auggh!!

220
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:11,593
Augh.

221
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:15,263
You! I'm not afraid of
that magic stuff you do!

222
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:16,464
Eee!

223
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:21,369
Wait! I'm sorry! I just got carried away!
Forgive me!

224
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:25,807
I didn't mean what I said please don't put
me back into that plushie! Please don't!!

225
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:27,742
As long as
you get it!

226
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,745
Here! Take this cell phone!

227
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:33,648
Huh?
what's this thing for?

228
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:36,884
Duh. So I can call you if
you're needed for another job.

229
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:39,887
And if I call, you better get
here within fifteen minutes.

230
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:41,789
Now hold on!

231
00:16:41,823 --> 00:16:44,425
I gotta admit, that Plushie and
this guy are kinda the same.

232
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:46,327
Learn some
respect--!

233
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:50,765
Eaahhuhuhu! Okay! I give!
Alright! Whatever you say!

234
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:55,770
Hmmm!

235
00:16:56,838 --> 00:17:00,475
'Kay! You can go home
now too, Ichigo. Get out.

236
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:01,843
Huh?

237
00:17:03,444 --> 00:17:07,582
Seriously? I thought for sure I'd
be sleeping over to stay and train.

238
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:08,616
[gasp]

239
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,584
What?!!

240
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:13,855
As if I'd ever let a gross creep like
you sleep here! That's just sick!

241
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:16,824
Go home, you
stupid pervert!

242
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:18,359
Look you little--

243
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,261
[Kugo] You know she's
got a good point.

244
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:21,396
Hm?

245
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,832
Letting you stay here
overnight would be reckless.

246
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,635
As you now understand,
Fullbring is the power

247
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:30,204
to control souls with
your own flesh and blood.

248
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:33,775
And it takes a far greater toll on your
body than you might think it does.

249
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:36,511
Don't push yourself
too hard, Ichigo.

250
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:39,881
If something goes wrong, your
whole body will shut down.

251
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:41,282
Mm.

252
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:42,850
I see.

253
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,722
There's no point
in rushing this.

254
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:51,426
We'll call you back here as soon as
your body has completely healed.

255
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:54,696
You've lived for over a
year without your powers.

256
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:58,433
I mean, what's a few
more days, right?

257
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:05,506
Ah!

258
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:12,880
The person who
attacked Ishida,

259
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:15,216
would be me.

260
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:18,419
[nervous breathing]

261
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:26,194
So who are you?

262
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:29,530
Shukuro Tsukishima.

263
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:31,699
I'm your--

264
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,167
[Moeh]
Mister Tsukishima!

265
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:35,703
You really didn't need to
show up here sir, honest!

266
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:37,371
I'll take care
of this one!!

267
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:41,175
This is something I know I can
do, so please just let me do it!

268
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:43,177
Yeah?

269
00:18:44,112 --> 00:18:45,313
Just watch me!

270
00:18:46,214 --> 00:18:48,382
Alright, go on!
Come at me, lady!

271
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:49,851
Yeah! Do it now!

272
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:52,553
I am gonna beat
you to death!!

273
00:18:53,855 --> 00:18:55,456
All right,
that's enough.

274
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:56,491
Yeah, what now?!

275
00:18:57,558 --> 00:18:58,559
Time to go home.

276
00:18:58,593 --> 00:19:00,428
What're you talking about?!

277
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:04,365
As your devoted apprentice, I can't
withdraw from the task at hand now!

278
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:07,168
I appreciate you looking
out for me sir, but your

279
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:09,537
honor is more important than
my life in this mattter!

280
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:10,705
And I know I can--

281
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:11,806
Mmmh!

282
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,444
Moeh, Let me ask
you something.

283
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:22,150
Think back. Didn't I say to you that
you didn't have to do anything?

284
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:26,187
Uh, Yes sir.

285
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:28,823
I thought so.

286
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:32,560
Then tell me what exactly
are you doing here?

287
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:38,599
I... thought it would be good if
I came here, so I could help.

288
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:44,272
Aww. Now I've lost track
of how far I'd read.

289
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:45,840
What a pity.

290
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,710
Right, Shishigawara?

291
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,887
[Chad] There's probably
more again today.

292
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:01,589
What are you talking about?

293
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:05,326
For a while now, Orihime
brings bags of bread

294
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:07,195
over to my house and
leaves it there for me.

295
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:10,198
Oh that. Well she's been
really worried about you.

296
00:20:10,598 --> 00:20:12,400
You should let her know
that you're eating it.

297
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,102
But she always leaves
me way too much.

298
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:16,103
Hold up.

299
00:20:16,137 --> 00:20:16,778
Huh?

300
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:21,375
Wait right here a second. I'll go and get
you some. Take half of it home with you.

301
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:23,311
Huh? Uh, sure.

302
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:28,549
Just as I thought.

303
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:32,153
I feel bad she
does this for me.

304
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,187
[gasp]

305
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,229
Ichigo!

306
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:43,164
Hnh? What's the
matter Chad?

307
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:45,466
It's Orihime's
Spiritual Pressure!

308
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,602
Something's wrong!
She's in danger!

309
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:48,669
[gasp]

310
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,572
[Shukuro]
Okay, Shishigawara.

311
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:54,575
Time to take
responsibility here.

312
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:57,445
Yahh!

313
00:20:57,712 --> 00:20:59,313
What just happened?!

314
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:03,284
His bookmark, it suddenly
turned into a sword!

315
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,824
Is that a Zanpakuto?

316
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:11,626
hmm?

317
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:17,465
Oh this? No, it's
not a Zanpakuto.

318
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:22,203
This is my Fullbring, it's
called "Book of the End."

319
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:27,842
Relax. I have no intention of
doing anything to you yet.

320
00:21:28,676 --> 00:21:33,781
I'll be heading home for today, right
after I punish this disobedient boy.

321
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:35,149
Gahh!

322
00:21:45,126 --> 00:21:49,530
I see. It's true. You're as
kind-hearted as I heard you were.

323
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:53,467
You can't even bear to see
an enemy get hurt, can you?

324
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:56,270
That's not what I'm doing.

325
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:59,106
If you're really the
one who attacked Uryu,

326
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,842
Then I'm not going
to let you get away!

327
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,282
Interesting.

328
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:49,607
[Chad] Ichigo! There's something
else about Orihime that worries me!

329
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:52,477
[Ichigo] Wait, really?! There's more?!
What the hell else is there?!

330
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:54,646
[Chad] With all that unsold
bread left over everyday,

331
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:57,449
how will Orihime's workplace
survive financially?!

332
00:23:57,482 --> 00:24:00,985
[Ichigo] What?! This isn't the time
to-- Wait, now that you mention it...
