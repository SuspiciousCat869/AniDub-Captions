NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

3
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:53,209
who was kidnapped by Sosuke
Aizen, Ichigo and his friends

4
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:56,209
snuck into Hueco Mundo,
the realm of the Hollows,

5
00:01:56,243 --> 00:01:59,376
and infiltrated Aizen's
fortress, Las Noches.

6
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,276
Upon entering the fortress,
they are engaged in battle

7
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:05,976
by some of Aizen's most
powerful Arrancars.

8
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,909
Chad defeats Gantenbainne, but
Nnoitora, one of the Espada,

9
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:10,909
appears.

10
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:14,509
Chad is powerless against him.

11
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:17,076
[groan]

12
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:17,943
-Heh.

13
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:18,743
I knew it.

14
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:22,976
You're as weak as a newborn.

15
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,076
[gasping]

16
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:28,276
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Chad
couldn't have been defeated.

17
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:30,209
We made a vow.

18
00:02:30,243 --> 00:02:31,676
I can't accept this.

19
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,509
We vowed we'd all come back.

20
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:39,409
ULQUIORRA (VOICEOVER): That
fool, Nnoitora, got impatient.

21
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:42,143
He had been under standing
orders to remain in his place.

22
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:47,376
-I could sense the fight.

23
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,576
Chad isn't dead.

24
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:51,843
That's for sure.

25
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:54,076
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
Rukia has found herself

26
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:55,809
in a fierce battle
with Aaroniero,

27
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,276
a powerful Arrancar
who was adopted

28
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:01,276
the form of the deceased
lieutenant of Squad 13, Kaien

29
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:02,609
Shiba.

NARRATOR: Elsewhere,
Renji is finding himself

36
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:45,376
in a tight situation when he
is confronted by Espada number

37
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:48,476
eight, Szayelaporro.

38
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:53,076
-You two are fascinating
on many different levels.

39
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:55,276
I was planning to welcome
you with open arms

40
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:58,076
in hopes we could establish
a dialogue together,

41
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,043
if you're willing to take
a chance and trust me.

42
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:03,776
I think we'll both benefit.

43
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:06,309
Now wouldn't that be much
better than fighting?

44
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:08,409
[laughing]

45
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:10,009
RENJI: Don't be ridiculous.

46
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:11,509
-Hmm?

47
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,243
-You must have me
mistaken for someone else.

48
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,676
I didn't come here so we could
paint each other's toenails

49
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,609
like it was some kind
of slumber party.

50
00:04:18,643 --> 00:04:21,209
I came here to kick your ass.

51
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:23,409
I don't care about
your statistics,

52
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:25,109
and I don't care
about the invitation

53
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:27,343
to your little peace conference.

54
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:29,276
If you want to talk
to me, then you

55
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:32,943
can do it while I'm
cutting you to pieces.

56
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:34,843
But you'd better do
it quick because it

57
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:38,043
won't be long
before you're gone.

58
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:38,543

[chuckling]

64
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:27,409
-What's going on?

65
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:28,509
-See?

66
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:30,343
This is what happens
when you don't bother

67
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:34,243
to listen to everything
I have to say.

68
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:35,743
There's something
you should know.

69
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:37,876
You can't use your Bankai here.

70
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,776
[gasp]

71
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:44,109
-I can't use my Bankai?

72
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,843
Yeah, right.

73
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:49,576
[chuckling]

74
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:50,609
-Correct.

75
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:51,843
You're quite right.

76
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:55,143
And how very nice that
you confirmed it verbally.

77
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:58,276
Not bad for an idiot like you.

78
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:01,343
I have complete information
about your Bankai,

79
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:04,909
its structure, abilities,
and spiritual pressure,

80
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:07,576
how it explosively
increases its attack power,

81
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:11,776
not to mention its
Reishi composition.

82
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,976
It was simple, really.

83
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,943
I used the
information I gathered

84
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:20,409
in preparing this chamber so
that your Bankai wouldn't work.

85
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:22,409
-Tell me, how did you
get complete information

86
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:23,843
on my Bankai?

87
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,543
Only an opponent who
fought against it

88
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,876
firsthand would know
so much about it.

89
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:28,743
How's this possible?

90
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,709
-Because my brother told me.

91
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:36,143
-Who's he?

92
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:37,609
SZAYELAPORRO: Remember my name?

93
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:41,843
You probably don't. (LAUGHING)
You must pay more attention.

94
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:43,109
That's OK.

95
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:45,676
I'll just have to
repeat it then.

96
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:46,576
Pay attention.

97
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:48,843
My name is Szayelaporro Granz.

98
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:52,743
I expect you've heard of
Yylfordt Granz, correct?

99
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:57,076
You know, my older brother.

100
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:59,909
[gasp]

101
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:02,109
-Him!

102
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,476
-Oh?

103
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:06,443
So you remember that
dirty piece of scum.

104
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:09,876
I suppose I should
be grateful for that.

105
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,709
-From the way you're talking,
it seems pretty obvious

106
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:14,643
that you're not here
to avenge your brother.

107
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:17,976
--[laughing] Only a fool like
yourself would think that.

108
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:20,876
Do you think that's why
I chose to go after you?

109
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:24,176
I learned about your Bankai
from Rokureichu, the recording

110
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,609
spirit bugs.

111
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,976
I placed them all over
his body and collected

112
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,543
the pertinent data during
the autopsy [laugh].

113
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,009
I considered him nothing
more than a box built

114
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:36,009
to carry my reichu.

115
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:39,909
I'm not childish enough to get
mad at you for breaking my box.

116
00:07:39,943 --> 00:07:42,976
I forgive you.

117
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:46,709
-You're really
sick, you know that?

118
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:50,443
-What a totally unoriginal
way for you to describe me.

119
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:52,676
How petty of you.

120
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,776
I'm stunned.

121
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,243
Well, whatever.

122
00:07:56,276 --> 00:08:01,343
You no longer have a
way to win or to escape.

123
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:03,243
This should be interesting.

124
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,143
This is the first
time I've seen someone

125
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:10,709
who can use a Bankai in person.

126
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:13,476
To be honest, I'm rather
excited by it all.

127
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,543
There's no need to
bother struggling.

128
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:18,509
You'll just delay
the inevitable.

129
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,576
I don't want your corpses
to be mangled when you die.

130
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:36,509
-San no mai, Shira-- Shirafune.

131
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:41,309
-Impossible.

132
00:08:41,343 --> 00:08:45,243
[groaning]

133
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:47,709
[groan]

134
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,509
-Aaroniero, huh?

135
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,309
Master Halibel,
what should we do?

136
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:14,009
-That kid, having to be killed
in such a pathetic matter.

137
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:22,143
[grunt]

138
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,098

[coughing]

142
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:37,276
-[laughing] You woke up.

143
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:43,676
Starrk.

144
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,017
Morning.

145
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,121
-Good morning, Lilynette.

146
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:55,131
Gimme a break, OK?

147
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:57,398
-Ugh, don't go back to sleep!

148
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,198
[grunt]

149
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,331
Come on, come on!

150
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,665
No more sleeping.

151
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:03,598
-Oh, stop it, will
you, Lilynette?

152
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:05,598
You never know when you
might-- you're an idiot!

153
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:06,765
LILYNETTE: Nap time is over!

154
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:08,198
Wake it and shake
it, sleepyhead!

155
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:09,665
I'll stop when you
get out of bed.

156
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:10,131
STARRK: Get off me!

157
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:11,198
Stop it!

158
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:12,198
LILYNETTE: If you
don't get out of bed,

159
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:13,065
I guess I'm never
gonna stop, am I?

160
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:18,031
[sigh]

161
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,498
It's Aaroniero.

162
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:24,498
He was killed.

163
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:25,665
-(SIGHING) I already knew.

164
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:32,398
-You don't care?

165
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:32,898
-Hmm.

166
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:45,031
(WEARILY) What do you
want me to do about it?

167
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:46,998
-Roar, Zabimaru!

168
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:52,431
I'm not finished yet!

169
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:56,998
Run into a little problem?

170
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,165
I guess that information
you had wasn't as complete

171
00:10:59,198 --> 00:10:59,898
as you thought.

172
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,131
It looks like even though
you know how I fight,

173
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,031
it isn't helping you keep
up with my actual movements.

174
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:10,498
-Damn you.

175
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:14,931
-[shout] Take that!

176
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,398
You're just a bunch of hot air.

177
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:18,631
[frightened shouting]

178
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:21,598
[shouting]

179
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,531
-A final blow!

180
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:25,965
[startled shout]

181
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:28,231
-Joke's on you.

182
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:29,698
[gasp]

183
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:35,498
[gasping]

184
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:38,398
[laugh]

185
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,398
[gasp]

186
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:41,331
[shout]

187
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:47,165
-[grunt] You bastard.

188
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:49,665
-You don't compare to
the picture I had of you.

189
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:51,365
You're incredibly slow.

190
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:52,698
-Damn you.

191
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:55,365
SZAYELAPORRO: Haven't you
put two and two together yet?

192
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:57,398
I was simply toying
with you, seeing

193
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:00,798
how long you would be
fooled by my little charade.

194
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:02,831
-You go to hell.

195
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:05,765
Huh?

196
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:08,231
[gasp] It can't be.

197
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:24,498
SZAYELAPORRO: Oh, you
seem to have noticed.

198
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:25,765
-You were still.

199
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:28,731
You deflected all of my
attacks, and you barely moved.

200
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:30,798
-I was conducting an
amusing little test

201
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:33,298
to see exactly how
good your attack are.

202
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:36,198
They were below my expectations.

203
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:38,765
Is this the best you can do
without your Bankai, Soul

204
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:39,598
Reaper?

205
00:12:39,631 --> 00:12:42,531
-(SHOUTING) I'll kick your ass!

206
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:45,365
Now roar, Zabimaru!

207
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,065
-At this point, I
do not even need

208
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:50,631
to study your attacks anymore.

209
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:52,631
[chuckling]

210
00:12:52,665 --> 00:12:54,598
[gasp]

211
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:57,531
[grunt]

212
00:12:57,565 --> 00:13:00,031
I can sense your attacks
before you even start them.

213
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:01,931
[grumbling]

214
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:03,865
[shout]

215
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:11,598
[groaning]

216
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:13,465
Don't you see that
those pathetic moves

217
00:13:13,498 --> 00:13:17,165
can't penetrate my defense?

218
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:19,698
-Damn Arrancar.

219
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:22,031
VERONA: Master Szayelaporro.

220
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:24,765
-Master Szayelaporro.

221
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:26,331
-Master Szayelaporro.

222
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:28,565
-Master Szayelaporro.

223
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:30,465
-Hmm?

224
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:33,598
So tell me, Lumina and
Verona, why are you here?

225
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:35,165
-Aaroniero died.

226
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:36,131
Now he's dead.

227
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:36,631
-Died.

228
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:37,131
He's dead.

229
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:38,931
Dead!

230
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,731
-Hmm.

231
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:42,998
Ah, it's really true.

232
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,665
I've received a full
report about it.

233
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:49,131
I was having so much fun
that I didn't even notice it.

234
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:51,298
[laughing]

235
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:58,831
The message says they killed
each other, Soul Reaper.

236
00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:01,131
-What are you talking about?

237
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,598
-Do try to keep up.

238
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:04,331
I'm saying one of
your friends managed

239
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:08,331
to kill an Espada
before they died.

240
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:10,098
How exciting.

241
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:13,331
That is truly remarkable.

242
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:16,098
-You don't know if that's true.

243
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:18,198
-What, you're not convinced?

244
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:21,165
I wouldn't be so
optimistic if I were you.

245
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:23,631
In fact, I've just received
the name of your dead friend.

246
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:30,598
-Rukia Kuchiki is one of your
friend's names, isn't it?

247
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:32,065
[shout]

248
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:37,098
I knew you'd react that way.

249
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:40,365
I must say, you
really are amusing.

250
00:14:40,398 --> 00:14:43,998
But I've told you
several times now,

251
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:46,798
you can't damage an Espada
with just your Shikai.

252
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:48,365
Try to get that
through your head.

253
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:49,798
[gasp]

254
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:02,165
RENJI: Shut your damn mouth!

255
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:05,265
You make me sick.

256
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:06,331
Outta the way!

257
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:11,298
[laugh]

258
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:18,665
[grunt]

259
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:23,798
-Ooh, is there
something wrong, Ichigo?

260
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:24,298
Rukia.

261
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:30,831
-So you've noticed.

262
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:31,798
[gasp]

263
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,231
ULQUIORRA: I thought
that you were

264
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,465
a kid who possessed
only brute strength.

265
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:47,331
Quite frankly, I'm amazed that
you have some decent abilities.

266
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:50,565
-I know you.

267
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:53,531
-It's been quite a while,
right, Soul Reaper?

268
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:00,865
[gasp]

269
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:17,435
URYU (VOICEOVER): I sense
several spiritual pressures

270
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:19,302
nearby.

271
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:21,069
Someone is fighting.

272
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:24,069
And that spiritual
pressure earlier was Rukia.

273
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:25,869
[grunt]

274
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,169
-What's wrong, Ichigo?

275
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:31,269
Are you sensing something bad
happening to your friends?

276
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:33,369
-My name is Uryu Ishida.

277
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:35,802
Try to get it right, Pesche.

278
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:36,669
-You got it, Ichigo.

279
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:37,569
-Hmph.

280
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:39,002
-So, uh, which way are we going?

281
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:40,535
-You're doing it
on purpose, right?

282
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:43,869
--[laughing] It's easy to
play the straight man when

283
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,435
you've got a terrific
comic to work with, right?

284
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:49,402
This is just one
of my many talents.

285
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:50,669
The show must go on.

286
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:51,802
-You're wasting time.

287
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:52,369
Let's go.

288
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:53,069
-Oh, wait, wait.

289
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:53,769
Wait, wait, wait.

290
00:16:53,802 --> 00:16:55,235
Hey, hey, Uryu.

291
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:56,369
Oops, I got your name right.

292
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:10,102
[quavering]

293
00:17:21,469 --> 00:17:22,735
-I know you.

294
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:34,435
Ulquiorra.

295
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:42,569
-How interesting that
you know my name.

296
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:45,269
I don't think I ever
told you my name, though.

297
00:17:56,602 --> 00:18:01,069
At any rate, Rukia
Kuchiki is dead.

298
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:06,969
-What?

299
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:11,702
-More accurately, she and Espada
number nine killed each other.

300
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:14,402
Her entire body was
covered in wounds,

301
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:16,535
and she was run
through by a trident.

302
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:18,269
She couldn't have survived.

303
00:18:18,302 --> 00:18:20,635
-I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

304
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:23,035
Just a moment ago, I felt
Rukia's spiritual pressure

305
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,402
decrease.

306
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:25,769
You weren't fighting her.

307
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:27,269
There's no way that
you would know--

308
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:28,935
-Synchronized awareness.

309
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:31,669
That was one of Noveno, Espada
number nine's, talent's.

310
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:37,135
He had many responsibilities,
and that was one of his roles.

311
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:40,535
In the exact instant that
he first engages in battle,

312
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:44,269
he can convey information about
his enemies to his comrades.

313
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:48,735
[shouting and crying]

314
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:50,702
-Let me out!

315
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:52,669
Let me out of here!

316
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:54,135
Please let me out!

317
00:18:57,602 --> 00:19:00,069
Let me out.

318
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:01,035
Oh please.

319
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:07,935
[groaning]

320
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:16,469
-I'm coming to save you.

321
00:19:22,835 --> 00:19:23,769
[crying]

322
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:25,535
-I must get out.

323
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:27,369
I can't take this.

324
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:35,002
[crying]

325
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:35,502
Rukia.

326
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:42,202
-Where are you going?

327
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,602
-I'm going to save Rukia.

328
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,069
-I told you, she's dead.

329
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:54,469
-I don't believe you.

330
00:19:54,502 --> 00:19:56,402
-You're very stubborn.

331
00:19:56,435 --> 00:20:00,402
Is it a good idea to
leave without killing me?

332
00:20:00,435 --> 00:20:03,102
-I have no reason to kill you.

333
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,169
-And what do you mean by that?

334
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:08,002
-You may be my
enemy, but the fact

335
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:11,135
is, you haven't hurt a
single one of my friends yet.

336
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,735
ULQUIORRA: I see.

337
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,569
What if I tell you
that I was the one who

338
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:26,069
forced Orihime Inoue
to come to Hueco Mundo?

339
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:29,035
-Wah!

340
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,435
-You kidnapped her
and brought her here!

341
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:33,135
I suspected that she
didn't come to Hueco

342
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:35,235
Mundo of her own free will.

343
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:36,969
-How unexpected.

344
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,735
You had some doubts about
the girl, didn't you?

345
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:43,035
Despite that, you and your
friends came to save her.

346
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:43,969
-Damn you.

347
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:46,169
Do you understand what you did?

348
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:50,402
Because of your actions, Orihime
is being called a traitor!

349
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:52,102
-Traitor, yes.

350
00:20:52,135 --> 00:20:53,702
If she were not
being called that,

351
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:58,002
it would mean that we
grossly miscalculated.

352
00:20:58,035 --> 00:21:00,402
-You bastard.

353
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:03,635
-Is that enough reason to
fight me now, Soul Reaper?

354
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:09,535
[nervous whine]

355
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:21,535
-Uh, Ichigo?

356
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:25,169
ICHIGO: Nel, make
sure you stay back.

357
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,635
-But Ichigo--

358
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:30,602
-He doesn't want
to let me get by.

359
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:33,435
But unfortunately, things
won't turn out the way

360
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:34,102
that he'd like.

361
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:42,035
I must move quickly.

362
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:49,002
I'm going at this guy
with everything I've got!

363
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:52,469
Bankai!

364
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:20,021
[theme music]

365
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:46,602
ULQUIORRA: Soul Reaper, you seem
to have recovered quite a bit

366
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:47,435
from your fatigue.

367
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,402
NEL: Of course!

368
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:49,669
I covered him with
my saliva, which

369
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:51,469
has excellent
healing properties.

370
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:54,269
He can go forever before
he needs his next nap.

371
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:55,969
Ichigo can't live
without me anymore.

372
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:59,502
ICHIGO: You make me
sound like a sicko!
