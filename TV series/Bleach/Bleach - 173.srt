NARRATOR: As the only surviving
heir of the noble Kasumioji

4
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:55,497
clan, Princess Rurichiyo had
become a target for trouble

5
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,897
in her homeland.

6
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,930
For her own protection,
her guardians

7
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:02,130
took the unsuspecting princess
to the world of the living,

8
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:05,930
where Ichigo reluctantly
agreed to become her bodyguard.

9
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:09,297
Rurichiyo quickly turned
Ichigo's world upside down

10
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,097
with her spoiled behavior.

11
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,764
Kenryu and Enryu continued
to keep the truth away

12
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:16,930
from Rurichiyo for
her own peace of mind.

13
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:20,030
But one day, after an argument,
she ran away from them

14
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:22,830
and was attacked by an
assassin on the streets.

15
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:25,997
Orihime happened to be nearby
and tried to fight him off

16
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,630
but found herself in peril
because of the assassin's

17
00:02:28,664 --> 00:02:30,330
bizarre Zanpakuto.

18
00:02:30,364 --> 00:02:33,464
Fortunately, Ichigo arrived
and defeated the assassin

19
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:34,897
before he could harm anyone.

Because Lady Rurichiyo
has disappeared again!

It's Her Highness!

Oh my.

Oh, Princess.

VASSAL: Oh, are you all right?

45
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,079
-I'm relieved to see
you safe, Your Highness.

46
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:07,879
-Are you hurt?

47
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:09,612
Are you hurt, Your Highness?

00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:10,612
GYOKAKU KUKOI: Princess.

49
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:11,846
-Ah?

50
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,979
-You ran off without telling
me where you were going.

51
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:16,346
Where have you
been all this time?

52
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:18,479
-I did not need your permission.

53
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:21,912
I was properly accompanied
by Kenryu and Enryu.

54
00:04:21,946 --> 00:04:23,679
GYOKAKU KUKOI:
Nevertheless, Princess,

55
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:25,412
if something were
to happen to you,

56
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:28,112
you would not be
the only one shamed.

57
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:30,479
It would also shame
your late parents.

58
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:32,279
Your behavior has consequences.

59
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,312
Think about the disgrace
you could easily

60
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:36,412
bring down on the
Kasumioji clan.

61
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:38,812
-[indignant gasp] I'm aware.

62
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,712
I need no reminding.

63
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,812
-If you truly understand
that, then you

64
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:46,612
must behave as a princess of the
Kasumioji family would behave.

65
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:47,912
It's expected of you.

00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:54,512
[pbbbt]

67
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:56,779
-Huh?

68
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:57,479
Go.

00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:58,379
Prepare my sedan chair.

70
00:04:58,412 --> 00:05:00,679
There is someone I must visit.

71
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:01,479
-I see.

72
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:04,012
Just where might you be going?

73
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:05,312
-To a party!

74
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:25,079
-You're ready to work, Hanza?

75
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,879
-Yes, Lord Kumoi.

76
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,912
-For some unknown
reason, she has

77
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:34,212
returned from the
world of the living.

78
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,346
Kenryu and Enryu
aren't with her.

79
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,679
This is a perfect opportunity.

80
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:39,179
-Understood.

81
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,012
-Not again.

82
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,179
-Be ready this time.

83
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:55,579
-What the hell?

84
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:58,512
Nice welcome.

85
00:05:58,546 --> 00:05:59,412
-Stop this at once!

00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,246
Stand down!

00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,146
GUARDS: Yes, sir.

88
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:05,412
-Must I instruct
you on protocol?

89
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:07,346
Only the princess
and her guardians

90
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:08,812
are permitted to
use this entrance.

91
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,246
-Yes, we know, Sir Kenryu.

92
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,646
But the gate flew open
earlier this afternoon,

93
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,112
and yet no one came through it.

94
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,179
-Apparently she made
it back after all.

95
00:06:24,912 --> 00:06:26,046
-Sorry, everyone.

96
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,312
We can't go to the Soul
Society through that gate.

97
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,679
I was told that
it was forbidden.

98
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:32,579
-On top of which,
there's always a chance

99
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:35,746
that Miss Kasumioji will
return before you do.

100
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:38,912
We'll maintain a tight watch on
this side in case that happens.

101
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:39,946
-Thank you.

102
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,712
We'll be counting on
you to stay alert.

103
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:42,779
-Time to get moving.

104
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:49,812
Better hurry.

105
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:51,646
These gatekeepers don't
seem to be all that bright.

106
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,879
I'm sure she slipped right by
them and entered the palace.

107
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:54,379
-Right.

108
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,346
You guys hide her in
the world of living

109
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,646
and then the very
first chance she gets,

110
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,579
the princess undermines
all your hard work

111
00:07:04,612 --> 00:07:06,212
by going right back home.

112
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:07,979
I guess that's what
happens when you become

113
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:11,246
glorified nannies to
some spoiled brat.

114
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,379
Yaah!

115
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:13,012
What?

116
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,146
Why'd you do that?

117
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:16,679
Say something!

118
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:19,346
-He's saying that someone of a
lower class, such as yourself,

119
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:21,212
should not be
criticizing the princess.

120
00:07:21,246 --> 00:07:24,212
Am I right?

121
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:27,546
-That doesn't change the fact
that she's a spoiled brat.

122
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:29,446
I just hope this guy
Kumoi who's trying

123
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:32,979
to harm her doesn't
find her before we do.

124
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:34,446
Hm!

125
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,012
I'm staying away from you.

126
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:36,812
[whap]

127
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:37,546
-Oof!

128
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:38,546
What's wrong with you two?

129
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:39,679
Are you nuts?

130
00:07:39,712 --> 00:07:41,746
-You deserved that for
saying the enemy's name

131
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:44,279
in the open where
anyone could hear it.

132
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:46,279
-Come on, her life's
in danger, and yet she

133
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:48,779
runs home like it's
perfectly safe.

134
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,212
-Yes, but Lady
Rurichiyo's still young.

135
00:07:51,246 --> 00:07:53,546
She may not understand
the situation.

136
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:56,046
That'll make our job harder.

137
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,712
[annoyed sigh]

138
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:59,679
RUKIA KUCHIKI: We'd better
split up and search.

139
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,546
KENRYU: We'll start by
checking in this area.

140
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,779
-Damn it.

141
00:08:08,812 --> 00:08:10,112
This palace is big.

142
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:12,546
She could be hiding
anywhere in this place.

143
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:13,879
That brat's a lot of trouble.

144
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:19,979
MALE SPEAKER: Hey.

145
00:08:20,012 --> 00:08:22,046
What's the big hurry?

146
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,379
-Long time no see. [giggles]

147
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:30,879
RUKIA KUCHIKI: Captain Zaraki
and Lieutenant Kusajishi.

148
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:31,879
-Quite a surprise.

149
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,546
What are you doing here?

150
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,246
-Yeah, that's right.

151
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,079
Why aren't you in the
world of the living?

152
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:42,779
-Uh, well, um--

153
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:46,346
-Is Ichigo here as well?

154
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:48,279
-Uh-- um--

[inhales deeply]

156
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:54,979
-Hm.

[tinkling]

158
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:05,179
-He is here.

159
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:05,746
-Yep.

160
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,546
I sense him too.

161
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:09,946
-And he's pretty worked
up about something.

162
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:10,846
-You're right.

163
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,312
He must be on a mission.

164
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:13,879
-No, actually.

165
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:16,179
That is-- well, uh--

166
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:19,612
-He comes all the way out here
and doesn't even say hi to me?

167
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,079
Now that's just rude.

168
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:22,146
-Uh--

169
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:23,646
-I'm gonna go find
him and see what's up.

170
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,812
-Uh, uh-- but wait, Captain
Zaraki-- (VOICEOVER)

171
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,279
Oh, this isn't good.

172
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:30,779
This whole situation
with Lady Rurichiyo

173
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:32,279
was supposed to be kept secret.

174
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:35,479
Things could get out of hand
if Captain Zaraki finds Ichigo.

175
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,612
-It doesn't look like
the princess is anywhere

176
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,279
in the palace.

177
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:44,112
What?

178
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:45,646
Did you see something, Enryu?

179
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,146
Huh?

180
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,846
Wait a minute!

181
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,579
This veil belongs
to the princess!

KENRYU: Did that door
just close by itself?

185
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,412
Enryu, where are you?

186
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,446
It's so dark here.

187
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,379
I can't see a thing.

Ow!

189
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:18,246
-Now that I have the
both of you locked away,

190
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,646
I can dispose of the princess.

191
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,746
-Princess, we've arrived
at the residence.

192
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:31,246
-Hm.

193
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:38,246
-Princess Rurichiyo is
here and awaits her host.

194
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,879
-I am honored and
truly grateful to have

195
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:57,346
been invited to
your party today.

my heart for gracing us

with your presence.

198

-You may keep the sedan
chair here for me.

199
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,012
-Yes, my lady.

200
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,712
-There she is.

201
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:13,579
Why, that little--

202
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:19,112
-You are dismissed.

203
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,679
We will call when we are ready.

-Everyone's here.

00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,612
They've all been
waiting for you.

214
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:46,112
It seems like we haven't
seen you for ages.

00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:46,746
-That's true.

Oh, Rurichi, so good to see you!

-Oh, it is.

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,146
It's fabulous.

00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,112
-How've you been?

224
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:04,279
-I'm well.

225
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:05,412
What about you?

Is everyone doing OK?

227
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:08,779
-Hey, Rurichi?

-You remembered!

That makes me so happy.

233
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:30,712
-How could I forget
something so important?

234
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:33,612
It's a sign of our lifelong
friendship, Sayori.

KENRYU: Almost there.

237
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:53,788
Can you get me up
any higher, Enryu?

238
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:55,988
I can just about
reach the latch.

239
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:57,854
A couple more inches
ought to do it.

240
00:12:57,888 --> 00:13:01,488
We can't let Kumoi
get away with this.

241
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:02,454
I did it!

doing in there.

-Wait a minute, guys.

00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:24,854
I saw Rurichiyo go inside.

251
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,888
I need to speak to her.

252
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:30,654
I'm a Substitute Soul
Reaper, Ichigo Kurosaki.

-Substitute Soul Reaper?

-How dare you speak
the Princess's name

255
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:36,388
in such an informal manner?

256

I'm not a threat to anyone.

Kenryu asked me to come here
as his personal representative.

-You dare speak Sir
Kenryu's name as well?

what are you doing here?

you the same thing.

You should not have
followed me here.

He's threatening a little girl
at the point of his sword!

-I've been looking for you.

I figured you were
here somewhere.

-I told Kenny we'd find you!

384

-Captain, we need to-- huh?

390
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,963
Ichigo, what are you doing?

[grunts]

392
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:22,463
Now, Lady Rurichiyo,
please-- get in.

393
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:33,963
-I ask of you, please don't
be angry with Rurichi.

394
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:35,963
-Mmph.

395
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:39,896
-You see, she came to my
party because very soon, I'm

396
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,930
going to be married.

397
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:41,630
-Congratulations.

398
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:42,363
That's great.

399
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:43,863
-It is awful!

400
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:45,330
This is an arranged marriage.

401
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:47,130
She is being forced
to marry someone

402
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:49,863
she's never met and doesn't
even know if she likes!

403
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:50,796
It's horrible!

404
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,363
The whole thing was
set up and agreed

405
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:57,563
to by the heads of both
noble families right

406
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,830
after Sacchi was born.

407
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,796
-Don't be upset about it.

408
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,663
It's the way life is sometimes.

409
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:08,030
I accept it as my fate.

410
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,963
This was going to be
my very last tea party.

411
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:13,030
Rurichi knew that when
I sent the invitation,

412
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:16,730
so she did everything she
possibly could to attend.

413
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:18,363
Because the way
things work out, we

414
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:22,030
may never be able to
see each other again.

-You're marrying into an
extremely strict family,

416
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:25,463
aren't you?

417
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:25,963
-Mm-hm.

418
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:30,996
Oh, how strange.

419
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,230
Why am I crying?

420
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:33,196
I've accepted it.

421
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,030
It's not like I'm sad. [crying]

-Sacchi!

423

-It's tough being a noble.

424
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:46,430
They don't have much freedom.

425
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,730
-Without a doubt.

426
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,496
Their lives are quite
different than yours

427

in the world of the living.

428
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,963
Captains Zaraki,
I didn't tell you,

429
00:20:57,996 --> 00:21:00,263
but we're working on
a top secret mission.

430
00:21:00,296 --> 00:21:02,730
Because of that, I'm
asking that you please not

431
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,463
mention today's
events to anyone else.

432
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:07,096
-I don't know why
all that happened.

433
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,230
And in the second
place, I don't have time

434
00:21:09,263 --> 00:21:11,963
to think about stuff I didn't
understand in the first place.

437
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:17,563
-Uh.

00:21:17,596 --> 00:21:20,996
Thank you for your discussion.

439
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,630
-Today was
interesting, at least.

440
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:26,430
Bring Ichigo back sometime so
I can smack him around a bit.

He didn't even

tremble when he felt
my spiritual pressure.

452

are too much of a bother,
