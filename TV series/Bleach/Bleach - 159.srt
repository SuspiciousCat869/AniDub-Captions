NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

6
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:53,655
who was kidnapped by Sosuke
Aizen, Ichigo and his friends

7
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:56,488
snuck into Wakomundo,
the realm of the Hollows,

8
00:01:56,522 --> 00:02:00,222
and infiltrated Isane's
fortress, Las Noches.

9
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:03,288
Upon entering the fortress,
they are engaged in battle

10
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:05,455
by some of Isane's most
powerful Arrancars.

11
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:10,688
In the midst of his desperate
fight against the Privaron

12
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,955
Espada, Gantenbainne Mosqueda.

13
00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:14,922
Chad was pushed to
the edge of defeat,

14
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:16,588
and suddenly found
he had awakened

15
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:19,255
a new power that had
been dormant within him.

16
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:22,088
-This is Diablo.

17
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:27,688
Brazo Izquierda del Diablo.

18
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:29,522
La muerte.

19
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:30,455
-Ew ah.

20
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:38,922
NARRATOR: Chad defeated Johnson
fine but before he can savour his

21
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:41,955
victory a new enemy
appeared before him.

22
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:46,255
-Uh.

23
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:52,822
-Well, well.

24
00:02:52,855 --> 00:02:55,455
At the head of
the pack, are you?

25
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:56,888
-Uh, mm.

26
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:01,755
His movements are slow.

27
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:05,155
He's skilled, I can tell
that by looking at him.

28
00:03:10,522 --> 00:03:13,622
I should win with one blow.

29
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:14,588
Hee ut.

30
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:27,755
-Ah

31
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:30,022
-So that's the best you can do?

32
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:42,355
-Ew, ah!

33
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,955
I'm not done.

34
00:03:51,988 --> 00:03:52,888
-Hm-hm hm-hm.

35
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:03,588
-Uh, uh, heh, heh, heh.

36
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:04,555
-Eh heh-heh.

37
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:10,422
-Aw.

38
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:11,288
-Heh.

39
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:12,055
I knew it.

40
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:13,755
You're as weak as a newborn.

41
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:17,922
-Uh.

42
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:18,888
-Ah.

43
00:04:18,922 --> 00:04:21,355
-Uh.

44
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:22,055
-Chad?

45
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:24,755
-Those bastards got him.

46
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:25,255
-Huh.

47
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:32,588
-Hey, what's wrong, Ichigo?

48
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:35,055
Well, you just-- wha!

49
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,988
What are you doing, Ichigo?

50
00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:38,488
You're going way too fast.

51
00:04:38,522 --> 00:04:40,222
Watch out for the wall!

52
00:04:40,255 --> 00:04:42,088
-Chad couldn't
have been defeated.

53
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:43,955
We made a vow.

54
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:46,455
-As we approached the
crucial battlegrounds,

55
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:49,488
swear that though the land
itself may break asunder,

56
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,355
we will--

57
00:04:50,388 --> 00:04:51,222
-I can't accept this.

58
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:52,555
---come back here--

59
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:53,822
-We vowed we'd all come back.

60
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:54,622
---alive.

61
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,755
-And we'd all return alive.

62
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:58,322
We have to trust.

63
00:04:58,355 --> 00:05:00,555
That's exactly what we'll do.

64
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:01,055
-Hm.

65
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,288
-All I can do now
is believe in Chad.

66
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:16,855
-Uh.

67
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:21,122
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
I'm coming in.

68
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:31,222
Yes, obviously you are
aware of what happened.

69
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:34,122
That fool, Nnoitora
got impatient.

70
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:38,122
He had been under standing
orders to remain in his place.

71
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:39,222
-I could sense the fight.

72
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,622
Chad isn't dead.

73
00:05:44,455 --> 00:05:45,255
That's for sure.

74
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:52,555
-Go ahead, coming in.

75
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:09,588
-Your meal is ready.

76
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:11,722
Now eat it.

77
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:13,688
-No, I refuse.

78
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:16,788
-I understand your defiance,
but until Lord Aizen tells me

79
00:06:16,822 --> 00:06:20,288
otherwise, staying alive
is one of your duties.

80
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:21,255
So eat.

81
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:23,755
-Mm.

82
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:25,222
Mm.

83
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:26,822
-Would you prefer
to have me force

84
00:06:26,855 --> 00:06:28,588
the food down your throat?

85
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,355
Or would you rather
be strapped down,

86
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:32,055
and receive the
nutrients intravenously?

87
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:38,822
-All I know is that
Chad is not dead.

88
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:40,955
-You're annoying me.

89
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:43,855
It doesn't matter
one way or the other.

90
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:48,122
Do you expect me to respond
to your provocation?

91
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:50,588
Do you expect me
to reassure you,

92
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:53,922
to confirm to you whether
or not he's still alive?

93
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,688
It's a pathetic attempt.

94
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:57,788
I'm not here to comfort
you, either physically

95
00:06:57,822 --> 00:07:00,355
or psychologically.

96
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:00,855
-Uh.

97
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:07,455
-I don't even understand why
you care so much whether or not

98
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:08,655
he's alive.

99
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:09,855
-Uh.

100
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,655
-Before this battle is
over, all of your friends

101
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:13,655
will be dead anyway.

102
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:15,055
That's the truth.

103
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:16,755
What does it matter
if one is killed

104
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:18,822
if it's sooner than the others?

105
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,688
They should have
realized that this

106
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:22,455
was going to happen
from the start.

107
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:24,155
-Stop it right now.

108
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:25,955
-If they didn't realize
it, then they're

109
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:29,222
fools, and deserve to
die for their arrogance.

110
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:30,488
-Uh.

111
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:33,755
-Either way, you should
dismiss them from your mind.

112
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:36,588
It's not worth the
effort to remember them.

113
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,888
-Mm.

114
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:41,855
-If I were you, I'd be angry
that they were all foolish

115
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:44,655
enough to sneak into
Wacomundo in the first place--

116
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:45,488
-Uh.

117
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:47,922
---like lambs to a slaughter.

118
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:49,422
-Ee, he eh.

119
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:53,855
Uh, uh, uh.

120
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:09,022
-I will come back here
again in one hour.

121
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,588
If you haven't eaten any
of your nutrients by then,

122
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:16,122
I'll tie you down and force
the food down your throat.

123
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:17,088
Keep that in mind.

124
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:23,855
-Uh.

125
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:28,588
Huh, uh, mm.

126
00:08:28,622 --> 00:08:32,022
Mm, mm, mm.

127
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:36,955
Uh, uh, ah huh, ah huh, eh.

128
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,155
-Hm?

129
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:02,122
Mm.

130
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:04,622
TESLA (OFFSCREEN):
Master Nnoitra.

131
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:07,355
-Is that you, Tesla?

132
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:07,855
-Yes.

133
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:15,988
Aren't you going to
finish him off, sir?

134
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,222
You did beat him.

135
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:19,088
NNOITRA (OFFSCREEN):
What good would that do?

136
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:24,722
Who in the world is ever
going to acknowledge me

137
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:29,188
as the strongest if I
kill a thousand weaklings?

138
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:32,022
The lives of small
fries are worthless,

139
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:33,022
all that matters is--

140
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:33,955
TESLA (OFFSCREEN): Uh?

141
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:34,855
What is it?

142
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:37,188
Is something the matter?

143
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:38,388
-Nothing.

144
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:42,022
That idiot, Aaroniero,
released his resurrection.

145
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:44,688
Huh, I don't understand.

146
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:46,322
His opponent's
spiritual pressure

147
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:47,588
isn't even anything special.

148
00:09:51,788 --> 00:09:54,488
Let's go.

149
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:55,722
-Where to?

150
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:59,122
-I found a guy with
massive spiritual pressure.

151
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:00,522
I'm going to crush him.

152
00:10:00,555 --> 00:10:03,555
-Stop there.

153
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,522
Eh, ah.

154
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:06,855
Ah, uh.

155
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:08,622
We're not finished yet.

156
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:14,222
I won't let you go, not while I
have strength left in my body.

157
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:17,322
-Oh, you can still move, I see.

158
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,922
-Uh, heh.

159
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,388
Mm, mhm mm, ah!

160
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:32,555
-I will not allow a
weakling like yourself

161
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:36,322
to land a blow on
Master Nnoitra.

162
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:39,255
-Damn you.

163
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:39,755
Ew-ah.

164
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:49,488
-Now, shall we leave, my lord?

165
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:56,655
-Tesla, who told
you to interfere?

166
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,988
-I'm terribly sorry, my lord.

167
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:01,455
But I couldn't hesitate,
I saw the enemy

168
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:04,588
put all of his strength into a
final attempted to defeat you.

169
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,555
I was afraid of the possibility
of you being injured.

170
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:08,822
-You were wrong.

171
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:11,588
Nothing was going to happen.

172
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:15,022
No one in the
universe is my equal.

173
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:18,055
No one can break this body.

174
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:20,555
-Mm, ah uh, uh heh.

175
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:23,188
-Never forget that.

176
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:26,022
I am the most powerful
Espada ever created!

177
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:36,622
[panting]

178
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,755
-What is it?

179
00:11:37,788 --> 00:11:40,122
Why did you stop in the
middle of the corridor?

180
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:42,022
-Because there's a
fork in the road.

181
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:42,522
-Huh?

182
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:52,355
-Until we got to this point,
it was a straight path.

183
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,322
Now what do I do?

184
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:56,222
Which way should I go?

185
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:57,322
-Oh!

186
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:59,155
Come on, Renji,
what's the big deal?

187
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:01,388
Would you please stop
scaring me like that.

188
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:02,455
-Mm.

189
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,622
-Forget about it, in
the final analysis,

190
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,588
it doesn't matter
which path you take.

191
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:07,588
I'm scared enough
as it is, there's

192
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:09,388
no need for you
to make it worse.

193
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:09,888
-Uh!

194
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:11,088
-Ah!

195
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:12,855
-Dondochakka, what in
the hell's going on here?

196
00:12:12,888 --> 00:12:14,622
Ah!

197
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,088
Uh, ah.

198
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:22,155
-Huh?

199
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:22,722
Ha-ha.

200
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:25,755
Iy, iy, iy, iy.

201
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,588
-We're supposed to be
in order of seniority.

202
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:28,555
-That's right.

203
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:30,255
That's what we agreed on.

204
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:32,188
So don't go ahead of me, OK?

205
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:33,388
-All right, then.

206
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:35,622
Would you mind telling me
exactly how old you are?

207
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:36,288
-What?

208
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,522
Nu- no problem.

209
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:39,288
Just give me a second while
I do a little counting.

210
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:40,055
Now, let's see.

211
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:42,388
Add, uh, one, two, and four.

212
00:12:42,422 --> 00:12:44,522
-Chad's spiritual
pressure is weakening.

213
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,722
And Rukia's being overwhelmed.

214
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:50,188
Damn, I've gotta move faster.

215
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:50,955
-Uh, huh?

216
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:51,622
Stop that!

217
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:52,522
Respect your elders.

218
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:53,388
And that would be me.

219
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:55,222
I just proved it mathematically.

220
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:56,388
Wait, Ichigo?

221
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:57,955
Why are you running
away from me?

222
00:12:57,988 --> 00:12:59,788
Old age isn't
contagious, you know.

223
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,588
I'm just kidding about
that old age stuff,

224
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:03,555
but I wouldn't mind if
you slowed down a little,

225
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:05,088
you keep leaving me behind.

226
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:06,255
You're breaking up the team.

227
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:07,755
How can I do my
jokes if you don't

228
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,388
feed me the straight lines?

229
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,522
-Whoa, oh oh, ah.

230
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:15,522
How long can I possibly
keep falling like this?

231
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:18,888
Uh, uh, yuh.

232
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:22,322
Oh, ah.

233
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:25,588
[coughing]

234
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:26,722
-What was that about?

235
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:29,455
That was a really long fall.

236
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:33,722
Wait a minute, where am I?

237
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:35,688
Can't waste time here.

238
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:37,955
I've got things to do, and
I've got to get moving.

239
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:39,988
SZAYEL (OFFSCREEN):
Ah hah, ha-ha ha-ha.

240
00:13:40,022 --> 00:13:41,355
This is great.

241
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:42,688
-Ah?

242
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,722
SZAYEL (OFFSCREEN): I placed
a lot of sophisticated traps

243
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:47,488
within the walls of this
fortress, but I must tell you,

244
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:49,255
I'm stunned that
someone would literally

245
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,788
fall for the simplest
of the bunch.

246
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:53,222
Oh, excuse me.

247
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:57,688
I haven't Introduced
myself yet, have I?

248
00:13:57,722 --> 00:14:00,488
I'll only say this
once, and I hope someone

249
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:02,155
with such a low
degree of intelligence

250
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:03,755
as yourself can remember it.

251
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:10,055
-Uh.

252
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:13,822
-My designation in the
hierarchy is Espada number 8.

253
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:16,488
But for you, my
full name is simply

254
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,188
pronounced Szayel Aporro Granz.

255
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:35,811
My designation in the
hierarchy is Espada number 8.

256
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:39,244
But for you, my friend,
my name is simply

257
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,111
pronounced Szayel Aporro Granz.

258
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:43,911
-An Espada, huh?

259
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:45,611
I've heard of your kind.

260
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:47,578
You're supposed to be
the best of the best.

261
00:14:47,611 --> 00:14:49,011
You belong to an
elite group that

262
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,778
commands the other Arrancars.

263
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:51,878
[bellowing]

264
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:53,111
-Wait a minute, who's that?

265
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:56,211
Is that Dondochakka?

266
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:56,778
Mm.

267
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:58,178
I don't get it.

268
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:00,978
That fat lump fell just before I
did, what's taking him so long?

269
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:03,811
How did I arrive
here ahead of him?

270
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:04,511
Huh?

271
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:06,378
Is he coming this way?

272
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,744
Uh.

273
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:08,678
Whew.

274
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:10,944
That was a really close call.

275
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:14,178
I almost got crushed by someone
who's supposed to be my ally.

276
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:18,044
[bellowing]

277
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:19,511
-Ah!

278
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:23,511
Oh, it hurts, it really hurts.

279
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:26,078
I have a boo-boo on
my bottom, and it's

280
00:15:26,111 --> 00:15:27,511
going to leave a big mark.

281
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:29,478
-Will you shut up?

282
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,411
-That hole was really scary.

283
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:33,678
I thought I was going
to keep falling forever.

284
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:35,778
-OK, the hole was
scary, now would you

285
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,311
get off of me already?

286
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:41,178
[sobbing]

287
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:41,678
-Huh?

288
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:51,611
[sobbing]

289
00:15:51,644 --> 00:15:53,878
-Wait, I know you.

290
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,178
You're an Espada.

291
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:56,478
A scary one.

292
00:15:56,511 --> 00:16:00,644
You're master
Szayel Aporro Granz.

293
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:02,278
We're in trouble for sure.

294
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,478
He's Wakomundo's
greatest researcher.

295
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:06,111
He specializes in
the development

296
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:09,011
of a wide variety of
spirit-based weaponry.

297
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:11,344
We hear rumors, but his
research is completely

298
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:13,011
surrounded in secrecy.

299
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:14,811
Underlings like me
aren't allowed anywhere

300
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:17,278
near the laboratory, so we
don't know what's going on here.

301
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,411
-What are you even
talking about?

302
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,544
Am I supposed to be the
guy you're talking to?

303
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,378
And stand up and get
off of me already,

304
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:25,044
so I can see you
face-to-face, you egg head.

305
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:27,244
-Oh, Renji, there you are.

306
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,378
I've been looking for you.

307
00:16:28,411 --> 00:16:30,878
What are you doing
under my tushy?

308
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,511
Aw!

309
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:32,778
That hurt.

310
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:35,278
Why'd you have to go
and kick me like that?

311
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:36,678
-Shut up.

312
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:39,311
I'm going to kick you again if
you keep on whining like that.

313
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:43,044
Your head's so hard it nearly
broke my frickin' foot.

314
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:44,311
-You're really mean.

315
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:45,878
I would never do that to you.

316
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:49,711
I'm a pacifist, you know?

317
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:52,511
-Ah, more like a scaredy cat.

318
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,944
Quit crying, will ya?

319
00:16:56,611 --> 00:16:57,844
-Now it's even worse.

320
00:16:57,878 --> 00:16:59,644
You've gone and
hurt my feelings,

321
00:16:59,678 --> 00:17:02,244
and I really can't stop crying.

322
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:03,211
-Ugh.

323
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:04,811
All right, I get it.

324
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:06,644
I guess I might have
gone a little overboard

325
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:08,411
in calling you stupid.

326
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,611
So, I apologize.

327
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:11,244
-Are you really sorry
for what you did,

328
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:12,711
and what you said to me?

329
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:13,878
-Yes.

330
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:15,011
I'm really, really, sorry.

331
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:18,244
-Are you really, really,
really, really sorry?

332
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:19,611
-Yes, of course I am.

333
00:17:19,644 --> 00:17:20,978
-That's good.

334
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:24,478
Then, just so we're even steven,
let me kick you in the face,

335
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,311
all right?

336
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:25,978
Oh!

337
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,311
You kicked me again.

338
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:29,411
You're not sorry
at all, you bully.

339
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:30,911
You know what I'm talking about.

340
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:33,478
-I was trying to be polite,
but you took it too far.

341
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:41,344
-Have you two finished with
your little comedy routine?

342
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:44,644
Don't get me wrong, your
act is very impressive.

343
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:46,611
But I've had just about enough.

344
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:48,944
Believe me, I'm
no threat to you.

345
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:50,844
I mean, even though
I'm an Espada,

346
00:17:50,878 --> 00:17:53,044
I'm not very good at fighting.

347
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:56,144
It's just like your hard-boiled
friend over there told you,

348
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:58,044
the bottom line is,
I'm a researcher.

349
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,678
When I'm in the
field like I am now,

350
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,178
I'm gathering data on
different spirit patterns.

351
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:03,978
Trust me, it's the
most interesting thing

352
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:06,878
in the world to me, and
it brings me great joy.

353
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:11,111
You two are fascinating,
on many different levels.

354
00:18:11,144 --> 00:18:13,178
Your patterns are very
different from the ones

355
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:15,278
I've already had
a chance to study.

356
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,511
I was planning to welcome
you with open arms

357
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:19,911
in hopes we could establish
a dialogue together.

358
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:23,478
If you're willing to take
a chance and trust me,

359
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:25,911
I think we'll both benefit.

360
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:28,378
Now, wouldn't that be
much better than fighting?

361
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,744
Ah hm-hm hm-hm.

362
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:33,744
-Don't be ridiculous.

363
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:36,611
You must have me mistaken
for someone else.

364
00:18:36,644 --> 00:18:39,044
I didn't come here so we could
paint each other's toenails

365
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:40,944
like it was some kind
of slumber party.

366
00:18:40,978 --> 00:18:43,478
I came here to kick your ass.

367
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:45,278
I don't care about
your statistics,

368
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:47,378
and I don't care
about the invitation

369
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:49,644
to your little peace conference.

370
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,611
If you want to talk
to me, then you

371
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:55,178
can do it while I'm
cutting you to pieces.

372
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:57,144
But you'd better do
it quick, because it

373
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,844
won't be long
before you're gone.

374
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:00,378
Bankai.

375
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:18,311
Hihio Zabimaru.

376
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:22,311
-Mm-ah!

377
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:30,678
Ah, uh.

378
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,944
-Mm.

379
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:40,944
-Uh, ah.

380
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,003
-Uh, uh.

381
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:00,970
Uh, heh.

382
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:05,070
-My true ability is called
glotoneria It's quite simple.

383
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:08,303
I devour dead Hollows and
absorb both their spirit energy

384
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:09,870
and abilities.

385
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:11,670
Understand?

386
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:14,970
When Metastacia came back
in Kaien Shiba's body,

387
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:18,203
I devoured him and was able to
absorb both their abilities.

388
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:21,703
Because this body really
did belong to Kaien Shiba,

389
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:24,237
the muscles retain
all his experience.

390
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,003
And the mind retains
all of his memories.

391
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:29,503
They're accessible for my use.

392
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:31,670
It's an elegantly
effective system,

393
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:33,037
when you think about it.

394
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,937
I simply accessed
all of his memories,

395
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,070
and acted accordingly.

396
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,670
It's the endgame.

397
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:40,237
Allow me to demonstrate for you.

398
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,937
I'll show you what an Espada
sword release actually

399
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,403
looks like.

400
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:46,037
Devour her.

401
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,537
Glotoneria.

[music playing]

404
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:22,137
-It's there, in your face.

405
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,803
You're terrified.

406
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:25,603
That fear is well-founded.

407
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:28,637
The form you see before you
is the result of combining

408
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,003
the strengths of every
Hollow I've ever devoured.

409
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:35,170
Don't imagine that the
release of a regular Arrancar

410
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:38,870
compares in any way with
the power of an Espada.

411
00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:41,637
For your information,
my glotoneria

412
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,837
can simultaneously display the
abilities of all the Hollows

413
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,603
that I've ever eaten.

414
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:49,603
The last time I
did an estimate, I

415
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:54,637
had devoured 33,650
Hollows, more or less.

416
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,170
In case you can't do the math,
that means at this moment,

417
00:21:58,203 --> 00:22:01,103
as you stand there alone
and consider fighting me,

418
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:07,170
you're facing off an army
of over 30,000 Hollows.

419
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:07,670
-Kaien.
