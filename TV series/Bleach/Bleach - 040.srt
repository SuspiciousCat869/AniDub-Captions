00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:02,624
-Sorry, my friends.

3
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:36,744
-[grunt] Ha.

4
00:02:36,777 --> 00:02:41,244
Well, why are you
saying you're sorry?

5
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:43,644
You stupid idiot, you won.

6
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,277
-Thank you so much.

7
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,644
Kenny had a great time
fighting you, Ichi.

8
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:22,810
It's been a very
long time since I've

9
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:24,977
seen Kenny have so much fun!

10
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,110
I really appreciate it.

11
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:30,777
Here we go.

12
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,710
Hey, listen.

13
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,444
Try to stay alive, OK?

14
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:37,610
That way, maybe you'll get to
play with Kenny gain someday?

15
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:38,410
Goodbye!

00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:00,844
-Sounds like the fight's over.

18
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:03,277
I wonder if Ichigo
is still alive.

19
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,844
We have to keep on
going, no matter what.

20
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:07,844
-Do we have a
chance by ourselves?

21
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:09,877
-He gave us a job
to do, didn't he?

22
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,944
So let's get moving!

23
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:14,810
You ready for this?

24
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:17,410
We have to climb up there, OK?

25
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:18,277
-Right.

26
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,444
-Here goes!

27
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:21,310
-Let's do this!

28
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:26,710
-[shout] Huh?

29
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:27,210
-Oh!

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,710
Hey!

31
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,710
You almost killed me with that.

32
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:39,144
-[laugh] My bad.

33
00:04:39,177 --> 00:04:41,477
RUKIA: The sounds of
fighting have stopped.

34
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,977
I can't sense any
spiritual pressure.

35
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,477
It's gone!

36
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,510
Which one of them has died?

37
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:50,177
I can't tell.

38
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,244
The tower's [?
sekisekirok ?] is blocking

39
00:04:52,277 --> 00:04:54,144
any trace of spiritual
pressure still

40
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:56,244
out there, making it unreadable.

41
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,810
And why?

42
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:04,177
Why should any blood be
spilled on my account?

43
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,410
For me, of all people.

44
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,644
Can you explain?

45
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:14,577
Please, Kaien.

46
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:20,444
GANJU: There we go.

47
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:21,444
Nice and tight.

48
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:22,644
That'll hold just fine.

49
00:05:22,677 --> 00:05:24,477
HANATARO: Uh, Holdon?

50
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,377
I think you tied
me up by mistake.

51
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,144
-[laughs] Well,
it'll be all right.

52
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:31,177
Too late to untie you.

53
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,310
I'll just have to throw
you and the hook together.

54
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:34,177
-Please!

55
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,910
You can't!

56
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:38,377
[shouts] Stop!

57
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,377
Hey, let me down.

58
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,810
You're tearing my arms off!

[screams]

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,010
-I apologize.

61
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:58,077
I know I'm a little late.

62
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,310
You've been cut up
pretty good, Ichigo.

63
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:02,644
But against someone
like Kenpachi Zaraki,

64
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:04,744
you could not have
expected any less.

65
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:08,244
Taking him out was
quite an achievement.

66
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:09,777
You fought well.

67
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,277
And you endured a great deal.

68
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,010
I am impressed.

69
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:16,344
So don't worry.

70
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:17,477
I won't let you die.

71
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:27,877
-Huh?

72
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,277
[giggle]

73
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,544
-Where did you come
from, little one?

74
00:06:32,577 --> 00:06:33,544
[giggling]

75
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:35,844
-Why are you
looking at my sword?

76
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:36,944
This is no toy.

77
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:39,444
It's a tool that I use
for killing people.

78
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,310
-Oo.

79
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:47,744
Ah.

00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:53,110
[giggles]

81
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:55,544
-What's your name, little one?

82
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:56,344
-Huh?

83
00:06:56,377 --> 00:06:58,544
-You don't have one, huh?

84
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:03,344
Neither do I.

85
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:05,710
-[giggle]

00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:08,044

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,210
-Yay!

89
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:13,144
Kenny's awake!

90
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:14,577
Yay!

91
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,677
KENPACHI: What about the Ryoka?

92
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,544
-Huh?

93
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:19,810
I sent someone for Lady Unahana.

94
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:21,977
She should be here any minute.

95
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,910
-Is he alive?

96
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,610
-I think so.

97
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,410
He was breathing
when we left him.

98
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:29,610
-That's one good thing, then.

99
00:07:29,644 --> 00:07:33,410
There'd be no way for me to
pay him back if he were dead.

100
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:35,044
-To pay him back for what?

101
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:37,477
-He beat me, obviously.

102
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,644
-But you beat him, Kenny.

103
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:41,510
-[laugh] You don't get it.

104
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,810
I can tell by the
look on your face.

105
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:45,577
-But you didn't lose, Kenny!

106
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,777
Ichi cheated.

107
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,777
I heard him saying that
Zangotsu was helping him.

108
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,677
So it was two against one.

109
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,577
He forfeits, you win!

110
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,510
-[laugh]

111
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:56,144
-Don't laugh at me like that!

112
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:59,677
-[grunt] Hm.

113
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,810
Getting help from one Zanpakuto.

114
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:03,777
Yachiru?

115
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,744
-Hm?

116
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:07,210
-Do you remember
that day, the day

117
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:11,377
when I gave you your
name so long ago?

118
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:11,944
-Mhm.

119
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:13,744
Of course I do.

120
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:18,510
Gosh, I even remember how many
clouds there were in the sky.

121
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:19,877
-Yes, me too.

122
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:24,610
-Oh!

123
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:25,810
Are you get up?

124
00:08:25,844 --> 00:08:27,410
-Be quiet.

125
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:31,010
[grunt] It's been
such a long time.

126
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:35,810
I'd forgotten how painful
it is to have no name.

127
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:37,277
Everyone else had one.

128
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,177
They were all called
by their names.

129
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,177
Only I was without one.

130
00:08:44,944 --> 00:08:46,344
It's pronounced Yachiru.

131
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:49,377
This is how it's written.

132
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,610
It's the name of the only
person I ever admired.

133
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:55,344
-Oh.

134
00:08:55,377 --> 00:08:58,277
KENPACHI: I give
you this name now.

135
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,144
-Yachiru.

136
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:03,010
-And I shall claim,
from this day

137
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:06,877
forward, the fearsome name
of Kenpachi, the title given

138
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,110
to the mightiest Soul Reaper.

139
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:21,610
My sword, I've ignored
you for such a long time.

140
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:26,510
And now, after so many years,
it's probably too late, anyway.

141
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:31,244
But if I ask, I wonder if you'd
tell me what your name is.

142
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,344
[laugh] Well, then.

143
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:44,877
I guess not, huh?

144
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,410
I want to get stronger.

145
00:09:48,444 --> 00:09:51,477
I finally found someone
worthy of fighting.

146
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,344
And I need to get stronger.

147
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:55,877
I want to fight.

148
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,210
I want to get stronger.

149
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:05,810
It's been a long time
since I felt this way.

150
00:10:05,844 --> 00:10:07,810
-Hm.

151
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:09,310
KENPACHI: I must get stronger!

152
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,510
[groaning]

153
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:23,844
YACHIRU (VOICEOVER): I had
no name, no home, no parents.

154
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:30,577
I was lost there in the
North Rukon District,

155
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,144
Area 79, a place
known as Kusagesi.

156
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:36,244
I've no memory of
anything I saw there,

157
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:38,710
other than the color of blood.

158
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:41,244
The people around me
were beastly and cruel.

159
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:42,944
A helpless child
like me would surely

160
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:45,577
have been stomped to
death before very long.

161
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,944
But then you came along from
the Norh Rukon District,

162
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:51,644
Area 80, a place
known as Zaraki.

163
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:58,110
You appeared from the
very depth of darkness.

164
00:10:58,144 --> 00:11:00,477
You carved up my bloody
world in an instant.

165
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,344
And you gave me a name.

166
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,077
If you hadn't
appeared when you did,

167
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,910
I know I wouldn't be here today.

168
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:16,744
And since that moment,
you've been my whole world.

169
00:11:20,177 --> 00:11:23,277
That's why I know
you can do it, Kenny!

170
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,277
-There's no one else
as strong as you.

171
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,777
And we'll keep getting
better and better, together!

172
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,777
Huh?

173
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,277
Kenny?

174
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,777
Kenny, say something!

175
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:44,810
Kenny!

176
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:01,368
GUARD: [groan] Finally,
all that spiritual pressure

177
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:02,135
has died down.

178
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:10,101
Whoever it was, I wouldn't
want to have to face them.

179
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:13,368
GUARD 2: [laughs] What the
hell is wrong with you?

180
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:16,135
I can't believe
all your whining.

181
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:16,801
How pathetic.

182
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:17,301
-Me?

183
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:18,535
Look at you.

184
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:20,135
You're so scared, your
whole body's still shaking.

185
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:21,035
-Am not.

186
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:23,501
It's just cold up here.

187
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,801
Huh?

188
00:12:24,835 --> 00:12:25,801
What the hell?

189
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:27,868
Did a bird get on
me or something?

190
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:31,401
-What is it?

191
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:33,568
What happened?

192
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,235
Oh, so it was you.

193
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:37,168
You're gonna pay for that.

194
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:46,401
[grunting]

195
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:48,435
-That was kind of
over the top, Ganju.

196
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,835
Don't you think?

197
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:51,201
-I'm over the top?

198
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:54,068
What the hell was that
green goop you used?

199
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:55,835
-You mean this stuff?

200
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:58,768
It's a powerful tranquilizer
known as shinten.

201
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,835
You just put one
drop on the skin.

202
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:02,968
And if the target has
low spiritual pressure,

203
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:04,868
then it'll knock him right out.

204
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:07,935
-You kind of scare me
sometimes, you know that, kid?

205
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:09,768
-Ah, come on.

206
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,301
Anyway, we better hurry?

207
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:19,201
-So it's a vault-style door.

208
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:21,735
Now the question is,
how do we get it open?

209
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,068
-I can handle that.

210
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:24,001
-Huh?

211
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:26,435
Your green goop
opens doors, too?

212
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:28,635
HANATARO: No, but
this spare key will.

213
00:13:28,668 --> 00:13:31,168
I borrowed it from the storage
room in the underground tunnel

214
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,268
last night.

215
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:35,668
-Whoa, what happens if
they find out you did that?

216
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:37,868
Won't that be bad?

217
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,868
-I think I'd be in big trouble.

218
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:42,568
But I thought about
it last night.

219
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:44,335
Ichigo gets beat
up, but he keeps

220
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:46,401
on fighting while
I just run away.

221
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:49,601
I decided that it really
isn't very honorable of me.

222
00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:52,435
I want to save
Rukia, too, you know.

223
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:54,801
But I haven't been
doing enough to help.

224
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,968
So I've decided I'm
going to give it

225
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,868
all I've got from now
on, even if it means

226
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:02,101
breaking the rules
sometimes and maybe

227
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:04,135
getting punished for it later.

228
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:07,101
Of course, stealing a lousy key
hardly compares to the fighting

229
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:08,835
that you guys can do.

230
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:11,935
But I'm afraid it's
about all I'm good for.

231
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:14,035
GANJU: Don't sell
yourself short, my friend.

232
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:15,768
-Huh?

233
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:16,601
-You've done enough.

234
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:22,701
I have to say, I've
never seen such an effort

235
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,468
just to save one person.

236
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:27,468
With all the people involved and
everything we've gone through,

237
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,568
this Rukia must be
quite a cutie, huh?

238
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:31,635
HANATARO: Well, it isn't
about that, really.

239
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,735
-Come on, you could tell me.

240
00:14:33,768 --> 00:14:34,368
Ha.

241
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:35,168
Nevermind.

242
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,401
I'll see for myself.

243
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:39,368
Hey there, Rukia,
come on out here.

244
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:39,868
Huh?

245
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:49,001
[gasp]

246
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:50,868
-Are you Ichigo's friends?

247
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:52,201
How do you know me.

248
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:54,835
-It's me, Hanataro!

249
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,935
Rukia, you remember
me, don't you?

250
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:57,801
-Hanataro?

251
00:14:57,835 --> 00:14:58,735
Of course.

252
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:01,301
But what are you doing here.

253
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:02,768
-I can explain later.

254
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,201
But we've got to move now.

255
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:05,701
Come on, Ganju, let's-- huh?

256
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:09,901
Ganju?

257
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:11,801
You look like you've just
see a ghost or something.

258
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:14,001
-[gasp] I know that symbol.

259
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:15,101
Huh?

260
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:17,801
-The Trembling Current
of the Fallen Skies.

261
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:21,101
You-- you're from
the Shiba clan.

262
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:22,001
-Huh?

263
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:25,368
Do you two know each other?

264
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:27,301
-Yes, I know her.

265
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:36,868
As if I could ever
forget that face,

266
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:42,001
the face of the Soul Reaper
who killed my brother.

267
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:53,135
-You must be mistaken, Ganju.

268
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:54,835
Rukia would never do that.

269
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:56,368
-He died by the sword.

270
00:15:56,401 --> 00:16:01,701
He had his throat slashed and
he was stabbed in the chest.

271
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:04,935
All his wounds were
inflicted by a sword.

272
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:07,301
If he was really
fighting with a Hollow,

273
00:16:07,335 --> 00:16:10,268
how could he have
died of sword wounds?

274
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,068
Not only that, she confessed.

275
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:15,201
She admitted she was
the one who killed him.

276
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:15,868
HANATARO: Wait.

277
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:17,168
This is impossible.

278
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:19,935
Ganju, that just
can't be the truth.

279
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:22,135
RUKIA: It's all right, Hanataro.

280
00:16:22,168 --> 00:16:23,535
-Huh?

281
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:24,868
-What he says is true.

282
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,035
-But Rukia, how?

283
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,935
-He wore the same symbol.

284
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:30,368
It must've been
your older brother.

285
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:37,968
I am the one who
killed Kaien Shiba.

286
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,835
Do what you want.

287
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:46,235
If you kill me now,
I have no reason

288
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:48,168
to complain about my fate.

289
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:48,968
-Agreed!

290
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:49,768
-No, Ganju!

291
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:50,435
Don't do it!

292
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,835
Please don't do it!

293
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:54,101
We came here to save her,
not to kill her, right?

294
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:54,801
Remember?

295
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:55,601
You said it to yourself.

296
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:56,935
Ichigo trusted us.

297
00:16:56,968 --> 00:17:01,001
He trusted us to carry out a
mission no matter what happens,

298
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:01,535
Ganju.

299
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:02,468
-I don't care!

300
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:09,301
Huh?

301
00:17:09,335 --> 00:17:10,735
What's with the
spiritual pressure?

302
00:17:14,235 --> 00:17:18,701
[gasping]

303
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:23,735
UKITAKE: What?

304
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:24,668
What do you mean?

305
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:26,235
Aizen's been killed?

306
00:17:26,268 --> 00:17:32,068
[coughing] Killed when, and how?

307
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,101
Who did this?

308
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,801
-[together] This
morning, before dawn.

309
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:37,835
The murderer and his motives
are still unknown, Captain.

310
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:41,035
-Why didn't you awaken me
immediately to tell me?

311
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:43,401
-Sir, I was concerned
about your health,

312
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:44,801
so I delayed the report.

313
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:48,101
You must punish me, Captain, as
I deserve a severe reprimand.

314
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:49,801
-What are you talking about?

315
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,368
I'm the one who
should be punished.

316
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:52,368
-Why do you do that?

317
00:17:52,401 --> 00:17:54,168
You always have
to copy me, Keoni.

318
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:55,768
-I don't copy idiots.

319
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:58,901
UKITAKE: That's enough, you too.

320
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:00,301
Something's up.

321
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:02,435
I will figure this out.

322
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:09,401
HANATARO: Oh, no.

323
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:14,001
That's the captain of
Squad Six, Byakuya Kuchiki.

324
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:15,935
-Byakuya Kuchiki.

325
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:17,368
So this is him.

326
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:21,101
-You-- you know who he is?

327
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:22,635
GANJU: I know him, all right.

328
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,335
The Kuchikis are one of the
four great noble clans that

329
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:28,101
carry the highest
rank, [? shoichi. ?]

330
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:30,168
This guy's the
current clan leader.

331
00:18:30,201 --> 00:18:34,235
Of all the 13 squad
captains, he is probably

332
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:36,868
the most famous one.

333
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:39,368
For him to show up here
at a time like this--

334
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,768
it's about the worst thing
that could have happened to us.

335
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:46,468
There isn't a chance we could
win in a fight with him.

336
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:50,735
So maybe we just get down on
our knees and beg for our lives.

337
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:51,668
-What?

338
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:53,035
We still have a
job to do, Ganju.

339
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:54,135
We can't just quit.

340
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,835
Let's take Rukia
and get out of here.

341
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:56,901
-You're insane!

342
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,201
You see any exits out
of this damn place?

343
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:02,035
There's only one way out,
and it's over that bridge.

344
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:07,701
And why should I risk my
life for the likes of her,

345
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:10,401
for the one who
killed my brother?

346
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:12,501
What is she?

347
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:13,868
She's nothing but a monster.

348
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:23,068
HANATARO: I understand.

349
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:24,368
GANJU: Huh?

350
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:27,135
HANATARO: I can hardly blame
you for feeling that way.

351
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:28,835
You never had any
real reason to want

352
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,901
to save Rukia to begin with.

353
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:32,835
I see that it would
be asking far too

354
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:35,401
much to expect you to
stay here and fight.

355
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:38,868
But when you escape from
here, would you at least

356
00:19:38,901 --> 00:19:40,568
take Rukia with you?

357
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,535
Please?

358
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:44,568
I'll stay.

359
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,335
I'll hold him as long as I can?

360
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:48,301
-What?

361
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:49,901
Now I'm sure you've
lost your mind.

362
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:53,201
-I'm just saying I understand
and I don't blame you, Ganju.

363
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:56,235
I wouldn't want to risk my
life to save an enemy either.

364
00:19:56,268 --> 00:19:57,668
-Stop.

365
00:19:57,701 --> 00:19:59,768
The point here is you
can't handle this.

366
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:00,968
Feel that spiritual pressure?

367
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:02,501
HANATARO: I know
what I'm up against.

368
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,768
But I've come this far,
and it's only because I

369
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:08,535
wanted to help
save Rukia's life.

370
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:13,535
So how can I just leave now,
without having done anything?

371
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:16,401
Thank you, Ganju, for
everything you've done.

372
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:17,101
Now wish me luck.

373
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:25,568
-Hanataro, no!

374
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,368
Please don't go out there.

375
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:28,135
No!

376
00:20:28,168 --> 00:20:29,768
You can't let him do this.

377
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:30,735
Stop him!

378
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:35,668
-Such a fool.

379
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,635
Without even a Zanpakuto, what
does he think he's going to do?

380
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:41,068
Look at him.

381
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:42,435
He's trembling.

382
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:46,935
Who does he think he
is, acting so tough?

383
00:20:46,968 --> 00:20:49,801
Damn it.

384
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:50,935
-Wait!

385

386

387

-Ganju?

388
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:02,935
-Sorry, pal.

389
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:03,868
-Huh?

390
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:06,235
[shout] Not again!

GANJU (VOICEOVER):
Well, my brother,

392
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:15,368
it looks like avenging
your death is going

393
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:18,301
to have to wait
for a little while.

394
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:20,668
If you want to blame
someone for that,

395
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:23,335
blame sis for not
raising me to be

396
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:27,435
a coward who runs
out on his friends.

397
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:30,001
GANJU: It's your
lucky day, Captain,

398
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:32,235
because I'm the one you'll
have to deal with now.

SOMEBODY, "HAPPY PEOPLE"]

00:22:49,378 --> 00:22:51,711
CAT: The story is finally
coming to a climax.

401
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:54,244
Maybe now it's time for
me to reveal my secret.

402
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:56,011
Can you guess what my secret is?

403
00:22:56,044 --> 00:22:57,911
-You can speak human
language, but not cat.

404
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,744
HANATARO: You die your
fur to keep it black.

405
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,278
GANJU: You're actually a dog?

406
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:02,478
CAT: Bingo.

00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:04,444
Hey, wait, are you trying
to make a fool of me?
