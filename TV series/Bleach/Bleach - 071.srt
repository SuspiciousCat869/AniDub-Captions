00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,210
-I'm afraid that's impossible.

00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,877
-Why's that?

00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,877
-Striking at your opponent's
weakness is a given, is it not?

-Huh?

00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:03,944
-Besides that, I'm
curious to find out

8
00:02:03,977 --> 00:02:06,444
exactly what a Quincy's
soul tastes like.

What's this?

13
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,844
Five on one doesn't seem
very fair, now does it?

-It's fair enough!

Stay back.

Let us handle this guy.

-If that's the case, I shouldn't
hold back, should I, Fried?

Five on two is better.

Although to be perfectly honest,
it's still not quite even.

-Damn you.

24
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,177
All this talk
about a fair fight.

25
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,710
You acted like there's only
one, but there are two of you.

26
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:07,744
-I think of Fried and I as
being of one mind and body.

27
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:10,510
But then again, if we're
being completely fair,

28
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:12,844
I suppose you'd have to count
your sword, in which case

29
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:14,877
we need to recalculate
the odds yet again.

30

-I've had enough
of your nonsense.

-Damn you!

32
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,310
What do you want with her?

33
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:20,777
That girl's done nothing.

34
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,744
-No need to worry
about the girl.

35
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:25,444
I have no intention
of killing her.

36
00:03:25,477 --> 00:03:28,310
However, depending
on your actions,

37
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:31,810
I could make countless incisions
all over her beautiful skin

38
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,677
and let the snake's
venom turn her

39
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,810
into something unrecognizable.

40
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:37,177
That is a possibility.

41
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:44,510
-There's absolutely
no way either party

42
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:46,344
can win in a
situation like this.

43
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:49,144
The only thing we
can do is give up.

44
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:50,044
Am I right?

45
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:51,444
Ah!

46
00:03:51,477 --> 00:03:53,477
-How can you be talking about
giving up at a time like this?

47
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:58,844
-I'm the one you're after.

48
00:03:58,877 --> 00:04:03,544
So then, give up the
woman and take me instead.

49
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,377
-What are you doing?

50
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,710

-We don't have any other choice.

it hurts that you would even

to eat Uryu's soul,

he'll be distracted, and
we can make our move.

00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:56,977
So it looks like the only
data that's available

168
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,577
is what you have stored here.

169
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,810
And since it's such
a dusty old subject,

170
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:02,644
it shouldn't be
a problem, right?

171
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:05,144
-I decide what's a
problem and what isn't.

172
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:07,544
Seems to me that as the
captain of another squad,

173
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:09,177
you're overstepping
your authority

174
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,144
to be here in the first place.

175
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,610
--[sigh] But that's the very
reason I came to see you.

176
00:10:14,644 --> 00:10:16,510
Who better to come
to than the captain

177
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:18,510
of the Department of
Research and Development,

178
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:23,144
as well as the greatest
mind in the Soul Society?

179
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:24,644
Am I right?

180
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:26,577
-If you want to
access our data, I'm

181
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,710
afraid you'll have to go
through the proper channels

182
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:30,810
like everyone else.

183
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:34,110
--[sigh] If I did that, it
could take a good three months.

184
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:35,210
KUROTSUCHI: That's true.

185
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:38,077
I know data such as
this might seem trivial.

186
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,444
But you must understand,
if everyone neglected

187
00:10:41,477 --> 00:10:42,877
to go through the
proper channels,

188
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,444
my position would lose
all meaning and authority.

189
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:49,377
-So, I take it you're
not giving me the data.

190
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,310
-I'm afraid not.

191
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:55,610
-[sigh] I hope that you burn.

192
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:56,310
-Huh?

193
00:10:56,344 --> 00:10:57,810
Did you say Something

194
00:10:57,844 --> 00:10:59,777
-No, nothing at all.

195
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,644
Oh, by the way.

196
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:04,610
I made up that nonsense about
you having the greatest mind.

197
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:06,210
-Hm?

198
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:10,877
-There are some nasty
rumors about you, though.

199
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,710
But if you want to find
out more about them,

200
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:15,077
I'm afraid you'll have to go
through the proper channels.

201
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,977
[laughs]

202
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,010
-Damn!

203
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:23,444
I can't believe that
rude, arrogant son

204
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:26,110
of a-- [growl] Nemu, the key.

205
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,044
He thinks he can
talk to me like that?

206
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:36,377
I'll just delete
the data he wants.

207
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,244
Huh?

208
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:39,077
What?

209
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,777
What do you mean, access denied?

210
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,477
This is ridiculous!

211
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,544
I never gave that order.

212
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:48,410
Who could possibly
have done this?

213
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:50,277
Nemu, get over here.

214
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,044
What's this all about?

215
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:54,310
I left you in charge
of supervision.

216
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:55,644
How did this happen?

217
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:56,877
You're worthless!

218
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,177
-It appears this is more
complicated than I originally

219
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,477
thought.

220
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:00,977
Damn.

221
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:15,159
[clock ticking]

222
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:19,659
[sighing]

223
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,407
-Uryu.

224
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,694
-This sucks.

225
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,461
We can't just sit
here do nothing.

226
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:46,628
Where's Yoruichi?

227
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:49,161
-All I know is that she
hasn't come home yet.

228
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:50,161
-Where is she?

229
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:51,828
We need her right now.

230
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:53,328
-We need everyone we can get.

231
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:54,228
-I'll do what I can.

232
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:55,628
-[grunt]

233
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:57,961
-And you can count me in.

234
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:00,294
-Now, just take it easy.

235
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:01,061
-What do you mean?

236
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:02,528
We've got to find Uryu.

237
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:05,128
-Where exactly do you
plan on finding him?

238
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,128
Do you even know where
to start looking?

239
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,328
-Uh.

240
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:10,628
If we all split up, we've
at least got a chance.

241
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:11,794
URAHARA: Wouldn't advise it.

242
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:14,294
We don't really even know
what their objective is.

243
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:17,528
If we split up, we might be
doing exactly what he expects.

244
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:19,894
It's possible he'll come
after whoever's alone,

245
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:22,028
like the other day.

246
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:24,061
The dolls that these
Bounts manipulate

247
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,161
possess mysterious powers.

248
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:28,061
It seems they have
capabilities even

249
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:31,228
beyond those of our Zanpakutos.

250
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:33,694
If you're not fully prepared
when you go after them,

251
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:34,761
look out.

252
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:38,328
You'll be falling
right into their hands.

253
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:42,161
[sighing]

254
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:44,561
[fart]

255
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:46,028
-Huh?

256
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:46,994
-Huh?

257
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:48,461

--[laughs] I got you,
I got you, I got you.

260
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:58,761
[laughs] Boo-boo cushion.

261
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:00,161
That was great!

262
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:05,061
You should have seen the look
on your face when you sat down!

263
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,394
Whoa, take it easy.

264
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,561
I was just trying to lighten
the mood a little bit.

265
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:09,294
That's all.

266
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:09,994
ICHIGO: Get lost!

267
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:11,928

-[groans]

269
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,928
Where am I?

270
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:26,394
[gasp]

271
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:27,361
What happened?

272
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:33,528
Why am I still alive?

273
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:39,828
Did you save me because a soul
tastes better when it's alive?

274
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:42,561
YOSHINO: You're a
Quincy, aren't you?

275
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:44,728
-Seems like you're all
interested in that.

276
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:47,228
Is a Quincy some sort
of delicacy to you?

277
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,261
Do our souls make
your mouth water?

278
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:54,328
-Well, to be completely honest,
it doesn't smell very tasty.

279
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,861
And now that you've
lost your powers,

280
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:58,328
it's even less appetizing.

281
00:14:58,361 --> 00:14:59,494
-Guess I should be insulted.

282
00:15:03,394 --> 00:15:04,561
-What happened?

283
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:05,594
-Huh?

284
00:15:05,628 --> 00:15:07,094
-I'm curious how you
lost your powers.

285
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:32,561
-When the time came,
I wasn't ready.

286
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:35,928
I went beyond my capability.

287
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:38,228
I think that sums it up.

288
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:40,294
-Is that a common
characteristic with Quincies?

289
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:42,628
URYU: What?

290
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:44,061
-This self-pity of yours.

291
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:51,894
[sigh] Guess I should have
looked for another Quincy.

292
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:54,028
URYU: There are
no other Quincies.

293
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:54,661
YOSHINO: Huh?

294
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:55,961
URYU: It's true.

295
00:15:55,994 --> 00:15:56,794
I'm the last one.

296
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:00,861
-I see.

297
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,094
There's only you.

298
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:06,361
That must be a very
lonely feeling.

299
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:07,794
-[gasp]

300
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:13,928
URAHARA: I've been
debating whether or not

301
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:16,761
to tell you this.

302
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:18,628
The reason we were
initially interested

303
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:21,494
in researching Bounts is
because of a special substance

304
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:24,894
we discovered contained in
the residue they created.

305
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:27,161
It was harmless enough
in small quantities.

306
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,061
But if it became
more concentrated,

307
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:30,628
our research led
us to believe that

308
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:33,061
under the right conditions,
this substance could possibly

309
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:34,428
affect space.

310
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,861
-What do you mean, space?

311
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,128
And what does it do?

312
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,761
-Can you give us
any more details

313
00:16:38,794 --> 00:16:40,661
so we know what we're
dealing with here?

314
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:43,261
-This substance causes a
reaction in the atmosphere,

315
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,894
forming what can
only be described

316
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:47,861
as a tunnel connecting two
separate planes of space.

317
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:50,361
-Well, if that's true,
then that would mean that--

318
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:51,061
-Quit drawing.

319
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,094
It's just confusing me!

320
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:55,628
-[sigh] Something like this?

321
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:00,661
-Uh, yeah, in a way.

322
00:17:00,694 --> 00:17:02,528
But it's a bit more complicated.

323
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:04,994
You see it connects this
world with Hueco Mundo, which

324
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:07,028
is the world where
the Hollows dwell.

325
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:07,994
[gasping]

326
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,394
-But if that happens,
there's no way

327
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,128
of telling how many innocent
humans living in this world

328
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:13,994
could be sucked into that plane.

329
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:15,194
-Yes.

330
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:17,528
But perhaps a more serious
problem is that the Soul

331
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:20,861
Society has always used the time
it takes for a Hollow to appear

332
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:22,761
in this world to position
its Soul reapers.

333
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:26,594
[sigh] If the Hollows have
completely unrestricted passage

334
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,961
from there to here--

335
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:30,728
-All of the Soul Reapers in
Seireitei couldn't stop them.

336
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:31,894
URAHARA: Yeah.

337
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:34,228
With so many
unprotected souls, it

338
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,961
would be a Hollow
feeding frenzy.

339
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:40,761
Of course, what we're talking
about is only a possibility.

340
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,294
-How much of a possibility?

341
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,961
-Hm.

342
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:46,861
I'd say about this
much of a chance.

343
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:47,894
-What?

344
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:49,361
Only 5%?

345
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:50,528
URAHARA: Guess again, Ichigo.

346
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:52,961
-You mean 50%!

347
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:53,894
-Mhm.

354
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:03,794
-I'm sorry to interrupt, but I
just received word from Uryu.

355
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:04,361
ICHIGO: What!

356
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:13,094
Where the hell have you been?

357
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:15,461
-I'm still kind of banged up
from that pounding I took,

358
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,394
so if you could keep
your voice below a roar,

359
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:19,328
I'd appreciate it.

360
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:21,628
-But it looks like
you're all right.

361
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:23,228
-I'm so relieved.

362
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:24,061
-Hm?

363
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:24,628
-Don't worry.

364
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:25,394
I'm not a ghost.

365
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:26,861
My legs are still there.

366
00:18:26,894 --> 00:18:28,161
-Tell us what happened.

367
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:29,361
-What do you want to know?

368
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:32,594
-How the hell did you
even make it back alive?

369
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:35,294
-The female Bount
who captured me-- she

370
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:38,461
basically wanted to talk.

371
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,661
YOSHINO: I want you to
be quiet and listen.

372
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,528
If you give me a
chance to explain,

373
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:46,694
then I won't have to hurt you.

374
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:49,094
As long as I can
remember, we Bounts

375
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,061
have had a rule that
must never be broken.

376
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:53,761
We are strictly
forbidden from ever

377
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:57,028
taking the soul of a
living person, ever.

378
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:58,528
Do you want to know why?

379
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,328
-Tell me.

380
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:01,761
YOSHINO: If we
did so, the result

381
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:04,628
would be that we Bounts
would obtain immense energy,

382
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:08,694
so much so that it would
cause us to effect space.

383
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:10,994
URYU: I don't understand.

384
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:12,528
Effect it in what way?

385
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:15,394
YOSHINO: For example, we
could pass into the afterlife.

386
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:20,428
But as I'm sure you
can imagine, that

387
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:23,094
would completely destroy
the balance of the world.

388
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,528
And the knowledge
of that has been

389
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:29,328
enough to keep us from ever
attempting it until now.

390
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:33,994
However, a Bount
has recently emerged

391
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:36,861
who is trying to do just that.

392
00:19:36,894 --> 00:19:39,661
The name of this
man is Jin Kariya.

393
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:49,494
-You broke the rule and
attacked live humans, too.

394
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:52,394
-Yes, but I failed.

395
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,528
I needed more strength
to fight Kariya,

396
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,228
and I knew there
was no other way.

397
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,228
But I realize now that
I was wrong to do so.

398
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:02,461
There was no justification
for ever breaking the rule.

399
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,461
That means I must
rely on whatever power

400
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,561
I now possess to
defeat Kariya and put

401
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:09,461
a stop to his twisted plans.

402
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:10,728
-Why tell me all this?

403
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:12,661
What's this have to do with me?

404
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:14,728
-Kariya has targeted
you, and I'm

405
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:16,628
sure he'll come after you again.

406
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:19,961
I will do whatever I can
to make sure you survive.

407
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:22,528
I brought you here
to tell you that.

408
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:24,028
-But why my soul?

409
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:25,128
Why me?

410
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:27,528
-There's a prophecy
about the final outcome,

411
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,394
that it will be
determined by a Quincy.

412
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:36,828
URYU: After that, I
lost consciousness.

413
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,228
I don't know what happened next.

414
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:40,294
But when I came to, I was
here in this hospital.

415
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:43,461
-But why a Quincy, I wonder.

416
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:47,128
-I never got the chance to ask
her that before I passed out.

417
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:48,094
-What do you think?

418
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:49,994
Was she telling the truth?

419
00:20:50,028 --> 00:20:51,994
-It's hard for me
to know for sure.

420
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:54,894
Who knows?

421
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:55,828
Hm.

422
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:56,361
ICHIGO: Uryu?

423
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:57,228
-Huh?

424
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:58,461
Oh, sorry.

425
00:20:58,494 --> 00:21:00,061
If it were a lie,
though why would she

426
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:01,861
bring me to the hospital?

427
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,894
It's hard to believe it's
all some kind of a bad joke.

428
00:21:04,928 --> 00:21:07,928
-At any rate, I've got a feeling
that guy's coming after Uryu.

429
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:09,928
And we better be ready
when he gets here.

430
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:12,294
Yeah, you don't have to
worry about a thing, Uryu.

431
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:14,194
We'll protect you.

432
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:15,728
-Thanks a lot, you guys.

433
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:17,928
URAHARA: Well, if we're
going to come up with a plan,

434
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:19,294
we better get on it.

435
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:21,561
I'll head back to the shop and
see what I can come up with.

436
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:25,461
-Yeah, I need to talk to Mr.
Hat and Clogs for a minute.

437
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:28,094
-You should try to get some
rest while you can, OK?

URYU (VOICEOVER):
It's been so long,

439
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:43,794
but that face seems so familiar.

00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:45,461
-Mommy.

441
00:21:45,494 --> 00:21:46,361
Mommy?

442
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:48,194
What's the matter, Mommy?

443
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:50,928
Why are you crying?

444
00:21:50,961 --> 00:21:52,394
URYU (VOICEOVER): Huh.

445
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:54,061
That's right.

00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:58,528
I remember Mom looked like she
might be laughing, yet crying.

UTAGAWA: Are you sure that
letting Yoshino roam around

448
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:09,528
freely like that is
such a good idea?

449
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,094
Mr. Kariya!

450
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:12,928
-I can say with
absolute certainty

451
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:14,794
that Yoshino would
never leave me.

452
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:20,094
I have taken the
appropriate steps.
