1
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,300
Mnnnhhh.

2
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,200
A successful
procedure!

3
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:24,266
We did it, Karin!

4
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,766
<i>My name is Franken-Ichigo.</i>

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,966
<i>I was on the brink of death</i>
<i>after battling Hollows.</i>

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,533
<i>But I have been rebuilt,</i>
<i>and brought back to life!</i>

7
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:44,400
<i>I wandered about aimlessly</i>
<i>for hours, and as I emerged</i>
<i>from within the dark forest,</i>
<i>a castle appeared before me.</i>

8
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:34,545
Huh? What is this place?

9
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:37,812
Hm? Huh?
What's going on here?

10
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:46,578
[sigh] Not again.

11
00:02:46,612 --> 00:02:47,345
[Rukia]
Ichigo!

12
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:48,012
Huh?

13
00:02:51,278 --> 00:02:52,712
Oh! Rukiruki!

14
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:55,445
Who?

15
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:59,045
<i>One night, I had a dream.</i>
<i>I awoke in a desert to</i>
<i>find I had become an</i>
<i>Arabian thief and--</i>

16
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:01,045
Uhh, It's not
important.

17
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:03,612
All you really need to know is,
this whole thing's a dream.

18
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:06,912
So you think you're in the
middle of a daydream?
That's what you're saying?

19
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:09,178
I don't see why you're
even bringing that up.

20
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:12,178
What difference does it
make, when I'm already
inside a dream?!

21
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:15,578
Ouch! What the hell
are you doing?!
That really hurt!

22
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,045
You're not dreaming!

23
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:20,345
It was time for our
scheduled meeting,
but as usual, you
didn't show up!

24
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:21,645
So I had to come
and get you!

25
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:22,878
What meeting?

26
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:25,878
You dummy!

27
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:26,812
G'ahh!

28
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:29,378
All right then,
let's see if you can
forget about this!

29
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:32,245
Ut! Agh! Egh!
Hey, cut that out!

30
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:35,978
Move it! We're going
back to the castle!

31
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:39,512
All right, I'm going!
So you can stop
poking me, Rukiruki!

32
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:42,712
It's not Rukiruki!
I'm Rukia!
Now speed it up!

33
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:45,045
That thing's really sharp,
in case you didn't know!

34
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:57,245
Sorry we're late.

35
00:03:57,745 --> 00:03:58,745
[frustrated sigh]

36
00:03:58,778 --> 00:03:59,478
Huh?

37
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:12,712
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Rangiku... Toshiro... Uryu...</i>
<i>Orihime... and, who are you?</i>

38
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:17,878
Relax. Relax.
This is nothing
but a stupid dream.

39
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:19,912
What are you mumbling
to yourself about?

40
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:21,478
Hurry up and
take your seat!

41
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:22,778
Yeah, whatever.

42
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:30,545
[slurrrp]

43
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:32,878
Hey Uryu, What
in the world are
you drinking?

44
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:35,812
Have you gone blind?
It's a bottle of milk!

45
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:37,678
Shouldn't you be
drinking blood
or something?

46
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,412
You're supposed to
be Dracula, right?

47
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:44,645
What do you mean? Blood is
the same color as a Soul
Reaper's Spirit Ribbon,
I would never drink that!

48
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:46,945
That makes sense,
but why drink milk?

49
00:04:47,278 --> 00:04:48,312
<i>Augh!</i>

50
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:53,545
As you can see, I'm both
Dracula and a Quincy! It's
only natural that I take
pride in the color white...

51
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:56,012
[dizzy]
Nnh...

52
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:57,878
Hey, what's wrong, Uryu?

53
00:04:57,912 --> 00:05:01,345
The truth is, I'm a
little anemic because
I can't drink blood.

54
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:03,578
Try not to get me so
worked up, willya?

55
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:05,478
You're an idiot,
you know that?

56
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:08,512
<i>[Rangiku]</i>
<i>Take it easy!</i>
<i>It happens all</i>
<i>the time, right?</i>

57
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:09,612
Yeah!

58
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:10,112
Huh?

59
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,545
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>So Rangiku is a witch.</i>

60
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:18,845
<i>And Orihime is</i>
<i>a-- well, what is</i>
<i>she, a pumpkin?</i>
<i>A pumpkin ghost?</i>

61
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:23,245
Ha ha ha! You're all
patched together!
You look really weird!

62
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:23,878
Geh!

63
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:25,978
Come on, I don't look
as weird as you!

64
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:27,812
Ignore him, Orihime.

65
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:31,312
The fact is, he's been
acting extremely strange
since I brought him here.

66
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:33,078
There's nothing
wrong with me.

67
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:36,478
And by the way, what
kind of monster are you
supposed to be, Rukia?

68
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,312
S'cuse me?
You can't tell?

69
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:40,012
I happen to be a succubus.

70
00:05:40,045 --> 00:05:41,645
Huh? What the
heck's a succubus?

71
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:43,045
<i>[Uryu] [still weak]</i>
<i>Allow me to explain.</i>

72
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:43,712
Huh?
Hm?

73
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,212
They're dream demons.
The kind of demons
that ruin men.

74
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:50,045
They appear as lovely
women, with bat wings
on their backs.

75
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:53,678
In many cases, they target
men ahead of time, and
attack them in their sleep.

76
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:56,845
Once the men have no
way to escape, they
proceed to seduce them.

77
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,312
And then they go and
suck out their life energy.

78
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:00,978
Ungh!

79
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:03,045
Hey, Rukia.

80
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:05,912
Come to think of it, you
are a succubus and you've
been jabbing at me with
your fork the whole time.

81
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:07,212
What's the deal?

82
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:10,112
Forget it! I've known
you a long time.
Why would I seduce you?

83
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:12,945
I only use my skills
on certain people.

84
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:16,112
They have to be both
noble and beautiful
to get my attention!

85
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:20,345
<i>For example, someone</i>
<i>like my older brother.</i>

86
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:22,012
Hmpf...

87
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:23,478
<i>[Renji]</i>
<i>Oh will you stop already?</i>
<i>You're making my ears bleed.</i>

88
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:24,359
Hm?

89
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:24,812
Mmh.

90
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:29,345
That voice.
Is that you in
there, Renji?

91
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:32,178
I didn't recognize you
inside that mummy outfit.

92
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:32,845
Wrong.

93
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:33,612
Eh?

94
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:35,812
I'm not a mummy.
I'm a pirate.

95
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:36,678
Huh?

96
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:41,678
Once upon a time not that
long ago, I was a pirate
who sailed the Seven Seas!

97
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:46,512
<i>Back then, I was afraid</i>
<i>of nothing. I believed</i>
<i>the world was my oyster.</i>

98
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:52,078
<i>But I was constantly</i>
<i>being harassed by</i>
<i>my arch-enemies,</i>
<i>Team Seaweed!</i>

99
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,978
Let's get 'em, boys!

100
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:55,245
Pine!!

101
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:56,878
Seaweed Zone Defense!
Seaweed! Seaweed!
Seaweed! Seaweed!

102
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:04,212
<i>A fierce firefight broke</i>
<i>out between our two ships,</i>
<i>until finally...</i>

103
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:10,145
Now that you're at my mercy,
shall I tell you the
difference between you and I?

104
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:11,845
It's class!

105
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:13,345
Ungh.

106
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:18,245
I carry the wounds on my
body from that day, and
that's why I look like this!

107
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:19,245
Hold on.

108
00:07:19,278 --> 00:07:21,578
So you're telling me that
you're not a monster?

109
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:24,045
And what's Team Seaweed?
I've never heard of it!

110
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,612
<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>I hate to interrupt...</i>

111
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,478
but aren't we all gathered
here to have a meeting?

112
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:31,245
A meeting? What are you
talking about, Toshiro?

113
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:34,412
My name's not Toshiro!
It's Wolfman Hitsugaya!

114
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:36,112
Egh.

115
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:38,845
And the bottom line is,
we couldn't start on
time because you didn't
show up, as usual!

116
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:41,845
Don't get so upset.
It's all right,
Captain.

117
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,378
I mean, we haven't all
introduced ourselves yet.

118
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:47,412
And anyway, the meeting's
only about the hunters,
isn't that right?

119
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:48,845
What hunters?

120
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:49,478
[grumble]

121
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:50,845
It's no big
deal, really.

122
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:53,578
We just have to find a
way to get rid of them
as quickly as possible!

123
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:54,512
[growl]

124
00:07:54,545 --> 00:07:56,612
Try not to get so
stressed out, Captain!

125
00:07:56,645 --> 00:07:58,912
Otherwise, your fur will
start falling out again!

126
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,278
Rangiku!

127
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,045
Hey, don't shoot
the messenger!

128
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:05,478
Here, why don't we
use this to ease
your stress! Fetch!

129
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,378
[barks and yips]

130
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:09,378
[sigh]

131
00:08:12,412 --> 00:08:13,512
[panting]

132
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:16,445
Wow! Good dog,
Captain, good dog!

133
00:08:16,812 --> 00:08:18,212
Stop it!
I'm not a dog!

134
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:19,878
Shake? Come on!

135
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:20,378
Woof.

136
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:22,145
Good job!
Attaboy!

137
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:24,378
Weren't you listening?!
I'm not a dog!

138
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:26,645
Here you go!
Once more...
Fetch!

139
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:28,512
Ruff!

140
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:32,545
So. What is this
meeting regarding the
hunters all about?

141
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,612
If you insist, I suppose
I'll have to explain it.

142
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:37,412
We're back to you again?!

143
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,612
Recently,
we received word,

144
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:46,512
that mysterious monster
hunters have been spotted,
prowling through this area.

145
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:53,445
<i>It appears the two of them are</i>
<i>not here to kill monsters, but</i>
<i>are instead, looking for a</i>
<i>certain secret treasure.</i>

146
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:54,778
Treasure?

147
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,512
Yes. And the secret treasure
they're looking for is...
priceless.

148
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:04,945
It's a legendary jewel that
will force us monsters to
return to our original
forms as human beings!

149
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,945
It's called the
'Snow Crystal'!

150
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:10,778
Wait just a minute!
I know that shape.
I recognize it! Yeah!

151
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:16,412
<i>Anyway, long story short.</i>
<i>They plan to use the Snow</i>
<i>Crystal to cleanse the world</i>
<i>of every last monster.</i>

152
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:18,378
<i>That's their</i>
<i>ultimate objective.</i>

153
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:25,612
Question! Where would
a person look for this
'whatever-you-call-it'
crystal?

154
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:26,878
Here.

155
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:30,078
It is kept under lock and key on
the top floor of this castle.

156
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:34,912
So if we use that on
ourselves, We'll all
turn back into human
beings, right?

157
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:36,478
Yes, that is correct.

158
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:39,812
And that is why we must
protect the Snow Crystal

159
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,312
from falling into the
wrong hands, at all coss.

160
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:43,578
Hm?

161
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:47,512
<i>Hold on, there!</i>

162
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:50,312
Just where are you
going, Ichigo?

163
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:52,312
To the top floor,
if you must know.

164
00:09:52,345 --> 00:09:55,145
<i>Egh! You're not</i>
<i>planning to steal</i>
<i>the jewel, are you?</i>

165
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:59,278
Damn right, I am!
I'm gonna use that jewel
to turn myself back
into a human being!

166
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:02,878
At that point, I should be able
to wake up from this dream!

167
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:05,778
What kind of stupid plan have
you got up your sleeve?!

168
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:07,678
Come to your senses,
will you?!

169
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:10,912
Nngh... Blood...
Need more blood...

170
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:14,012
Once you wake up from
this dream, your anemia
will be gone, too!

171
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:14,978
See ya!

172
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:18,612
We have a situation, everyone!

173
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:19,712
Hm?

174
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:20,378
Huh?

175
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:23,012
Just look outside!
Something's coming!

176
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:56,996
Who's that?

177
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,296
It's my Dad!
It's Ryuken!

178
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,162
Huh?
Huh?

179
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:06,462
Hey Dad!
Ryuken!

180
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:10,296
Sorry Ichigo.
It's only polite,
go first.

181
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:14,529
There's no need to be polite,
Uryu! You go ahead and talk,
if you're ready!

182
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,129
Grr! Well all right,
fine then!

183
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:18,262
[clears throat]
Ahem!

184
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:19,396
Hey, Ryuken!

185
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,262
Calling your father
by his first name.

186
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:23,762
You haven't changed at all.

187
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:27,229
That's not important.
Why do you have the
powers of a monster hunter?

188
00:11:27,662 --> 00:11:30,096
Why are you asking such
a foolish question?

189
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:30,896
Really?

190
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,496
Just accept the fact.

191
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,429
The truth of the matter is,
whether you like it or not,

192
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,762
I am the only man who is
allowed to call himself,

193
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:41,729
the last Monster Hunter.

194
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:44,596
Excuse me, but I'm
a Hunter, as well!

195
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:46,496
Then how 'bout getting out
there and doing your job?!

196
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,229
Hey, hey, take
it easyyyyyo~!

197
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:54,262
Now then, prepare
yourself, Uryu!

198
00:11:54,662 --> 00:11:56,662
You leave me no choice
but to fight you!

199
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,896
Rukia. Orihime. Momo.

200
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:02,396
You three return to the castle
and protect the crystal!

201
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:03,362
<i>[all 3]</i>
<i>Right!</i>

202
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:06,229
The rest of us will make a stand
and stop them here.

203
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,729
Wait a minute.
Where's Ichigo?

204
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:11,662
Ah!

205
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:17,196
<i>[all in unison]</i>
<i>Oh crap! He's going after</i>
<i>the crystal himself!</i>

206
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:18,662
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Heh ha ha ha ha!</i>

207
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:21,829
Yeah, right, Like I'm gonna
waste my time fighting hunters!

208
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:25,596
<i>I'm gonna go in there, get</i>
<i>the Snow Crystal, and wake</i>
<i>up from this stupid dream!</i>

209
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:26,996
Huh?

210
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:37,496
Dad!

211
00:12:38,796 --> 00:12:40,696
Son! This is it.

212
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,729
I won't allow you to lay a
hand on the Snow Crystal.

213
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:45,829
Huhh?

214
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:48,829
Wait a minute!
What the hell?

215
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:51,762
I thought you came here to
steal the Snow Crystal,
not protect it!

216
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:54,896
Ha ha ha ha!
Don't sweat the
details, kid.

217
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:58,796
Well just forget it!
The Snow Crystal is
mine, Dad!

218
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:02,896
And you can't stop me from
waking up back in reality!

219
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:07,162
Raaaaa!
Yaaaaah!

220
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:15,796
This is a useless
exercise, Uryu!

221
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,562
I know you don't have
the energy to shoot a
full volley of arrows!

222
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:23,129
Damn it all! I knew I should
have started drinking blood!

223
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:25,529
And there's one more thing.

224
00:13:25,562 --> 00:13:30,096
You probably think the
maximum number of Spirit
Arrows I can shoot in a
volley is 1200, don't you?

225
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:31,862
<i>Actually,</i>

226
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:33,862
It's twelve hundred...

227
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:36,096
...and one!

228
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:37,196
What?!

229
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:39,896
Yee!

230
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,496

<i>Extend, Zabitai!</i>

Hm?
Hm?

232
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:47,396
Got it!

233
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:50,496
Let me help you
out a bit, Uryu.

234
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:53,162
Dgh.

235
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:59,429
Damn! All I really want to do
is wake up from this dream!

236
00:14:00,396 --> 00:14:02,996
Tell me something, Dad.
Why do I have to fight you?!

237
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:04,362
Ah ha ha ha!

238
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:07,162
Oh, come on, Ichigo!
Isn't it obvious, yet?

239
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:13,796
<i>As the saying goes: The Lion,</i>
<i>the King of Beasts, shoves its</i>
<i>cubs off the highest cliff to</i>
<i>test their worthiness!</i>

240
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:17,629
<i>Now then, Ichigo, Crawl</i>
<i>back up and prove that</i>
<i>you can surpass me!</i>

241
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:20,662
Why the hell are you spouting
all this nonsense. dad?

242
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:24,029
You want me to fight you so
I can prove I can fight?!

<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>We finally found you, Ichigo!</i>

You bastard! How could
you betray us like this?!

245
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:34,096
You were planning to snatch
the crystal for yourself this
whole time, weren't you?!

246
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:35,162
Uhh!

247
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:37,729
Wait, you've got it all wrong!
I mean, just look!

248
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:40,596
You see this hunter?!
I'm in the middle of
fighting him now!

249
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,396
Huh?

250
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:43,862
You're having...
a family squabble?

251
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:47,929
Yaaaahhh!
Yaahhhhh!

252
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:56,096
Renji! Uryu!

253
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:02,296
I have to say, when
it comes down to it,
you guys are all talk
and no substance!

254
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:03,829
Egh!

255
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,762
Damn it! We can't defend
ourselves against him!

256
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:11,662
If you absolutely
refuse to tell me where
the crystal is, then
you leave me no choice.

257
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:14,362
<i>I'll have to get</i>
<i>rid of you first.</i>

258
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:17,329
After that, I'll just
find it on my own.

259
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:25,229
Come on, Uryu!
Isn't there
anything we can do?

260
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:29,029
There is!

261
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:30,829
Huh?

262
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:33,596

Huuagh!

267
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:48,896
Hey, what's the big idea!
Stop it!

268

I anticipated
this situation.

276
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,896
So I placed Sprenger
inside the courtyard
in case I needed it.

277
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:25,329
Looks like it paid off.

278

It's over, Monster Hunters.

279
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:32,496
And as for you, Ichigo, your
noble sacrifice allowed us to
earn a great victory today.

280
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:35,829
Rest in peace, my friend.

Man, that was close!

287
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:24,596
If I hadn't been wearing
my mask, I would have been
wiped out, right along
with those other two guys!

288
00:17:25,196 --> 00:17:27,862
Hey, Uryu, what was up
with that land mine?!
Are you nuts?!

What do you mean?

290
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:32,262
I carefully
explained it all at
today's meeting.

291
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:34,429
You have yourself to
blame for missing it.

What? I couldn't
help it!

293

'Course not!
I'm sure you'd lose
your head if it wasn't
sewn onto your body!

00:17:57,362 --> 00:17:59,162
Now you kids have
really done it!

302
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:00,796
You little bastards!

303

Yeeahhahhhhhh!

305
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,329
Raaaahhh!!

306
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:18,362
<i>[Orihime]</i>
<i>Pumpkin... Pumpkin...</i>
<i>Pumpkin... Pumpkin!</i>

307
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:21,162
What do you think, Orihime?
Will this do the job for now?

308
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:24,762
Oh yes. The barrier
has become much,
much stronger.

309
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:25,629
Huh?
Huh?

310
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:26,996
[panting]

311
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:28,362

313

[Renji]
What are we gonna do?!
There's nowhere else to run!

314
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:35,329
[Ichigo]
Damn! We'll have to
fight them again!

315
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:39,162
[Rangiku]
Fight? Did you already
forget that we didn't stand
a chance back there?

316
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:40,396
[Uryu]
We don't have a choice!

317
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:42,962
It's just not worth
risking everyone's lives.

318
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,262
It sucks, but
we'll have to hand
over the crystal.

319
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:45,829
Mmm.

320
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:46,796
Urgh!

321
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,529
Orihime! Where's the
crystal right now?

322
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,929
Hm? Right over there,
of course.

323
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:53,729
Okay!

324
00:18:57,129 --> 00:18:58,262
What?

325
00:18:58,296 --> 00:18:59,696
<i>[Renji]</i>
<i>Hey, Ichigo!</i>
<i>It's no use!</i>

326
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:01,462
I can't hold them
back any longer!

327
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:02,329
Hwaaah!

328
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:06,496
That's it, then!
This is as far as
you go, you
pathetic monsters!

329
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,229
[fright squeal]
Eyaaahh!

330
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:13,462
Okay, spill it!
Where have you guys
hidden the crystal?

331
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:15,629
Hmph! Someone's
a petty thief!

332
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:17,229
Which one of you is it?

333
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:20,596
I'll tell you,
it wasn't me!

334
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:22,462
I would never pull
such a trick!

335
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,429
I didn't do it!

336
00:19:24,462 --> 00:19:25,796
It wasn't
me, either!

337
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:27,029
Or me, honest!

338
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:29,929
Hmph.
Looks like you
have your answer.

339
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:32,762
Nobody knows about this crystal.

340
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:36,362
Maybe the thing never
existed to begin with!

341
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:38,296
That ridiculous!

342
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,496
You don't know if
it's true or not!

343
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:43,496
And I'm warning you
now, These people
here are my friends!

344
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:45,862
I'll protect them
against any attack!

345
00:19:46,062 --> 00:19:49,662
You fool! You think you're
actually able to defeat us?

346
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:53,396
It's no longer a matter
of whether I think I
can defeat you.

347
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:57,696
The bottom line is, I can
no longer allow you to
hurt any of my friends.

348
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:00,362
That means I have to defeat you!

349
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:01,796
Great, Ichigo.

350
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:04,229
I see you're reckless as always.

351
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:05,496
Uryu!

352
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:09,296
Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm not doing this to try
and help you.

353
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:12,062
This is my fight, too,
and I'm not gonna run away.

354
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:14,596
That's a good enough
reason to join forces.

355
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:16,196
Ready to show 'em
what we've got?

356
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:17,429
Hm.

357
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:19,296
Let's do it!

358
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:22,462
[both attack growl]
Huaaaahhh!

359
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:24,629
What is this?!

360
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:35,129
Huh! I can see now that
beating scum like you
isn't going to make us
very much money!

361
00:20:35,762 --> 00:20:37,462
So... That's the way it goes!

362
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:39,429
Huh?! What does that mean?!

363
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:40,862
See ya!

364
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:43,062
Where are
you going?!

365
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:47,862
[all others]
Hey! We won! Yeah!

366
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:48,562
Huh?

367
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:52,429
[Ryuken]
Friends, huh? That foolish boy
never learns from his mistakes.

368
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:57,096
[Isshin]
Ah, stop being so hard on him.
At least you got to see how much
your precious son has matured.

369
00:20:57,129 --> 00:20:58,762
Yeah. If you say so.

370
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:01,796
You're too much!
You won't admit
you're proud of him!

371
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,229
Hey! Wait for me!

372
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:06,562
[relieved sigh]

373
00:21:06,596 --> 00:21:08,096
What the hell was
that all about?

374
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:11,829
Yeah, really.
And we still
don't know where
the crystal is!

375
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:12,729
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.

376
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:15,129
Right! And without it,
I can't go back!

377
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:17,662
Go back to what?

378
00:21:18,496 --> 00:21:21,562
Finally, I'm out! Hey!

379
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:22,829
Rukia!

380
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:24,796
Wait a minute,
did you hide
the crystal?

381
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:28,362
What are you talking about?
Don't you understand it yet?

382
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:30,996
A succubus is a demon
who shows you dreams.

383
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:34,296
In other words, my young friend,
I am the Snow Crystal!

384
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:35,829
I don't understand.

385
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,996
And besides,
I hate to
inform you,

386
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:39,896
this doesn't even happen
to be your dream!

387
00:21:40,496 --> 00:21:41,596
Then whose is it?

388
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:42,229
Ow!

389
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:43,462
What did you do that for!

390
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:44,896
GYAHHHHH!

What's going on?!

394
00:21:50,262 --> 00:21:51,062
Fur?!

395
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:53,262
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>Farewell, Ichigo!</i>

396
00:21:55,496 --> 00:21:57,629
Raaaghh!

397
00:21:58,096 --> 00:21:59,696
Beast!!

398

399
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,362
Wow. That was really scary.

400
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:07,262
Oh! It was me.

401
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:08,462
Heh heh...

402
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,347
<i>[Isshin]</i>
<i>Good episode to celebrate</i>

<i>Our sons have matured.</i>

<i>[Ryuken]</i>
<i>I'm not so sure.</i>

404
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,247
I wore this outfit,
thinking it was my son's design.

405

<i>But I must have been</i>

<i>Oh. I designed that.</i>
