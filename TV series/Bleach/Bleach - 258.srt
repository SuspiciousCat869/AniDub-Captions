1
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:12,033
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:19,766
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,533
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:27,466
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,433
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:38,473
Hey look at that, you
guys--it's a frog!

7
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,473
Ooow. What's wrong
with you? That hurt!

8
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:46,840
Zip it, alright, we
don't have time to go
chasing frogs.

9
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:49,240
Yeah I got it, I was just
looking, OK?!

10
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:53,040
Listen, I only dragged
you two to the World of
the Living because I
thought you'd help me

11
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:56,840
capture those Sword
Beasts quicker. Stop
fooling around. Let's go.

12
00:02:56,873 --> 00:03:01,140
Yeah, yeah, we know.
All right, what is it
you want now?

13
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:05,240
You forgetting something?
You'll probably have to
cut me loose if we're
splitting up.

14
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:08,140
You gonna behave?

15
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,573
Sure, no sweat. I'll
be on my best behavior.

16
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:17,573
It's close!

17
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:18,606
Let's go!

18
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Hehe.

19
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,940
Now roar, Zabimaru!

20
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:49,340
Now, Roar---

21
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,673
That all you got?

22
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:54,573
Not by a long shot!

23
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,240
You're not getting
away!

24
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:12,473
He's fast, I'll give
him that much.

25
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:17,040
Yeah, but Snake is over
in that direction. He's
finished!

26
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:21,540
Damn.

27
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:23,306
Coming your way, Snake!

28
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,306
Hey monkey! You're
not gonna believe it! I
caught a fish the size
of-

29
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,606
Uhh---

30
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,006
Out of the way!

31
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:42,973
Damn it! What the hell
were you thinking back
there?!

32
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:48,140
It doesn't matter, he's
injured now.

33
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:49,640
He couldn't have gotten
far.

34
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,206
Honestly--Every time I
unchain you, it's the
same thing.

35
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,640
You know where this
behavior will get you.

36
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,173
Come on, he's
gettin' away.

37
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:01,306
<i>Right.</i>

38
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,006
What's her problem? I mean,
it's not everyday I get to be
on my own. Why can't I have a
little fun?

39
00:05:19,573 --> 00:05:23,906
He's injured. In that
case, I can handle him
by myself.

40
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,506
<i>Hey!</i>

41
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,773
Dammit, they
found me.

42
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,740
So how about it?
You wanna give up?

43
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:33,540
I'm finally able to
choose my own path.
I won't give up my
freedom now!

44
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:37,773
Goin' solo, huh? Is
freedom really all it's
cracked up to be?

45
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:45,006
Damn straight. Being on
your own is great, kid.
You can roam wherever you
want, when you want.

46
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,673
It's a miracle
creatures like you and I
have even gotten a taste
of it!

47
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:50,373
A miracle?

48
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:55,206
Yup, that's right.
Come on, look the other
way, will you? As long
as I'm on the loose,

49
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,040
you get to be your own
man, right?

50
00:05:57,073 --> 00:06:01,506
Once you capture me, it's
right back on the leash.

51
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,540
You know where this
behavior will get you.

52
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:12,373
<i>Wait!</i>

53
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,473
Damn it, he got away
again!

54
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:17,806
What's the matter, why
were you just standing
here?!

55
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,706
Well, umm--

56
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,973
Don't tell me you just
let him get away...

57
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,373
Just shut up, okay? I
didn't let him escape.

58
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:30,773
I'm sorry, Snake. I don't
wanna do this, but it's time.

59
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:34,973
Hold on a minute!
I've been thinking
about it, and I'm not
so sure I wanna spend all

60
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,973
my time on the end of
that chain anymore!

61
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:41,506
You've been a hinderance since
the moment you were let loose,
now enough is enough, you hear
me?

62
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,906
I'm sorry, have I
been slowing you down?
What are you chomping at
the bit for? You wanna

63
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,206
finish this mission and
go back to being a regular
Zanpakuto?! You've gotta be
kidding me!

64
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,873
I'm finally able to choose
my own path. I won't give
up my freedom now!

65
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:58,873
I'm finally able to exercise
a little free will!

66
00:06:58,906 --> 00:07:01,840
I don't wanna be bound to
you anymore, I'm done!

67
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,373
You little-!

68
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:06,606
Leave it.

69
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,473
Give him a little space.

70
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,540
Oh man, I am so over
those two. I think
it's time for me to
strike out on my own-

71
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,240
Wait a minute, if
I'm on my own...

72
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:27,640
That's right! I can do
anything that pops into
my head now! All right!

73
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:34,906
Okay, what's the first
thing I wanna do as a
free snake?

74
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:48,306
I've always wanted to
stuff my face without
being told to mind my
manners!

75
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,906
It's a dream
come true!

76
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,773
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>you're doing?</i>

77
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,606
Can I help you?

78
00:07:58,373 --> 00:07:59,940
Uh, I think
maybe you can.

79
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:03,306
For starters, why don't you
pay for that food you're
about to wolf down?

80
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,306
Huh? Uh, what's the big
deal? I just wanted a
snack.

81
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,006
Now, beat it, girl, unless
you want me to beat you!

82
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,606
Excuse me sir! There's
a kid back here who's
trying to eat without
paying!

83
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,006
Pipe down. Renji and Monkey
will have my tail in a sling
if I get in trouble here!

84
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:19,806
What's going on?

85
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,706
This little weirdo is
getting into the rice
balls back here.

86
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,573
<i>What little weirdo?</i>

87
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:25,773
Huh?

88
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,006
Big jerk. What was
her problem, anyway?

89
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:58,306
Being your own boss is
awesome!

90
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,973
I should have broken away
ages ago--Monkey never lets
me have fun like this. I can
do whatever I want to, now.

91
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:05,206
[stomach growling]

92
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,606
Excuse me. One chicken
breast, please--and some
of your eggs.

93
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,873
<i>Right. One breast, and a</i>
<i>carton of eggs, coming</i>
<i>up!</i>

94
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,073
Hey! Give me that chicken
leg and some eggs!

95
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,473
Thank you very much!

96
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:22,306
And what can I get for
you today?

97
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,873
Hey! Old man! I said I
wanted a chicken leg and
eggs!

98
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,006
For you, pretty lady?
No problem.

99
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,640
Hey, lady, what are you,
blind? I was here first,
what are you cutting in
line for?!

100
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:33,940
... two breasts
as well...

101
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:34,906
You got it!

102
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,373
What gives here? Can't
these two even see me?

103
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,506
But then... how was
she able to?

104
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:49,973
Oh, is that so?

105
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:55,706
[stomach growling]

106
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,940
Looks a little thick for
soft serve.

107
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:01,706
<i>What is that?</i>

108
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,406
Man, I don't know what I'm
lookin' at, but it looks
absolutely delicious!

109
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:12,773
Karin, are you okay?
What's wrong?

110
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:15,673
Uh. Well, it's that
kid I saw back at the
store.

111
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:17,240
Hmm? From
the store?

112
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:20,106
Yeah! The weirdo in the
goofy outfit, remember?

113
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,840
Goofy outfit, huh?
Hmm. Where is he?

114
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,373
Oh, am I the only one
who can see him?

115
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,806
Hey.

116
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:33,506
Oh, great, that kid again.

117
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,140
You're just a kid
yourself.

118
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:37,640
Shut up, I am not
a kid, okay?!

119
00:10:37,673 --> 00:10:39,506
Hey Karin, who are you
talking to?

120
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,973
A weird little boy in a
goofy suit.

121
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:46,573
What the?! Who are you
calling weird!? And
anyway, you're more
of a kid than I am!

122
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:49,473
Hi there! Pleased to
meet you, Mister weird
little boy!

123
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:51,540
Hey! I'm over here!

124
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,206
Are you hungry or
something? You're
drooling all over
the place.

125
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,640
I'm not drooling, all
right? And it's none of
your business if I am,
anyway.

126
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:02,540
Okay, never mind, then.

127
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:03,940
Let's go, Yuzu.

128
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,973
Man, that girl's
a piece of work.

129
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,740
What? Oh, like I would
ever eat any of that!

130
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:21,206
That rice can sit there
and rot! I don't need
that jerk to give me
anything!

131
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:24,473
<i>Hey!</i>

132
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:29,140
What is it?

133
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:31,706
Well, I um...
thought that--

134
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,373
<i>You want some more rice</i>
<i>balls?</i>

135
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:36,473
What?! 'Course not!
Who'd want any of that
garbage?!

136
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:39,073
Please! I didn't even
touch the first one!

137
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,506
You might wanna work on
your story there, or at
least clean your face up
a bit.

138
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:52,040
Hey! Are you talking to
that boy in the goofy suit
again? Maybe he needs a little
more food in his stomach...

139
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:54,806
What for? I didn't know
ghosts even felt hunger!

140
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
Who said I was a ghost?

141
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:59,206
I'm actually a Zanpakuto.

142
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,773
A Zanpakuto?

143
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:02,040
Really...

144
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,140
Hey, I've got a
great idea, Karin.

145
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,606
Why doesn't the weird
little boy come stay at
our house for a while?

146
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:26,238
What's the matter?
Still worried about Snake
being on his own?

147
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:28,238
No, I know he'll
be okay.

148
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:29,705
So what is it then?

149
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:35,038
Gallivanting about,
acting like a Sword Beast
out there. It's pathetic.

150
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:37,472
You don't really
believe that.

151
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:39,105
<i>Renji!</i>

152
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:40,305
Ichigo!

153
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:45,372
I thought I was picking
up your Spiritual Pressure.
What are you guys doin' here?

154
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:50,105
Oh, you've probably heard
about it. Those Sword Beasts
are still on the loose...

155
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:52,372
I see you've got
Zabimaru with you.

156
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:56,172
That's weird. Isn't
she usually paired up
with that little snake kid?

157
00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:03,738
He ran off. But he's
probably still in the
area somewhere.

158
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:12,938
Sorry for the wait!
Easy does it now, it's
hot, so you'd better
try to drink it slow?

159
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:15,138
Hello! I'm sitting
over here!

160
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:17,805
So my dad and my brother
aren't around the house
right now...

161
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,538
But if they come back
I'm gonna need you to
find a place to hide for
a bit.

162
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:25,005
I'm pretty sure Ichigo
will be able to see you,
just like I can.

163
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:25,972
Who's Ichigo?

164
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,105
The brother I was
mentioning.

165
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:32,072
Sounds pretty crowded to
me, are they always around?

166
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,805
Yeah, sure, what's
wrong with that?

167
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:39,005
Man, that's lame. I
prefer to fly solo. I
can do anything I want
on my own.

168
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:41,738
Anything except buying
lunch I guess.

169
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:44,872
And for the record,
there's nothing cool
about being on your own.

170
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:48,705
Oh, please! I'm my own
man! It's like the coolest
thing, ever!

171
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:52,638
Sure. So, um... Where
are your mother and
father, anyway?

172
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:54,738
I never had any.

173
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:55,838
Oh?

174
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:01,972
Well of course I don't!

175
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,538
Why would I have a mother
or father?! I'm a Zanpakuto!

176
00:14:04,572 --> 00:14:07,205
Sorry... guess I
don't understand.

177
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,638
Here. I found some pudding
in the fridge you can have.

178
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:13,305
It's actually our brother's,
but I know how hungry you are.

179
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:14,705
I said I was over here!

180
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:18,138
Why is it always so
difficult for you to
figure out where I am?

181
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:28,805
Whoa, that was good! That
was the most delicious thing
I've ever tasted!

182
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:32,538
By the way, I don't think
you ever told us your name.

183
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,538
It's Zabimaru. What do
you two go by?

184
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:37,538
I'm Karin... and
my sister--

185
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:38,972
Hi, I'm Yuzu!

186
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:41,072
Got it, Karin and Yuzu.

187
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:44,938
All right! So do you
guys wanna play a board
game or something? Come
on!

188
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:46,838
Hey, yeah, still
over here!

189
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,705
Ah forget it, I can't do
this!

190
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:53,772
What? You're kidding
me, right?

191
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:55,338
Huh, maybe--

192
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:01,038
What the heck's the
point to all this? I
don't get it.

193
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:04,238
You know what, maybe
games and ghosts just
don't mix.

194
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:07,305
How many times do I have
to tell you, I'm not a
ghost!

195
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:11,772
So the rice cooker...
Seems to be all the rage
these days, right?

196
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:15,438
And I always have to buy
the latest and greatest,
you know? I buy everything--

197
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:18,872
You think this is more
his speed?

198
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:20,138
Seems like it.

199
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:23,305
He's so funny, we should
have popped on the TV
from the start.

200
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:29,605
Amazing.

201
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:36,338
Boy, this thing is cool,
how does it even work?

202
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:43,772
<i>I'm home!</i>

203
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:50,538
What ? Is everyone
sleeping in the living
room tonight?

204
00:15:57,172 --> 00:16:01,272
No, please, I'm stuffed,
I can't eat anymore...

205
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:02,738
<i>Hey...</i>

206
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:04,405
What?

207
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:07,972
What the hell are you
doing in my living room,
kid?

208
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:12,005
Sorry, who are you?

209
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:15,705
Ichigo Kurosaki!
Substitute Soul Reaper?

210
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:18,272
Substitute Soul Reaper?

211
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:21,005
Forget it. Look, I don't
what you're doing in my
house,

212
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:23,305
but Renji and the others
are worried about you.

213
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:26,805
Wait a minute, how do you
know about Renji?!

214
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:29,338
Doesn't matter, you're
his Zanpakuto, right?

215
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:32,272
They don't know where
you are right now.
Shouldn't you head back?

216
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:34,672
Buzz off, pal! It's none
of your damn business!

217
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:36,805
What's going on?

218
00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:41,438
You should have never
brought me to your stupid
house! I hate you!

219
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:44,338
Hey!

220
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:45,772
Wait!

221
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:46,838
Karin!

222
00:16:51,038 --> 00:16:54,205
Dammit! Everyone's
ganging up on me!

223
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:55,838
How's it going?

224
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:58,505
It's you.

225
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:01,238
I can't help but notice
you're still on your own.

226
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:03,905
How is your newfound
freedom suiting you?

227
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:10,505
Thanks to you, I was
able to buy some time and
recuperate.

228
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:15,272
Now all I have to do is
track each of you down,
one by one, and finish
you off.

229
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:18,672
That was your plan from
the beginning.

230
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,438
Not that it matters
though, I can handle you
alone.

231
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:26,705
Zabimaru!

232
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:31,072
Now, roar!

233
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,372
Sorry, were you aiming at
me?

234
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:52,138
All right, not bad.
Watch this.

235
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:55,305
You really don't wanna
underestimate me!!

236
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:05,338
What is this?!

237
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:20,005
What did I tell you?
I'm more than equipped
to deal with you, pal.

238
00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:22,205
Damn you!

239
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,938
<i>Zabimaru!</i>

240
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,472
It's her!

241
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:39,005
Karin!

242
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,272
Oh don't worry too
much, your little friend
here is fine for the
moment.

243
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:49,238
But if you don't
abandon your attack, the
girl will die. Do I make
myself clear?

244
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,638
Dammit.

245
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:58,738
Little fool!

246
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:16,638
Well, at least you
learned how to stand on
your own two feet before
the end...

247
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:19,072
Truthfully, you should be
thanking me.

248
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:25,272
You're a stubborn one,
huh?

249
00:19:25,305 --> 00:19:28,638
But no one's gonna rob
me of my freedom, I
don't care who you are.

250
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:32,638
Who the hell needs a
master to bow down to?!
Or Friends?!

251
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,772
You know, I actually
feel sorry for you.

252
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:42,472
Why be alone? Having
friends around you is
a privilege.

253
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:48,038
Hah, that's funny, kid.

254
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:51,372
Die!

255
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:08,338
Thanks for keeping him
busy, Snake. I think we
can handle this guy from
here. Right?

256
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:12,938
It may have taken some
time, but when all is
said and done it looks
like cutting you loose

257
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:16,038
was actually a good call.
Wouldn't you agree?

258
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,372
Karin!

259
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:32,205
There you are.

260
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:39,072
She's okay. She's
just had a long day.

261
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,538
Thanks a lot, kid.

262
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:45,272
Wait, you're going?

263
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:51,338
Do me a favor. I
don't want you telling
Karin or Yuzu anything
about me.

264
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:55,138
It's better that way.

265
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:07,372
What's wrong?

266
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:09,338
Where's Zabimaru?

267
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:11,038
What happened?

268
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:13,972
I thought you were gonna
sleep out here all night.

269
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:16,105
Ichigo, where's
Zabimaru?!

270
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:18,072
What are you talking
about?

271
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:38,505
Forget it.

272
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:43,772
Ready to go?

273
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:46,505
Yeah, I'm good.

274
00:21:49,638 --> 00:21:52,305
After all, I'm a
Zanpakuto, right?

275
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:56,172
Besides, Monkey would be
heartbroken if she didn't
have me around!

276
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:58,372
Ha. Dream on,
snakeboy.

277
00:22:01,005 --> 00:22:02,305
Let's go home.

278
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:48,268
Hey Yuzu, what happened
to the pudding I left in
the fridge?

279
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,735
<i>Huh? W-well---</i>

280
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:51,802
<i>Oh, uh... I think</i>
<i>dad ate it.</i>

281
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:55,435
What?! I'm gonna pound
the beard right off his
face!

282
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:57,402
<i>K-Karin?!</i>

283
00:23:57,435 --> 00:24:00,102
<i>Ah don't sweat it.</i>
<i>Dad's been wanting some</i>
<i>father and son time,</i>
<i>anyway.</i>
