1
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:11,966
Gunchotsurara!

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,933
You're about to find out
that each Espada signifies
an aspect of death.

3
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:25,333
Damn it all! Ryusenka!

4
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,844
Hunt...

5
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:20,044
...Tiburon!

6
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,177
[gasping]

7
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,044
[gasping]

8
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:56,344
You are powerless.

9
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,544
Your ice dragon is
drowned by a single
strike from a shark...

10
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:14,244
You are next...

11
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,144
I will avenge those three
you burned...

12
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,910
You will suffer!

13
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:30,077
How can you still be
alive?

14
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:37,610
After your sword release,
I didn't think that your
speed and range would
increase so quickly.

15
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,210
But I took a
few precautions.

16
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,277
An illusion made of
ice...

17
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,310
I can only use a move
like this once, so I held
off using it until I knew
it would have the maximum

18
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:54,410
effect on our battle.

19
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,044
Our strength is not...
to be underestimated.

20
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:19,010
It's clear to me now...

21
00:04:19,044 --> 00:04:25,377
As I might have expected
from a captain level Soul
Reaper, you have an ability
proportionate to your rank.

22
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,210
It helps you avoid
danger, but I hope you
don't think that's
enough to save you.

23
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:30,777
I don't need saving.

24
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:57,410
Ahhh! That's a lot of
destructive power!

25
00:04:57,444 --> 00:05:00,244
[trembling]
Huh?

26
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:01,777
You fool...

27
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,077
Keep your guard up! It's
bad enough I'm stuck here
with a big dumbass like you!

28
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,877
Oh, sorry about that.

29
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,944
Wait a minute! That's a
pretty harsh statement,
Captain!

30
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,944
That crack about my
ass wasn't very nice.

31
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:18,544
Getting nervous about
this fight? Halibel puts
on quite a show.

32
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,044
At this point, the enemy
must experience the pain
of her sacrifice.

33
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:26,477
<i>Sacrifice?</i>

34
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,777
That's right...

35
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:33,944
You're about to find out
that each Espada signifies
an aspect of death.

36
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:38,644
A mortal's death always
results from one of these
aspects.

37
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:44,844
The presence of these
aspects is the basis
behind each Espada's
abilities, beliefs, and

38
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,644
reason for existing.

39
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,744
Solitude...

40
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:52,144
Nothingness...

41
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,310
Despair...

42
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:56,377
Destruction...

43
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,577
Ecstasy...

44
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,877
Madness...

45
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,944
Greed...

46
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:04,910
Rage...

47
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,077
And Halibel signifies
the aspect of death
known as sacrifice.

48
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:14,577
Her lethal power
is unstoppable.

49
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,244
It will eventually
consume her opponent,
leading to his death.

50
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,544
[grunting]

51
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,244
[grunting]

52
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:29,810
Too weak.

53
00:06:29,844 --> 00:06:30,777
[gasping]

54
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:46,544
I'm already familiar with
that technique!

55
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:02,577
You've
misjudged me.

56
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,877
My Zanpakuto is extremely
powerful. In case you
didn't notice, its ice
and snow capability has

57
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,344
the strength to turn any
kind of water into a
lethal weapon...

58
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:16,510
Even if the water in
question happens to be
your weapon.

59
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:21,044
The truth is, if all you
can do is manipulate
water...

60
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:24,410
... then your attacks
will never be able to
reach me.

61
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,110
<i>They can... and</i>
<i>they will.</i>

62
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,977
If you want to see the
proof, then I'll show
you.

63
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,177
<i>Come on.</i>

64
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,244
What makes you think I'm
going to fall for your
taunts and close the
distance between us?

65
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:47,210
I told you that
you misjudged me.

66
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:48,944
That was your
first mistake!

67
00:07:55,844 --> 00:07:58,810
Actually, you're the one
who misjudged me...

68
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:02,310
Hirviendo.

69
00:08:06,744 --> 00:08:07,644
[gasping]

70
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:14,510
Yes, you realized that my
water could become your
weapon. But you ignored
the possibility that the

71
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:17,110
opposite could also be
true.

72
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,977
Your ice could become
my weapon.

73
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,710
Cascada.

74
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:57,110
Hmm?

75
00:08:57,144 --> 00:08:58,344
<i>Captain Komamura!</i>

76
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:01,744
Don't worry, Izuru.

77
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:05,577
It was quite loud,
but that shockwave was
nowhere near us.

78
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:09,577
Please hurry, and finish
treating everyone's
injuries.

79
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,744
Yes, sir.

80
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,977
The only problem is...
there are so many of them.
And they're hurt so badly.

81
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:22,777
There's no way I can get
this done in time on my
own.

82
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:30,210
This force field isn't
impenetrable, either.

83
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:34,310
If we're attacked, there's
only one thing standing
between us and them...

84
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:37,144
...And that's Captain
Komamura!

85
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,977
Come on out.

86
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,644
Do you really think that
I'm a big enough fool to
be taken in by another
one of your tricks?

87
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:07,144
That was close.

88
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:18,377
I was able to avoid it by
quickly putting up a wall
of ice.

89
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,777
But if I had gotten
caught by that force, I
wouldn't have lasted a
second.

90
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:28,710
I'm not gonna stand a
chance against her with
an ordinary defense.

91
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:30,310
<i>What are you doing?</i>

92
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,477
Are you taking a break?
Or did you come to your
senses...

93
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,910
... and decide it's
time to surrender.

94
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:46,477
So if the enemy's weapon
can be taken over and
become your own...

95
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,777
... then the opposite
is also true.

96
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,777
You must not think
I'm very bright.

97
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,877
Let me tell you, I was
well aware of that concept
before you decided to
lecture me.

98
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,044
Gunchotsurara!

99
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:10,077
We're about to see if
your technique is
effective or not.

100
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,477
Hirviendo.

101
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,644
Uh!

102
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,677
[yelling]

103
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:45,477
Thank you for the lecture,
Tier Halibel. Now allow me
to teach you something.

104
00:11:46,177 --> 00:11:50,744
Your greatest vulnerability
is exposed when you use your
strongest tactic.

105
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,444
For me, that's always
been an ironclad rule.

106
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,477
Very amusing.

107
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:07,510
Hm!

108
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:12,177
Well. It's about time.

109
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,544
I was beginning to think
you weren't going to take
this fight seriously.

110
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:18,677
Believe me, I'm serious.

111
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,110
And I seriously don't
intend to sit by and get
pounded.

112
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,910
Oh really? It seemed
like you were barely
putting any effort into it.

113
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:27,977
Hm?

114
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:35,610
[gasping]

115
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:39,577
Hm...

116
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,610
<i>Hey, that was close!</i>

117
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:47,277
If you had attacked me
like you really meant it,
I'd probably be dead by
now.

118
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,377
You had no intention of
cutting me from the start.
So why have you gone through
all this trouble?

119
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,344
We won't get anywhere if
all we do is guess each
other's intentions.

120
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:59,910
Things will only change
if one of us takes the
first step forward.

121
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,610
But that's where the
problem lies, doesn't it?
Neither one wants to give
away his strategy.

122
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:10,577
Both of us are waiting
for the other guy to make
the first move.

123
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,244
It's an interesting
situation when you
think about it,

124
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:16,444
because it all comes
down to a contest of
will.

125
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:19,844
Someone's going to have
to go first.

126
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,310
Getting impatient yet?
I'd love to see your Cero
about now.

127
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:31,144
All right, already.
Let's get this over with.

128
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,244
I'll take you up on
your invitation.

129
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,177
[gasping]

130
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:50,010
La Gota.

131
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,044
What is she planning
to do?

132
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:02,410
It doesn't look like she's
blindly launching a barrage
of attacks.

133
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:06,910
On the other hand, she
must be aware that her
technique is not strong
enough to finish me.

134
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:10,110
She doesn't appear to be
aiming right directly at
me.

135
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:11,844
<i>Shouldn't you look where</i>
<i>you're going?</i>

136
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:12,677
[gasping]

137
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,110
Dammit!

138
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:21,810
You seem to be most
confident when you're
running away.

139
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:27,510
Cero.

140
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:28,144
[gasping]

141
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:40,513
Cero.

142
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,247
[gasping]

143
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,080
[panting]

144
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:02,613
[panting]

145
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:05,847
No more running away
for you.

146
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:12,013
You fight such a timid
battle. Can't say I really
blame you, though.

147
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:16,480
You and I are both
waiting for the same
thing, aren't we...?

148
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:20,147
...Waiting for this
battleground to be
filled with water...

149
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,813
...so we can strike a
final blow.

150
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,147
So, what's
your point?

151
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,613
It just means one of us
will have to make a
decision.

152
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,447
We'll go in circles if
she and I continue like
this.

153
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,947
I've never attempted this
with Bankai before... but
I'll have to take the chance.

154
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,080
Have you come up with
some sort of strategy?

155
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:48,080
To tell you the truth,
it's not really necessary
for me to wait for water
to gather.

156
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,813
I'm ready.
[gasping]

157
00:15:58,147 --> 00:16:00,547
This Spiritual
Pressure...!
[gasping]

158
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,613
They're too
close to us!

159
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:15,413
<i>What's the matter?</i>

160
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,947
Did you hesitate because
you might injure your
allies?

161
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,513
None of your business!
You should try worrying
about yourself!

162
00:16:24,613 --> 00:16:25,813
You're right.

163
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:28,813
Either your allies get
sacrificed in this fight...

164
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:32,247
Or you yourself will
become the sacrifice.

165
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,547
Please, feel free
to pick an option.

166
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,980
What about this
option?

167
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:08,847
Sennen Hyoro!

168
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:19,013
Hm.

169
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:21,513
He trapped her!

170
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:24,947
[gasping]

171
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,547
Spare me. Is this
the best you can do?

172
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:37,213
What?!

173
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:49,580
Are you through? If you
don't have anything more,
then I guess it's my turn.

174
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:52,013
Dammit.

175
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:57,213
Cascada...

176
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,080
If I dodge her attack...

177
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:06,680
Uh!

178
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:15,113
...She'll hit the people
below!

179
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:19,013
All right.

180
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:20,780
Ryusenka!

181
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:34,113
Ahhhh!

182
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:37,613
Do you think you can stop
me, using a weak response
like that?

183
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:40,747
Check the volume of
the water in this
battleground.

184
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:45,047
It has already reached a
level that is more than
enough to finish you.

185
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:50,013
And believe me, this
Cascada won't compare to
anything you've seen before.

186
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,580
Ahhhhhh!

187
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,247
Captain
Hitsuguya...

188
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:04,447
Come on, Captain.
You can do it.

189
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:15,180
[grunting]
Ahhhhhhh!

190
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,113
Impossible! Captain
Hitsugaya!

191
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,247
To..

192
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,547
...shiro.

193
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,113
So, you were able to
shatter that Cascada. But
you've accomplished
nothing.

194
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:55,480
When we sacrifice
ourselves, it's to
further our tactical
advance.

195
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:58,280
You, on the other
hand, are willing
to fall in battle,

196
00:19:58,313 --> 00:20:01,147
simply to protect the
other members of your
squad.

197
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,547
My subordinates were not
simply defeated. Each one
left behind a marker for
me, a guideline telling

198
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,380
me how to carry on the
fight.

199
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:14,047
If I lose this battle...

200
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,180
The sacrifices of my
predecessors will have
all been for nothing.

201
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,680
I hold within me the
resolve of those who
have fallen before me.

202
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:41,380
I'm resolved as well.
Resolved to stop you.

203
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:44,813
I suffered a great deal
of damage, but I can
still fight.

204
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:51,313
Yes, but it's a waste of
time. You won't be able
to operate at full strength.

205
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:57,713
I'll trust that what
strength I have left,
will be enough to keep
you from victory.

206
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,680
Such wasted effort.

207
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:14,447
Hmm!

208
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,013
What's going on?

209
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:49,080
My Hyorinmaru is the
strongest ice and snow
type Zanpakuto.

210
00:21:49,613 --> 00:21:53,313
It allows me to weaponize
all kinds of water, from
any source.

211
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:58,980
The entire sky
is always...

212
00:21:59,013 --> 00:22:00,780
... under my control.

213
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:08,013
Hyoten Hyakkaso...!

214
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:49,777
That Barragan dude guy
sure is sure able to
memorize a lot of stuff,
isn't he?

215
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:54,343
<i>He didn't memorize it. He</i>
<i>was looking at his hands</i>
<i>the whole time he was</i>
<i>talking. He probably</i>

216
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:56,377
<i>wrote down all his lines</i>
<i>on his palms.</i>

217
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,443
Really?---In that case,
the guy's pretty stupid!

218
00:23:58,477 --> 00:23:59,610
<i>Just like you.</i>

219
00:23:59,643 --> 00:24:00,710
What?!!!
