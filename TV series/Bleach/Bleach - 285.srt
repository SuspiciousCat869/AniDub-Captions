Curse you, you ant! How dare
you defy a god in this way?!

8

Lord Aizen.
What is it?

<i>This isn't what I expected.</i>

16
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:29,395
I went through a
considerable amount
of effort to gather
all of you Espadas.

17
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:33,428
I never expected your strengths
to be inferior to my own.

Now then...
Are you all ready?

Whooa. The last Espada
has been taken out.

22
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:16,268
Aahh.

When you fight at this level,
you'll find that you become
exhausted quickly!

30
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:39,368
Take your mask off and put it
back on or your energy will run
out.

Wow! You think you

Big deal!
So you countered it!

Sorry pal, But I'm afraid
I'm just not mature enough
to hold back against a kid!

You relax. I'm gonna school

I wanna ask, Are you
avenging me? Heheh.

58
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:07,322
It sounds like you're
happy. Idiot.

59
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:12,688
This is happening because you
didn't listen when I warned you.

60
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:17,155
I'd never avenge someone
who behaves like that.

61
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,855
Hehe.

62
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:22,888
Hnh!

63
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:25,188
That kid needs to
be taught a lesson.

I'll knock him
down a peg.

Are you kidding?!
Stop that!

Haai!

69
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:04,028
Haa!

70
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:08,262
Let me show you how
you throw a punch!

71
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,128
Haauuughh!

72

Heeaaaa!

78
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:58,095
Sosuke. I think it's time we
settle things between us!

79
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:07,635
I really liked those old days,
Back when we were in the
Soul Society.

80
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:19,068
<i>Soul Reapers are</i>
<i>always in death's way,</i>

81
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:23,868
Because of where they exist,
and what they do.

82
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:28,735
<i>We all know we might die</i>
<i>tomorrow, or even today.</i>

83
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,568
<i>We may be talking one minute</i>
<i>and be dead the next.</i>

84
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:36,568
No one ever talks about it,
but we all carry that
thought in our minds.

85
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:40,568
<i>We all knew death better</i>
<i>than we really wanted to.</i>

86
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:44,935
<i>We saw death up close.</i>
<i>We felt death up close.</i>

87
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:51,102
Knowing death helped
us cherish each day.
It united us.

88
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:55,902
That's how we built such trust.
You traitor!

[anguished scream]
Graaaahhhh!

97
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:42,208
Sosuke, The reason I hate you
isn't that you gained our trust
and chose to betray us.

98
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,675
I hate you because you
made me hurt my friends!

99
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:48,008
You used me!

100
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:54,008
<i>And them! You destroyed us!</i>
<i>You ruined what we shared!!</i>

It's been boiling inside me for
a hundred years!

103
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:06,115
I can't live with this hate!
I won't go back to the old
ways until you're dead!

104
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:12,982
Don't be reckless
as you approach him.

105
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:15,448
He possesses great power.

106
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:20,115
If you approach him carelessly,
it will be the end of you.

Right, I know that.

Hold on!
Listen to me,

109
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:28,948

00:15:46,836 --> 00:15:48,969
Orihime, please
take care of him.

162
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:50,936
Okay. Leave it to me.

163
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:52,769
Now!

164
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:59,069
Hoooooaaaaaaa!

165
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:06,276
Bankai!

166
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,709
[mechanical scream]

167
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:20,343
Hihio Zabimaru!

168
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:27,843
No matter how hard you try,
it's useless!!

169
00:16:30,276 --> 00:16:31,876
Ridiculous.

170
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:39,009
Huh?!
What's this?!?

171
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:41,076
Hrrgghh!

172
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,343
Rukia! Chad! Now!

173
00:16:43,443 --> 00:16:44,043
Right!

174
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:46,443
Dance! Sodenoshirayuki!

175
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:49,876
Tsuginomai Hakuren!

176
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,209
Brazo Derecho del Gigante.

177
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:01,443
You shouldn't be so confident!!

178
00:17:08,816 --> 00:17:09,683
[Rukia]
Watch out!!

179
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:25,283
Huh?!!

180
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:32,649
Hmph!

181
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:35,816
How can he be
completely unharmed?

182
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:39,649
Your pathetic efforts to
hurt me will never work!

183
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:59,149
He's tough and has
plenty of power.
So what now?

184
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:03,716
There's nothing to
discuss. We have to
defeat this guy.

185
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,223
Yeah, you're right.

186
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:06,789
What are you
whining about now?

187
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:09,123
You look like
scared little ants!

188
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,089
Let's do this!

189
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,756
Hunh? Where did you go?

190
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:16,989
I see one.

191
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:18,823
And two!

192
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:23,989
Why do you three keep
moving around!?
Just hold still will ya!

193
00:18:25,623 --> 00:18:28,056
Ahhg! How annoying!

194
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:30,256
<i>I knew it!</i>

195
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:32,123
<i>He can't keep up</i>
<i>with our speed!</i>

196
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:35,789
We'll throw him off
and then strike!

197
00:18:38,056 --> 00:18:41,056
Where are you?
You can't hide from me!

198
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,256
There you are!!

199
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:50,156
Waauugh!

200
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,156
Hikotsu Taiho!!

201
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:05,196
I've had enough of you!

202
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:06,029
What!

203
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:07,529
Hrrngh!

204
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:16,529
Well that's one down.
Now then.

205
00:19:19,563 --> 00:19:20,563
Uahh!

206
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:30,929
That's two.
Just one left.

207
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:40,529
C'mon!
It's no use!

208
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,929
Well?

209
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:43,263
Huh?

210
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:44,863
Ohh!

211
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:49,929
<i>Do you think you can get</i>
<i>away from me by running?!</i>

212
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,503
Damn it!

213
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:10,936
Nn... Ngh...

214
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,103
Ah! Now I've caught you!

215
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:22,636
<i>You're the last one.</i>
<i>Catching you wasn't easy</i>
<i>'cuz you're so tiny.</i>

216
00:20:22,969 --> 00:20:27,036
Ha ha ha ha!
But now you're
all mine!

217
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:31,969
<i>Don't struggle.</i>

218
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:34,969
This requires a
delicate touch from me.

219
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:37,969
It's not easy to hold
you without crushing you.

220
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:45,969
Now,then, How exactly
should I kill you?

221
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,969
Hmm. Let me think.

222
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:53,036
Squeezing you into a
bloody pulp with my hands
just isn't that amusing.

223
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:57,836
I'm not coming up with a fun
way to kill you right now.

224
00:20:59,636 --> 00:21:02,503
Hey! How do YOU
want me to do it?

225
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,609
I'll kill you however
you tell me to.

226
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:13,409
Hey listen, I know I look
mean and scary to you, but I'm
really generous to weaklings.

227
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:16,043
Huh??

228
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,743
Sokatsui!

229
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:27,909
[overselling the pain]
Ow! That stung! That hurt!
That really really hurt me!

230
00:21:28,043 --> 00:21:29,909
You sure got me with that one1

231
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:32,876
<i>[gasp] That didn't</i>
<i>do a thing to him!</i>

232
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:36,709
That was so painful...

233
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:40,543
Guess it made me lose my grip!

234
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:45,143
Hah!

235
00:21:48,543 --> 00:21:50,143
<i>What incredible power!</i>

236
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:54,076
<i>I can't get back into my</i>
<i>posture because the wind</i>
<i>pressure's too intense!</i>

237
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:03,509
[panicked breathing]

238
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:05,883
No!

239
00:22:06,383 --> 00:22:08,549
Rukia!!

240
00:23:47,277 --> 00:23:49,010
<i>[Mashiro]</i>
<i>Go, Kensei!</i>

241
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,710
<i>That's it Kensei,</i>
<i>you go give it 'em!</i>

242
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:55,077
<i>[Kensei]</i>
<i>Hey, If you have the</i>
<i>energy to cheer me on,</i>
<i>Then give me a hand.</i>

243
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,910
<i>[Mashiro]</i>
<i>No way! I'm mature enough to</i>
<i>hold back on a kid like that!</i>

244
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:01,044
<i>[Kensei]</i>
<i>You brat!</i>
