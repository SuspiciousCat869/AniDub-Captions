1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,366
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,000
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:20,666
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,866
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper...
And dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,833
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:16,186
Scatter!

7
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:20,319
[grunting]

8
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:30,786
[fighting grunts]

9
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,253
Reign over the
Frosted...Heavens!

10
00:02:36,486 --> 00:02:37,986
[screaming]

11
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,719
Roaaaarrr!

12
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,019
Uh...huh?

13
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:44,053
Above you!

14
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:46,553
Damn it!

15
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:56,286
[grunting]

16
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,886
<i>He went that way!</i>

17
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:03,819
We've got him!

18
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,819
There he is!

19
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:10,486
[growling]

20
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:13,753
[gasping]

21
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:19,319
Hey, those are nice
weapons you got there.

22
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:22,319
How 'bout we compare
whose is stronger...
Yours or mine?

23
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:23,453
Kazeshini...

24
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:27,053
Alright, I get it. You
want me to stop playing
around!

25
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:35,053
[fighting and growling]

26
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:36,486
Get back here!

27
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:39,986
What in the--?
Damn you!

28
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,619
Huh?

29
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:49,019
[choking]

30
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:51,186
[screaming]

31
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,753
What the hell?

32
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,219
[gasping]

33
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:01,586
Well done, Kazeshini.

34
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:04,719
You're getting good at
cleaning up these messes.

35
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:06,186
Hmmm...

36
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:07,319
What's the matter?

37
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:09,819
Nothing.
Everything's fine.

38
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:13,286
<i>What? Is the fight over</i>
<i>already?</i>

39
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,486
Renji...

40
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,786
Sorry we're late,
Shuhei.

41
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:20,119
It happens all the time,
Monkey's big butt always
slows us down

42
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:22,019
she needs to stop
eating so much!

43
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,153
What are you
talking about?!

44
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:25,086
Don't worry about it...

45
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:27,753
The Sword Beast didn't
put up much of a fight.

46
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:32,453
Judging by their recent
activity, Sword Beasts
appearances seem to be
dwindling down.

47
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:34,353
Yeah, you're right.

48
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:38,986
Looks like we've been
effective. Perhaps there
are only a few of them
remaining.

49
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:43,519
Now that the reconstruction
of the Seireitei is coming
along, things are finally
getting back to normal.

50
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:44,553
Yeah.

51
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:46,853
You've been eating
nothing but sweets lately.

52
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,653
Look around, I don't
think that it's my butt
that's getting bigger.

53
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:52,419
Hey, I'm a growing boy,
so that makes it all
right.

54
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:54,819
Don't forget, you and
I together are one.

55
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:57,986
So the bottom line is,
if you're still growing,
so am I.

56
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:58,853
Hey...

57
00:04:58,886 --> 00:04:59,753
Hm?

58
00:05:00,753 --> 00:05:02,219
That Sword Beast
we caught...

59
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:06,219
... it returned to back to
Sword Form even though I
never struck a fatal blow.

60
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:07,853
Huh?!

61
00:05:07,886 --> 00:05:09,419
Are you sure?

62
00:05:09,453 --> 00:05:10,686
Hmmm.

63
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:21,553
[breathing heavily]

64
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,186
[screaming]

65
00:05:27,253 --> 00:05:29,419
[growling]

66
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:40,153
Nice moon tonight,
wouldn't you say?

67
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:44,086
Huh? No, it's too
bright in my opinion.

68
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:44,686
<i>Hey!</i>

69
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,586
Hm?

70
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:49,786
Now there's something
new under the moon.

71
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:53,519
So, I guess you guys
are buddies now?

72
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,919
It's only unusual in your
eyes. Our masters hang out
together quite often.

73
00:05:57,953 --> 00:05:59,986
Heh, yeah, whatever.

74
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:04,653
So what brings you here
tonight? Or did you
just come by to kiss
your master's ass?

75
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:09,853
What?! You'd better
watch your mouth, you big
slug! You're asking for a
beating!

76
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:12,119
Okay, okay. Don't
get so excited.

77
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:16,119
Hey! I thought we came
here to discuss
something.

78
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:17,886
[groaning]

79
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,853
The Sword Beast we
worried about has
appeared.

80
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:21,853
[grunting]

81
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:22,886
You're sure about that?

82
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,819
Absolutely.

83
00:06:24,853 --> 00:06:29,353
An incident happened
right in front of me.
Before I could attack, a
Sword Beast was sucked

84
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:32,319
dry of its Spirit
Energy and returned
to Sword Form.

85
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:34,086
It has to be his doing.

86
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:39,319
As we know, Sword Beasts
were originally Zanpakuto
that lost their masters
and became wild.

87
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:41,786
They each have a finite
amount of Spirit Energy.

88
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,286
They eventually lose
their power and disappear.

89
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,019
Huh. Looks like they're one
step away from extinction.

90
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,686
That's right.

91
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:52,786
Except this guy is able to
take Spirit Energy from other
Zanpakuto and make it his own.

92
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,153
So what? I'm able to
do that as well.

93
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:59,819
Yes, but what makes him
both unique and troublesome
is that he's one of those
rare Zanpakuto

94
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,186
who's able to surpass
his master's powers.

95
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:04,286
<i>Why is that so</i>
<i>troublesome?</i>

96
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,419
To him, his master was a
nuisance from the very
beginning. And now that
his master has died,

97
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:14,219
there's no-one around to
control the way he uses
his power.

98
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:16,286
[heavily breathing]

99
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,519
[screaming]

100
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,686
This isn't good.

101
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,686
He's dangerous.

102
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:31,019
Everything he comes in
contact with will be stripped
of its Spirit Energy and used
to make him stronger.

103
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:35,453
With that ability, it's too
big a risk for us to let Soul
Reapers face him.

104
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:37,486
We're going to have to
take action.

105
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,686
And if we're successful,
we'll be able to put an end
to the Sword Beast hunt.

106
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:45,919
And destroying him means
a grand finale for us.

107
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,386
Huh?

108
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:55,286
Waitress, let's have
another couple of bottles
of this sake!

109
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,019
Coming right up!

110
00:07:57,053 --> 00:08:01,919
Rangiku, too much alcohol
is poison to the body.

111
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:04,486
Yes, but too little
poisons the spirit!

112
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:09,419
That's right. What are
you worried about? It's
not like she's a child who
doesn't know when to stop.

113
00:08:09,453 --> 00:08:12,253
Haineko, you know
me so well!

114
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:15,419
The two of them never
change. Hm?

115
00:08:20,153 --> 00:08:22,086
Katenkyokotsu,
want some?

116
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:27,453
Well, don't hold back.
You can have some. We're
sharing the order.

117
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:28,919
Here you go.

118
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:31,519
Huh.

119
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:37,019
So, tell me something,
Nanao. Why did you bring
Captain Kyoraku's Zanpakuto
with you?

120
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:40,153
Why wouldn't I bring her
with me? We're part of the
same squad.

121
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,653
Where's her
partner?

122
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:47,086
She's back at the
barracks, drinking with
the Captain.

123
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:51,919
Oh? And you're all
right leaving the
two of them alone
together?

124
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:55,119
Come on, she's a
Zanpakuto. What is
there to worry about?

125
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:59,753
I'm so happy! It's so nice to
have a meal with everybody
once in a while.

126
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:02,319
I must admit you're
right. Even the food
tastes better.

127
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:05,019
Hey, Momo! What's
the problem?

128
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:07,353
You haven't had a drop
of sake this whole time!

129
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:10,986
I came here today to
enjoy the food, I wasn't
even planning to drink.

130
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:12,053
What?!

131
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:14,686
Are you telling me you
won't accept my sake?

132
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,419
Stop giving Momo a hard
time, Rangiku!

133
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:19,053
You don't have to defend
me, Tobiume.

134
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:20,886
Hold on, girls. Let's
all calm down.

135
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:23,819
I'll accept your sake,
how would that be?

136
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:28,819
What in the world is up
with you, Haineko, you're
behaving awfully level-
headed today.

137
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:32,086
Yes! Because I happen
to be a mature woman!

138
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:36,019
Ha! That's my Zanpakuto!
Very well said!

139
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,319
Maybe you could learn
something from her,
Rangiku.

140
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:40,319
What?!

141
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:43,319
[giggling]

142
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:44,819
Thank you very much!

143
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,453
[groaning]

144
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,186
Can you try and walk a
little? We're carrying
you.

145
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,553
Can't feel my feet!

146
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:55,053
She ends up like this,
just about every time we
go out drinking.

147
00:09:56,886 --> 00:09:57,819
Huh?

148
00:09:57,853 --> 00:09:59,153
Aren't you
girls coming?

149
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:02,186
We wanna enjoy the
night air a little bit
before we turn in...

150
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:05,153
Is it okay if I leave
Rangiku with you guys
for now?

151
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:07,819
Um.. Sure, that's fine.

152
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:12,086
We apologize, Momo. Is it
really all right for us
to go off on our own?

153
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:15,353
Don't worry about it.
It's nice to be able to
spend time with your
friends.

154
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:17,419
I think I'm gonna barf!

155
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:19,553
Come on, Rangiku! Try
to hold it together!

156
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,286
At least until we can
get you back home to
the barracks!

157
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:23,519
Oh, brother!

158
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:25,486
[groaning]

159
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,886
We're not far,
just hold on.

160
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,053
I told you we should have
cut her off!

161
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:37,519
<i>Thank you, Rangiku.</i>
<i>It was fun.</i>

162
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:02,619
Hm?

163
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:05,919
How sentimental are you,
staring at the moon!

164
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:08,086
We finally found him.

165
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,286
Let's get
to work.

166
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:24,137
[panting]

167
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,703
[growling]

168
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,237

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,770
[panting]

170
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:35,670
[grunting]

171
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:42,837
[panicking]

172
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:48,870
[screaming]

173
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,037
[roaring]

174
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,037
There you are.

175
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,503
I have to say, I never
figured you'd get this
big.

176
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:27,503
[growling]

177
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:31,470
I knew you were the one
behind this, Kirikaze!

178
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:35,703
You were the one out of
all of us that was the most
dissatisfied with your master!

179
00:12:35,737 --> 00:12:40,270
You've mis-used your
ability to transform!
You've entered the bodies
of other Zanpakuto, and

180
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:42,670
leached away all of their
Spirit Energy.

181
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:43,903
That's disgusting!

182
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:46,603
His size comes from all
the energy he's consumed.

183
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:49,370
He's cannibalized many
Sword Beasts.

184
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,803
That's all about
to end right now!

185
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,737
[grunting]

186
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:01,437
[grunting]

187
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,503
He turned himself
into mist!

188
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:07,203
What?

189
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,837
Scatter!

190
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,237
That was uncalled for!

191
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,670
Something had to be done,
or we all would have been
in peril. So quit
complaining.

192
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:22,270
Less talk, more action!
[yelling]

193
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,203
Watch it!

194
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,470
He's vulnerable
from the rear.

195
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:34,737
[roaring]

196
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:46,003
[grunting and roaring]

197
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:48,570
That's as far as you go!

198
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:52,737
As you're about to find out,
you don't have a monopoly on
leaching Spirit Energy.

199
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,570
I can do it
as well.

200
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,603
[roaring]

201
00:14:03,637 --> 00:14:07,037
How 'bout it? Now that
the tables have been
turned...

202
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,670
...you'll find it's not
such a pleasant
experience!

203
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:14,837
[struggling]

204
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,003
What is it?!

205
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:20,270
This... can't be!

206
00:14:20,303 --> 00:14:23,537
[struggling]

207
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,903
[growling]

208
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:26,737
Break the
connection!

209
00:14:27,403 --> 00:14:28,637
Bastard!

210
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:35,503
[screaming]

211
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:40,837
I'm running
out of time!

212
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,003
[screaming]

213
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:43,037
[squealing]

214
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,837
[screaming]

215
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,570
I've got you!

216
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,770
[growling]

217
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:17,237
[growling]

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,370
[roaring]

00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:28,970
[grunting]

220
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:36,003
[struggling]

221
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,203
Gonryomaru, are you all
right?!

222
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,870
Roar!

223
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:43,337
Uh... huh?

224
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:44,970
Above you!

225
00:15:45,003 --> 00:15:46,437
[roaring]

226
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,737
Damn it!

227
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:50,303
[grunting]

228
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:52,903
Renji!

229
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:58,337
Bakudo Number
Sixty three! Sajosabaku!

230
00:15:58,637 --> 00:16:00,770
[roaring]

231
00:16:00,803 --> 00:16:02,837
He'll transform
into mist.

232
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,670
I've put a
stop to that.

233
00:16:05,137 --> 00:16:08,070
[roaring]

234
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:10,570
Lady Rukia!

235
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,070
Don't get distracted.

236
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:15,203
You're right in the
middle of a battle.
Keep your guard up.

237
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:17,737
Come on Haineko. Let's
get you on your feet.

238
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,237
You know you're not
allowed to sleep on
the job.

239
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,070
Rangiku... Why
are you here?

240
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:27,170
Give us some credit. Did
you really think we didn't
know what was going on?

241
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:28,137
Uh!

242
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:32,170
Sorry, Momo.

243
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:35,670
You idiots! What were
you all thinking
coming out here?

244
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:40,037
Who's the idiot? What
did you think you could
do in your condition?

245
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,437
It's obvious you're all
reaching your limits.

246
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,270
[gasping]

247
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:46,537
All of you knew?

248
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,537
Right now, all you
need is to concentrate
on your enemy.

249
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,037
That's what we were
trying to do! This Sword
Beast's abilities are too
dangerous for Soul Reapers.

250
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,870
Way dangerous! You
wouldn't be able to
defeat him, that's why we
came without telling you!

251
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,903
<i>That's enough!</i>

252
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,270
After all this time, you
don't get it, do you?

253
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:08,070
Swords alone and Soul
Reapers alone will never
be enough!

254
00:17:08,103 --> 00:17:13,337
The only way this works
is when we're paired
together, and operate as
a team! That's when our

255
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:19,503
true strength reveals
itself! Didn't you learn
that lesson from what
happened to Muramasa?

256
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:24,270
We're only vulnerable
when we split our
energies in half.

257
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:26,237
Hm! Renji...

258
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,370
I hear you. We were
wrong to come here
by ourselves.

259
00:17:30,503 --> 00:17:35,237
[roaring]

260
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,403
He broke free!

261
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,937
Kazeshini...

262
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,170
I'm with you. Let's wrap
this up once and for all.

263
00:17:43,203 --> 00:17:44,403
<i>Are you ready?</i>

264
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:46,337
Yeah!

265
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:52,237
[growling]

266
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,637
Renji! He's goin'
after your friend!

267
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:00,137
Sodenoshirayuki!

268
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:05,037
Scatter!

269
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:09,170
Pierce!

270
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:21,537
Reign over the Frosted...
Heavens!

[growling]

272
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:29,703
My energy...

273
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:35,303
Sir Hyorinmaru! I can't do
anymore with the Spirit
Energy I have remaining.

274
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:37,303
You can't give up!

275
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:40,537
Remember what we told
you! You're not in this
fight alone!

276
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,003
Lady Rukia!

277
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,970
It'll be all right.
They can't separate us,
we're always together!

278
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,437
Yes.

279
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,603
Come, Sodenoshirayuki!

280
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:58,570
[growling]

281
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:00,803
Now dance,
Sodenoshirayuki!

282
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:02,970
Tsuginomai! Hakuren!

283
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,870
[growling]

284
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,170
Wabisuke!

Tobiume!

286
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,437
Kazeshini!

287
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,503
Haineko!

288
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,470
Raise your head...

289
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:21,003
...Wabisuke!

290
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,670
Now snap...

291
00:19:24,703 --> 00:19:25,870
...Tobiume!

292
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,370

[growling]

296
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,270
Now growl...

297
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:34,537
...Haineko!

298
00:19:37,037 --> 00:19:40,037
[growling]

[weaker growling]

00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:51,770
He can't turn into mist!
He's weakened considerably.

301
00:19:51,803 --> 00:19:52,370
<i>Renji!</i>

302
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:53,103
Hm?

303
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:54,537
You ready to do this?

304
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,470
Yeah.

305
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,003
We'll give you our
remaining Spirit Energy
as well!

306
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,670
Renji, this has been an
experience we will never
forget.

307
00:20:08,703 --> 00:20:11,837
<i>And you've been there</i>
<i>for us every step of</i>
<i>the journey.</i>

308
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,903
<i>Zabimaru...</i>

309
00:20:12,937 --> 00:20:15,503
We couldn't have dreamt
of anything more...

310
00:20:15,537 --> 00:20:18,170
<i>Not to mention, it</i>
<i>was a lot of fun.</i>

311
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:19,503
<i>You said it.</i>

312
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:28,303
Bankai...! Hihio,
Zabimaru!

313
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,270
[grunting]

314
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:34,637
Ahhhhhh!!!

315
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,603

316
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:42,237
Hikotsu! Taihooooo!

317
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,170
[struggling]

318
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,503
They've all disappeared,
just as we expected.

319
00:20:59,537 --> 00:21:03,070
By the time the Sword
Beast reached the limits
of its Spirit Energy,

320
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,903
all of our Zanpakuto
were so weak, that it was
completely impossible

321
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:09,503
for them to maintain
their manifested forms.

322
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:11,503
You mustn't feel
too bad for them.

323
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:15,537
Their appearance was
temporary and only happened
because of Muramasa's powers.

324
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:18,737
They knew they'd return
to sword form,
eventually.

325
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,970
That's right.

326
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:22,470
There's no need to feel
too upset...

327
00:21:22,503 --> 00:21:25,037
They've just gone back to
where they originally
came from.

328
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,070
They'll always be
there for us.

329
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:29,070
Right? Don't you feel
their presence?

330
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:30,170
Yes...

331
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:33,670
It's a very comforting
feeling.

332
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:37,137
Even though they no
longer appear in those
other bodies...

333
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,337
It's okay, because they'll
be with us wherever we are.

334
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,037
Uh...

335
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,303
Renji?

336
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:52,903
Huh? What is
it, Rukia?

337
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:53,870
Uhh...

338
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:57,070
Nothing. It can wait.

339
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:01,603
[chuckling]
Kind of a relief,
it's finally over.

340
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,170
Yes. Let's all go back
to the Seireitei.

341
00:23:44,932 --> 00:23:50,099
The producers are finally
done, messing around with
the plot. Thank you for
waiting, Master Ulquiorra!

342
00:23:50,132 --> 00:23:52,932
<i>Understood. Can I have a</i>
<i>cup of tea before we</i>
<i>begin?</i>

343
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:57,265
Absolutely! Ichigo's not
even here yet, so take
your time and enjoy
yourself!

344
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:58,099
<i>I am here!</i>

345
00:23:58,132 --> 00:23:59,265
Whaat?!
