[theme music]

2
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:11,953
-So how are you feeling?

3
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:12,453
-Renji.

4
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:17,826
Yeah, luckily, Orihime
was there to help out.

5
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,526
-Huh, even if you
were killed, you'd

6
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,193
probably come back to life.

7
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:24,193
-Just give it a rest.

8
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,913
Orihime worked on
Rukia, too, right?

9
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,246
Why is it taking
so long to recover?

10
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,546
-Aw, come on.

11
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,813
Don't you remember?

12
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:34,479
You should know the Rukia still
has a whole lot more than just

13
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:37,413
her recent injuries
to recover from.

14
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:39,546
She hadn't fully regained
her spirit energy

15
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,479
when this Bount madness started.

16
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:44,513
And she got sent to the
World of the Living.

17
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:46,179
After all of that,
I'm sure she's

18
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:48,913
going to need a little more
time to completely recover.

19
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:50,913
-Yeah, you're right.

20
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:54,713
So is the Seireitei
all cleaned up now?

21
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:56,513
-No, not yet.

22
00:02:56,546 --> 00:02:59,513
There are still buildings to be
repaired and other wounded yet

23
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,646
to be healed.

24
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:03,413
But we're making progress
and before long everything

25
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:06,746
in the Seireitei should
be back to the way it was.

26
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:09,146
-Good.

27
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:11,279
I hear the Soul Society
finally admitted

28
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:13,179
they were responsible
for the Bounts existence

29
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:14,346
in the first place.

30
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:15,546
-Yeah.

31
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,479
Damnit, that Kariya.

32
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:20,913
He wanted things to be as if
the Bounts never even existed.

33
00:03:20,946 --> 00:03:23,679
But now, no one will
ever forget about them.

34
00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:26,579
-Huh, you're always talking
like you know everything.

35
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:27,646
-What'd the hell you say?

36
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,279
-You heard me.

37
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:30,746
None of this would have
happened in the first place

38
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:32,779
if you hadn't sent
the Bounts here.

39
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,313
-Hey, how can you
blame me for that?

40
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:35,546
You were there, too, you know.

41
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,879
-Yeah, but don't forget
I defeated Gezelle.

42
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:42,479
In fact, my savi moto
hasn't been the same since.

43
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,346
-Which just proves you weren't
strong enough to start with.

44
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:46,479
-Oh, yeah?

45
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:48,446
Who the hell do
you think you are?

46
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,479
-Hey, what's the problem?

47
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,213
I'm just telling it like it is.

48
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:52,646
-Telling it like it is, huh?

49
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,746
You've got a lot of nerve
to suggest I'm not strong

50
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:56,446
enough just because
you might have gotten

51
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,313
a little more practice lately.

52
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:00,913
Don't forget, you're still
only a substitute Soul Reaper.

53
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:02,879
You're not even close
to being the real thing.

54
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:05,413
So don't go getting
carried away, you got it?

55
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,313
-All right, all
right, I'm sorry.

56
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:09,346
-Well, that's still
not good enough.

57
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,913
-Well, what do you expect then?

58
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:13,213
I'm Too tired to fight
about it with you.

59
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,579
-Eh, and acting like
defenseless little mouse

60
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:16,146
is just disgusting.

61
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:25,613
-What exactly is going on here?

62
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:27,846
-Hello, Captain Kuchiki.

63
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,146
-What excuse could you have
for making so much noise?

64
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:33,146
Could it be you have
forgotten you're

65
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:34,913
outside an infirmary
full of the injured?

66
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:36,513
-Eh, sorry, Captain.

67
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,213
As for you, Ichigo--

68
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:46,613
-Huh?

69
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:48,146
-If your business
here is finished,

70
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:50,413
then you should return to
the World of the Living.

71
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:52,813
You know full well that you
do not belong in this place.

72
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:00,546
-Thanks for getting me in
trouble with the Captain.

73
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:03,279
-Yeah, he's probably been
inside there listening

74
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:04,313
to every word we said.

75
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,779
-Shut up out there.

76
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:09,679
Are you both stupid?

77
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:11,546
-Hey, glad to see you're awake.

78
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,279
-Of course, I'm awake.

79
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,379
How am I supposed to sleep
with you two out there making

80
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:16,913
all that noise?

81
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:18,546
Well, if you won't
let me rest, I

82
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:19,913
guess I might as
well just get up.

83
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,646
It's so peaceful.

84
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,146
-Yeah.

85
00:05:36,513 --> 00:05:37,713
But it's strange.

86
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:39,479
Ive got to admit,
I never expected

87
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:42,279
to come back here to
this world a second time.

88
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:44,746
-You're always butting into
other people's business.

89
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:45,746
-Yeah.

90
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,813
Probably true.

91
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,446
-What are you
thinking about, Rukia?

92
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,179
-Every single one of
the Bounts is gone now.

93
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:58,646
The battle resulted
in so many casualties.

94
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,713
It's almost unimaginable.

95
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:02,913
-Yeah.

96
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:06,779
-Kariya was too hung up
on the Bounts' history.

97
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:09,146
He couldn't stand to see
things repeating themselves

98
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:10,779
over and over again.

99
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:12,279
-Do you think that's it?

100
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:13,746
-Yeah.

101
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:17,179
That's one of the problems
with living forever.

102
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:19,646
Despite the thousands
of years that passed,

103
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,446
he found that the
Bounts' situation

104
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,746
had remained stagnate.

105
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,779
For him, history had
always repeated itself.

106
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:29,646
It was something that
remained unchanged.

107
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:33,513
He wanted to break that cycle.

108
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:34,179
-Unchanged, huh?

109
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:40,246
I think I understand.

110
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,446
I'm being transferred to where?

111
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:44,679
-No, that's not it.

112
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:46,813
We're not going to transfer
you out or anything as extreme

113
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:47,879
as that.

114
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:49,646
We're just sending you to
the World of the Living.

115
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:51,679
Just like the first
mission you and I

116
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:53,613
went on together
back when you joined.

117
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,879
Do you remember that?

118
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:58,146
-Uh, actually, I, uh--

119
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:00,246
-You see, Kiyone, she
doesn't even remember going.

120
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,479
The experience was
so bad she probably

121
00:07:02,513 --> 00:07:05,213
erased it from her
memory, right Rukia?

122
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,846
-Well, uh--

123
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,779
-Nobody asked you
for your opinion.

124
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:11,479
So why don't you just go stick
your head in a fan somewhere.

125
00:07:11,513 --> 00:07:12,479
-What do you think I am?

126
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:14,213
An ostrich or something, Kiyone?

127
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:15,546
-Please, stop.

128
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:18,146
-You're new post is in
a four kilometer radius

129
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:19,579
around Karakura Town.

130
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:21,179
And it's just for one month.

131
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:23,413
With your skills,
it should be easy.

132
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:25,546
I'm sure you can handle, Rukia.

133
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,313
-Captain Ukitake.

134
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:27,979
-Oh, Captain.

135
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:29,279
-You shouldn't be out, sir.

136
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:30,446
You need your rest.

137
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,346
-Well, that's kind of you,
but I'm feeling good today.

138
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:36,246
And even though this is just a
month long assignment, Rukia,

139
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,879
I thought you might be a little
anxious about being sent out

140
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:42,679
on your own for the first
time, so I came to see you off.

141
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,646
-Thank you, Captain.

142
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,313
-Please, it's nothing.

143
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:49,313
Have you told Byakuya yet?

144
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:55,346
-Of course, I mean, not yet.

145
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,346
Captain Kuchiki hates
it when I bother him

146
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,279
with every little detail.

147
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,779
So I was going to leave
without saying anything

148
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:04,513
to him about it.

149
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:05,413
-I see.

150
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:09,613
It's all right.

151
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:11,446
If that's what you
really want to do,

152
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,579
then I support your decision.

153
00:08:13,613 --> 00:08:15,846
I'll tell Byakuya for you.

154
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,246
So go with a clear conscience.

155
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:19,913
-Thank you, Captain.

156
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:26,746
That's right.

157
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:31,346
That's how all of this began.

158
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,313
Until I met Ichigo,
I thought that life

159
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:38,746
was a straight line
stretched on forever.

160
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:43,679
-I believe that the
future is a straight line.

161
00:08:43,713 --> 00:08:47,413
-I hereby promote Squad 11,
sixth seat, Renji Abarai

162
00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:48,779
to the position of
Lieutenant Squad 6.

163
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,779
Congratulations,
Lieutenant Abarai.

164
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:58,779
-Yes, thanks. , I
mean, it is an honor.

165
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:01,279
I humbly accept Lieutenant.

166
00:09:01,313 --> 00:09:04,446
-You don't have to be so
formal with me, Renji.

167
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:07,613
-Well, are you happy, Renji?

168
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:09,413
You've gotten yourself
one step closer

169
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:12,513
to Captain Kuchiki his sister.

170
00:09:12,546 --> 00:09:14,279
-And just what does that mean?

171
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:16,513
-Isn't it about time
you talked to her?

172
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:20,879
When are you going to get over
your insecurity with Rukia?

173
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:23,846
Even though she some
kind of royally now,

174
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,613
you can approach her since
you've become a lieutenant.

175
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:29,746
You haven't spoken for 40 years.

176
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,746
Don't you think it's about time
you patch things up with her?

177
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:35,179
Remember the way you two
used to run around together

178
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:36,813
in the Rukon District?

179
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:40,379
-If you want to do that, then
I suggest that you hurry.

180
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,779
Rukia has just been assigned
a month-long station

181
00:09:42,813 --> 00:09:45,579
in the World of the Living, and
she scheduled to leave soon.

182
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:48,313
-Oh, no, you've got
to hurry up, Renji.

183
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:50,479
-No.

184
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:53,213
I won't be officially promoted
until the ceremony a month

185
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:53,913
from now anyway.

186
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:57,179
So I'll wait until after that.

187
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:58,679
I'll surprise her
with the news that I'm

188
00:09:58,713 --> 00:10:03,379
a Lieutenant after
she comes back.

189
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:08,479
-If history repeats itself,
and moves in a circular path,

190
00:10:08,513 --> 00:10:11,679
then believing that
whatever force is turning,

191
00:10:11,713 --> 00:10:16,613
it is perfect, is all we
can do as we move ahead.

192
00:10:19,846 --> 00:10:24,279
Pushed along by forces
beyond our control,

193
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:26,746
waiting for the
blade to be swung.

194
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:00,672
-Where am I?

195
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:04,039
-Ah, you've regained
consciousness.

196
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:07,572
-You're Yoshino.

197
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:09,139
-No, she's not Yoshino.

198
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:11,839
This is Ran Tao.

199
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,872
-Ran Tao.

200
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,872
And this is Ran Tao's
underground hideout.

201
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:21,806
-How did I get here?

202
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,439
-I carried you here, so that the
Soul Reapers wouldn't find you.

203
00:11:27,472 --> 00:11:30,439
-But you, you were with
Ichigo and the others.

204
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:34,972
So why?

205
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:37,006
Why would you help me?

206
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,639
-Who knows?

207
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:41,206
-Where's Kariya?

208
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,006
-Kariya's dead.

209
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:46,706
-I see.

210
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,739
-The Jokaicrust powers backed by
the strength of all the Bounts,

211
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:58,039
and you extended
Ichigo Kurosaki.

212
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:03,906
Your friends will
eventually come

213
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:06,572
to hate you just as mine did.

214
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:09,439
Where is the logic in
defending such disloyal people?

215
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:11,072
-I protect them
because I want to.

216
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,906
With them, I'd
even risk my soul.

217
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:18,806
-Kariya.

218
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,739
-If the ultimate
fate of the Bounts

219
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:47,039
is to die out in the end, Then
I will have to accept that.

220
00:12:47,072 --> 00:12:49,706
-That's true.

221
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,906
-You are free to go,
but you should stay here

222
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,739
until your wounds have healed.

223
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,472
-And what about you?

224
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,639
-I don't think there's anything
left for me to do here anymore.

225
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:00,006
After all this
time, I don't plan

226
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,006
to return to the Seireitei.

227
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,072
But I would like to hear
the story of the last Bount.

228
00:13:06,106 --> 00:13:09,706
-Well then, I'm going to return
to the World of the Living.

229
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:11,606
I've left things here
Yoruichi's hands,

230
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,939
so there should be no problems.

231
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:15,539
-Before you go.

232
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:17,972
-What it is?

233
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,739
-Would you do me a favor,
and tell Ichigo thanks

234
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:23,739
for stopping Kariya.

235
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:26,139
-Definitely.

236
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:26,772
I'll tell him.

237
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:33,739
-Huh?

238
00:13:38,906 --> 00:13:40,806
-Good, looks like no
one's spotted me so far.

239
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,139
Here goes.

240
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:43,739
-What are you doing here?

241
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:44,039
-No!

242
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,806
You.

243
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,572
How dare you sneak up on
me like that, you big jerk.

244
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:49,806
-Don't change the subject.

245
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,539
Were you trying to
sneak into Rukia's room?

246
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:52,772
-Oh, so what if I was?

247
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:55,139
It's none of your
business anyway.

248
00:13:55,172 --> 00:13:57,606
And there's nothing wrong
with me going to see her,

249
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,772
because Rukia and I are
destined to be together.

250
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,606
You're lucky I stopped
you before you tried it.

251
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,472
Byakuya would have sliced
you up into ribbons

252
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:06,139
if you knew you were trying
to get into her room.

253
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:07,672
-Shut up.

254
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,539
After what you did, I'm
not about to take advice

255
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:11,139
on the likes of you.

256
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:13,739
You guys left me behind when you
went off to fight the Bounts.

257
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:15,672
And by the time I
caught up with you,

258
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:18,906
it was all I never had a
chance to get in on the action.

259
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:20,872
-That's what you wanted?

260
00:14:20,906 --> 00:14:22,806
You seriously wanted to
get in on the fighting?

261
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,072
-Of course.

262
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:26,606
Why do you think I came to the
Soul Society in the first place

263
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,939
if not to battle?

264
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:30,006
-OK, I get it, but
it's too late now.

265
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,006
Look, the Senkaimon
is just about ready,

266
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,539
and we're all leaving for home.

267
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,506
-Oh, yeah?

268
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,572
Are you just going to
leave Rukia behind?

269
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,739
-She isn't ready to travel yet.

270
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:41,572
She'll be staying here until
she recovers from her injuries.

271
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:43,839
-Typical Ichigo,
leave if you want,

272
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:46,506
but I'm going stay
here by her side.

273
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:48,072
You let go of me.

274
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:52,739
-I'm not about to leave you
here to cause more trouble, Kon.

275
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:53,739
-This stinks.

276
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:56,606
Why couldn't this stupid
body have more power?

277
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,539
I would have destroyed the
Bounts single-handedly.

278
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:02,006
And I would have beaten
the Soul Reapers, too.

279
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,006
And my precious Rukia would
fall in love with me for sure.

280
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,039
-Everyone wants more
power, like Kariya.

281
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:14,106
He gained all that power,
but it corrupted him.

282
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:17,572
In the end, he had no choice
but to destroy himself.

283
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:23,039
Kariya wanted the
power to change fate.

284
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:29,139
And what I thought I wanted,
seems to have changed.

285
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:31,706
-Ichigo.

286
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:34,039
Look what I just got, Ichigo.

287
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:35,939
It's the brand new
Bad Shield series.

288
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:37,939
It just came out.

289
00:15:37,972 --> 00:15:39,439
-Yeah, so?

290
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,806
What's the big deal?

291
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,072
-How can you say something
like that, Ichigo.

292
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:46,972
You told me the TV version
was like your favorite show.

293
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:49,806
-Oh, I forgot.

294
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,772
-I like Bad Shield, Keigo.

295
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:53,639
-I wasn't talking to
you, Mizuito, now was I?

296
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:55,906
-Aren't the actors the best?

297
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:56,972
My favorite one is--

298
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:59,772
-Now that I've returned to
the World of the Living,

299
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:02,072
I can see how
things stay the same

300
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:04,939
and repeat themselves
over and over.

301
00:16:04,972 --> 00:16:05,806
The world changes.

302
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,739
It turns.

303
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:10,906
Each time the sun touches the
moon, it takes a new shape.

304
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:11,939
-Next question.

305
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,972
What's your favorite snack food?

306
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,139
-Probably cake.

307
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:16,672
-Fascinating.

308
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:18,672
And do you prefer your
cake to be whit inside

309
00:16:18,706 --> 00:16:19,306
with pink frosting?

310
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:20,906
-Yes, how'd you know that?

311
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,772
-And based on your answers
to this compatibility test,

312
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:27,606
the perfect match for
you romantically is me!

313
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,506
-That was rigged.

314
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:30,939
-Mind your own business.

315
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:32,206
-I am.

316
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:34,006
-See you girls later.

317
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,439
-Wait.

318
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:36,872
Mind if I walk home
with you, Ichigo?

319
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:39,106
-Actually, I have
to go someplace.

320
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:40,072
-Oh, OK.

321
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:43,039
See you tomorrow, then.

322
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:45,939
-The one thing that does not
change is my powerlessness.

323
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:53,806
-Ah, so you're back
again, are you?

324
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:54,972
-Huh?

325
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:59,639
-Sadly, though, the
boy is gone now.

326
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:01,472
-Yeah.

327
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:03,472
I can see spirits.

328
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:04,972
I can touch them.

329
00:17:05,006 --> 00:17:07,106
I can talk to them.

330
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,839
That's all.

331
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:14,006
-So I'm afraid you brought
that toy airplane for nothing.

332
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,439
-That's all right.

333
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:18,706
It's just something I
had in my closet anyway.

334
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:21,539
They often just
disappear like this.

335
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:24,106
I never know what
happens to them,

336
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:28,006
but sometimes they leave behind
bloodstains that only I can see

337
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,639
and the faint smell of fear.

338
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:37,072
No matter how strong I
get, I can't protect them.

339
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:40,572
This realization cuts my
heart like cold steel.

340
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:47,072
Things are revolving again.

341
00:17:47,106 --> 00:17:49,539
-Oh, there you are.

342
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:51,906
I'm right over here.

343
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:52,906
-Oh, hello.

344
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:53,906
-I'm sorry I'm late.

345
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,439
-That's OK.

346
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:58,572
Three dogs and two cats
passed by so far today.

347
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:00,006
-Wow, that's a lot.

348
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:00,939
So what else happened?

349
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:02,139
Did you talk to them?

350
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:04,506
-Yes, and they were
really disobedient.

351
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:06,772
The big brown on peed
on the telephone pole,

352
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:08,839
even though I told him not to.

353
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:13,039
-Here.

354
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:14,606
I brought you some flowers.

355
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:16,439
-For me?

356
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:16,739
Oh, wow.

357
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:22,706
-They're pretty, aren't they?

358
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,172
-Um-hmm.

359
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:26,772
Oh. [crying]

360
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:27,106
-Hmm?

361
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,072
What?

362
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:32,139
What is it?

363
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:35,439
Will you come back
here again tomorrow?

364
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:37,006
-It's turning.

365
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,772
Sure, if you want me to.

366
00:18:38,806 --> 00:18:39,872
I'll come back again tomorrow.

367
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:40,872
Fate is a millstone.

368
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:42,006
You can count on it.

369
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,572
-Thank you, Mister.

370
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:44,839
-And we are the grist.

371
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:49,572
Until then, no more crying.

372
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:50,539
OK?

373
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:51,539
There's nothing we can do.

374
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,772
I wish for strength if I cannot
protect them from the wheel.

375
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:09,706
And I wish for enough strength
to be able to shatter fate.

376
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:16,106
Is that my power?

377
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,906
To shatter fate?

378
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:21,939
Or will my power consume me
in the end, like Kariya's did?

379
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:23,539
Hmm.

380
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:26,039
What's the use
worrying about it?

381
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:28,439
This power that I have to
protect the people that

382
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:31,706
are around me, it is a
good thing, isn't it?

383
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:33,506
-What's the matter, Ichigo?

384
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,572
-Oh, Captain Ukitake.

385
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:38,872
-Looks to me like you have
something on your mind.

386
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:40,506
-I do.

387
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:42,806
I'm wondering why Kariya
was so obsessed with gaining

388
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,839
all that power?

389
00:19:44,872 --> 00:19:46,572
-Hmm.

390
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:49,906
Kariya seemed to view all of
history as a vicious cycle.

391
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,672
He probably thought
he could use force

392
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:54,139
to sever it and stop
the cycle, so things

393
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:56,806
wouldn't keep
repeating themselves.

394
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,172
I don't know if
that's right or wrong.

395
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:02,772
-Things repeating themselves
wouldn't be so bad

396
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:03,839
if you had friends.

397
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,072
-It's not the kind
of question that

398
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,606
can be answered
quite that easily.

399
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:19,639
-Is history something that
repeats and remains unchanged?

400
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:22,506
Or does it evolve with
the passing of time?

401
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:25,872
And if it does repeat, should
we try to break that cycle,

402
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:28,439
or resign ourselves to it?

403
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:35,772
-Ichigo.

404
00:20:35,806 --> 00:20:37,839
Everyone's here.

405
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:38,706
-Hi, Ichigo.

406
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:42,939
-Ichigo!

407
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:46,806
-Ah, I cannot believe we came
all the way to the Soul Society

408
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,006
just to turn around and go
back to the World of the Living

409
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,006
without even getting a souvenir.

410
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,039
-If you like it so
much, then stay.

411
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:57,839
-How dare you talk
to me that way!

412
00:20:57,872 --> 00:20:59,706
-I guess the time
comment has come.

413
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:01,939
-Let's go home, Ichigo.

414
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,072
-Yeah, all right.

415
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,472
-And it turns again.

416
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:30,739
Thank you, Ichigo.

417
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:32,706
Until we meet again.

418
00:21:57,072 --> 00:21:58,039
-Well, well.

419
00:21:58,072 --> 00:22:00,439
What a charming little city.

420
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:22,768
[theme music]

421
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,254
-Hey, everybody, Kiyone here.

422
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:54,287
I wasn't around much
in the Soul Society.

423
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:56,054
But I'll play a big
part when we get back

424
00:23:56,087 --> 00:23:57,021
to the World of the Living.

425
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:59,754
-Sorry, but starting
with the next episode,

426
00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:02,187
I'm the main character, so you
won't be appearing anymore.

427
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:03,654
-Who the hell are you?

428
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:05,321
-My name is-- hey,
wait a minute.

429
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:20,887
-We're back from our trip.

430
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:22,287
Where have you been, Captain?

431
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:24,287
-We were lost in Kusajishi.

432
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:26,721
-It was such a blast,
we couldn't leave.

433
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:28,054
-So were are the Bounts?

434
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:29,754
-Ichigo defeated them already.

435
00:24:29,787 --> 00:24:31,221
-I see.

436
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:34,554
Well, I guess I'll just
fight Ichigo in that case.

437
00:24:34,587 --> 00:24:37,587
-Uh, Captain, he returned
to the World of the Living.

438
00:24:37,621 --> 00:24:38,721
-What?

439
00:24:38,754 --> 00:24:40,054
That bastard.

440
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:41,887
The next time I see
him, I'll kill him

441
00:24:41,921 --> 00:24:43,621
without even saying hello.

442
00:24:43,654 --> 00:24:47,287
-Ichigo, it was a good idea to
leave without saying goodbye.
