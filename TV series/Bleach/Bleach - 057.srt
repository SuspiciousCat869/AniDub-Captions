00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:47,826
-You've never seen such
a fighting technique

3
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,126
before, have you?

4
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,960
It's unique because
it combines elements

5
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:52,926
of both Hakudo and Kido.

6
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,293
It's something I created myself.

7
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:58,526
You should feel
privileged, actually.

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,026
This technique has only
been perfected recently,

9
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,493
so you're the first victim of
it in actual combat conditions.

10
00:02:04,526 --> 00:02:07,960
It doesn't even have a name yet.

11
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:09,426
-Wrong.

12
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,860
It has a name.

13
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:13,426
-What did you just say?

14
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,226
-It's called Shunko.

[music playing]

16
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:39,626
-The fact is I
really didn't want

17
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,593
to have to resort to using
this technique against you.

18
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:51,060
You better be careful, Sui-Feng,
because to tell you the truth,

19
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:54,493
even I can't control
this technique very well.

20
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,360
-[laughing] I guess you're
wondering why I never showed

21
00:03:16,393 --> 00:03:18,893
you this technique
before, Sui-Feng.

22
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:22,126
Is that it?

23
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,493
I didn't want to
tell you because I

24
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:25,726
knew it was too dangerous.

YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN): Stop.

27
00:03:40,426 --> 00:03:44,060
You are not ready to use
this technique yet, Sui-Feng.

28
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:48,260
SUI-FENG (VOICE OVER): She-- she
used a Hanki Sosai against me.

29
00:03:48,293 --> 00:03:49,760
She canceled mine
out by crushing

30
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:51,960
it the Kido of the same
quality and strength,

31
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:53,926
but with opposite spin.

32
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,860
And yet she did it so
quickly and effortlessly.

33
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:00,060
It shouldn't have
been so easy, not

34
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:02,760
against my Kido
speed and pressure.

35
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:03,860
Tell me why.

36
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:06,226
I should have
surpassed you by now!

37
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,093
I'm stronger than you!

38
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:12,660
Why are you still standing?

39
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:14,593
I should have the power by now.

40
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:18,060
A century of isolation should
have made you weaker than me.

41
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:20,060
How can you be dominating me?

42
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,126
It's not right.

43
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Why are you standing
there in front of me

44
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:24,626
as if you were my master?

45
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,093
How can it be that you
still prevail over me!

46
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,060
Tell me the answer, Yoruichi!

47
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:36,093
-Look up there, Shaolin.

48
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,493
Do you see her?

49
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:40,493
There, the Princess
of the Shihoin Clan.

50
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:42,226
She's the one who
will someday become

51
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,293
the Commander of the
Punishment Force.

52
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:48,393
You will serve her, as all
of us in the Feng Clan do.

53
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:51,960
We devote everything
of ourselves to her.

54
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:53,160
-Everything?

55
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,660
-Everything.

56
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:58,793
That is our fate
and our obligation,

57
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:01,393
and it is now yours as well.

58
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:06,226
From this day on, you
have a new name, Sui-Feng.

59
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,326
You will live only
to serve that lady.

60
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,693
SUI-FENG (VOICE
OVER): I remember

61
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:13,626
the first time I met her.

62
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,493
It was like meeting a goddess.

63
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:21,160
For generations, the Feng Clan
has been a low-ranking house,

64
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:24,726
its members making their living
as executioners and assassins.

65
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,260
For us, strength is everything.

66
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,426
Any clan member who can not make
it into the Punishment Force

67
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,393
is cast out by the family.

68
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:41,593
-I give up!

69
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,793
-You should go back
to doing drudge work.

70
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,560
SUI-FENG (VOICE
OVER): I just knew

71
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:57,560
I wanted to become stronger,
stronger than anyone.

72
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,293
Force leader.

73
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:22,926
-You there.

74
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,626
What's your name?

75
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,526
-My-- my name is
Sui-Feng, Commander.

76
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,226
-Not bad.

77
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,226
SUI-FENG (VOICE OVER): From
that day on, she was my idol.

78
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,360
I worshipped her.

79
00:06:38,393 --> 00:06:42,693
She was everything
I wanted to be.

80
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:46,326
Then seven years after I
joined the Force came the day

81
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,260
I was named to the Commander's
personal guard squad.

82
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:53,193
Sui-Feng reporting
for duty, Commander.

83
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:56,726
-Ah, you've already heard
about your promotion, I see.

84
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,860
-Yes.

85
00:06:57,893 --> 00:06:59,593
And I assure you,
Commander, that am ready.

86
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:01,393
I won't hesitate to lay
down my life for you

87
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:02,393
if the occasion should--

88
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:04,560
-Oh, don't be so formal.

89
00:07:04,593 --> 00:07:06,560
Stop with the "Commander" stuff.

90
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,826
Just address me with
something simple.

91
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,093
How about Miss Yoruichi?

92
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,060
-Commander, that's impossible!

93
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:15,426
I could never show such
disrespect for you.

94
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,193
So, instead of that, would
it be acceptable if I just

95
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:29,093
call you Lady Yoruichi instead?

96
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:30,226
-Ah!

97
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,693
How'd you get to be so uptight?

98
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:33,426
It doesn't matter.

99
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,426
Call me whatever you want.

100
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,793
I didn't have you transferred
over here for your manners.

101
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:39,660
I wanted you for your skill.

102
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,726
What we call each other
isn't very important.

103
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,560
Are you prepared to work
hard here, Sui-Feng?

104
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:47,893
-Yes!

105
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,493
INSTRUCTOR (VOICE OVER): You
will give your life for her,

106
00:07:49,526 --> 00:07:50,460
Sui-Feng.

107
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:53,493
You live only to
serve the Commander.

108
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:54,893
SUI-FENG (VOICE OVER): Yes, sir.

109
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:59,126
I live only to
serve Lady Yoruichi.

110
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,126
I accepted that
without hesitation.

111
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,793
I was happy.

112
00:08:09,393 --> 00:08:11,393
-How have you been
doing, Sui-Feng?

113
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:13,693
Are you getting used to your
role here with the Force?

114
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,326
-Uh, yes, Commander.

115
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,526
I am.

116
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
-Hmm.

117
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:21,293
What is that buzzing
sound I'm hearing?

118
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:22,993
Buzz buzz.

119
00:08:23,026 --> 00:08:24,093
Buzz buzz.

120
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:25,426
Buzz-- ah-ha!

121
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,026
Oh, I thought it was
a bee, but it was just

122
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,826
all those thoughts
inside of your head.

123
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,026
-I-- I suppose.

124
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,326
-And I thought we were through
with a "Commander" stuff.

125
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,826
-Yes.

126
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,260
I forgot.

127
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:41,193
-Hmm?

128
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:44,926
-Um, Lady Yoruichi, I meant.

129
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,460
-See?

130
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:47,460
That was easy.

131
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,160
Come on, follow me!

132
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:49,826
-What?

133
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,160
Hey, wait a minute!

134
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:55,693
-When I tell you
to come with me,

135
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:57,693
I expect you to
run, and run fast.

136
00:08:57,726 --> 00:08:58,660
-Yes, ma'am.

137
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,426
-Hmm.

138
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,426
You're going to be fine.

139
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,526
SUI-FENG (VOICE OVER): I
was happy to serve her.

140
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,593
Even in the middle of battle,
I was filled with happiness.

141
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:51,626
-OK, let's pull out.

142
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,326
SUI-FENG (OFFSCREEN): Please
forgive me, Lady Yoruichi.

143
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,426
-Hmm?

144
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,360
-I'm here to protect you.

145
00:09:57,393 --> 00:09:59,893
It's not supposed to be
the other way around.

146
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:00,826
-Hah!

147
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,226
We work together.

148
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,860
It's not about who did what.

149
00:10:03,893 --> 00:10:05,426
-But I wasn't strong enough.

150
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,593
-Look, if I say it's
OK, then it's OK.

151
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:09,493
Do you understand?

152
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,526
-Yes, but Commander--

153
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,360
-Hmm?

154
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,293
-I mean, yes, I understand.

155
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:19,560
Thank you, Lady Yoruichi.

156
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:21,093
-Well, good.

157
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,826
-How can I protect Lady
Yoruichi when I can't even

158
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,426
defend myself?

159
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,126
I must do better!

160
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:42,393
-Sui-Feng, listen to me.

161
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:44,093
I'll teach you the
way to wield a sword.

162
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,960
When you're ready, you'll
step in, like this.

163
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,993

-What an empty threat.

All your boasting and bragging
will not change my mind,

330
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:36,660
and it will not change
Rukia's fate, nor your own.

You want my Bankai?

Careful what you ask for, fool.

333
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:44,226
You will die, but
it's a thousand years

334
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,026
too soon for you to
die by my Bankai.

What is that light that I saw?

339
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:43,226
Is this the true power of your
Zanpakuto, Ichigo Kurosaki?

340
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,226
-That's right.

341
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,826
When I swing my sword, all
of my spiritual pressure

342
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,426
is absorbed by Zanpakuto.

343
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,160
Then it gets released again
in a super high density

344
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:58,093
beam that gives it an
incredibly amplified swing.

345
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:00,093
That's Zangetsu's power.

346
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,826
You know, the funny
thing is I never actually

347
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,660
aimed it at anything before.

348
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:10,293
Until just now, I wasn't
really sure how to fire it.

Kisuke Urahara told me, I can
only teach you the stances.

Now I finally know
what he meant.

351
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,560
He was telling me that there
was only one who could really

352
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:31,460
teach me how to use Zangetsu,
and that was Zangetsu himself!

-At last you are able to
fire a shot at will, Ichigo,

The destructive
power of an attack

greater when you

357
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,593
know its name than
when you do not.

Hear this and
remember well, Ichigo.
