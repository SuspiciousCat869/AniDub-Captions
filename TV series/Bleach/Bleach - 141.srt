00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:46,696
-You don't know the
pressure I'm under.

166
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:47,196
-Huh?

167
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:49,329
-What is it?

168
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,429
-That's weird.

169
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,896
I wonder why Ichigo's
chair fell over.

170
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:54,529
You think he came
to school today?

171
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:56,029
-No way.

172
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,796
Someone must have just
bumped into it or something.

173
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,496
-Hm.

174
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:00,829
I guess.

175
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:04,629
But don't you think it's
strange that he, Chad, Orihime,

176
00:09:04,663 --> 00:09:08,529
Rukia, and Uryu were all absent
from school on the same day?

177
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:09,096
-Hrrh!

178
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,329
Wait, that's it!

179
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:13,263
They're all doing something
fun together. [bawls]

180
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:14,696
And we've been left out.

181
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:16,596
The cool kids are
deliberately snubbing us.

182
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:18,496
-Don't put me in the
same group as you.

183
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,029
-What's that?

184
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:22,396
MIZUIRO: And besides--

185
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,596
-Huh?

186
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:27,029
-If you take a minute
to think about it,

187
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:29,529
we're not the only ones
who have been left out.

188
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:30,463
-Oh, really?

189
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:31,896
-Well, what do you mean?

190
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:33,429
Like who?

191
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:36,963
-Off the top of my head, the
first one who comes to mind

192
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:38,463
is Tatsuki.

193
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:38,963
-Uh.

194

MIZUIRO (VOICEOVER): If you
take a minute to think about it,

we're not the only ones
who have been left out.

196
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:03,596
Off the top of my head, the
first one who comes to mind

197
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:04,596
is Tatsuki.

199
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:20,463
-Keep up your pace.

200
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:21,929
Don't slack off now.

201
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:22,929

00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:27,396
-Uh.

203
00:10:34,396 --> 00:10:36,363
Tatsuki.

00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:37,363
[gasps]

205
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:41,296
Uh.

BOY: Where were you
aiming at, you idiot?

207
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:49,763
Go get the ball.

208
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:03,196
TEACHER: Arisawa,
what's the holdup?

209
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:03,829
-Nothing, sir.

210
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:16,029
ULQUIORRA (VOICEOVER):
Don't forget.

211
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:19,863
You can say goodbye to one
person and one person only.

212
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,261
[static noise]

213
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:57,961
[beep]

214
00:11:57,994 --> 00:11:59,028
-That's strange.

215
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:02,561
I can't reach Orihime
in the Soul Society.

216
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:05,728
Maybe there's some
spiritual wave interference.

217
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:06,728
[sighs]

218
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:21,028
HACHIGEN (VOICEOVER): I'm sorry.

219
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:23,994
This is the best I can do.

220
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:26,128
My ability doesn't
actually involve

221
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:28,594
healing someone's
illness or injuries.

222
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:31,594
It's more a type
of time reversal.

223
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:34,461
In order to use my
techniques most effectively,

224
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:37,894
I must have precise knowledge
of what conditions to reverse.

225
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:41,394
This is critical to
success or failure.

226
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,494
Right now, Ichigo's
spirit energy

227
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:46,494
has intermingled with the
spirit energy absorbed

228
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:48,061
from the Arrancars' attacks.

229
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:51,694
In his current condition,
this is the best I can do.

230
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:54,594
In order to get him through
this as quickly as possible,

231
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:56,428
he needs to be isolated.

232
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:58,361
It's important that
he be separated

233
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:02,094
from beings like ourselves since
we all have spirit energy that

234
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,128
is similar to the
kind found in Hollows.

235
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:09,194
Being around us will only slow
down or reverse his recovery.

236
00:13:09,228 --> 00:13:12,228
So my advice to you is
to take him home and let

237
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:14,494
him rest for as
long as necessary.

238
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:19,394
That would be the best
treatment for him right now.

239
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:21,761
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Yes, I understand.

240
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:28,494
Ichigo.

241
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:31,128
I wonder who those people were.

242
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:34,628
And even more importantly,
what kind of power

243
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:38,361
were you trying to
obtain from them?

244
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:41,061
Why did the Arrancars retreat
in the middle of the fight?

245
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:43,661
It doesn't make sense.

246
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:46,361
There are so many things
I don't understand.

247
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,928
All right, Ichigo
will be safe here.

248
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:54,194
I better go check on Orihime.

249
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,094
KARIN: We shouldn't
be bothering him--

250
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:55,694
-Huh?

251
00:13:55,728 --> 00:13:56,561
KARIN: --Yuzu.

252
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:58,194
We were supposed
to let him rest.

253
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:00,628
YUZU: But, Karin,
what if he wakes up?

254
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:01,594
We should be there.

255
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:04,128
He should see somebody
he knows, right?

256
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:05,061
KARIN: Maybe.

257
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,028
[both gasp]

258
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:14,894
-Um, Rukia, would it be OK
if we eat dinner in here?

259
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:17,028
-Hm, of course.

260
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:18,828
I don't see why not.

261
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:21,628
I'm sure Ichigo would like that.

262
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:22,794
-Rukia--

263
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,661
RUKIA: Hm, what's wrong?

264
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:26,128
-Aren't you hungry as well?

265
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:27,861
It's dinner time.

266
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:31,261
I made a special
dish just for you.

267
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:32,661
RUKIA: Wow, what's this?

268
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:33,494
-A surprise.

269
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:34,794
Smells good, huh?

270
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:36,694
-Yeah, but I was on my way out.

271
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:37,894
I have to go somewhere.

272
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:39,061
-Oh, really?

273
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,961
-I'm not very hungry just now.

-Wasn't that your tummy talking?

00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:48,028
-Your tummy knows
more than you do.

278
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:49,294
You are hungry.

-[chuckles]

280
00:14:51,394 --> 00:14:54,828
I guess I will have
some, Yuzu, since you

281
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,661
went to the trouble
of making it.

282
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:57,228
YUZU: Yay!

283
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:58,328
Thanks, Rukia.

284
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:00,494
Come on, Karin, let's
bring the trays in.

285
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:01,061
KARIN: Huh?

286
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:04,261
Oh, sure, Yuzu.

D-ah!

Mr. Kurosaki, I didn't
know you were still up.

00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:21,594
-Good evening there, Rukia.

292
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:23,594
How's my idiot son doing?

293
00:15:23,628 --> 00:15:24,628
-He's fine.

294
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:26,328
Of course, he's still sleeping.

295
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:28,328
-Ahh, don't worry about him.

296
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,694
It's his own stupid fault he
got beat up by some bullies.

297
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:32,828
I mean, how pathetic.

298
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:35,961
They're not even
from his school.

299
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:37,694
-I'm sorry, Mr. Kurosaki.

300
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,061
I mean, this only
happened because I

301
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:42,028
got him involved with
those delinquents.

302

-What are you
talking about, Rukia?

The kid's old enough
to know better.

304

I'm just glad that you're safe.

ISSHIN: [coughs] Got it.

310
00:15:52,928 --> 00:15:56,061
Hey, Rukia.

311
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:57,928
It's pretty cold
out there tonight.

312
00:15:57,961 --> 00:16:00,194
So if you're planning to
go somewhere, be careful.

313
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:02,828
And be sure to bundle up.

Hm.

Hm.

323

I decided to say
goodbye to you, Ichigo.

There are actually a
lot of other people

00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:25,128
I wanted to say goodbye to as
well, like Tatsuki, Chad, Uryu,

326
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:27,428
Rukia, and a bunch of others.

00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:29,794
But I'd get in trouble if I did.

328
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:31,361
So I had to choose.

329
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:36,994
[breathing heavily]

330
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:37,694
YUZU: Hrm.

331
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:40,361
-[gasps]

332
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:40,861
Uh.

333
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:51,894
Oh, uh, hm.

334
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,694
Oh, I get it now.

335
00:17:53,728 --> 00:17:57,861
I guess Yuzu and Karin wanted
to be close to you tonight.

336
00:17:57,894 --> 00:18:00,194
You haven't been
around much, so they

337
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:01,728
must have really
missed you a lot.

338
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:03,494
That's so cute.

339
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:05,261
They brought their
plates in so they

340
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:08,294
could have dinner
next to your bed.

341
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:09,228
Huh?

342
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:12,628
Wait, I just realized--
your bedroom!

343
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:18,994
Come to think of it,
this is the first time

344
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:25,028
I've ever been in your bathroom
by myself since I've known you.

345
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:27,528
It has your scent.

346
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,861
[soft music]

347
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:03,028
[sobbing]

348
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:05,028
Just look at me.

349
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:07,994
The truth is, I can't
bring myself to do it.

350
00:20:08,028 --> 00:20:09,494
[sobs]

351
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:14,461
I'm so ashamed of myself.

352
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:17,028
It's my last moment
with you, and I'm

353
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:27,361
trying to-- when I
think about it, Ichigo,

354
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:30,661
there were so many
things I wanted to do.

355
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,861
I wanted to become
a school teacher.

356
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:35,928
I wanted to become an astronaut.

357
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:37,794
I wanted to be a baker.

358
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:39,961
I wanted to go to a
bunch of donut shops

359
00:20:39,994 --> 00:20:41,961
and ask for one of everything.

360
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:44,928
I even wanted to stop the
ice cream man and truck,

361
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:50,394
and tell him to give me one
of everything he had as well.

362
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:55,494
Haah, I wish I could have had
five different lives instead

363
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:56,428
of one.

364
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:58,161
Then instead of
one town, I could

365
00:20:58,194 --> 00:21:00,694
have been born to a family
in five different ones.

366
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:03,694
And each one would have fed me
a lifetime of different foods.

367
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:07,928
And I would have grown up to
have five different careers.

368
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:16,928
And in every one
of those lives, I

369
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:20,128
would have fallen in
love with the same person

370
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:21,594
five different times.

371
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:29,061
Thank you, Ichigo.

372
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:35,594
Goodbye.

373
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,399
[theme music]

374
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:44,133
WOMAN: Hm.

375
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,500
I'm not getting through.

376
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:47,433
MAN: Maybe you should get a new
cellphone, like mine, he-he.

377
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,633
It's awesome.

378
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,300
Look, it's got all the
latest bells and whistles.

379
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,700
WOMAN: But it's ugly as hell.

380
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:52,733
MAN: You're crazy.

381
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,100
And you can download
music on this one.

382
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:54,800
WOMAN: Oh, really?

383
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,633
How's the reception?

384
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:56,967
MAN: I have no reception!

385
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,500
WOMAN: Don't talk to me anymore.
