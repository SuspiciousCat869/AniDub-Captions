1
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:11,933
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:19,600
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,066
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:27,233
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:30,366
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:25,251
[laughing]
So the only defense left
for you is running away?!

7
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:41,418
So, You run away and hide,
then attack me from the
shadows? You fight just
as dirty as you look!

8
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:47,485
Fight Dirty?!
What's wrong with that?
Does it really matter in
a life or death situation?

9
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,885
I prefer to look my
opponent in the eye.

10
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:54,151
You think I care how you
fight!?

11
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:59,885
I am a Zanpakuto whose
sole aim is to harvest as
many lives as I can.

12
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:02,918
I have no interest in
how my master fights.

13
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:07,551
I was under the
impression that you and I
had a mutual understanding.

14
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:12,985
Through communication.
We formed a relationship
where we were a synergistic
unit.

15
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:29,851
I can't say I know
about other Zanpakuto!
But I know who I am. I
exist to reap lives!

16
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:33,818
That was the only thing
I was responsible for in
this relationship.

17
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:38,318
Is that so? Then you
have left me no choice.

18
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:43,551
If killing you means losing
my Zanpakuto, then so be it.

19
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:47,785
I just realized something.
I don't like you.

20
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:51,118
That's fine with me.

21
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:53,551
I feel the same...

22
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:14,985
So Sword Beasts are
attacking the Rukon
District?

23
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:19,718
Yeah. They've teamed up
and are on a rampage!

24
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:22,251
We better hope we're
not too late!

25
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:24,485
Enough talk!
Keep running!

26
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:33,351
What was that?!

27
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:37,451
Well, speak of the devil!
Looks like we found one!

28
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,685
You're wrong.

29
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:41,351
That's not a
Sword Beast.

30
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:46,918
Could that be--?

31
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:48,718
Shuhei... isn't
that your Zanpak---

32
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:52,651
Just go on without me,
guys. I'm the on he's after.

33
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,018
Hey!

34
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:56,318
Come on, you guys. We've
got to keep moving. Let's go!

35
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,585
Hold on!

36
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:04,951
Not too bad.

37
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:08,351
Again with your surprise
attacks. You don't quit.

38
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:14,318
That's right. I'm sorry,
but until we settle our
fight, I'll do whatever
it takes to get you.

39
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,751
I'll pursue you to the
ends of the earth, to
the death!

40
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,618
Reap Kazeshini.

41
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:23,351
Haah!

42
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:29,685
Izuru, what was
that all about?!

43
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:32,318
That was Shuhei's
Zanpakuto Kazeshini,
wasn't it?

44
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:35,018
Has it joined up with the
Sword Beasts?

45
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:36,985
No. It's not
like that!

46
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:42,785
Shuhei's Zanpakuto,
Kazeshini, is unlike
any other Zanpakuto.

47
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:48,285
Even after the Muramasa
incident was resolved, he's
continued to act independently
of Shuhei.

48
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:54,218
Kazeshini is a Zanpakuto
that reaps lives.

49
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:58,851
Shuhei says that once it
targets someone, it will
keep pursuing that person
until the fight is settled,

50
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:01,351
Even if that target
is his own master.

51
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:06,551
So, he's willing to take
his own life to kill?

52
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:12,418
Really? Then Shuhei sure
is stuck with a difficult
Zanpakuto to deal with.

53
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:14,718
Yeah.

54
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:18,985
So! As usual, you keep
running and hiding from
my blade!

55
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:22,785
And as usual you refuse
to stand where I can see
you and fight.

56
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:27,918
Always trying to pull a
surprise attack on people.
I don't like the way you do
battle.

57
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:32,818
I don't care! The only
goal that I have is to
reap your life!

58
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:36,918
It's meaningless to
debate our methods for
achieving that goal!

59
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:41,051
Haah!

60
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:44,585
Bakudo Number Sixty-two!
Hyapporankan!

61
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:47,118
Ahhh!

62
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:50,151
Bastard.

63
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:52,551
Now, you've finally got
what you want!

64
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:54,585
Well, it's a start.

65
00:06:56,118 --> 00:07:02,951
Just know this, until you
agree to attack me head-on,
I have no intention of
settling our fight.

66
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:08,085
You're always pushing to
have us fight your way.
I just hate it!

67
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:14,418
We agree then. We see
this the same. We both hate
the way each of us chooses
to fight.

68
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,918
[grunting]

69
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:30,885
Hey, sorry I'm late.

70
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,751
What's up, Shuhei? How'd
things turn out?

71
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:38,318
Okay for now. What's
the situation here?

72
00:07:38,518 --> 00:07:44,751
We were too late. By the
time we got here, all the
Sword Beasts had already done
their damage and disappeared.

73
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:48,885
We have got to go and
hunt them down before
they go and do this again!

74
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:55,218
I heard that you attacked
your master again...

75
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:00,618
Give us a break, will ya?
Because of you and your
thirst for blood,

76
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:05,285
the Soul Reapers are
worried that all of us
are going to start acting
as crazy as you and cause

77
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,151
a bunch of
trouble for them.

78
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:10,951
Why do you keep on trying
to take the life of your
master?

79
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:13,618
Still under Muramasa's
mind control?

80
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,418
That's none of your
damn business!

81
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:18,285
It's not our business!?

82
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:25,518
I don't really care what it
is that you do, but just stop
stirring up trouble of all of
us in the process.

83
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:27,851
We are all
Zanpakuto.

84
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:33,485
If you want to isolate
yourself, we won't stop you,
but we won't help you, either.

85
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:40,185
That sounds fine to me!
Because I have no intention
of asking you guys for help,
so good luck out there!

86
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:43,985
He's so gloomy.

87
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:45,885
And look who's talking!

88
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:52,951
[yelling]

89
00:08:58,451 --> 00:08:59,318
Stop!

90
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:03,618
Well! Fancy meeting you
here!

91
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:08,851
[grunting]

92
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:10,285
You're mine!

93
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:13,585
Huh?!

94
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:17,685
I'm done wasting
time with you.

95
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:19,818
Come back here!
Hey!

96
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,351
Why is it so important to
you to protect people you
don't even know?

97
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:36,385
[breathing hard]
Dammit, I lost him.

98
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:37,685
<i>[screaming]</i>

99
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:42,985
What the-?

100
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:44,551
Help me.

101
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,751
Huh? You again?

102
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,551
You're not him.

103
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:49,651
<i>Wait!</i>

104
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:50,451
Huh?

105
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:52,385
Who are you?

106
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:53,885
What?

107
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:58,718
You're definitely not one
of my kind. Are you one of
the Soul Reaper's dogs?!

108
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:03,918
You call me a Soul
Reaper's dog? You've
got some nerve.

109
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:10,585
[baby sounds]

110
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:18,185
[struggling]
You're not one of them,
are you? You're different.

111
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,518
Don't lump me in with
those Sword Beasts.

112
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:25,385
I beg of you. Please
look after my baby.

113
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:27,851
Say what?

114
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:31,518
[cooing]

115
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,285
No way, kid.

116
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:37,518
I'm not a Sword Beast
or a nanny. I'm a Zanpakuto.

117
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:41,051
I have no interest in
anything, except for
reaping lives.

118
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:42,518
[cooing]

119
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:47,418
[cooing]

120
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:51,585
Damn. This kid's blood would
probably rust my blade...

121
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,385
Huh?

122
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:56,485
[cooing]

123
00:10:56,518 --> 00:10:57,751
Let go.

124
00:10:57,785 --> 00:10:59,818
[cooing]

125
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:01,018
Move!

126
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:06,351
[choking back tears]

127
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:07,618
Uh-uh!

128
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:10,485
[sobbing]

129
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:12,218
Knock it off!

130
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:13,651
<i>I hear a baby!</i>

131
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:15,518
<i>It's coming from</i>
<i>over there!</i>

132
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:18,851
Come on! Stop it! Don't
cry! Shut up, please?!

133
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:20,685
You leave me no choice!

134
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:32,818
Listen, kid. The fact that
you're still alive is a miracle.
Be grateful for that, now, go
disappear somewhere.

135
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:36,085
Man, you need to
learn to take a hint.

136
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,151
[cooing]

137
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:45,551
Ahhhh, stop following me,
you pesky runt! I've had it!
Time to lose you, you rugrat!

138
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:53,185
[giggling]

139
00:11:53,218 --> 00:11:59,785
Oh, so you like hangin'
around like that. Well then
just hang in there, they'll
find ya. So long!

140
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:09,818
[struggling and crying]

141
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:17,385
[struggling and crying]

142
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:19,918
<i>Ha-ha ha-ha ha hah!</i>

143
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:23,251
What the hell? What have
you got on your back?

144
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:27,285
Kazeshini, he looks
so good with you!

145
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:30,551
Dammit, woman,
I'll kill you.

146
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:34,985
Hey, kid. Laugh.
I said laugh.

147
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:37,618
What a gloomy kid.

148
00:12:37,651 --> 00:12:40,451
Well, you're not exactly
Mister Sunshine, yourself.

149
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:43,151
So you and this baby have
become buddies?

150
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:47,385
You should've just left
the kid somewhere. Like
the middle of a lake.

151
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:48,518
