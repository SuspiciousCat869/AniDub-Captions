leave something to be desired.

00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:37,188
We still don't know
who killed Aizen,

165
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:39,055
and you troublemakers
are certainly

166
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:42,088
prime suspects, and an
important source of information.

167
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:44,222
Wouldn't want to kill you
until we've investigated.

168
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,755
There's one other reason.

169
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:53,555
Though your efforts may have
been clumsy, the fact is, you

170
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:57,622
and your friend here were trying
to save one of my officers.

171
00:10:57,655 --> 00:11:01,122
Honor would never let me stand
by idly and watch you die.

172
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:02,122
[wind blowing]

173
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:17,982
[shouting]

174
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:18,714
-Sir!

175
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:20,814
No Ryoka back there either, sir!

176
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,614
-Very well.

177
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,514
This area is secure, then.

178
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:27,314
Hey there, you men go and
search the Higashi Nijo area.

179
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:30,880
And look sharp now, these
Ryoka are damn sneaky.

180
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:33,747
Thank you for reporting in.

181
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,047
Come to think of it though,
I've never seen the two of you

182
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,914
before.

183
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,014
Are you new here?

184
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,314
-Yes, sir.

185
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,780
We just joined up this last
term, as a matter of fact.

186
00:11:42,814 --> 00:11:45,314
I'm Orihime, at
your service, sir!

187
00:11:45,347 --> 00:11:46,880
-And I'm Uryu.

188
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:50,447
I'm glad we could
be of help, sir.

189
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,147
-Mm.

190
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,014
Mm.

191
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:53,580
Mm.

192
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:54,080
Mm.

193
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:03,847
You know, you should come over
to my place tonight, my dear.

194
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,780
-Huh?

195
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:06,747
-Yes, it would be
quite an honor.

196
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,480
At least for you, that is.

197
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:10,180
No doubt you've
heard of me before.

198
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:12,047
I'm Toshimori Umesada,
and this year I

199
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,847
made 15th season on
a 20 seat Squad Nine.

200
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,414
I'm not one to boast,
but I'm clearly

201
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:17,814
going places in my squad.

202
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:19,514
So what do you say, my dear?

203
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:22,180
I'll treat you good, and--

204
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:24,547
-At a time like this,
with Ryoka on the loose

205
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,014
and a wartime alert
having been issued,

206
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,580
I hardly think a seat Officer
would dare take the time

207
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,347
to be propositioning women, sir.

208
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,914
-Why you-- What?

209
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:35,380
How dare you lecture me
about proper conduct,

210
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:36,780
you insolent slug!

211
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:38,180
-Umesada, sir!

212
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:40,014
This sector is clear, sir.

213
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:42,314
Awaiting further orders, sir.

214
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:43,814
-Grr.

215
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:44,814
Figures.

216
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,747
You're lucky duty calls.

217
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,580
But when this is
over, I'll be back

218
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:50,980
to take your
insubordinate head off.

219
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:52,180
-Yeah, right.

220
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:53,980
Threaten away, because by
the time you come back,

221
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:55,514
I'll be long gone.

222
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:56,847
-Thank you for defending me.

223
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,214
-It was nothing.

224
00:12:58,247 --> 00:12:59,747
I did it because
I can't stand it

225
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,580
when pigs like him act that way.

226
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,414
-But it all worked
out so perfectly.

227
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:05,380
-Well, I guess it's
true, I did kind of--

228
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:06,714
-My whole plan is working great.

229
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:07,680
Am I a genius, or what?

230
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:11,647
-You sure are.

231
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:16,647
-Are you crazy?

232
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,047
Steal Soul Reaper's clothes?

233
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,880
-Sh!

234
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:20,714
Not so loud, they'll hear us.

235
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:23,047
Anyway, it's not
stealing, it's borrowing.

236
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,714
Haven't you noticed, we don't
look that different from Soul

237
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:27,614
Reapers, except for the
clothes we're wearing?

238
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:29,180
So why don't we just fix that.

239
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:30,780
If everyone thinks
we're Soul Reapers,

240
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:34,080
too, just think how much easier
we'll be able to get around.

241
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,747
-Well, you do have a point.

242
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,080
-I think someone's coming!

243
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:37,847
-But how do we--

244
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,780
-Get ready!

245
00:13:38,814 --> 00:13:40,614
When I say go, we jump.

246
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:43,380
OK?

247
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:43,880
Ready?

248
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:44,380
Go!

249
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,814
-Uh, sorry.

250
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:52,214
I didn't hear you say you go.

251
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,047
-Orihime, listen.

252
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,547
-Huh?

253
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,247
Oh, sorry.

254
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,447
Here are your clothes.

255
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,614
-No, it isn't that.

256
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:02,314
I was just-- I was
going to tell you

257
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:04,614
that I think what you did
out there just now was really

258
00:14:04,647 --> 00:14:05,847
amazing.

259
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,614
You knocked out those two
without using your spirit

260
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,547
energy.

261
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,314
-Oh, thank you!

262
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:13,880
I learned some
karate from Tatsuki.

263
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:16,314
She told me I was
pretty good at it.

264
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:18,447
In fact, she said I was
about at the yellow belt

265
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,047
level, whatever that means.

266
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,747
-Is that what she said?

267
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,714
-Well, we better hurry
up and get changed.

268
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:26,714
-Ah!

269
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:28,147
Orihime, wait, wait, wait!

270
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,980
You can't do that!

271
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:31,147
Please put your shirt back down.

272
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,714
-That's right.

273
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:32,780
Sorry Uryu.

274
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:34,147
I was thinking I was
with Tatsuki again.

275
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,380
And I forgot boys and
girls aren't really

276
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:39,080
supposed to change clothes
in front of each other.

277
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:40,247
-That's right.

278
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,814
So now-

279
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,780
-So you use the dressing room.

280
00:14:45,814 --> 00:14:49,747
Then you can have your privacy.

281
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,347
-Isn't it supposed to
be the other way around?

282
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,580
-Are you OK in there, Uryu?

283
00:14:53,614 --> 00:14:54,814
Hurry up!

284
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:56,714
-I'll be right out.

285
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:01,347
-All right, then.

286
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,447
Those two Soul Reapers said
we should head this way

287
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,880
to get to the tower
where Rukia's being held.

288
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:12,347
I'm sure by now the others
all headed that way as well.

289
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,280
And if I know Ichigo, he's
so determined he's probably

290
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:17,547
already there.

291
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,047
-Hm.

292
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,814
Well then.

293
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:22,247
We'd better get moving, right?

294
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,514
You know how Ichigo always has
to rush into things all alone.

295
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:30,947
We need to there and help him,
before he screws everything up.

296
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,314
-Right.

297
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:34,747
So, what squad should we say
we're from if anyone asks us?

298
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,147
-Good question.

299
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,780
-We have to be ready to answer
right away, if we get stopped.

300
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,180
-Yeah, you're right about that.

301
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:44,614
[music playing]

302
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:20,680
-I guess that's
what happens when

303
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,814
you don't fight for 100 years.

304
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:25,414
You get so out of shape, that
after just a few dozen flash

305
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:26,847
steps, you're exhausted.

306
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,980
I can't remember
ever feeling so weak.

307
00:16:33,947 --> 00:16:34,580
[deep breathing]

308
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,947
-Hey, Ichigo, how
are you feeling?

309
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,947
-Where am I?

310
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,314
Why did you do that?

311
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:11,314
Why was I the only
one you brought back?

312
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:14,147
I was the only one with half a
chance of surviving back there.

313
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,347
And now thanks to you,
Ganju and Hanataro and rukia

314
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,547
will be killed.

315
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,180
Damn you.

316
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:21,814
-Don't be so vain.

317
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:23,947
You had no chance of surviving.

318
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,547
None of you defeated Byakuya.

319
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:38,647
Stop thrashing around.

320
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,380
Do you want to open
up those wounds again?

321
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:43,747
-Why don't you go to hell?

322
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,014
-One person was all I could
carry and still get away

323
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:48,947
from Byakuya.

324
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,447
-Then why, why didn't you
take Rukia, instead of me?

325
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,214
-I could have.

326
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:59,414
But Rukia wouldn't have a chance
of defeating Byakuya any more

327
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:01,347
than the rest of them
back there would have.

328
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,514
You alone have the ability to do
that, given the right training.

329
00:18:05,547 --> 00:18:07,247
So I brought you
back here with me,

330
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,547
in order to give
you that training.

331
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,347
Besides, I'm sure the others
are safe with Captain Ukitake

332
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,480
there.

333
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:17,614
He's Rukia's superior,
and a very decent man.

334
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:20,914
Even though Ganju's an intruder,
and Hanataro a traitor,

335
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:23,180
he wouldn't kill someone
who tried to save Rukia.

336
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:25,680
So don't worry
about them, Ichigo.

337
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:28,547
Stay here and regain
your strength.

338
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,980
You're no match for
Byakuya right now.

339
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:34,347
But I am going to train
you, so you will be.

340
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,280
And then you're going to
go back and rescue everyone

341
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:38,347
with your own hands.

342
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:44,414
How is the pain?

343
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:47,047
-It's still there, but a
lot better than before.

344
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,914
-We won't be able to wait
for you to heal completely.

345
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:53,247
You're just going to have to
ignore the pain, and do this.

346
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,480
-Fine.

347
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,047
What is this place?

348
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,047
Looks kind of familiar somehow.

349
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,880
-You are the very first
outsider I've ever brought here.

350
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:05,380
It is pretty
impressive, isn't it?

351
00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:06,380
-Huh.

352
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:07,547
Oh well.

353
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,847
Time is short, right?

354
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,814
So let's get this
show on the road.

355
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:12,847
-Fine.

356
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,847
All right, then.

357
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,847
Let me start by
asking you a question.

358
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,847
I assume that by now,
you must have noticed

359
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,780
that your Zanpakuto is always
in it's released form, correct?

360
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:24,247
-It's released form?

361
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,280
That's what Kenpachi Zaraki
told me about his Zanpakuto.

362
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:29,947
I guess that's why
it's shape is so

363
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,480
different from other
people's swords,

364
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:33,780
and why it never
transformed, even

365
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:36,180
when I tried calling
out its name.

366
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:37,280
-Hm.

367
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:40,080
So you really didn't
know after all, did you?

368
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:43,247
Then I assume you also
didn't know that Zangetsu

369
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,780
can be released
to another level.

370
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:46,380
-Huh?

371
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:48,114
-Not just Zangetsu, of course.

372
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:51,314
All Zanpakuto swords have a
second level of soul release,

373
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:53,047
beyond the initial one.

374
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,714
That first level
is called Shikai.

375
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:58,714
The second level
is called Bankai.

376
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:01,714
Before any Soul Reaper
can become a captain,

377
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,614
he or she must have mastered
both of these Zanpakuto

378
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:06,347
releases.

379
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,347
-Both?

380
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,647
-That's right.

381
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,247
Except for one, every squad
captain of the Court Guard

382
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,247
has always had to
first master Bankai.

383
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,014
-Which one?

384
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,780
-Kenpachi Zaraki.

385
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:21,647
As far as I know, in all
the vast history of the Soul

386
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,147
Society, Kenpachi
is the only one

387
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,380
ever to become Captain without
first achieving Bankai.

388
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:30,114
Certainly he is the first to
attain that rank, without even

389
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,647
knowing the name
of the Zanpakuto.

390
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,547
It shows how greatly the
13 Court Guard squads

391
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,514
value and respect his
fighting abilities.

392
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:40,647
I'm sure you can appreciate that
more than anyone, having fought

393
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,680
him yourself, and
survived to tell about it.

394
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,447
The power difference
between levels

395
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,447
varies, depending on
the fighters ability

396
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,814
and discipline.

397
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:57,414
But, in general, it's accepted
that with a Bankai release,

398
00:20:57,447 --> 00:21:00,680
a fighter's power
increases by 5 to 10 times.

399
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:01,447
-That much?

400
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:06,314
-Now do you see what
I'm talking about?

401
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:09,547
To gain this advantage,
it's not uncommon for even

402
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,347
a strong fighter to have
to train for over 10 years

403
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,414
to achieve it.

404
00:21:13,447 --> 00:21:14,514
-What are you saying?

405
00:21:14,547 --> 00:21:15,780
I don't have that kind of time!

406
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:16,947
-I know, I know.

407
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,147
Don't panic.

408
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,847
There is another way.

409
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,614
It's going to be rather
dangerous, Ichigo,

410
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,114
but I plan to use a completely
different method here.

411
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:28,447
You will master Bankai
in only three days.

412
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:30,337
-Three days.

413
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:50,579
[theme song]

414
00:21:50,579 --> 00:22:44,446
[theme song]

415
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:48,175
-So Uryu, what squad shall
we say we're from anyway?

416
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,908
-Doe each squad have it's
own unique characteristic?

417
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:51,741
-I'm sure they do.

418
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,008
Like a squad that loves flowers.

419
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,541
Or a musical squad.

420
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,208
Or a squad that
tells great jokes!

421
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,741
-Orihime, you don't
really understand

422
00:22:57,775 --> 00:22:59,908
what Soul Reapers are
all about, do you?
