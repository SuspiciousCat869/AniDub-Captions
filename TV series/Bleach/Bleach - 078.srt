00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:41,595
JINTA: What do you want?

00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:46,428
There.

00:01:46,462 --> 00:01:47,495
You

URURU: Didn't have
boil that much water.

7
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:51,162
It's not like we're gonna
deliver a baby or anything.

-Yeah?

Well, that shows
how much you know.

'Cause hot water can be
used for all kinds of stuff.

-The method I'm using to heal
them is very unconventional.

12
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,362
It doesn't require a
single drop of hot water.

think it would

-So what have you heard?

00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:07,128
Does the Soul Society have any
information that might help?

YORUICHI: The Department
of Research and Development

43
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:10,262
came up with something.

44
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:22,562
-Wait.

45
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:24,562
-As the captain in charge of
the Department of Research

46
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:26,695
and Development, I have
full authorization.

47
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:30,562
So there shouldn't be any data
that I'm denied access to.

48
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:35,962
It took me some time, but I
was able to unlock the file.

49
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:38,295
Allow me to demonstrate.

50
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:39,428
Nemu?

51
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:41,128
NEMU: Yes, I'll bring
it up on the monitor.

KUROTSUCHI: The ones
causing a disturbance

53
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:45,495
in the World of the
Living are called Bounts.

54
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:48,162
They're a tribe that
is basically human,

55
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:53,928
but can extend their lifespans
by feeding on human souls.

56

KUROTSUCHI: As I'm sure you are
all aware, these are Quincies.

60
00:04:03,228 --> 00:04:06,862
At one point in their history,
the Bounts and the Quincies

61
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,495
were mortal enemies.

took this footage,

00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:20,628
which is surprisingly
well preserved.

00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:24,295
[shouting]

66
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:37,628
-I think you'll find
this interesting.

00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:45,328
[shouting]

68
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:46,962
KUROTSUCHI: It's
obvious the Bounts are

69
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,028
targeting one Quincy
in particular.

70
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:55,362
KYORAKU: What happens next?

71
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,362
KUROTSUCHI: The
file is very old.

72
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:59,928
That is all I've
been able to recover.

73
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:00,995
-Hm.

74
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:03,295
I hate it when a movie
leaves me hanging.

75
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:07,395
I'd be interested to know
how this one turned out.

76
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:09,995
-Unfortunately, it all
happened so long ago,

77
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:12,162
there's no way to find
out if the Bounts actually

78
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:13,228
got the Quincy.

79
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:16,762
However, according
to my records-- Nemu,

80
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:19,662
explain to these gentleman
what we actually did find.

81
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,662
-Yes.

82
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,228
The records after
the battle indicate

83
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:24,862
that the Bounts continued
feeding on living humans

84
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:27,428
and absorbing their souls
for a period of time.

85
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:28,728
-What?

86
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,095
NEMU: Originally, there
existed a kind of law.

87
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:32,728
It was understood
that the Bounts were

88
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:35,428
only to absorb the
souls of dead humans.

89
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:37,795
To absorb a living
soul was prohibited.

90
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:39,495
This incident seems
to be the turning

91
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:41,962
point at which the Bounts
began absorbing souls

92
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:43,628
from living bodies.

93
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:45,895
The data we've gathered
backs up this theory,

94
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,928
showing a decrease in the
quality of souls, and--

95
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:50,328
-You can skip the
unnecessary details.

96
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:53,028
-Do the records show
what happened after that?

97
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,728
-I'm afraid not.

98
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:57,362
But whenever there's an
upheaval in their tribe,

99
00:05:57,395 --> 00:06:00,228
they abandon the law that
they themselves created

100
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:02,528
and attack living humans.

101
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,962
One has to wonder if
there is some connection

102
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:07,128
between this behavior
and their need

103
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:09,728
for that particular Quincy.

104
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:11,695
I don't know if these
old records have

105
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:16,062
any bearing on what is currently
happening in the living world.

106
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:18,762
But there are
definitely parallels.

107
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,495
And this much is obvious.

108
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:23,062
From this point
forward, the Bounts

109
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:27,228
will begin to freely and
recklessly attack the humans--

110
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,195
not dead humans,
but living ones.

111
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:36,062
[gasping]

112
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,295
-Yoruichi, are you
certain about this?

113
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:41,295
-Maybe if I had heard
from someone else,

114
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:43,795
but I got this from
Jushiro Ukitake himself,

115
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:45,695
and he was visibly upset.

116
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:49,362
There's no reason
to question it.

117
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:53,628
-Jin Kariya-- he's trying to
use Uryu's power as a Quincy

118
00:06:53,662 --> 00:06:58,562
to somehow open a hole and
break through to Hueco Mundo.

119
00:06:58,595 --> 00:06:59,562
-[gasp]

120
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:01,462
-[gasp]

121
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:02,895
-I would imagine
the energy they've

122
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:04,562
been absorbing from
the souls of living

123
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:07,128
humans is necessary for
that objective as well.

124
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:12,228
But what is the
purpose of a Quincy?

125
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:15,262
Why is he so necessary
for their success?

126
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:18,462
-We don't have enough
information to answer that yet.

127
00:07:18,495 --> 00:07:22,895
And we must be very careful
until we find the answer.

128
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:26,295
At any rate, we've got to
do everything we possibly

129
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:28,395
can to stop Kariya
and the other Bounts

130
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:30,195
from attacking
living humans until--

131
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:32,195
ICHIGO: Hey, Yoruichi?

132
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:33,828
-Yes, what is it?

133
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,328
-There's just one
thing in all this

134
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:37,895
that doesn't make any sense.

135
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:40,528
They're breaking their own laws
by sucking the souls of living

136
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,162
humans and going
to all this trouble

137
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:46,728
to get a Quincy just
to get to Hueco Mundo

138
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:49,495
But the thing is,
what does Kariya

139
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:51,895
plan to do once he's there?

140
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:54,328
-If we knew the answer to
that, maybe we could stop him.

141
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:57,528
-Kariya.

142
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:05,195
He's powerful enough as it is.

143
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:11,362
What could he possibly
do with more power?

144
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:12,962
After you've reached
a certain point,

145
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:15,695
what difference does it make?

146
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,762
-Ichigo, listen to me.

147
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:20,295
-He's incredibly strong.

148
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:23,262
But it's not like he has to
depend on some technique.

149
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,328
So then why does he--

150
00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:26,828
-[gasp]

151
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:30,128
-[gasp] The truth, Ichigo.

152
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:31,928
Are you really
afraid of this man?

153
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:35,928
-No, I don't think that's it.

154
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:39,228
It's just that if I'm
really honest with myself,

155
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:47,495
at my current ability, I
don't see how I can win.

156
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:47,995
-Ichigo.

157
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:51,862
-Huh?

158
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:52,395
-Huh?

00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:08,395
-[laughs] Do I know how to
make an entrance, or what?

163
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:10,495
[laughs]

164
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:11,662
-Thank you very much, sir.

165
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:14,628
Please come again.

166
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:16,662
-Hanataro, where's Ganju?

167
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:19,095
-Well, uh, I-- I
think he was just

168
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:21,395
restocking those
shelves a minute ago.

169
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,162
-Oh, I see.

170
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,962
He must be in the bathroom.

171
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:24,962
-I don't know.

172
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:26,662
I suppose he could
be someplace else.

173
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:29,228
-No, if I know him,
he's in the bathroom.

174
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:30,595
[laughs]

175
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:31,595
-You may be right.

176
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:34,595
But with Ganju, you
never can be sure.

177
00:09:34,628 --> 00:09:38,695
-[sigh] Well, you've made
quite a mess here, didn't you?

178
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,895
You'll have time to
fix it all later.

179
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:45,062
-[laughs] It's just a couple
of walls and some furniture.

180
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:48,162
-First of all, what
are you doing here?

181
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:51,128
And secondly, why were
you riding that boar?

182
00:09:51,162 --> 00:09:53,362
Where on earth did you find it?

183
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:54,462
-Sweet, huh?

184
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:56,062
They got some really
strange animals here.

185
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,062
I could get used to this.

186
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:00,928
-You stole it from
the zoo, didn't you?

187
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:02,728
GANJU: I got to
admit, he's not bad.

188
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:04,328
But he's nothing like my Bonnie.

189
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:07,595
[laughs] Oh, come to
think of it, you've

190
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:09,628
never met my sweet
little Bonnie, have you?

191
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:11,128
-Why are you here, Ganju?

192
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:11,762
GANJU: Oh, yeah.

193
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:12,762
Right.

194
00:10:12,795 --> 00:10:14,162
Well it started all
of a sudden when

195
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:17,062
I got this feeling of a gloomy
spiritual pressure coming

196
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:18,895
from somewhere in town.

197
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:21,028
I'm the type who's very
sensitive to these kind

198
00:10:21,062 --> 00:10:24,028
of things, so I just hopped
on my boar, followed my nose,

199
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:25,828
and look where I ended up.

200
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:29,062
And the gloomy bastard
I sensed was you!

201
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,962
-What'd you call me?

202
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:32,095
[groaning]

203
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:33,695
-I hadn't noticed
before, but you're right.

204
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:34,828
-How'd we miss that?

205
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:37,195
He reeks of it.

206
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:39,028
-Whoa, someone open the windows.

207
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:40,428
I can't breathe in here.

208
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:43,762
-Hey, you can't talk about me
like I'm garbage or something!

209
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:44,595
-You're right.

210
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:46,495
Rotten garbage is more like it.

211
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:48,795
I'm going to take you out
and freshen you up a little.

212
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:52,262
Hey, old man, do you know a good
place where I could do that.

213
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:54,328
-Old man?

214
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,162
You may not know
it to look at me,

215
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,795
but your older sister
and I are good friends.

216
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:02,795
[laughs] But that's
another story.

217
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,428
Right this way.

218
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:05,762
-Yeah, now you're talking.

219
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:06,462
Come on, Ichigo.

220
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:07,628
It's for your own good.

221
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:12,928
-All right.

222
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:15,462
Now get out of your Gigai
so we can get started.

223
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:17,062
-This isn't a Gigai!

224
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:17,762
[shout]

225
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:18,762
RUKIA: How's that?

226
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,962
-What the hell are
you doing, Rukia.

227
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:21,795
Ah!

228
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:23,262
-I'll come along and help you.

229
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:24,162
-The more the merrier.

230
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:25,928
Now move it, Ichigo.

231
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:26,695
-Hey, wait.

232
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,428
Can we talk about this?

233
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:29,262
Come on, guys.

234
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:31,128
What's the rush?

235
00:11:31,162 --> 00:11:31,962
Hey!

236
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:33,328
-Ready or not, now here you go.

237
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:36,828
-[shout]

238
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:06,964
-Master, can we still use it?

239
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:08,799
-It's hard to tell.

240
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:15,731
Maybe if we somehow
fix it, then perhaps.

241
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:19,431
There should be some tools
around here somewhere.

242
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:22,064
-Allow me to find
them for you, sir.

243
00:12:22,098 --> 00:12:22,664
-No need.

244
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:25,431
I'll do it.

245
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,298
-[groaning]

246
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,231
-All right.

247
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:29,331
Start spinning.

248
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:30,698
[laughs]

249
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:32,431
-You shouldn't be
doing that, Jinta.

250
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:33,798
-Come on, don't
be a spoil sport.

251
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:36,031
He'll dry out faster this way.

252
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:37,364
-You jerk!

253
00:12:37,398 --> 00:12:39,598
I'm not some piece of laundry
you can hang out to dry.

254
00:12:39,631 --> 00:12:43,864
Especially in the middle
of the night! [shouting]

255
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:46,098
-Would you keep
it down out here?

256
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:49,098
I've got injured people inside,
and they need their rest.

257
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:51,564
-Uh, sorry about that.

258
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:53,131
JINTA: See, I told you so.

259
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:54,998
JINTA: Shut up!

260
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:57,364
YOSHINO: [gasp]

261
00:12:57,398 --> 00:12:58,831
-Does it hurt?

262
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:00,364
-Not much.

263
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:05,231
Whatever treatment he gave
me seems to have worked.

264
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:07,931
I'm sorry that
this has to happen.

265
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:11,031
I never should've gotten
you involved in all of this.

266
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:13,598
-I was already involved.

267
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:15,064
There's nothing
you could have time

268
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:17,631
to stop them from targeting me.

269
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:21,864
I'm still a Quincy after all,
even though I have no powers.

270
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:29,164
-It's funny but I
just remembered.

271
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:32,631
Jin Kariya once told
me the same thing.

272
00:13:32,664 --> 00:13:36,731
He said, I'm sorry for
getting you involved in this.

273
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:39,298
-And I'm sure you
believed him, though I

274
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:41,098
doubt he really felt that way.

275
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:43,764
-I don't think he's
sorry for anything.

276
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:45,631
Still, it shocked
me when I finally

277
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:48,431
came to that realization.

278
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:50,698
No one knows what
he's really like.

279
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:52,298
He has deceived all of them.

280
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:58,098
-Is his plan to go to Hueco
Mundo just another deception?

281
00:13:58,131 --> 00:13:59,731
-No, that's real.

282
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:02,098
Although I don't know exactly
what he plans to do once

283
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:03,131
he gets there.

284
00:14:03,164 --> 00:14:05,831
He never told me that.

285
00:14:05,864 --> 00:14:09,031
But whatever it is, I don't
see how it could possibly

286
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:12,264
justify breaking the laws
our tribe has always lived by

287
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:14,831
and sacrificing innocent humans.

288
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:17,631
-I agree with you.

289
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:21,398
-Still, I attacked
living humans, too.

290
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,564
I'm despicable.

291
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:29,398
-That's different.

292
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:32,764
Our fate was decided long ago.

293
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:36,531
When I was first born into this
world-- and many, many years

294
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:41,464
before that, since the first
Bounts came into existence--

295
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:43,631
out population has
been determined.

296
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:46,798
-[gasp]

297
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:49,698
-Every one of us were born
during a short period of time

298
00:14:49,731 --> 00:14:52,264
when a genetic
mutation occurred.

299
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:55,764
Since then, the mutation
has never occurred again.

300
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:58,598
And as such, no new
Bounts have been born.

301
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:05,731
Besides that, we are not capable
of giving birth to new life--

302
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:06,231
ever.

303
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:12,264
We can live forever,
yet we are constantly

304
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:17,698
waiting to die, to die
slowly over endless years

305
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:18,298
and centuries.

306
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,531
GANJU: I'm telling
you you're scared!

307
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:26,498
You're a weak-kneed,
lily-livered coward!

308
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:28,264
And it makes me sick.

309
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:31,331
Now I'm going to break
that cowardice out of you.

310
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,031
-Yeah?

311
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,731
I'd like to see you try!

312
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:35,731
-[laugh] About time
you showed some spirit.

313
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:37,564
Why don't you take it from here?

314
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:38,364
-Huh?

315
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:39,498
You said you were going to--

316
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:40,531
-I thought you'd want to.

317
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,998
But I guess if you're afraid--

318
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,064
-What'd you say?

319
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:44,064
-That's the spirit.

320
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:45,031
Now get in there.

321
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:47,064
