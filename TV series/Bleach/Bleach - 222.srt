ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
I'm Ichigo Kurosaki.

2
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:09,100
And other than having the
ability to see spirits,

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:11,366
I used to be an ordinary
high school student.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,766
But the day I met
Rukia Kuchiki, I

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,633
was given the powers
of a Soul Reaper

6
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,633
in order to protect the
world of the living.

7
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,066
As I began my work as a
substitute Soul Reaper,

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,500
I found myself thrown into
a never-ending battle.

9
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:24,266
In the midst of everything,
my best friend Orihime Inoue

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,400
was abducted by ex-Soul
Reaper captain Sosuke Aizen.

11
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:30,966
My friends Chad and Uryu join
me as I race to rescue Orihime.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,400
Once we arrived in Hueco
Mundo, we entered a fight

13
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,666
with powerful enemies
known as Arrancars.

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,466
We were too late to
keep Aizen from entering

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
the world of the living.

16
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:40,600
But luckily, the 13
Court Guard Squads

17
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:42,200
were already there to stop him.

18
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:43,666
An all-out war was
about to begin.

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,066
[theme music]

20
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:30,875
NARRATOR: In order to prevent
Sosuke Aizen from destroying

21
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:33,542
Karakura Town, the Soul
Reapers used four pillars

22
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:36,175
to create a massive
Senkaimon to relocate

23
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,508
the entire town to
the Soul Society.

24
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,408
Izuru, Yumichika,
and Shuhei, who

25
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:41,975
were defending three
of the pillars,

26
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:44,342
faced attacks from
Barragan's Fracciones.

27
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,042
They emerged victorious
from their various battles.

28
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,142
However, the final
pillar was destroyed

29
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:50,775
in a fight between
Ikkaku Madarame

30
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:52,842
and the Fraccion named Poww.

31
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,908
Tetsuzaemon managed to prevent
the return of Karakura town

32
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,442
by using emergency stakes.

33
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:59,442
Captain Komamura, who
had rushed to the scene,

34
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:02,475
eventually defeated Poww,
putting an end to the assault.

35
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:04,375
-Very well.

36
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:06,808
Shall we at last get
on with the real fight?

37
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:28,542
BARRAGAN: Don't let even
a single ant escape alive.

38
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,475
There is no place for you
to return to as losers.

39
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:38,975
Don't you dare disappoint me.

40
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:42,308
Kill them all.

41
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:46,275
-I implore you, you must put
all your spirit into this

42
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:47,642
to defeat them here.

43
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:50,175
Even if your flesh is
torn from your body,

44
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,275
use your bones to form
an impenetrable wall.

45
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:55,275
No matter what the
cost, we must never

46
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:58,875
let them step even one
foot into the Soul Society.

47
00:03:58,908 --> 00:03:59,675
Attack now!

48

-You worried?

54
00:04:37,308 --> 00:04:39,708
Your second in command is
getting his ass kicked.

55
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:41,108
-So what?

56
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:42,042
He's a fool.

57
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,308
And the only
thoughts he ever has

58
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:45,308
are about money, food,
and his family's business.

59
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:51,308
-Say that's pretty cold.

60
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:52,842
Is that how things
work with you?

61
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,942
-I don't like a cozy
atmosphere in my squad.

62
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:57,842
-Really?

63
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:58,342
-Ha!

64
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:03,708
-Damn!

-Bakudo #30, Shitotsu Sansen.

66
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:23,408
It's all over, Arrancar.

67
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:27,842
I didn't have the time
to learn your name.

That is the power
of my Suzumebachi.

72
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:51,342
-What are you talking about?

73
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,742
Are you saying if that thing
stings me twice, I'm history?

74
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:58,808
-You're about to find out.

75
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,542
-Cero.

-You're not too efficient
for an assassin.

79
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:29,575
Maybe you do have a weapon that
kills an enemy in two strikes.

80
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:30,375
Why announce it?

81
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:32,108
Why not just use it?

82
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,975
With flash step, this
battle would be over by now.

83
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:40,608
That's what I would have done.

Ready for another?

-What?

-I'll be able to finish
you off in one strike.

101
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,042
You better do something.

102
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,542
There's no point
in holding back,

103
00:07:59,575 --> 00:08:02,008
you should use your best
move before you're killed.

Now watch and learn.

you down, my friend,

Shikai or my killer move.

That's too bad.

119
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,086
To be honest with
you, I really wanted

120
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:52,452
to fight that blonde chick.

121
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:55,619
See, I had no interest
in battling you.

122
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:57,519
You're just a fat-ass.

123
00:08:57,552 --> 00:08:59,119
-I'm a what?

124
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:00,952
What are you talking about?

125
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:02,452
Are you blind or something?

00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:05,552
Man, wait a minute.

127
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,619
Of course.

128
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:08,052
You're just jealous.

129
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:09,152
That's it.

130
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:10,686
What a dummy, I should
have figured it out

131
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,986
from the beginning.

132
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,452
I can't help it if you look
bad and have a terrible odor

133
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:15,152
as well.

134
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:16,219
Could be worse.

135
00:09:16,252 --> 00:09:18,519
But it's not my fault
you're fat and ugly!

136
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:20,219
Don't blame me.

137
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:21,819
-Excuse me?

138
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,186
-Don't play dumb.

139
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:24,952
It couldn't be any more obvious.

140
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:28,119
You are suffering from a
classic inferiority complex.

141
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:29,852
It's why someone
who looks bad tries

142
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:31,886
to put down someone
who looks good.

143
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,719
Or why someone with
no money puts down

144
00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:36,219
someone who's wealthy.

145
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:37,652
-Is that right?

146
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,319
So where is this guy who looks
good and has a pile of money?

147
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:42,019
I'd really like to meet him.

148
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:43,219
-Tell me something.

149
00:09:43,252 --> 00:09:46,419
Are you also an idiot on
top of being fat and ugly?

150
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,286
-An idiot?

151
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:49,286
-Come on.

152
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:50,819
All you have to do
is open your eyes.

153
00:09:50,852 --> 00:09:52,219
Just think about it.

154
00:09:52,252 --> 00:09:55,586
Look, are you so damn dense that
I have to spell it out for you?

155
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:56,886
All right, fine.

156
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,519
I am a man of
considerable wealth.

157
00:10:01,486 --> 00:10:03,819
I happen to have a
great sense of style.

158
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:07,119
And my looks obviously
leave nothing to be desired.

159
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:09,286
I've been talking about
myself, of course.

160
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:13,119
-Eugh.

161
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,819
-You have an issue
with my speech?

162
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,186
-Oh, yeah.

163
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:23,819
Do all Arrancars
talk this much when

164
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:26,852
they're right in the middle
of fighting for their lives?

165
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:29,019
-I suppose I do become
a little chatty when

166
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:31,452
victory is so easily
within my reach.

167
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:32,486
-Interesting.

168
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,219
So it appears to
me the only way I

169
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:36,886
can make you talk less is to
make this battle much more

170
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,886
difficult for you.

171
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:42,486
And believe me when I say this
is something I'm willing to do.

172
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,252
My second in command talks
enough for the both of you.

173
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:47,486
-So what's your point?

174
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,786
-Just I prefer the quiet, since
I have all the talk I need.

175
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,752
-Maybe I'll just fix your
mouth so you can't talk either!

176
00:10:57,752 --> 00:10:59,186
-Don't be so sure!

177
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:02,652
-Huh?

178
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:03,619
-Haa!

179
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:04,119
-Augh!

180
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,052
-Huh?!

181
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,052
-Haa!

182
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:13,519
(VOICEOVER) I've got him!

183
00:11:13,552 --> 00:11:14,652
[gasp]

184
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:16,519
-If you think I can't
keep up with your speed,

185
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,119
you've underestimated me!

186
00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:24,686
Oh, I'm so sorry.

187
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,719
Am I still talking
too much for you?

188
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:31,052
[grunting]

189
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:31,552
-[gasp]

190
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:32,052
-Haa!

191
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:38,986
Disappointing.

192
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:40,352
I expected more.

193
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:42,686
You're the captain
of Squad 2, the unit

194
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,819
that's known as
the Stealth Force.

195
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:47,719
I heard that that squad
was comprised of assassins,

196
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:52,219
the most lethal fighters
in all of the Soul Society.

197
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:55,286
So far I'm not impressed
with your technique.

198
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:59,286
Or is this the best that the
Soul Society has to offer?

199
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,386
Oh, by the way,
when we met earlier

200
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:03,552
you said you didn't have
time to learn my name.

201
00:12:03,586 --> 00:12:05,386
Well, guess what.

202
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:07,086
You have time now.

203
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:10,219
And I'm going to tell you.

204
00:12:10,252 --> 00:12:14,419
His Majesty Barragan's
Fraccion, Ggio Vega.

205
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:16,686
And while I'm on
the subject, there's

206
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,419
another name you
should hear as well.

207
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:23,952
Bite off, Tigre Estoque!

208
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:31,152
-Let me explain
something to you.

209
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:34,486
A good-looking man is bred from
a good lineage and environment.

210
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,619
He's incredibly polished.

211
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:40,219
Truth is, to a poor man like
you it's much too confusing.

212
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:43,552
You couldn't comprehend the
lure of a hot man like me.

213
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:45,152
[laughs]

214
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:47,086
-Thank you, I got your message.

215
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:49,286
Would you shut up
already, fatso?

216
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:51,219
-I refuse to be called
fatso by someone

217
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:52,986
who looks like a tub of lard!

218
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,319
And anyway, I'm not
fat, I'm full bodied.

219
00:12:56,352 --> 00:12:58,219
It's a reflection of abundance.

220
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:00,352
It's much different from
how a knuckle-dragger like

221
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:02,552
yourself bloats up for no
apparent reason at all.

222
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:04,019
How about that?

223
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:07,486
-You are the biggest
pain I have ever met.

224
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,986
-Right back at you.

225
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:10,919
Anything you call me
bounces off and lands

226
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:12,986
right on your fat
head, so there.

227
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,619
-Are you four years old?

228
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:17,086
I'm going to have to
shut you up permanently.

229
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:18,719
-Say what?

230
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:23,052
That's big talk for someone
who doesn't have a clue.

231
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:26,152
You lack a sense of style and
your clothes are really shabby.

232
00:13:26,186 --> 00:13:29,652
You should think about getting
a makeover before you-- huh?

233
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:30,752
-Stomp down.

234
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,919
-[trumpets] Mamut!

235
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,801
[trumpets] Mamut!

236
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:01,701
-Whoaah!

237
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:12,863
Damn it!

238
00:14:12,863 --> 00:14:15,151
These guys are always using
sneaky transformations!

239
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:17,118
How did he become
so huge like that?

240
00:14:17,151 --> 00:14:19,485
All I've got to fight
him with is this sword.

241
00:14:25,518 --> 00:14:28,751
[groaning] That's
going to leave a mark.

242
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,685
Huh?

243
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:32,385
--[laughing] With
my Resurreccion,

244
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:34,585
my movements get
slower as I get bigger.

245
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:36,351
But I should still
be fast enough

246
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:37,951
to take out a pest like you!

247
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:38,485
Right, fatso?

248
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:45,718
That's it, run for
your life, you turkey!

249
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:50,451
[laughing] Haa!

250
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:52,851
How about another one?

251
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:55,585
[grunt] You're pretty slow.

252
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,685
If you lost a few
pounds, maybe you

253
00:14:57,718 --> 00:14:59,751
could put on a little speed.

254
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:01,885
Quit dragging that lard-ass!

255
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:03,685
-Who you calling lard-ass?

256
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:05,085
I told you before!

257
00:15:05,118 --> 00:15:07,285
Listen, I'm just full-bodied!

258
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:09,018
And maybe you hadn't
noticed, but you're

259
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:10,818
no greyhound either, wise guy.

260
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,718
-That might be, but
I'm doing the chasing

261
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:14,085
and you're doing the fleeing.

262
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:16,685
Maybe those pockets full of
money are holding you back.

263
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:19,018
Did you ever think about that?

264
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,751
-Waahh!

265
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:22,351
This guy is completely
out of control.

266
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:24,618
I'm not going to fight him
head on, that's for sure.

267
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:29,118
-What the?

268
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:30,318
-See ya!

269
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:32,451
In a street fight, you
need more than just speed.

270
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:34,585
You may be good
in a race, but I'm

271
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:37,085
guessing you're not so good
at climbing up tall buildings,

272
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:38,185
are you?

273
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:40,351
Enjoy the view from down
there, elephant breath!

274
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:40,851
Aaahh!

275
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:45,118
-What were you saying?

276
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:54,851
[jingling]

277
00:16:01,385 --> 00:16:02,251
-OK.

278
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:04,585
Here I come!

279
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:05,085
Hyaaah!

280
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:09,451
Uwaaahh!

281
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:15,318
SUI-FENG (VOICEOVER):
His attacks are sharper.

282
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:19,051
-You plan to fight, or just
stand there analyzing my moves?

283
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:21,718
-Who's to say it isn't
part of my technique?

284
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:22,918
-Ha ha, fine.

285
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:25,018
Keep it up, if that's the
way you want to play it.

286
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,718
But I'm running out of patience.

287
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:27,685
So take this!

288
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:32,085
-[grunts]

289
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,451
SUI-FENG (VOICEOVER):
He's also increased

290
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:37,885
his destructive power.

291
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:40,418
-Get ready, because
there's no time to rest!

292
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:40,918
Hyaah!

293
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:41,418
Urgh!

294
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,985
Well, not bad.

295
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:47,751
The cat finally
showed its claws.

296
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:49,651
SUI-FENG (VOICEOVER):
I see, his Resurreccion

297
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:52,818
has increased his attack
capacity by several levels.

298
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:53,485
-Now die!

299
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:02,985
SUI-FENG (VOICEOVER): His
speed has also increased.

300
00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:11,818
However--

301
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:12,318
-Haahh!

302
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:21,118
-Nice try, but you're
just not good enough.

303
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:27,818
--[chuckles] Now
that's more like it.

304
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:29,318
-No fair, hold on.

305
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:30,085
Wait!

306
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:31,485
No way!

307
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,618
You can't be able to jump that
high with your size and weight.

308
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:35,085
You're not supposed
to be here, you

309
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:36,351
should be stuck on the ground!

310
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:37,885
-Maybe that's a good lesson.

311
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:40,618
You should be more careful
about judging people, especially

312
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:41,685
based on their appearance!

313
00:17:45,018 --> 00:17:47,518
Hey, running away isn't
going to accomplish anything.

314
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:52,451
Besides, how far
do you think you

315
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:54,251
could get with
all weight on you?

316
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:56,085
Maybe you should've
spent some of your money

317
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,918
to get rid of that
hundred pounds of blubber

318
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,485
you're carrying around.

319
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:01,485
Now you're mine!

320
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:05,951
-Aaahh!

321
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:13,518
-[gasps]

322
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:20,951
-I'm not running
away any more, am I?

323
00:18:20,985 --> 00:18:23,685
-How did you do that?

324
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:26,918
-Huh, who do you suppose
you've been dealing with?

325
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:28,318
-What?

326
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:31,618
-I'm the lieutenant of Squad 2
and the head of Stealth Force

327
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:34,051
Second Unit, known
as Patrol Troops.

328
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,651
My name is Marechiyo Omaeda!

329
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,885
If you knew about
the Stealth Force,

330
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,118
you'd know I'd
never be that slow.

331
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:43,551
-You were playing me?

332
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:44,051
Damn you!

336
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,651
-Maybe that's a good
lesson, you should

337
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:09,685
be more careful
about judging people

338
00:19:09,718 --> 00:19:12,018
based on their appearance.

339
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:12,518
-Huhh!

340
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,018
Hyah!

341
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:13,518
Huhh!

342
00:19:20,518 --> 00:19:21,985
-That same technique again!

343
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:28,418
-Haahh!

344
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,085
-Well, looks like my
attacks are starting

345
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:48,451
to have an effect on you.

346
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:53,818
I understand why you didn't
fight back all that time.

347
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:55,351
You were analyzing
my moves, looking

348
00:19:55,385 --> 00:19:57,351
for some kind of weakness.

349
00:19:57,385 --> 00:19:59,385
I knew you were doing
that because deep inside,

350
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:00,885
you were convinced
you could come up

351
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,185
with some kind of method
to neutralize my attacks.

352
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:08,285
But unfortunately
for you, I haven't

353
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:10,485
shown you everything I possess.

354
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:11,851
So I wouldn't get
too comfortable

355
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:13,418
thinking you have
me all figured out.

356
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:15,385
I still have a few
tricks up my sleeve.

357
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,418
-Guess we'll find out.

358
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:37,518
-All right, I won!

359
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:42,651
Hey, look at you now.

360
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:45,685
You got exactly
what you deserve!

361
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:46,785
Talk smack to me, will you?

362
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,718
You see what
happens, butterball?

363
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:50,785
You thought you were
pretty damn smart, right?

364
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:53,785
You've got no substance,
oh, sure, big man.

365
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:56,385
You and your tricky
body, hopping around.

366
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:59,285
So who's in charge now, you with
your weird nose like a vacuum

367
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:00,385
cleaner?

368
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:01,651
Maybe I should tear that
thing off your face,

369
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:03,885
what do you think?

370
00:21:03,918 --> 00:21:07,751
Oh, ooh.

-I, you see-- sorry,
that came out wrong.

373
00:21:15,518 --> 00:21:18,085
I'm actually obsessed
with this nose.

374
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:20,118
The truth of the matter
is, I've always admired

375
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:21,318
long, handsome noses.

376
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:22,718
I wish I had one myself.

377
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:23,951
-Is that so?

378
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:26,918
How about I extend your
nose so it looks like mine?

379
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,085
-No, no, that's all right!

380
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:30,551
I was just kidding, I'm
happy with the way it is.

381
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:32,585
If you don't let go,
you're going to stretch it!

382
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:33,918
NIRGGE: Like this?

-Ahh!

384
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:37,218
Come on, give me
a break, will you?

385
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:38,985
You're going to mess
up my beautiful face!

386
00:21:39,018 --> 00:21:39,485
-Ugh!

387
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:48,951
-My nose is still here, right?

388
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:50,751
That pachyderm
didn't pull it off?

389
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:51,585
Huh?

390
00:21:51,618 --> 00:21:52,718
Wait a minute, what happened?
