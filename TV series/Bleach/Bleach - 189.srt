NARRATOR: After
years of scheming,

3
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:55,462
things finally fell into
place for Shusuke Amagai.

4
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:58,562
With the Soul Reapers occupied
storming the Kasumioji Palace

5
00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:03,762
grounds, Shusuke found Head
Captain Yamamoto alone.

6
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:05,395
He announced his
intention to kill

7
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:08,295
him to avenge his
father's death.

8
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,828
With his dying breath
Shusuke's father

9
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:15,962
had told him it was Yamamoto
who had mortally wounded him.

10
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:19,495
Shusuke's Bakkoto gave him
the ability to neutralize any

11
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:22,195
of the Soul Reaper's
Zanpakuto's.

12
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:24,662
After rendering the head
captain's Ryujin Jakka

13
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:26,828
powerless, Shusuke's
was poised to see

14
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:29,095
his wish for revenge fulfilled.

15
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:31,128
But when Ichigo
arrived, he and Shusuke

16
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:34,028
became embroiled in a fierce
battle that prevented Yamamoto

17
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,495
from being vanquished.

18
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:38,462
Shusuke expected his
Bakkoto to overwhelm Ichigo,

19
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:41,062
but Ichigo's hollowfication
leveled the playing field,

20
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:44,028
forcing Shusuke to
work for his revenge.

21
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:46,962
After an epic battle, which
he seemed destined to lose,

22
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:50,262
Ichigo used his Getsuga
Tensho to finally strike back

23
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:50,928
against Shusuke.

24
00:02:55,195 --> 00:02:56,662
-Getsuga Tensho.

25
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:05,595
[groaning]

26
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:24,762
-He survived that?

27
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:25,928
It can't be.

28
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:42,462
-I knew it was too
early to celebrate.

29
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:47,895
-This will not be over until
I've achieved my revenge.

30
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,095
-Forget it, Shusuke.

31
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,562
You're in no condition to
carry out your threats.

32
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:54,928
-Don't be so sure.

33
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:58,728
You see, I've dedicated myself
to complete this vendetta.

34
00:03:58,762 --> 00:04:01,895
Beyond that is death.

What is that?

Stop it.

40
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:34,695
You'll die if you keep it up.

41
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,228
-Goen Ryuga Homura!

42
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:21,262
-Ichigo!

43
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:34,728
You underrated me,
Substitute Soul Reaper.

44
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:40,862
-Something's wrong.

45
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:45,462
Why hasn't his Bakkoto
taken control of him?

46
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:48,528
-I'm able to suppress it
with my spiritual pressure,

47
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:51,895
and it hasn't grown
a bit, has it?

48
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:54,128
Let's finish all
this up, Genryusai.

49
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:59,795
-Your pride as a Soul
Reaper is still intact,

50
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:02,395
even though your mind has
been completely warped.

51
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,728
-You speak of pride?

52
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:06,495
You promoted order
in the Soul Society,

53
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:08,728
but the truth is you
saw to it that those

54
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:12,495
who didn't follow your
requests were eliminated!

55
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:15,395
You have no heart.

56
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:17,628
You and Rurichiyo must die.

57
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:20,728
So now prepare yourself.

58
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:22,295
-We'll protect you.

59
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:24,228
[shouting]

60
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:42,328
-You're OK.

61
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:44,728
-So you are still alive?

62
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:46,328
Why don't you just give up?

63
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:51,662
-I'll do whatever it
takes to stop you.

64
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:53,595
-Ichigo, no!

65
00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:56,362
-Rurichiyo, you
don't need to worry.

66
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,895
I can take care of myself.

67
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:01,528
-You're lucky
you're not dead yet.

68
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:04,495
It doesn't make sense that
you keep on fighting me.

69
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:05,962
There is no reason
you should want

70
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:08,228
to save this worthless old man.

71
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,595
-You just shut up, bastard.

72
00:07:10,628 --> 00:07:13,595
Do you even have a clue as
to how many people's lives

73
00:07:13,628 --> 00:07:15,395
you have wrecked with
your selfish ideas?

74
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:22,228
You used the Kasumioji clan,
betrayed the Soul Reapers,

75
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:25,128
and became obsessed
with the Bakkoto.

76
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:27,728
But you think avenging your
father's death gives you

77
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:29,695
a free pass to do anything.

78
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:31,195
Have you thought
of the suffering

79
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:32,562
you've brought to others?

80
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:34,228
Did you ever think about that?

81
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:40,395
You brought that chaos
down on the Kasumioji clan,

82
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:45,362
but you were never able to
break Rurichiyo's spirit.

83
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:48,295
She accepted the
challenge of her destiny.

84
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:52,795
And unlike you, she didn't
run from its responsibility.

85
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:56,528
I'm ending this childish
revenge of yours.

86
00:07:56,562 --> 00:07:58,095
And I won't run away either.

87
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:02,928
-Maybe you should.

88
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:05,095
You're worn out.

89
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:06,195
-That's where you're wrong.

90
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:11,062
-Even if you become
a Hollow again,

91
00:08:11,095 --> 00:08:15,062
all of your Soul Reaper
attacks have been neutralized.

92
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:19,095
If we fight, your energy will
be too low for you to defeat me.

93
00:08:19,128 --> 00:08:23,628
-[laugh] Think that'll stop me?

94
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:27,162
This time, it seems like
you're the one underrating me.

95
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:27,962
-You're delusional.

96
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:46,028
He's reacting faster.

97
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:51,028
In that case-- Goen Ryuga.

98
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:58,362
That did it.

99
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:08,262
Now, Homura.

100
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:15,562
Damn it.

101
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:20,128
-Now I've got you.

102
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:22,262
-That's impressive.

103
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,728
I know exactly how you
blocked my first flame attack.

104
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:29,462
-I haven't quite
perfected it yet.

105
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:31,662
Just give me a chance
to get the hang of it,

106
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:34,528
and I'll be shutting
down all of your attacks.

107
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:35,562
-Really?

108
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:37,362
Then I'd better hurry
and finish this.

109
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:54,462
-Damn.

110
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:56,862
I have to figure
out that Bakkoto.

111
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:02,928
He keeps guarding
his right side.

112
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:05,862
That means his side with
the Bakkoto is weaker.

113
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:06,828
All right.

114
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:15,462
SHUSUKE (VOICEOVER): He's
changing his strategy.

115
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:17,828
Now, he's moving more
from side to side.

116
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:19,795
He's drawing my
attacks to his position

117
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,662
to cut down on my
attacks off the middle.

118
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:24,295
I'll fix that.

119

created a smokescreen

122
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:37,195
to conceal himself.

123
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:39,928
Will he attack
from out in front?

124
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:43,028
No, from the right.

125

-Getsuga Tensho.

126

-Just as I thought.

00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:50,628
-Getsuga Tensho.

128

-Watch out!

-Look what happened.

137
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:36,328
From what I see you won't
be using that sword again.

138
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:40,362
-You bastard.

139
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:41,828
-You're already beat up.

140
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:43,995
Even if you were to
defeat me and the old man,

141
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:46,062
you'd just make it
worse on yourself.

142
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:47,328
It's useless.

143
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:50,362
Keep fighting, and
you'll have nothing left.

144
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:54,128
-[laugh] What was that?

145
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:56,495
You say it's useless
to keep fighting.

146
00:11:56,528 --> 00:12:00,528
[laugh] I told you
before, I have already

147
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:02,195
thrown this life away.

148
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:05,862
If I can just see Genryusai
dead, then I've won.

149
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,095
I may die, but I'm taking
every one of you with me.

150
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,562
-Stop it, Shusuke.

151
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:19,062
You're already too weak.

152
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,395
If you keep feeding it any
more of your spirit energy,

153
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:22,862
you won't live.

154
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:25,095
-I don't care about that.

155
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:28,595
-He won't listen, so
he leaves me no choice.

156
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:30,895
I guess this is the only answer.

-Look at him.

161
00:12:37,362 --> 00:12:40,262
-For someone smart
enough to be a captain,

162
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:42,928
you're doing
something very stupid.

163
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,928
-I will have my revenge.

164
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:46,662
Nothing else matters.

165
00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:48,728
You can't stop this.

166
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:51,195
[shouting]

167
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:20,670
[grunt]

168
00:13:20,704 --> 00:13:21,170
-Ichigo.

169
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:38,004
-He has defeated him.

170
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:38,504
-Yes.

171
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:47,270
-Not yet.

172
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:49,070
There's still a
matter to be settled.

173
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:55,437
My father's revenge.

174
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,204
-Shusuke, stop this.

175
00:14:00,237 --> 00:14:02,070
[screaming]

[laughing]

177
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:14,270
-Captain Yamamoto.

178
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:15,137
-Old man.

179
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:15,970
YAMAMOTO: Stand fast.

180
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,404
-Shusuke, the head
captain isn't the one

181
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:26,037
who caused the death
of your father.

182
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,337
-What?

183
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,037
-Certainly your
father was a victim,

184
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,470
but his life was completely
consumed by the Bakkoto.

185
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,070
-[groan].

186
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:38,304
YORUICHI: As you know, in the
Kasumioji clan at that time,

187
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,537
Gyokaku Kumoi began misusing
the clan's special techniques

188
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,570
for the casting of royal swords.

189
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:45,237
He exploited their
ancient secrets

190
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,570
in order to develop the Bakkoto.

191
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:50,604
Then using his prototypes,
he began doing experiments

192
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:52,170
with them involving
test subjects.

193
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:57,804
UKITAKE: When the head
captain became aware

194
00:14:57,837 --> 00:15:00,237
of Kumoi's activities, he
attempted to intercede,

195
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,104
but he was overruled.

196
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,937
MALE SPEAKER: You will
cease your intervention

197
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,070
into actions of
the Kasumioji clan.

198
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:11,204
UKITAKE: The Kasumioji
used their immunity

199
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:13,604
extraterritoriality as a shield.

200
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:17,004
So he was denied the chance to
scrutinize Kumoi any further.

201
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:18,470
However--

202
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:22,637
-Captain Yamamoto, please sir,
allow me to handle this matter.

203
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,037
-Shin'etsu.

204
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,604
-I shall uncover the secret
of the suspicious sword

205
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:31,204
and bring that
secret back to you.

206
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:32,570
UKITAKE: Shin'etsu Kisaragi.

207
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:35,770
At the time, your father was
the head captain's subordinate

208
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:38,470
and an outstanding and
trustworthy student.

209
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,237
And so Genryusai's sensei
ordered him in utmost secrecy

210
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,704
to conduct a covert
investigation, but sadly--

211
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:46,570
[gasp]

212
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:52,870
-[laugh] A soul reaper.

213
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:57,004
You will be a valuable
test subject for me.

214
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:57,504
-Stop.

215
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:03,770
[groaning]

216
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:06,304
KUMOI: Go and kill the
person who sent you here.

217
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:17,570
[growling]

218
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,004
-Master.

219
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,704
YORUICHI: Due to the
sensitivity of the matter,

220
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,170
no one involved ever
revealed the truth about

221
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:48,804
Shin'etsu's death.

222
00:16:48,837 --> 00:16:50,670
The Bakkoto was
kept secret, as was

223
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:52,370
its undercover
investigation, which

224
00:16:52,404 --> 00:16:54,204
defied Central 46's orders.

225
00:16:56,937 --> 00:17:00,004
UKITAKE: And Shin'etsu's
death was swept away.

226
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:02,570
The head captain ostensibly
repaired and developed

227
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,504
good relations with
the Kasumioji clan.

228
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:09,704
You probably know that
from reading the records.

229
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:14,170
-So then, he killed
my father, because--

230
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:16,437
-Think of all the
anguish Old Man Yama

231
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,737
felt for having to
kill his own student.

232
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,837
Can you imagine
what that felt like?

233
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:28,170
SHUSUKE (VOICEOVER): Then I--
I was-- I was consumed by hate.

234
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:30,770
My anger blinded me, so
I couldn't see through

235
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:32,837
to the truth.

236
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,237
-Everything that you are,
and even your destiny

237
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,470
itself have been swallowed
whole by the Bakkoto.

238
00:17:39,504 --> 00:17:44,270
SHIN'ETSU: Beware of the
Bakkoto-- of the Bakkoto.

239
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:44,970
[groan]

240
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:55,537
YAMAMOTO: I still
regret what I did.

241
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,704
So you are Shin'etsu's son.

242
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:01,137
You are a lot like him.

243
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,604
-Head captain, sir.

244
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:07,870
In all of this, I was a
shallow fool, wasn't I?

245
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:10,204
-You need not be ashamed, son.

246
00:18:10,237 --> 00:18:13,137
Forgive me that I lacked
the ability to save you

247
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,770
and your father's life.

248
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:16,270
[whimper]

249
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:32,504
-Why?

250
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:33,604
Byakuya.

251
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:37,204
-This man still has
his dignity to uphold.

252
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:40,270
-He's a man who attained
the rank of captain.

253
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:42,904
He's earned the right to end
his life the way he wishes to.

254
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,137
-Izuru, forgive me
for dragging you

255
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,704
into such a selfish
personal matter.

256
00:18:53,737 --> 00:18:56,937
-Captain Amagai.

257
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,604
-I spent the best
times of my life

258
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,970
together with you and the men.

259
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:04,970
Farewell.

260
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:05,970
-Captain Amagai.

261
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:37,104
-Ichigo, I'm truly in your debt
for all you have done for us.

262
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:39,704
We are all here because
of what you did.

263
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:41,404
I thank all of you.

264
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:42,237
-You're welcome.

265
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,937
I'm glad we could help out.

266
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,504
-Thank you, Ichigo.

267
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:49,170
Because of your intervention,
our clan avoided banishment.

268
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:51,470
From the bottom of
my heart, thank you.

269
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:52,070
-What?

270
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:53,170
Sure.

271
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:56,537
-Now that's what I call
a sincere thank you.

272
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,004
-So Shu, are you going to stay
here with the Kasumioji clan?

273
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:01,604
-Yes.

274
00:20:01,637 --> 00:20:05,637
The wedding between us was
called off, but I-- you know,

275
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,970
I still like Rurichiyo.

276
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:08,804
-Stop.

277
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:10,270
Don't say anything more.

278
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:12,704
SHU: But I'm still your fiance.

279
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:15,070
-Are you sure about
your decision?

280
00:20:15,104 --> 00:20:18,304
You want to rule the
Kasumioji clan at your age?

281
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:20,304
-I am sure.

282
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:23,970
You have all risked your lives
trying to protect this clan.

283
00:20:24,004 --> 00:20:27,537
Now it is my turn to
take on that role.

284
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,437
-But you're finally free from
people wanting to kill you.

285
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,904
Don't you want to enjoy
growing up like other kids?

286
00:20:33,937 --> 00:20:36,704
-Whatever do you mean?

287
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,404
Thanks to you and
so many others,

288
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,270
I was able to fully
experience just

289
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:43,304
what the outside world is like.

290
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:46,304
I will never, ever forget
the world of the living,

291
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:47,870
or you and everyone
else, Ichigo.

292
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:51,170
I will treasure those
memories forever.

293
00:20:51,204 --> 00:20:53,004
But my future is here.

294
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:55,137
-I'm sure it is, Rurichiyo.

295
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,537
And if anything should
happen and you need our help,

296
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,770
we'll be here in no time.

297
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:01,570
-Thank you.

298
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:03,204
That will not be necessary.

299
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:05,037
-What?

300
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,070
-Asking for your help again
would only mean one thing.

301
00:21:08,104 --> 00:21:10,137
That the Kasumioji
clan has gotten itself

302
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,337
into another horrible
situation like this one.

303
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,537
-Ah

304
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,437
-Another tragic figure
such as Shusuke Amagai

305
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,137
must not be allowed to
come into existence.

306
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,237
My mission is to
make sure of that.

307
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,170
-That's brave of you.

308
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:29,370
-The next time you see me those
goals will already be met.

309
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:31,104
You will see.

310
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:32,837
-Sounds good.

311
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,037
I know you can do it.

312
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,537
-Mhm.

313
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:41,870
Ichigo, farewell.

314
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:43,370
Until we meet again.

315
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,026
[theme music]

316
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:48,342
-Whew.

317
00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:49,942
I'm glad we managed to
finally finish with that.

318
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:52,509
We need to get back quick
and check in with everyone.

319
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:53,742
RUKIA: I have to go somewhere.

320
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:54,775
So I'll see you later.

321
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,009
-We're in the Precipice World.

322
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:57,209
