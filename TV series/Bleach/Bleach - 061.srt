[theme music]

3
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,297
-But this is Sokyuko Hill.

4
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,663
AIZEN (OFFSCREEN):
Welcome Renji.

5
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:52,130
-Captain Aizen.

6
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:58,130
How did-- Then Gin
must have-- What the?

7
00:01:58,163 --> 00:01:58,797
What's going on?

8
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:04,297
-Leave Rukia where she
is, Renji, and back away.

9
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,797
-Captain Aizen.

10
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,163
How can this be?

11
00:02:19,197 --> 00:02:22,097
And what was it you just said?

12
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,430
-How odd.

13
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:26,630
I'm sure you must have
heard me the first time.

14
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:31,863
I said leave Rukia there, and
I told you to back away, Renji.

15
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,963
-Hearts of the south,
eyes of the north,

16
00:02:37,997 --> 00:02:40,330
fingertips of the west,
heals of the east,

17
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:43,230
gather holding the wind,
scatter, sweeping the rains.

18
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,663
Bakuro 58.

19
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:45,330
Kakushitsuijaku.

20
00:02:48,363 --> 00:02:56,963
31, 64, 83, I've
pointpointed where they went.

21
00:02:56,997 --> 00:03:00,097
3 32 degrees east
by 15 66 north.

22
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:05,297
It's the Sokyoku.

23
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:05,830
-Ah yes.

24
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:07,130
I see.

25
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,097
I want you to stay
here and locate

26
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,230
all of the captains,
all lieutenants,

27
00:03:11,263 --> 00:03:12,430
all seated officers.

28
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:14,330
Report to them
everything we've just

29
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:16,197
learned about what
Sosuka Aizen has done,

30
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,630
and make sure to tell
them where he's gone.

31
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:20,130
-Right.

32
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:23,930
-And then I want you
to be sure to get

33
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:27,497
the message to
those Ryoka as well.

34
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,063
-Yes.

35
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:29,697
I understand.

36
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,297
-I'm counting on you.

37
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,730
I must go now and try to save
the lives of Captain Hitsugaya

38
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:37,530
and Lieutenant Hinamori
before it's too late.

39
00:03:42,163 --> 00:03:46,730
-Black and white net, 22nd
bridge, 66 crown and cincture.

40
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:49,297
Footprints, distance
thunder, sharp arrow,

41
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,297
rotating land cover of night.

42
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,063
Sea of clouds, pale soldiers!

43
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:58,463
Form a circle, and then
charge through the heavens!

44
00:03:58,497 --> 00:03:58,963
Tenteikura!

45
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,030
Connections complete.

46
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:11,997
All court guard squad
captains, lieutenants,

47
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,463
and seated officers, may I
have your attention please,

48
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:17,897
and also, the Ryoka.

49
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,763
This is squad four
lieutenant Isane Kotetsu

50
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:22,397
with an urgent announcement.

51
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,330
-Isane.

52
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,297
ISANE (OFFSCREEN):
Listen closely,

53
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,197
as the message will
not be repeated.

54
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,697
This is an emergency report
from Captain Unohana regarding

55
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,797
the traitor in our midst.

56
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,797
As grim as the
following facts are,

57
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,363
what I'm about to
tell you is the truth.

58
00:04:37,397 --> 00:04:39,797
-Impossible.

59
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,097
Not Aizen.

60
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,997
-This cannot be.

61
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,030
-Well, you heard the lady.

62
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:47,030
What do we do, old man?

63
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:49,397
Doesn't this fight seem
a little pointless now?

64
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:55,263
-I can't believe it.

65
00:04:55,297 --> 00:04:56,030
My captain lost.

66
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:01,463
-How could he?

67
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:03,963
He said that he wouldn't.

68
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:06,263
That he wouldn't harm Momo.

69
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:08,430
-You mean he
murdered all of them?

70
00:05:08,463 --> 00:05:10,963
All of central 46?

71
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:11,997
-No way.

72
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,597
We've been betrayed.

73
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,897
By my captain.

74
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,397
-Kaname.

75
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:19,997
-Sir.

76
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,230
Did you hear the
report about Aizen?

77
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,030
-Of course I heard it.

78
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:25,897
Do you think I'm deaf?

79
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,797
-What shall we do?

80
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,563
-Hm.

81
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:32,397
I don't really care.

82
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,830
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Do
you this is all true?

83
00:05:34,863 --> 00:05:36,163
GENJU (OFFSCREEN): Maybe.

84
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:38,430
It might also be
the enemy's trap.

85
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,363
-Possible, but I think
it's probably true.

86
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:42,397
-Hm?

87
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,797
-Don't you sense the
spiritual pressure

88
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,097
that just appeared back
up at the execution site?

89
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,597
-Rukia.

90
00:05:54,463 --> 00:05:56,230
-What's that?

91
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:57,230
-I told you.

92
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:59,330
I won't leave Rukia.

93
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:03,163
I refuse to let her go.

94
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,897
-Very well then.

95
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,530
-That won't be necessary, Gin.

96
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:17,363
You are stubborn, Renji.

97
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:19,597
Since you won't let go
of her and stand down

98
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,897
as I ordered you,
I have no choice.

99
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,463
But I'll take your feelings
into consideration,

100
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:29,030
and I will let
you have your way.

101
00:06:32,163 --> 00:06:34,463
She can stay in your arms.

102
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:35,530
The rest of you goes.

103
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,597
-Renji?

104
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,563
-My, my.

105
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:52,230
I can see your defensive
skills have improved

106
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:55,463
a great deal, Renji Abarai.

107
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:59,563
I am happy to see that
you've continued to progress.

108
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:03,163
But I hope you won't
struggle for too long.

109
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:06,497
It's difficult for me
to control my power.

110
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,063
It's difficult to step on
ants without crushing them.

111
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,230
And as your former
superior, I would

112
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:14,597
prefer not to kill you
if I don't have to.

113
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:19,897
-Renji.

114
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,530
It's OK, Rukia.

115
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:24,430
Just shut up.

116
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:25,363
Yeha, right.

117
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:27,263
You don't want to kill me?

118
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,797
Then what about Momo?

119
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,363
You killed her in cold blood!

120
00:07:33,063 --> 00:07:35,930
-What happened to Momo
couldn't be helped.

121
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:40,263
I had trained her so that
she couldn't live without me.

122
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:42,697
So don't you think that killing
her was an act of mercy?

123
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:48,830
Still, what I said is true.

124
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:50,997
I did not want to
kill her myself.

125
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,897
That's why I went to all the
trouble of forging the letter,

126
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,630
leading her to attack
Izaru and Toshiro.

127
00:07:57,663 --> 00:08:01,130
But that didn't work out.

128
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:03,097
So I had no choice.

129
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,163
I had to finish her myself.

130
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:08,763
-So Momo, and Izaru.

131
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:13,563
They were all just puppets
in your twisted scheme?

132
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:17,863
-And you, too, Renji.

133
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,830
-I see.

134
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:22,630
I don't know who the monster
in front of me really is,

135
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:25,397
but you're not the Aizen I knew.

136
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,997
And I don't know why
you want her so badly,

137
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,897
but I'll never hand
Rukia over to you.

138
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,430
Even if it costs me my life!

139
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:34,597
-I've got some news
for you about the Aizen

140
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,397
you used to know.

141
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,197
I'm sorry to break
it to you, since you

142
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,297
seem to remember him so fondly.

143
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,263
That Aizen you knew was
nothing but an illusion.

144
00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:46,463
He never even existed
in the first place.

145
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:52,097
-Roar!

146
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,263
Zabimaru!

147
00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:57,497
-Shikai, huh?

148
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,963
You're probably at your limits.

149
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,930
But that won't even
buy you any time.

150
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:08,863
-That's what you think!

151
00:09:08,897 --> 00:09:10,330
-Petulant as ever.

152
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:16,730
-He stopped it with
his bare hands!

153
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:18,897
-Of the three of
you, I always thought

154
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,363
you would turn out to
be the most troublesome.

155
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:22,830
And I was right.

156
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,197
-Renji!

157
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:38,663
-I was right.

158
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:40,363
When I first met
the three of you,

159
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:42,397
I felt sure I could use you.

160
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,363
That's why I had you all
assigned to squad five

161
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,730
as soon as you joined
the 13 court guard

162
00:09:46,763 --> 00:09:49,997
squads I made Izaru
and Momo subordinates

163
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,030
for myself and for Gin.

164
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:54,363
You, however, were different.

165
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:56,663
So I decided to send
you, the problem

166
00:09:56,697 --> 00:10:00,030
child, away to a
different squad.

167
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,097
And, as it turns out, my
instincts were correct.

168
00:10:09,463 --> 00:10:11,563
I'll give you one more chance.

169
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:14,497
Put Rukia down and
get out of here.

170
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,197
-He'll do it, Captain Aizen!

171
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,363
I'll go with you if you want!

172
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:18,263
Just leave him alone!

173
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:19,263
-Shut up, Rukia.

174
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:20,630
I refuse!

175
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:21,563
-Renji, no!

176
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,563
-I won't let him
have you, Rukia.

177
00:10:33,563 --> 00:10:35,997
You thought I'd give her up?

178
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,797
Are you that dumb?

179
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,630
-Then so be it.

180
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:41,630
Too bad.

181
00:10:57,697 --> 00:10:59,063
-Hey, there.

182
00:10:59,097 --> 00:10:59,563
-Huh?

183
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,930
-What's the matter, Renji?

184
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:07,230
The way you were
crouching down, I'd

185
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:10,263
almost think Rukia's too heavy
for you to hold, or something.

186
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:13,397
Good thing I came
to give you a hand.

187
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,997
Right, friend?

188
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:38,607
-Ichigo.

189
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,374
-Yeah?

190
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,174
-I'm sorry.

191
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,707
I'm sorry you had to come.

192
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,174
-What happened to you?

193
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:46,474
-Huh?

194
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,840
-All you had to do was carry
Rukia away, and look at you.

195
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,940
Either she gained a lot
of weight, or you're weak.

196
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:52,574
'Cause you look all beat up.

197
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:53,307
-Hah!

198
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,740
Yeah, look who's talking.

199
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:56,107
Maybe instead of
coming here, you

200
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,507
should have gone back to bed.

201
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,940
-You've got a lot
of nerve talking

202
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:01,474
like that to the guy who
just came to save your butt!

203
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:03,407
-I was about to
thank you, you idiot,

204
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,507
but I'm not going to now!

205
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,074
-Hm?

206
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:09,374
[muffled gasps]

207
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:10,340
-Huh?

208
00:12:10,374 --> 00:12:13,174
-Thanks, stupid!

209
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,540
Do you think I'm trying
to make a new world

210
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:16,974
record for holding my breath?

211
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:18,874
You were crushing
the wind outta me!

212
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:20,674
You almost killed me!

213
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:21,940
-Sorry about that.

214
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,440
I didn't think you'd want
me to interfere, Sosuke,

215
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:26,040
so I let the Ryoka get by.

216
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:27,374
-No matter.

217
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:28,907
It's fine.

218
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,374
When you're cleaning the house,
it doesn't make any difference

219
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:36,840
whether there's one
piece of dirt, or two.

220
00:12:36,874 --> 00:12:39,774
-So, this is Aizen, then.

221
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,040
-That's him.

222
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:44,074
-Do you think you still
have enough strength left

223
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:45,340
to get away?

224
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:46,840
-I have enough to
stay and fight.

225
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:48,607
I know that for certain.

226
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,440
And that's what I'm going to do.

227
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:54,074
You know damn well that
it's useless for us to run.

228
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,574
Zabimaru may be
broken, but he still

229
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,874
has a few surprises left in him.

230
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:01,340
Let's just slow him
down enough to get away.

231
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:02,607
-Hah.

232
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,140
Who needs a plan B?

233
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:07,274
If we join forces and battle
together, what could go wrong?

234
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:07,774
-Right.

235
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,874
I can only use this
technique a single time.

236
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:19,374
But if it connects,
it'll leave him

237
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:21,874
wide open for a second or two.

238
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:23,640
You've got to strike
in that opening.

239
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:24,607
-I gotcha.

240
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,340
-This may hurt a bit, Zabimaru.

241
00:13:31,374 --> 00:13:32,307
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,240
But you've got to hang in there.

243
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,374
Here we go!

244
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:41,874
Zabimaru!

245
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:43,374
Higa Zekko!

246
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,707
-Yah!

247
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:18,674
Ah!

248
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,174
-Well, now.

249
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:34,740
I thought I had succeeded in
cutting you completely in half.

250
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:38,640
But I didn't strike deep enough.

251
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:39,140
-Ichigo.

252
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,440
Where' he go?

253
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:48,340
Dammit.

254
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:56,707
-Ichigo.

255
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,207
Renji!

256
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:01,407
I-- I can't move.

257
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:12,040
-Come, now.

258
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:14,907
Stand up, Rukia Kuchiki.

259
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:22,140
Hm.

260
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:23,140
Oh.

261
00:15:23,174 --> 00:15:24,607
I see.

262
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,974
My spiritual pressure has
caused your body to go limp.

263
00:15:31,174 --> 00:15:32,140
[gasping]

264
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,840
-Ichigo.

265
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,107
-Poor doomed thing.

266
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,740
Is he actually still conscious?

267
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:50,607
Your stamina is
amazing, but your spine

268
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,307
is barely connected
to your body.

269
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,307
You should lie still.

270
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,174
At any rate, you have
each served your purpose.

271
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:03,807
Your job in all
this is done now.

272
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,874
-Our job is done?

273
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:09,407
-That's correct.

274
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,840
I knew you were coming.

275
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:12,874
I even knew from where.

276
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:15,707
I knew you would arrive in
the West Rukon district.

277
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,674
That's why I had
security increased there,

278
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:20,807
with squad members
stationed at the gate.

279
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,007
I had Gin go there as well,
in case something went wrong.

280
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,407
I lowered the wall around
the Sereitei wall right

281
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,807
after your arrival, and
placed third and ninth squads

282
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,174
behind the gate.

283
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:33,140
I knew the only way
you'd be able to get in

284
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:35,640
would be with Kukaku
Shiba's Flower Cream Cannon.

285
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:38,907
A very flashy entrance
that everyone would notice.

286
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,907
A bold approach.

287
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,940
It helped that you Ryoka
were skilled enough

288
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:44,540
to get past the captains.

289
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:46,807
As a result, the eyes
of all the soul reapers

290
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,474
were focused only on you.

291
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,840
The perfect diversion.

292
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:53,640
Your actions after you entered
the court and all the turmoil

293
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:56,640
that you caused were
actually quite impressive.

294
00:16:56,674 --> 00:16:59,874
As a result, there wasn't
very much fuss at all over me

295
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:03,374
when I faked my own death.

296
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:06,507
You made it easy for
me to make my move.

297
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,940
-But-- hold on.

298
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:10,274
How did you know
for sure that we

299
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:12,107
were going to come in
through the West Rukon

300
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,540
district in the first place?

301
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,640
-That's an odd question
for you to ask.

302
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:19,640
Where else could you
possibly have entered?

303
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:22,840
The Western Rukon district is
Kisuke Urahara's headquarters,

304
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,140
after all.

305
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:26,074
It's the only place
you can break through

306
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:28,807
with his Senkaimon.

307
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,340
Why do you find
that so surprising?

308
00:17:31,374 --> 00:17:34,940
After all, you work
for him, don't you?

309
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:37,240
Surely the reason you're
here in the first place

310
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:40,740
is to retrieve Rukia
Kuchiki under his orders.

311
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:42,407
-I-- I don't--

312
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,040
-Oh, I see.

313
00:17:44,074 --> 00:17:45,074
You poor boy.

314
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:48,207
You weren't told
anything, were you?

315
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,507
Oh, well.

316
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,940
Since this is the end anyway,
I'll tell you one last thing.

317
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,774
Did you know that soup reapers
have four basic fighting

318
00:17:57,807 --> 00:17:58,707
methods?

319
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,107
Zanjutsu, Hakura,
Hoho, and Kido.

320
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,574
Those are the four.

321
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,007
But there is a limit to how
strong a soul reaper can

322
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,807
become in any one of them.

323
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,107
No matter which of the
techniques he chooses,

324
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:15,240
there comes a point at which
you will have mastered it.

325
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:17,974
And all his growth
will stop there.

326
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:21,474
As a soul reaper, he
has reached his limit.

327
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:25,274
However, for some it is
possible to get past that wall,

328
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:29,440
and to exceed the limit that's
built into all four techniques.

329
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:33,240
And to do that,
there's only one way.

330
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:38,107
The soul reaper has
to become a Hollow.

331
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,340
Either that, or a Hollow can
become like a soul reaper.

332
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:48,707
Either way, what is
required is the removal

333
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,007
of the barrier between those
two opposing existences.

334
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,107
That is the key to making the
spirit's power even greater.

335
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,174
In theory, the idea
seemed plausible,

336
00:18:57,207 --> 00:18:59,074
so I studied it in secret.

337
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:01,974
I started testing,
focusing mostly

338
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,274
on the transformation of
Hollows into soul reapers.

339
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:08,440
I was successful in creating
Hollows which came close.

340
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:10,774
Hollows that could hide
their spiritual pressure.

341
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:13,574
Even one that could
zanpakuto with a touch,

342
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:17,807
and fuse with
other soul reapers.

343
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,607
But, in the end, none of
them worked out as well

344
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,007
as I had hoped.

345
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,974
It appeared that
the theory was only

346
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:28,707
that, destined never
to be a reality.

347
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,274
But, Kisuke Urahara
succeeded where I had failed.

348
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,774
The mechanism he invented
removes the barrier

349
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:39,974
dividing Hollow and soul
reaper, instantly making one

350
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:41,374
into the other.

351
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:45,007
It defied all logic
within the soul society.

352
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,340
It's called hogyoku.

353
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:51,240
I knew immediately
how dangerous it was.

354
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,440
I think Urahara
felt the same way.

355
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:55,740
He tried to destroy
it, but he was

356
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:58,674
unable to find a way to
undo his own creation.

357
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:03,407
Instead, he reluctantly
resorted to another method.

358
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,607
He created a shield around
the hogyoku and activated it.

359
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,607
Then he enveloped it
deep within a konpaku

360
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,774
in order to try to conceal
its location from anyone

361
00:20:12,807 --> 00:20:16,474
who would want to
use it for evil.

362
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,340
You know, don't you?

363
00:20:19,374 --> 00:20:21,474
You know that's why I want you.

364
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:24,740
Because the place Urahara
decided to hide the hogyoku

365
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:27,974
is inside you.

366
00:20:28,007 --> 00:20:31,707
-What did you just say?

367
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,140
-When I learned
you had disappeared

368
00:20:33,174 --> 00:20:36,340
in the world of the living,
I realized right away

369
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:39,407
that Urahara had
something to do with it.

370
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,074
All soul reapers and gigai are
traceable by the Soul Society,

371
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:44,840
no matter where they go.

372
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:47,874
This is because of the
gigai's healing energy.

373
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:50,640
But the gigai Urahara
gave you was different,

374
00:20:50,674 --> 00:20:53,607
created by him without reishi.

375
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,307
As a result, it was untraceable.

376
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:02,207
For this offense, Urahara was
cast out of the Soul Society.

377
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,740
There is also one other
reason Urahara was exiled.

378
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:10,807
A gigai like the one he
gave you, one without reishi

379
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,874
will constantly
break down and devour

380
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:15,540
the reishi of the
soul reaper using it.

381
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,574
He will never be able to
completely recover his power.

382
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:21,540
It will fade, and eventually
the connection with you

383
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:23,540
gigai will dim.

384
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:28,240
Finally, the soul reaper
is reduced to a mere human.

385
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:30,207
Do you understand?

386
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,507
Urahara didn't give
you any strength.

387
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,374
He didn't help you at all.

388
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:36,774
He used you, Rukia Kuchiki.

389
00:21:36,807 --> 00:21:42,307
He turned you into a human, just
so he could hide the hogyoku.

390
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,407
-What's the matter, Rukia?

391
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,540
You seem upset?

392
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:46,474
Can I help you?

393
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:47,707
With a gigai, perhaps?

394
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,440
-Fortunately, before
it was too late,

395
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:57,374
you were found in the
human world and arrested.

396
00:21:57,407 --> 00:22:04,340
I went immediately to
central 46 and kill-- Hm?

397
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:04,840
-Aizen!

398
00:22:21,562 --> 00:22:31,595
[theme music]

399
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:54,424
[theme music]

400
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:57,557
-Did everyone understand
what I was talking about?

401
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,057
I tried to make it simple
enough for even stupid people

402
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:00,757
to understand.

403
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,557
-What'd you say?

404
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,824
We just me!

405
00:23:02,857 --> 00:23:05,024
How'd you already know I'm
stupid, you arrogant jerk?

406
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:07,957
-So, you don't deny
that you're stupid.

407
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,057
-I guess you got me there.
