Years and years and years

And yet, it must never be known.

You're still dressed

It's festival time.

you're listening to today?

like you're feeling nervous.

That's just their
custom, I guess.

If anyone's to
blame for that, it's

who lost to him.

-Hm.

113

She's already started
her new position.

114

-What was her hurry?

115
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,622
It's not like it's
urgent or anything.

-And now, Squad 12.

123
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,588
Which makes me wonder
if everything's

everything, you know.

Old Man Yamamoto, right?

about Capt. Unohana.

That's right.

134

I might get scolded for
forgetting my great senior.

135
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:25,822
Now, I'm scared.

136
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:27,288
-What are you so scared of?

137

-Uh.

138

We were just talking about how
it's such a nice day outside,

That's all.

141

Right?

00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,222

144

-Our captain is such a
complete idiot sometimes.

145
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:44,022
-Squad 3 had a retirement.

146
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:46,888
Squad 12 had a promotion.

147
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:50,422
Unlike Squad 10, they didn't
have a death within the ranks.

148
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:53,255
In that sense, I'd say
Squad 12 has been lucky.

149
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:54,655
-Yeah.

150
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:55,422
SOSUKE: Promotion?

151
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:55,922
-Hm?

152
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:58,088
-Huh?

153
00:07:58,122 --> 00:08:00,422
-Hey, back in rank, Sosuke.

154
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:01,455
-Pardon me.

155
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:03,722
I couldn't help but overhear.

156
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:05,488
-Oh, that's OK, Sosuke.

157
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:06,455
Go ahead.

158
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:07,722
What is it?

159
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:08,888
-Sorry to interrupt.

160
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,188
But we, lieutenants,
haven't been told anything.

161
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:13,822
Was Capt. Hikifune
of Squad 12 promoted?

162
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:16,722
Because I was under the
assumption she retired.

163
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:18,655
-Yes?

164
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:23,222
-Then was she promoted
from captain to Central 46?

165
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:25,288
That would be quite
an accomplishment.

166
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:29,622
In fact, I've never heard
of it happening before.

167
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,822
-Not Central 46.

168
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:39,055
Instead, she went to the
Royal Guard, Squad 0.

169
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:42,922
-The-- the Royal Guard?

170
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,188
-What's this?

171
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,522
Why are you all
blocking the corridor?

172
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:47,722
-Pardon me, I didn't realize.

173
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:58,688
-Tell him, congratulations.

174
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:00,488
-If you have a
congratulatory message,

175
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:01,922
tell him in person,
Capt. Unohana.

176
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:05,788
-Say what?

177
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:12,488
The newcomer's that
guy from Squad 2?

178
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,791
[grunts]

179
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,724
-You call that hiding your
spiritual pressure, Kisuke?

180
00:09:57,757 --> 00:10:00,624
-Um, I totally let
you notice on purpose.

181
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:03,357
-You're too cocky.

182
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,357
-Huh?

183
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:06,291
-[grunts]

184
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,624
-[gasps]

185
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,824
My dentist thanks you
for pulling your punch

186
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:20,691
and not knocking my teeth out.

187
00:10:20,724 --> 00:10:22,991
-You're welcome, but I was
just loosening the tightness

188
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:23,624
in my shoulder.

189
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:27,624
[grunts]

190
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:30,357
-He-he, looks like you're
a little more stressed out

191
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:30,924
than usual.

192
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:32,324
-[chuckles]

193
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:35,491
I'm at that tender age where one
has lots of worries, you know?

194
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:37,091
-Worries?

195
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:38,024
Don't tease me.

196
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:39,491
I'm sure someone
like you doesn't

197
00:10:39,524 --> 00:10:41,957
have a worry in
the world. [laughs]

198
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,791
Ugh! [groans]

199
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:45,091
-But enough about me.

200
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:46,857
How's everything going with you?

201
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:48,024
-Huh?

202
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:51,157
Well, things seem to be
moving along accordingly.

203
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:52,324
-Excellent.

204
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:54,724
I'm counting on you, Third Seat.

205
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:55,991
-Hm?

206
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:57,457
Right.

207
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,957
By the way, Captain.

208
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,957
What did you want to
see me about anyway?

209
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,024
-Oh, the head
captain summoned me.

210
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:05,024
-Huh?

211
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:06,591
-He asked me to
recommend someone

212
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,024
for the new captain position.

213
00:11:09,057 --> 00:11:09,924
-What?

214
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:11,791
Don't tell me it's me.

215
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:14,157
-There'll be a captain's
exam coming up.

216
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:15,124
-[sighs]

217
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:19,091
WOMAN: Welcome
back, Lady Yoruichi.

218
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:24,891
Uh!

219
00:11:24,924 --> 00:11:25,924
Lady Yoruichi?

220
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:27,124
-[yawns]

221
00:11:27,157 --> 00:11:29,824
I'm so tired.

222
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,691
-Lady Yoruichi!

223
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:36,991
Lady Yoruichi, you make
too much of that man.

224
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:37,824
-Huh?

225
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:38,991
No, I don't.

226
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:40,724
I don't make anything of him.

227
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:42,624
-Please don't joke
around with me.

228
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:44,524
The appointment of a
captain is serious.

229
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:46,391
And I may be stepping
outside my bounds,

230
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:47,957
but I'm going to speak my mind.

231
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:49,857
-Hm.

232
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,291
-Kisuke Urahara is
a complete mess.

233
00:11:52,324 --> 00:11:53,757
Forget about making
him a captain.

234
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,257
I think it was a
mistake to give him

235
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,224
a command within
your very own squad.

236
00:11:57,257 --> 00:11:58,891
And not just any
command, but one

237
00:11:58,924 --> 00:12:02,424
of the five units of the Stealth
Force-- the Confinement Unit.

238
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:04,724
The Confinement Unit
keeps dangerous elements

239
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:05,524
under control.

240
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,757
It is a crucial department!

241
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,057
Captain, I'm telling you, he's
not suited to be in charge.

242
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:19,891
Third Seat, I have a
message from the captain.

243
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:22,557
Third Seat, are you there?

244
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:23,324
Please respond.

245
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:29,624
Third Seat, are you-- ugh.

246
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:30,124
Ugh.

247
00:12:33,157 --> 00:12:34,391
-I'm sorry.

248
00:12:34,424 --> 00:12:35,957
I was taking a nap.

249
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:37,857
-What is that putrid smell?

250
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,757
-Huh?

251
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,891
No.

252
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:42,924
I've been cooped up in
here for quite a while.

253
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:46,657
So long, I didn't realize how
bad the place was getting, hm.

254
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:49,691
Research makes me
lose track of time.

255
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:50,991
-He's unclean and silly.

256
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:54,157
What he lacks in hygiene is
worsened by his laziness.

257
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,157
-Huh?

258
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,991
No, he's not a
go-getter, that's true.

259
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:01,424
But what I want to know
is, why are you so hung up

260
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:03,724
on Kisuke Urahara anyway?

261
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:05,691
-I'm not hung-up on him!

262
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:06,757
Ngh.

263
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,891
There is nothing
redeeming about that man!

264
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:13,824
-Sounds like you're
hung-up to me. [laughs]

265
00:13:13,857 --> 00:13:14,324
-Ngh.

266
00:13:24,757 --> 00:13:26,824
Kisuke Urahara may be
an old acquaintance

267
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:30,491
of Lady Yoruichi's, but she's
being way too easy on him.

268
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:41,324
I must keep warning her until
she sees I'm right about this.

269
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:05,191
He has absolutely no respect for
his position as a Soul Reaper.

270
00:14:05,224 --> 00:14:08,157
[chatter]

271
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:14,624
-Go!

272
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:15,624
Go!

273
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,091
Go!

274
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:17,591
-Yeah!

275
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,691
Ha-ha!

276
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:22,524
-Shirking all his duties
to play with kids.

277
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:28,157
Misappropriation of funds.

278
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:40,024
Drinking sake during the day?

279
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:40,524
Uh.

280
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:41,024
Uhm.

281
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:46,524
Once she learns
how he really is,

282
00:14:46,557 --> 00:14:49,824
Lady Yoruichi will be sure
to change her mind about him.

283
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:57,924
I will tear away
his sheep's clothing

284
00:14:57,957 --> 00:15:02,324
and open Lady Yoruichi's eyes.

285
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:03,457
Excuse me, Captain.

286
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:03,957
Ungh!

287
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:12,791
-Hey, perfect timing.

288
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:15,357
-Oh, hello, Sui-Feng.

289
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:17,091
-I've been talking about you.

290
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,891
Kisuke is going to take
the captain's exam.

291
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:23,657
-Lady Yoruichi, I beg
you to reconsider.

292
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,224
-I won't.

293
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,891
Not only that, but I also
think you should accompany him

294
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:28,924
to the exam.

295
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:29,424
-Hm.

296
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:34,857
-Normally, only
captains are allowed

297
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:37,291
to be present for these
special proceedings,

298
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:39,957
but I made a specific
request for you.

299
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:42,091
-But why do I have
to go with him?

300
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:44,357
-No need to pretend.

301
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:45,957
It's obvious that
you have feelings

302
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:48,257
for our soon-to-be captain.

303
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,424
-Huh?

304
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:52,591
What are you talking about?

305
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:54,457
YORUICHI: Don't be embarrassed.

306
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:56,824
I know how Kisuke can't
go anywhere in town

307
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:59,224
without you tailing
along behind him.

308
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:00,024
SUI-FENG: No!

309
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:02,624
You got it all wrong!

310
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,457
I was following him for you.

311
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:06,924
I wanted proof that he's
lazy and incompetent.

312
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:09,291
He's not worthy of
your recommendation.

313
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:11,457
Believe me, I'm
not the least bit

314
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:13,257
interested in Kisuke Uruhara!

315
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:19,924
Please, I guarantee
that if you read this,

316
00:16:19,957 --> 00:16:23,391
you'll be sure to change
your mind about him.

317
00:16:23,424 --> 00:16:23,891
-Hm.

318
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:27,224
-Huh.

319
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:31,191
Huh!

320
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,757
Check it out, Kisuke,
your daily activities

321
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,024
have been recorded
here in great detail.

322
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:39,357
-Oh, that's amazing!

323
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:43,391
-He shirks his duty as a member
of the 13 Court Guard Squads.

324
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:45,857
He wanders around the
district in search of fun.

325
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:48,024
And he produces no results.

326
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:51,157
Is this the behavior
of the Third Seat?

327
00:16:51,191 --> 00:16:51,657
-Oh.

328
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:56,991
-Speak up if you want
to vindicate yourself.

329
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:59,757
-No argument from me,
you're absolutely right.

330
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,891
-What?

331
00:17:00,924 --> 00:17:02,857
-Well, you're consistent,
I'll give you that.

332
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:04,457
-I guess so.

333
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,057
-Sui-Feng, excellent work.

334
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,557
You're completely
right about him.

335
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:08,724
-Thanks.

336
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:10,724
YORUICHI: It's obvious
from this journal, you're

337
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:13,291
totally in love
with him! [laughs]

338
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:16,024
I told you, I don't have
any feelings for him!

339
00:17:16,057 --> 00:17:17,391
-[laughs]

340
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:18,557
Come on, Sui-Feng.

341
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,524
You're much too serious.

342
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:21,024
-Ngh.

343
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:26,391
-Third Seat, pardon me.

344
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:27,657
-Did you locate them?

345
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:28,724
-Yes, sir.

346
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,257
-What's this about?

347
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,591
-Excuse me, but some
people I've grown

348
00:17:32,624 --> 00:17:35,257
very attached to seem to
have left without permission.

349
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,691
And they have
recently been found.

350
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:37,857
-I see.

351
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,891
Well, that can't be helped.

352
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:42,624
I'll go to the exam site
myself and get things rolling.

353
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:43,624
-Right.

354
00:17:43,657 --> 00:17:44,291
-Please wait.

355
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:45,791
Don't go yet.

356
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,924
Knowing Kisuke, he will
somehow screw this up.

357
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:50,424
And if he doesn't make it
back to the exam on time,

358
00:17:50,457 --> 00:17:52,757
he will ruin Squad
2's reputation

359
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,891
and smear your name as well.

360
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,591
KISUKE: Nah, don't worry.

361
00:17:56,624 --> 00:17:59,257
-As if we could ever trust you.

362
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,124
-Come to the exam
when you're done.

363
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:02,224
-Right.

364
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:04,091
-No, wait!

365
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,124
It's a mistake.

366
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:06,491
-We're going, Sui-Feng.

367
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:08,024
Get ready.

368
00:18:08,057 --> 00:18:09,924
-Mm.

369
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:10,424
Hm.

-[pants]

371
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:22,761
Where are they hiding out?

372
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:24,094
-They're inside.

373
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,794
But I think they detected us
and compromised our position.

374
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:28,294
-Those things can't be helped.

375
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:29,961
I kind of expected this.

376
00:18:29,994 --> 00:18:32,761
I'm pretty sure they're
watching our moves as well.

377
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:35,294
It's going to come down to
who gets impatient first.

378
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:40,627
-Uh!

379
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,127
-Huh?

380
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:46,561
-The men from the bar.

381
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:53,161
What's going on here?

382
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:54,227
Who's in that place?

383
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:56,061
-They're deserters hiding out.

384
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,527
-Deserters?

385
00:18:57,561 --> 00:18:58,994
-I guess the air
in the Seireitei

386
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:00,561
didn't suit their
extravagant tastes.

389
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:09,427
-Just a threat.

390
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:12,561
They're not ready
to come out yet.

391
00:19:12,594 --> 00:19:17,027
But I do have a promise
to keep with Yoruichi.

392
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:19,294
-What are you going to do?

393
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:22,494
-I'm just going over there.

394
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:23,461
-Wait!

395
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:25,094
You don't intend
to go by yourself

396
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,661
to face this massive
spiritual pressure alone?

397
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:31,994
Kisuke!

398
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:33,094
-Stay back, all right?

They can take care of the rest.

it in plenty of time.

has been raving about
for so long now.

Uh, huh, please don't tell
me that I'm the last one
