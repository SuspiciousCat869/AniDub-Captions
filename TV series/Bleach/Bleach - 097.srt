SQUAD MEMBER: Here's my report.

6
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:53,746
We've confirmed the
rumors of strange events

7
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,613
in Kusajishi, Captain.

8
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:57,546
-Just what sort of events?

9
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,480
-Someone has gathered all
the able-bodied men together,

10
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:03,713
and has put them to work cutting
down trees in Kusajishi Forest.

11
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,480
-Captain.

12
00:02:05,513 --> 00:02:07,980
-And are the Bounts behind this?

13
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:09,413
-On the surface,
the leader seems

14
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:13,080
to be the bookie who runs one
of Kusahishi's gambling dens.

15
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:15,113
-Who's behind all of this?

16
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:18,446
-Well, there are some clues,
but nothing definite yet.

17
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,913
-What should we do now?

18
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:22,113
-This is the clue
I've been waiting for.

19
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:24,413
We're going to have to
investigate it ourselves.

20
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:26,346
-Are you going to
search the forest?

21
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,480
-No, not the forest.

22
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:30,746
We're going to see Renji Abarai.

23
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,380
-All right, but why are
we going to see him?

24
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:35,780
-Because Renji has had more
contact with the Bounts

25
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:39,346
than anyone else, and I need to
find out everything he knows.

26
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,680
And you're coming with me.

27
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:57,580
-I just got another report from
our scout on Kariya's gang.

28
00:02:57,613 --> 00:02:58,846
-So let's hear it.

29
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,913
What kind of trouble's
he stirring up?

30
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:02,046
-Plenty.

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,880
He's gathered a pretty
big crowd of followers

32
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:05,280
in just a short time.

33
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:07,813
Word is he's lured in thugs
and low lifes from all

34
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:09,380
over Kusajishi already.

35
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:11,080
They're are pretty
tough bunch, too,

36
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:12,780
but of course, they
don't have any spirit

37
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:14,046
energy on their side.

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,746
So even in large
numbers, they can't

39
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,313
hope to win against
Soul Reapers in the end.

40
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:21,046
-Except Soul Reapers won't fight
for real against ordinary Rukon

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,746
District folk.

42
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,313
And fighting while continually
holding yourself back

43
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:26,846
is a huge burden.

44
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,213
-Good point.

45
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:29,480
You're right.

46
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:32,213
-The Bounts are well accustomed
to being outnumbered.

47
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,646
I think we can count on them
coming up with a bunch of ways

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,946
to go up against the Seireitei.

49
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,980
-What's your plan, then?

50
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:42,146
-We're going to stop them.

51
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,380
Mobs never have any discipline.

52
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:47,013
We'll take advantage of that
and make it easier for the Soul

53
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:49,980
Reapers to fight them by
breaking up the crowd.

54
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:52,346
Which is where you
come in, brother.

55
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,146
-Since when am I
your brother, Ganju?

56
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,646
-Look, we don't have
a lot of time here.

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,980
I need you to gather as
many men as you can, Bull.

58
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:03,080
-Ganju.

59
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:05,680
Why the hell's this
suddenly so important?

60
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:08,213
-A certain friend of mine
is working really hard

61
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:11,446
to take down the Bounts, and
he's asked me for my help.

62
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,213
That's all there is to it.

63
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:17,013
-So who is it?

64
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:18,080
-Ganju.

65
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:20,446
You must be talking
about Ichigo, right?

66
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
-Mm-hm.

67
00:04:21,713 --> 00:04:24,146
-Ah, the amazing and
beautiful power of friendship.

68
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,013
When we have that, none of
us are ever completely alone,

69
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:28,313
are we?

70
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:30,246
Helping one another is the
most important thing of all.

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,213
That's what I--

72
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:33,513
-Oh, be quiet!

73
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:35,113
Anyway, the Bounts
gave this friend

74
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:37,113
of mine a real rough time.

75
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:39,480
And I want to make
sure he survives this.

76
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,646
-A bond between friends?

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Coming from you, that's
a little bit surprising.

78
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:45,713
Well, all right.

79
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:47,446
I never liked that
bookie anyway,

80
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,313
so I'll join up with you.

81
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:51,946
I, Daiji Hirasago,
the Bull of Kusajishi,

82
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,280
hereby agree to help you, Ganju.

83
00:04:54,313 --> 00:04:56,780
-I guess the Bull of Kusajishi
wasn't your real name

84
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,413
after all.

85
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:00,213
-What made you
decide to go by that

86
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:04,013
instead of using your real name?

87
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:05,980
-Because it's cool!

88
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:07,746
-He's just as bad as Ganju.

89
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,213
-Uh-huh.

90
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:11,546
-Hey, Konboi, Max, Lady.

91
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,280
-Yes, boss?

92
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,213
-Round up everyone you can
find, and get ready to move out.

93
00:05:33,946 --> 00:05:35,480
-If nothing else,
it looks like we've

94
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:37,413
gotten better at
repairing things.

95
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:39,713
-With all of the Ryoka
invasions of late,

96
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:42,213
there's no shortage of
practice for both the swordsmen

97
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:43,746
and the brick layers.

98
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,680
-No matter how many
times we repair it,

99
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:48,213
the issue has not
yet been addressed.

100
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:50,146
We still don't know
who destroyed it,

101
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,580
or what their purpose was.

102
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:53,480
-It was obviously a diversion.

103
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:55,513
-Oh?

104
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:57,546
-No doubt the Bounts
did this immediately

105
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,513
upon their arrival to focus
our attention elsewhere.

106
00:06:00,546 --> 00:06:02,313
-Well then, why did
they destroy something

107
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,280
that's so easily repairable?

108
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,146
-Ah, you are naive.

109
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,280
Don't you see?

110
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:10,246
The distraction
this provided was

111
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,480
intended to be
mental, not physical.

112
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:16,946
The entire Seireitei is
in complete chaos now.

113
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,080
-Hm.

114
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:22,013
-How lazy we must have
become, to let intruders

115
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:23,713
into the Seireitei so easily.

116
00:06:27,246 --> 00:06:30,346
But wait.

117
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,380
I wonder--

118
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:33,580
-Is there anything wrong?

119
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:38,613
-What is it?

120
00:06:38,646 --> 00:06:39,613
-It can't.

121
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:44,513
It's nothing.

122
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:45,680
Come, Nemu.

123
00:06:45,713 --> 00:06:47,380
I just remembered there's
someplace I have to be.

[scream]

125
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,980
-An exploding egg?

126
00:07:21,613 --> 00:07:23,546
-You have weird dreams, Ichigo.

127
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,113
-You slept too long.

128
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,546
-About time you finally woke up.

129
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,180
Now, let's eat.

130
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:36,113
-Mm.

131
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:40,313
-Ran'Tao.

132
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:41,780
-Hm?

133
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:44,746
-So, do you think we can
pick up where we left off?

134
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,080
-I'm so sorry about yesterday.

135
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:49,646
Now, what was it
you wanted to ask?

136
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,813
-Well, it's about your face.

137
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:54,613
-What?

138
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:57,580
-I met a Bount in the
world of the living,

139
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:00,146
and her face looked exactly
like yours, Ran'Tao.

140
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,113
Yoshino Soma.

141
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:08,013
That was her name.

142
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:10,146
So, what do you think it means?

143
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,246
-That's what I've
been wondering about.

144
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,580
How could that even be possible?

145
00:08:16,813 --> 00:08:18,780
-From what you tell
me, I'd say this Bount

146
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:20,446
you met is probably
one of my copies.

147
00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:24,613
-Copies?

148
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:26,880
-In the original experiments
that resulted in the Bounts,

149
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:29,780
we were trying to
create immortal souls.

150
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:33,080
Therefore we did not use
normal souls for that purpose.

151
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,413
-What kind of souls did you use?

152
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:38,380
-We created artificial souls
that were based on our own,

153
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:39,913
and then we modified
them according

154
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:42,113
to the parameters
of the experiments.

155
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,746
--Artificial souls?

156
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,180
-We did that to be
safe, because even

157
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,980
though the creation
of eternal life

158
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:51,746
was theoretically possible,
we knew that using human souls

159
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,213
was ethically on
questionable ground.

160
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:56,680
So we decided to use
our own souls as models

161
00:08:56,713 --> 00:09:00,180
to create the artificial
versions based on them.

162
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:00,980
-Then what?

163
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:02,513
-There was an accident.

164
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:04,813
The artificial souls
suffered a mutation,

165
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:07,680
and were incorporated
into the cycle of rebirth.

166
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,746
-So the Bounts are a mutation?

167
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,880
-Yes.

168
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:12,546
And though we started
with artificial souls,

169
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,813
the fact remains they were
based on those of Soul Reapers.

170
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,780
As a result, the
Bounts can be expected

171
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:20,013
to possess incredible powers.

172
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:21,513
-Now I see.

173
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,780
So they can use their
dolls in the same way

174
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,746
that Soul Reapers
use their zanpakuto.

175
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,013
Is that right?

176
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,413
-Indeed.

177
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,746
Since then, the research
into artificial souls

178
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,980
has grown a great deal.

179
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:34,713
And eventually the gikongan
mod-soul technologies

180
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:35,346
were developed.

181
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,480
-Wait a minute.

182
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:38,446
Then that must mean that
the Bounts are really

183
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,313
my distant relatives, or
ancestors, or something.

184
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:42,380
-That's right.

185
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:44,346
And that explains why
you and the others

186
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,646
have the ability to
sense and track Bounts.

187
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,713
You're all based on the
same kind of technology.

188
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:51,080
-I always thought
that since they

189
00:09:51,113 --> 00:09:52,813
dived through the
cycle of rebirth,

190
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:55,046
the features of the Soul
Reapers they were based on

191
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,880
would have changed.

192
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:59,646
But you say this Bount
called Yoshino resembled me

193
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,613
quite closely.

194
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:02,346
-Yes.

195
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,046
-So what happened to her?

196
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,113
-Jin Kariya betrayed
and murdered her.

197
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,680
-All I know is we
have to find a way

198
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:24,146
to stop the Bounts, and fast.

199
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:31,946
-Huh?

200
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,980
Kenny, are you
going to meet Maki?

201
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:37,346
-Yeah.

202
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,613
The word is Squad 10 has finally
managed to track and locate

203
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:41,446
him.

204
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,713
-I wanna go, too.

205
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:45,280
It's been a while, and I
haven't seen him in a long time.

206
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,246
-Move it, move it!

207
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,480
Come on!

208
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:52,946
-Pull!

209
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,913
-This way!

210
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:55,913
-Let's go, men!

211
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:00,780
-Men!

212
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:03,213
Take a rest from your
labors for just a moment,

213
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,313
and listen to me.

214
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,346
First I want to pay tribute
to the courage all of you

215
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,013
have exhibited.

216
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,146
This is your fight, after all.

217
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,280
Even though you are
from the Soul Society,

218
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:19,913
that same Soul Society has long
controlled and discriminated

219
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:20,846
against you.

220
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,013
But today you shall be released.

221
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:25,946
Today you will be free!

222
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,446
We shall soon commence our
attack on the Seireitei,

223
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,680
but we will need your help.

224
00:11:31,713 --> 00:11:33,746
Are you prepared
to fight with us?

225
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,680
-Yeah!

226
00:11:34,713 --> 00:11:35,180
-Yeah!

227
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:44,213
-Go forth and crush
the Soul Reapers!

228
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,213
[cheering]

229
00:11:58,314 --> 00:12:00,381
-It's just as I expected.

230
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:04,147
-What have you found
out, Master Mayuri?

231
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,947
-The one who snuck
into the Seireitei

232
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:10,014
and caused all that
destruction was Maki Ichinose.

233
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:12,247
And, that's not all.

234
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:12,747
Look.

235
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:13,581
-Yes.

236
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:16,481
I'd like to see this.

237
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:19,314
-Even though there have been no
Soul Reapers passing through,

238
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:22,114
nonetheless the Senkaimon
has been opening and closing

239
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:23,947
quite frequently.

240
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:27,014
This is the record of every
opening and closing, showing

241
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:30,247
all the times Ichinose
has entered and left.

242
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:32,081
The gate opens and
closes every time

243
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:35,181
he passes through the Senkaimon,
even if he's invisible.

244
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,481
And no matter how skillfully
he conceals himself,

245
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:40,447
he is not able to completely
hide his spiritual pressure

246
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:42,847
as he passes.

247
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,581
Of course, this was
something that only

248
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:47,181
I had the intelligence
to be aware of.

249
00:12:47,214 --> 00:12:50,147
I knew that Ichinose had been
breaking into the database,

250
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:52,714
making alterations and
hiding information.

251
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:54,614
But I wasn't fooled by that.

252
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:57,447
Heh, heh, heh.

253
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:01,214
Naturally, I already knew
all about Maki Ichinose's

254
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,181
zanpakuto, and its ability
to make him visible

255
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:07,081
using light refraction.

256
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:08,647
And then there's the
special technique

257
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:12,814
the Bounts are able to use to
hdie their spiritual pressure.

258
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:15,381
If Ichinose had
such a capability,

259
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:18,781
there is no way that
he wouldn't use it.

260
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:21,481
So the obvious conclusion
is that Ichniose

261
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:25,447
was making himself invisible,
then entering the Seireitei

262
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:26,981
and creating these diversions.

263
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:33,714
There may be other
occasions where

264
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:36,847
he broke into the database
that I'm not aware of yet,

265
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:39,314
so I'm going to conduct a
search for any events that

266
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:40,247
fit that pattern.

267
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,947
I thought so.

268
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:47,714
it is amazing that he could
have broken in this many times

269
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:49,314
without anyone noticing.

270
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:51,214
What?

271
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,414
-What is the matter, master?

272
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:55,047
-It can't be!

273
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,547
It's not-- what's this?

274
00:13:57,581 --> 00:13:59,514
Take a look at that!

275
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,947
-I see it, but--

276
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:02,447
-Isn't this one of
the missing files

277
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:04,981
that you restored for me
after they were somehow

278
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:06,214
secretly erased?

279
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:06,881
-Yes.

280
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:07,981
That's one of them.

281
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,647
-It was when I first
saw this that I came up

282
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:13,481
with the idea of drawing the
Bounts to the Soul Society

283
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:15,681
by using the Quincy
and his power.

284
00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:19,514
Was it Ichniose who deliberately
entered this into the database,

285
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:21,547
knowing that I would see it?

286
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:24,814
If that's the case, then they've
been using me all this time.

287
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:25,781
It all makes sense.

288
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:27,681
They wanted the
Quincy to use his bow

289
00:14:27,714 --> 00:14:31,081
so they could get here
to the Soul Society.

290
00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:32,914
How dare they!

291
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:34,181
Filthy Bount invaders!

292
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,614
-I've found their location.

293
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:46,581
It appears they've been
building something deep

294
00:14:46,614 --> 00:14:48,547
in Kusajishi Forest.

295
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:49,981
-Well, that fits
with the reports

296
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,947
we have that they've managed to
gather a large number of thugs

297
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:54,281
together.

298
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:56,514
-At least now, thanks to that,
the area around Kusajishi

299
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:59,114
is fairly calm and quiet.

300
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:01,547
-So, what shall we do, Captain?

301
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,181
-Since we've already
come this far,

302
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:05,681
let's go the rest of the way.

303
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:08,547
These thugs are still residents
of the Rukon District,

304
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:11,681
so in the event you encounter
any, try not to hurt them.

305
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:12,181
-Understand.

306
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:18,081
-Renji, are you able
to use your zanpakuto?

307
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:19,447
-Huh?

308
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:22,347
-You used your Higa Zekko attack
in the world of the living.

309
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:25,381
And your zanpakuto
hasn't recovered, has it?

310
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:26,914
-I'll be just fine.

311
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:28,581
I don't need my
shikai to take care

312
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:30,347
of a bunch of common thugs.

313
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:33,047
-But what if instead of thugs,
you should encounter Bounts?

314
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:35,214
-I'm not sure.

315
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:36,981
-Well, if that
happens, you can always

316
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:40,547
run back to the Seireitei and be
the messenger bearing bad news.

317
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:41,914
-Oh, thanks a lot.

318
00:15:41,947 --> 00:15:44,481
-Let's go.

319
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:45,414
-Are you going?

320
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:46,481
-Yeah.

321
00:15:46,514 --> 00:15:48,414
Orihime's Shun Shun
Rikka just told me

322
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,314
that the Bounts are
definitely up to something

323
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:52,747
in the Kusajishi forest.

324
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:55,014
So we've got to get going now.

325
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:57,281
-And what about you, Ran'Tao?

326
00:15:57,314 --> 00:16:00,481
-I doubt that this is the only
thing the Bounts are up to.

327
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:02,281
And just in case
it isn't, I have

328
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:04,947
something I need to stay
here and get prepared.

329
00:16:04,981 --> 00:16:06,181
-I understand.

330
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:08,181
I hope to see you again soon.

331
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:09,247
-Yes.

332
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:10,181
-Oh, wait.

333
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:11,581
-Hm?

334
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,747
-There's one more thing that I
still wanted to ask you about.

335
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:15,314
-Yes?

336
00:16:15,347 --> 00:16:17,947
-I assume you know about Uryu,
and about his special Quincy

337
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:19,181
accessory.

338
00:16:19,214 --> 00:16:22,514
How long do you believe
that'll keep on working?

339
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:25,147
-I'm afraid there's
no way of knowing.

340
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:29,014
It could become useless today,
or it could be tomorrow.

341
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:30,881
With all the destructive
energy it has,

342
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:33,214
it's conceivable that it
could obliterate everything

343
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:36,614
inside a 20 square mile radius
if it goes off accidentally.

344
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:43,047
-Well, there's no point
in getting scared of it

345
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:44,514
before I even use it.

346
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:46,681
I'll just have to do what I can.

347
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,181
-Hey.

348
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,847
Wait.

349
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:51,047
-Just be careful.

350
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:54,281
[shouting]

351
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,781
-Master, all of our
preparations for the surprise

352
00:16:56,814 --> 00:16:58,714
attack on the Seireitei
are on schedule.

353
00:16:58,747 --> 00:17:00,747
-Good work.

354
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:01,781
-Master Kariya?

355
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:03,414
-Yes, Ichinose?

356
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,347
-I've just learned that
there are several Soul

357
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:08,247
Reapers near here, and
approaching this location.

358
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:10,914
And apparently one
of them is a captain.

359
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,547
Unless you have
other plans for me,

360
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:14,614
I'd like you permission
to remain here and deal

361
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:16,847
with all of them myself.

362
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:18,314
-Finishing some of
the Soul Reapers

363
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:21,814
now can only make
our job easier later.

364
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:23,314
They're all yours.

365
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:24,147
-Sir.

366
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:25,314
You will not regret this.

367
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:25,781
Thank you.

368
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:32,881
[groan]

369
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:39,014
-Another two.

370
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:40,947
-There's no doubt
the Bounts are near.

371
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:43,447
So that's the reason why
these sentries are posted.

372
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,114
-But so few of them.

373
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,047
I heard that Kariya
recruited hundreds of men.

374
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:49,547
-So what now?

375
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:51,814
-We're going to split
up and keep moving in.

376
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:53,014
And be careful.

377
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:53,514
-Right.

378
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:12,114
-Guess I found one.

379
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:24,747
Who are you?

380
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:26,714
-Maki Ichinose.

381
00:18:26,747 --> 00:18:28,047
-I see.

382
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:30,381
You're the Soul Reaper who's
been working for the Bounts,

383
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:31,781
aren't you?

384
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:34,814
-I am no longer a Soul Reaper.

385
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,314
My allegiance is to the
great master Kariya.

386
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:44,847
-So where are the Bounts, then?

387
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:48,347
-Enough of your
questions, captain.

388
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:51,447
-If you won't answer, then I'll
have to force it out of you.

389
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:57,147
Attack!

390
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,814
At least tell my why
you choose to fight

391
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:12,014
on the side of the Bounts
when you have this much skill.

392
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:15,014
-Because Master Kariya's
way is paved with justice.

393
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:16,214
-Meaning?

394
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:19,314
-There's no justice anymore
in the Soul Society.

395
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:21,714
But now Master Kariya
will cleanse this place

396
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:22,914
and purify it.

397
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:23,614
-You traitor.

398
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:30,947
[groan]

399
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:37,414
-Is that Ichigo?

400
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:39,081
-Well, it's Toshiro.

401
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:40,914
HITSUGAYA: That's
Captain Hitsugaya to you.

402
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,981
-What the hell are you
two doing here, anyway?

403
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:46,947
-Rangiku.

404
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:48,281
And Renji.

405
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:50,114
-It would appear that
most of the thugs

406
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,614
have already left
the forest, Captain.

407
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:53,614
-Wah!

408
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:54,614
Stop it!

409
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:57,081
I want off, I want
off, I want off!

410

Oh!

Oh.

Uryu and Ichigo.

-What are you doing here?

414
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:07,081
-Well, we're with Ganju.

Don't let any of 'em get away!

419
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,747
-Chad and I came along
with Ganju and his friends

420
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,581
to try and stop all
of Kariya's thugs

421
00:20:19,614 --> 00:20:20,914
from gathering in the forest.

422
00:20:20,947 --> 00:20:22,881
-But for some
reason, there doesn't

423
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:25,881
seem to be as many of them as
we were told there would be.

424
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:29,214
-I'm aware of that.

425
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:30,681
ICHIGO: What is it, Chad?

426
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:32,247
-Among the Bounts,
there is one who

427
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:35,381
can control space the
same way Noba does.

428

-That old man.

ICHINOSE: You're all
too late, anyway.

-Huh?

431
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:39,981
-Hm?

432
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:44,914
-Master Kariya and
the main attack force

433
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:46,714
are already on their
way to the Seireitei.

434
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,347

I am a Bount.

00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:31,214
Stand aside, please,
and let me in.

likes of you inside!

have to go through you.

-Well, where is the
rest of the material?

478
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:56,824
-You should take that
up with Captain Kyoraku,

479
00:24:56,857 --> 00:24:58,224
since he was the
one who insisted

I buy you something sexy.
