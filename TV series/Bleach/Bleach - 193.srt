NARRATOR: Ichigo rescued
Orihime after a deadly battle

3
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:57,227
with Grimmjow, only to have to
face off against Nnoitra Gilga.

4
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:59,327
With his injuries
left untreated,

5
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:02,161
Ichigo was overwhelmed by
Nnoitra's immense strength.

6
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:07,861
As a consequence, Orihime
was once again taken captive.

7
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,127
Nel, who had been
hiding, was discovered,

8
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:12,194
and Ichigo and the
others found themselves

9
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:14,261
at the edge of defeat.

10
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:17,927
Just then, Nel underwent
an unexpected change.

11
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,427
-Ichigo!

12
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:28,127
-Nel?

13
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:32,594
-So, Nel.

14
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:35,627
You've reverted to your
old form, have you?

15
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:47,794
-Nel.

16
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:51,961
Are you really the same Nel?

17
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:53,327
-I am.

18
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:57,194
Thanks to you, Ichigo, I was
able to return to my old self

19
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:58,161
again.

20
00:02:58,194 --> 00:03:00,127
I will protect you.

21
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:05,294
Don't be worried.

22
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:08,427
It'll be over
before you know it.

23
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:02,594
-Damn her.

24
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:31,961
-I don't look that ugly.

25
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:33,761

-Zabimaru!

28
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:42,794
-Too soft.

29
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:53,861
Even if we look like and our
techniques are the same, a fake

30
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,061
it's still a fake.

31
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,627
The original's better.

-Damn it.

35
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,861
There's no end to this battle.

36
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:40,294
-I'm afraid you're right.

-SZAYELAPORRO: Well, that is
the beauty of clone fighting one

to one technology.

39
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,661
Every time these
clones are defeated,

40
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:53,461
they simply split apart
and multiply again,

41
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:56,194
sometimes in larger
numbers than before.

42
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:58,894
You don't actually think
you can win, do you?

DONDOCHAKKA: Ha!

00:06:06,827 --> 00:06:07,561
Look out, Renji.

00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:09,061
I'll get that guy for you.

46
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:14,094
-You idiot.

47
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:16,761
Isn't it obvious that
I'm the real Renji?

48
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:17,794
-I'm sorry, Renji.

49

All you Soul Reapers
look alike to me.

-If you seem to be confused
about who you're attacking,

51
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,461
then I suggest you
don't attack at all!

52
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:25,627
Understand?

53
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:27,194
-Don't worry, Dondochakka!

54
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:28,194

You look an awful
lot like Renji.

-You did that in purpose.

00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:48,561

-When you guys are through,
I figured out something

65
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,394
important.

66
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:59,761
I discovered the difference
between the clones and myself,

67
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,594
and-- excuse me.

68
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:01,394

00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:02,927
You're not listening to me.

70

Hey!

71
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,694
First, Renji's clones and mine.

72
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,794
We're the hardest to tell apart
because, other than our eyes,

73
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:13,861
there's only a slight
disparity in our hair.

74
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:16,761
Very difficult to distinguish.

75
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:20,127
Next, Dondochakka's clone.

76
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:22,794
His duplicates have no
spots on their backs.

77
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:26,127
Very easy to distinguish.

78
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:27,361
-How dare you call them spots.

79
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:30,527
Those are my polka
dot-shaped beauty marks.

80
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:33,661
-And last, but not
least, Pesche's clones.

81
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:35,027
This one's a no brainer.

82
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:39,194
I'm sure you've all noticed
by now the obvious difference.

83
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:42,227
Pesche's clones all wear pants.

84
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,427
-What?

85
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:45,361
-Hey, you're right.

86
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:46,694
He's wearing pants.

87
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:48,561
-Guess I missed that one, huh.

88
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:49,594
-Wow.

89
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:51,794
It was so obvious,
I never even saw it.

90
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:53,661
-None of you noticed, huh?

91
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:55,627
Well, just what
have you all been

92
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:58,394
looking at this whole time?

93
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:01,827
-This is going to be an
enormous advantage for our side.

94
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:03,827
Guess our opponent
is a lot more stupid

95
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,661
than we originally suspected.

96
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,961
-You're calling him stupid
while you couldn't figure out

97
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,994
if a clone was
wearing pants or not.

98
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:10,694
-Trust me.

99
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:11,494
I'm not stupid.

100
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,994
-You were eavesdropping on us.

101
00:08:18,027 --> 00:08:20,627
-That loincloth as well
as those awful spots

102
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:24,361
simply do not appeal to my
superior sense of fashion.

103
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:26,494
My versions are
much more tasteful.

104
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:28,361
-Clothes are supposed
to be exact duplicates,

105
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:31,194
so you're stupid for removing
the loincloth and his spots,

106
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:31,994
stupid.

107
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:32,927
-I already told you.

108
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:34,194
They're not spots.

109
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:36,394
They're polka
dot-shaped beauty marks.

110
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:47,194
-Have a taste of this!

111
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,161
-Too slow.

112
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:54,561
-All right.

113
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:08,627
Roar, Zabimaru!

114
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:09,661
-Roar, Zabimaru!

115
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:15,094
-They've got him surrounded.

116
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:17,027
-Poor Renji's done for.

00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:25,594
-Uryu.

118
00:09:25,627 --> 00:09:27,994
It's a losing battle trying to
fight this many of ourselves

119
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,194
at one time.

120
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:30,527
Let's get out of here.

121
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:31,294
-Great idea.

122
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:32,394
But only one problem.

123
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:34,427
There is no way out of here.

124
00:09:34,461 --> 00:09:35,427
-Maybe.

125
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:36,561
Maybe not.

126
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:37,627
I've got an idea.

00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:41,727
Bankai.

128
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:50,127
Hihiyo, Zabimaru!

129
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:51,361
-No.

130
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:54,627
You can't use something like
that in here, you idiot.

131
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,261
-Bankai.

132
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:57,661
-Bankai.

133
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:59,061
-Bankai.

134
00:09:59,094 --> 00:09:59,561
-Bankai.

135
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:20,327
-Just as I suspected.

136
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:23,261
I had a feeling they
were copying my moves.

137
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:25,294
Copy see, copy do.

138
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,794
So I tested them with my
Bankai and tricked them

139
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:32,327
into blowing the
roof off this place.

140
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:42,661
Hey.

141
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:43,994
You're still alive, huh?

142
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:45,361
Glad to see you
lived long enough

143
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,494
to see my genius plan at work.

144
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:49,427
-That was genius?

145
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:51,861
I'm telling you, Renji,
sometimes you and Ichigo

146
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:54,061
are so much alike, it's scary.

147
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:54,727
-Ha.

148
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:56,294
Stop teasing.

149
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:57,994
By lumping me in
with Ichigo, it's

150
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:00,061
almost like you're
not complimenting me.

151
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,194
-That's because I'm not.

152
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,627
You're being insulted.

153
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:04,294
-All right.

154
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:05,594
Back to business.

155
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:07,961
How many of these
clones are left.

156
00:11:07,994 --> 00:11:10,194
Dondochakka and
Pesche should be fine.

157
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:12,294
Those two are pretty tough.

158
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:13,461
The problem is Szayelaporro.

159
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:18,594
Keep a sharp watch
out below you.

160
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:20,027
Knowing that guy,
he'll come at us

161
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:21,827
right from underneath
our own two feet.

162
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:36,561
-Tsk.

163
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:37,061
Tsk.

164
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:44,427
Look what you did to my palace.

165
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:47,194
How will I ever explain
this to Lord Aizen.

166
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:01,627
I am very displeased.

167
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,061
-The clones.

168
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:13,227
-Let's end this.

169
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:14,927
I see no reason to continue.

170
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:17,327
This battle is really
beginning to bore me.

171
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:29,194
It's time I
personally stepped in.

172
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:33,194
I'll try to make this fast.

173
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:36,861
Allow me to demonstrate to you
the true power of my Laludeosa.

174
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,690
-Hey.

175
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:48,557
Hey.

176
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,124
Will you get off
me, Dondochakka?

177
00:12:51,157 --> 00:12:53,157
You're enormous!

178
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,924
-Wait.

179
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,157
I just figured something.

180
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,824
-Figured what?

181
00:12:56,857 --> 00:12:59,090
-I figured that we've been
acting like complete idiots

182
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:00,024
this entire time.

183
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:01,357
It's so clear to me now.

184
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,124
I've never been so aware
of how stupid we are.

185
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:05,157
-Great.

186
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,324
Congratulations on
your big discovery.

187
00:13:07,357 --> 00:13:09,790
Now get your ass away from me.

188
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,624
-You poked my polka dots.

189
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:22,757
-Ugh.

190
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,057
-Oh.

191
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,290
Beg your pardon?

192
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,324
It seems that you
didn't hear me earlier.

193
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,490
-Damn.

194
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:52,257
Even if those guys were
just a bunch of duplicates,

195
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,990
it still doesn't feel very
good to watch yourself explode,

196
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:58,024
that's for sure.

197
00:13:58,057 --> 00:13:59,924
-Now then.

198
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:01,990
Sorry to keep you waiting.

199
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:07,990
Allow me to show you the
true power of Laludeosa.

200
00:14:08,024 --> 00:14:09,757
I hope you appreciate it.

201
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,724
-Thank you for your
thoughtfulness.

202
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:19,224
You're very considerate.

203
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:21,624
But we have no interest
in you or whatever

204
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:23,290
show you're trying to put on.

205
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,324
We're gonna interrupt
your performance.

206
00:14:32,357 --> 00:14:33,724
-Bring down the curtain.

207
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:45,290
-Sorry, but the performance
is going on as scheduled.

208
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:47,924
You've already got your tickets,
and unfortunately, there

209
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:49,290
are no refunds.

210
00:14:49,324 --> 00:14:52,457
So I suggest you sit
back and enjoy the show.

211
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:04,957
-Uryu!

212
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:34,657
-Such a delicious meal.

213
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,557
-What?

214
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,357
-Uryu!

215
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,290
Uryu.

216
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,257
Uryu.

217
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,657
Snap out of it.

218
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,924
Are you gonna be all right?

219
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:02,424
Hey.

220
00:16:02,457 --> 00:16:03,924
You OK?

221
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:08,224
-I was doing fine until you
started yelling in my ear.

222
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:15,457
-Yoo hoo Check out my new toy.

223
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,924
-An Uryu doll?

224
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:18,157
Really?

225
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,090
-OK.

226
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:20,857
What's it for?

227
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,524
-Well, this doll has many uses.

228
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:25,390
Far too many to explain.

229
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:27,890
But basically it's
here to replace you.

230
00:16:27,924 --> 00:16:32,790
I'd like to thank you for being
such a good Uryu all this time.

231
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:36,257
However, your role
as Uryu is now over.

232
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,290
From now on, he is Uryu.

233
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:42,324
-What do you mean?

234
00:16:42,357 --> 00:16:43,724
-Huh?

235
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:45,724
-You see?

236
00:16:45,757 --> 00:16:48,957
You did feel that, didn't you?

237
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,857
You still look confused.

238
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,224
Maybe I should clarify and
explain a little bit further.

239
00:16:54,257 --> 00:16:57,090
To put it simply, think
of this as a joystick that

240
00:16:57,124 --> 00:17:00,357
controls your five senses.

241
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,324
In other words--

242
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:06,490
-Uryu.

243
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,224
-Works pretty good,
don't you think?

244
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:11,724
Observe.

245
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:20,590
-Why you-- What the
hell are you up to?

246
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:24,957
Stop it.

247
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,824
Stop it!

248
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:34,990
Damn it.

249
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,190
Huh?

250
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:43,257
-Sorry.

251
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,557
Didn't mean to cause
a panic or anything.

252
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,157
This doll is simply made
to come apart like this.

253
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,157
Nothing more.

254
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,457
Oh, I can see why
you thought you

255
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,124
were about to be torn apart.

256
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,257
Anyway, check these out.

257
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,290
All these little bits and
pieces are actually body parts.

258
00:18:05,357 --> 00:18:07,957
-Just get to the point already.

259
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,157
-Nice and colorful, aren't they?

260
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,290
Like collecting shells
or marbles in a jar.

261
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:17,224
In my opinion, this is the most
fun of playing with the doll.

262
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:19,424
Your brain power is
limited, so I'll just

263
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,790
show you rather than taking
more time to explain.

264
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:27,157
The stomach.

265

[groan]

266
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:32,111
-Uryu.

267
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,358
I'll get you for that!

268
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:42,892
-Don't make a fuss.

269
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:45,325
All I did was destroy
a vital internal organ.

270
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:55,458
My, my my.

271
00:18:55,492 --> 00:18:58,558
Some people get upset so easily.

272
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:00,525
All I did was threaten
you a little bit.

273
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:01,858
I think you should
be more mature

274
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:04,258
about the whole experience.

275
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:06,792
I guess that's asking
too much of you.

276
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:15,925
Humans and Soul Reapers act
just like children sometimes.

277
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:19,425
And Quincys fall into
that category as well.

278
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,558
It's actually quite vulgar.

279
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:25,058
-No, Renji.

280
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:27,758
-In fact, everything
about your pathetic kind

281
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,992
suggests extreme vulgarity.

282
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:34,192
In my opinion.

283
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:42,692
Lord Aizen should destroy
you for that alone.

284
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,558
-I thought this was
gonna be over quickly,

285
00:19:57,592 --> 00:20:00,392
but I guess not, huh, Nelliel?

286
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:02,292
Many years have
gone by since you

287
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:04,258
disappeared from
this place, my dear.

288
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,125
Don't tell me you're
under the impression

289
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:12,692
that the Espada's rankings
are still the same

290
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:14,158
after all this time has passed.

291
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:20,392
-Nel.

292
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:23,792
-Careful, Nel.

293
00:20:28,758 --> 00:20:29,858
-You make me sick.

294
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,358
Why'd you stop your sword?

295
00:20:58,392 --> 00:21:01,025
-Why'd you stop yourd?

296
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:02,092
-You idiot.

297
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,592
It's obvious I stopped
my sword because I

298
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,592
saw you stop your sword.

299
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,358
You're annoying.

300
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:23,458
You're so annoying.

301
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:27,958
When I'm fighting you, I
can't help but think back.

302
00:21:27,992 --> 00:21:35,125
Except for those ridiculous
rag tag clothes you're wearing,

303
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:38,958
you haven't changed
one single bit.

304
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,327
[theme music]

305
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,788
SZAYELAPORRO: So, what do you
think of my Uryu and Renji

306
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:21,436
dolls?

307
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:23,736
URYU: This attack doesn't
impress me at all.

308
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,103
SZAYELAPORRO: Oh well.

309
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:27,770
Maybe you'll be more impressed
after I tear Renji's cape off.

310
00:23:27,803 --> 00:23:28,703
RENJI: What?

311
00:23:28,736 --> 00:23:30,170
How dare you use
such dirty tricks?

312
00:23:30,203 --> 00:23:33,703
NNOITRA: Who cares about that?
