-My research was
made even harder

00:01:36,839 --> 00:01:39,706
because of the poor
quality of the specimens.

The last one was a
grubby old man who

kept screaming out the
name of his student.

00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:46,606

-Do you want me to tell you
the name you can't remember?

That student's name was Ishida.

Uryu Ishida.

18
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,406
This man is Soken Ishida.

Quincy, I'm going to kill you,

KUROTSUCHI (VOICEOVER):
I immobilized his limbs

Oh, I know.

[music playing]

31
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:20,172
It involves taking countless
threads of spirit particles,

32
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:22,506
bundling them together,
and then connecting them

33
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:24,539
to the immobilized
limbs to forcibly

34
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:28,206
move them, like a
puppet on strings.

35
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,639
The technique was developed
by elderly Quencies

36
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:32,939
so they could continue
fighting Hollows

37
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:35,206
with their clumsy old bodies.

38
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,806
Dislocated joints and
torn flesh mean nothing

39
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,739
to those who have mastered it.

40
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:42,572
It will allow a
Quincy to continue

41
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:45,706
fighting until his body has
literally turned to dust.

42
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,172
I thought it was a lost art
existing only in history books.

43

Of the thousands of
Quincies I dissected,

44
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,739
none could use
Ransotengai, so to find

45
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:05,606
that you are able to use
it at such a young age,

46
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,906
you may be something
special after all.

47
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:13,339
Perhaps even a genius.

48
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:14,706
-A genius.

49
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:18,272
Such a generic term doesn't
even begin to describe it.

50
00:04:18,306 --> 00:04:19,506
-Oh?

51
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:23,172
-For me, Ransotengai is
more than a defense or a way

52
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:25,706
to protect my life.

53
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:28,939
Even if I'm reduced to a corpse,
until I avenge my Master,

54
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:30,839
it's the expression
of my will to fight!

-I'll retract the word "genius."

-Don't argue with me.

00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,006
If I've told you once,
I've told you 100 times.

63
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,072
It's pointless to
try to save the dead.

-Let the Soul Reapers

The only thing you should

is how to save the living.

I have no interest in this
and you have no talent for it,

69

Do you understand me, Uryo?

00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:28,172
-But father, why do you
hate being a Quincy so much?

76
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,172
These days being a Quincy
doesn't put food on the table.

77
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:55,739
And with a family to support,
that is a real problem.

And I know something
else about Hollows.

And if I can do
that, then I know

my father will see he was

For once you have

you can never remove
this glove again.

131
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:10,706
The moment you do, your ability
to draw in spirit energy

will exceed your physical
limits as a Quincy.

removing the glove

will allow you to temporarily
gain enormous power, when that

your Quincy powers completely.

understand your

and when you know what it
is that you want to protect,

143
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:53,972
then you must decide if you
still want to be a Quincy.
