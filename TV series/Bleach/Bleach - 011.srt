Don't you see the damage
that you kids have done?

This ridiculous
show was broadcast

00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:53,716
on national
television yesterday.

for all the world to see.

Rukia and Ichigo, this
is a very serious.

00:02:04,383 --> 00:02:05,816
Never in the history
of this school

00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:07,849
has any student ever
dishonored this institution

of civil disobedience.

understand why you're

angry with Ichigo
and Rukia for acting

16

like a bunch of stupid idiots,
but why are Orihime and I here

17
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:21,016
when we didn't have
anything to do with this?

-Great, thanks a lot.

You were there with them, yet
you did nothing to stop them,

34
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:49,349
so you're just as
guilty as Ichigo.

what the big deal is.

I really did try to stop
Ichigo, but he wouldn't listen.

All he ever thinks
about is himself,

with getting on television.

everything you could have.

-Oh, thank you, Mr. Kagine.

52

So you'll punish
Ichigo and let me go?

you get his autograph for me?

here lost their minds?

She was trying to
sell me up the river.

-You gotta admit that her phony
crying covered your getaway.

70

You ought to be thanking her.

putting on the big act

00:07:42,316 --> 00:07:44,616
you wouldn't go and do something
embarrassing like score

164
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:47,649
in the top 50,
right, Chad, old pal?

165
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:50,149
-[grunts]

166
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:52,149
[screaming]

167
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:53,383
-I'm horrified.

168
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,783
I had no idea I was hanging
out with such a bunch

169
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:56,116
of complete geeks and brainiacs.

170
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:59,083
I'm through with all of you.

171
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:00,383
-Oh, well.

172
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,416
They'll be back.

173
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,249
-I guess it's lucky
for him one of us

174
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:08,449
isn't in the number one
spot, like Ametasu Ishida.

175
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:10,016
I've never even heard of him.

176
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:12,849
-That's Uryu, Uryu Ishida.

177
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:14,383
-You mean you know him?

178
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,116
-Yeah, of course.

179
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:16,783
He's in our class.

180
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:19,649
-You'll find that Ichigo has
an uncanny knack for forgetting

181
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:21,983
people's faces and the
names that go with them.

182
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:22,483
Come on.

183
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:23,649
-Oh.

184
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:26,549
-Hmm, that's weird.

185
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,616
[phone ringing]

186
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:32,283
-How come he's not answering?

187
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:34,583
Urahara, why don't
you ever pick up

188
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:36,616
when I call you in
emergencies like this?

189
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,283
You call yourself a businessman?

190
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:40,216
Then why do you show up
when you're not wanted,

191
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:42,416
and then when I really
need you, you won't answer?

192
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:49,249
[sighs] I need Urahara
to come and take

193
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:51,283
a look at this Soul Pager.

194
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:54,016
I mean how am I supposed to know
if this stupid thing is working

195
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:57,249
right or not?

196
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:58,249
[beeping]

197
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:03,816
-Let's go to that
new karaoke bar.

198
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:05,216
There's this hot hostess there.

199
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:06,316
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Ichigo?

200
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:07,616
-Huh?

201
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:08,483
-Come here.

202
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:09,949
I need you.

203
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,216
-That Rukia is one
aggressive chick.

204
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:14,416
-Maybe they really
are seeing each other.

205
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:15,916
-We have a Hollow alert.

206
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:17,049
-A Hollow?

207
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,316
Well, there better
actually be one this time.

208
00:09:19,349 --> 00:09:20,616
-Just shut up and run.

209
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:27,516
-[grunts]

210
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:28,016
Sorry.

211
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:42,616
-Damn it.

212
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,283
Again, you drag me
all the way out here,

213
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:45,649
and there's no Hollow.

214
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:46,716
-Shut up.

215
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:49,916
Stop whining and get
back into your body.

216
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,283
-Fine, but would
you do something

217
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:53,216
about that stupid Soul Pager?

218
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:55,416
-These false alarms
aren't my fault.

219
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:58,083
When it goes off, I have to
assume a Hollow has appeared,

220
00:09:58,116 --> 00:09:59,216
so I report it.

221
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:01,149
What else can I do?

222
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,683
-Well, get it fixed because
it's obviously busted.

223
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:06,649
-They don't fix them at
television repair shops.

224
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:07,183
-Huh?

225
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:09,483
-Huh?

226
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:10,316
-How unprofessional.

227
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,683
Good evening, Ichigo, Rukia.

228
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:22,249
-Who the hell are you?

229
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:24,449
And how do you know our
names you don't mind--

230
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:25,816
-I don't mind.

231
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:27,783
I also know you can
see spirits, Ichigo.

232
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:33,449
-How do you know that?

233
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:35,549
-Another Hollow
has just appeared.

234
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,183
-No way.

235
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:38,683
[beeping]

236
00:10:38,716 --> 00:10:40,316
-There's a new one
here all right.

237
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,616
How did he know?

238
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:42,116
-All right.

239
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:42,783
Which way?

240
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:47,949
-It's over there.

241
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:50,449
Can you not sense
such a simple thing?

242
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,183
And you call yourself
a Soul Reaper.

243
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:56,649
[chimes]

244
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:28,049
-The signal just vanished.

245
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,016
-So tell me, who
or what are you?

246
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,216
-Uryu Ishida.

247
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:37,816
I'm a Quincy.

248
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:39,983
Soul Reapers are my enemies.

249
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:41,349
-Just what do you mean?

250
00:11:41,383 --> 00:11:42,783
-Is that too
complicated for you?

251
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:46,183
I'll tell you again
then, slower this time.

252
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:49,783
Ichigo Kurosaki,
you are my enemy.

253
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,016
[bells ringing]

254
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:11,216
-Damn, what's the
story with that guy?

255
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:12,949
-And you call yourself
a Soul Reaper?

256
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:18,783
Can you not sense
such a simple thing?

257
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:23,238
-Who does he think he is
insulting me like that?

258
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:25,605
I'll mess him up the
next time I see him.

259
00:12:25,638 --> 00:12:29,405
Besides, who uses a
bow-and-arrow anymore.

260
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:31,071
What's his name?

261
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:32,705
Uh, Mac?

262
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:34,671
No, I think it
was Iki-something.

263
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:36,071
Ikibo?

264
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:36,805
Ikimo?

265
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:37,838
Metasu?

266
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:38,838
No.

267
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:40,571
Ichi-- Ichiarmadillo!

268
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:41,905
No, that's not it either.

269
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:42,671
Dammit.

270
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:45,805
-Do you mean Uryu Ishida?

271
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:46,805
-Orihime.

272
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:48,005
Uh, yeah.

273
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:50,571
-It's a pretty cool name, huh?

274
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:53,071
-Uh, yeah, I was just
saying it because it's

275
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,771
such a cool-sounding name.

276
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:55,971
-I agree.

277
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:57,405
In fact, I say his name to
myself all the time when

278
00:12:57,438 --> 00:13:00,038
I'm sitting with him in
the home handicrafts club.

279
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,371
-Home handy what?

280
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:04,138
-You see?

281
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:05,071
There he is, right there.

282
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,671
-That's him all
right, but I can't

283
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:13,338
believe he's really in
the home handicrafts club.

284
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:14,338
Look at him.

285
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,505
He's reading, not doing macrame.

286
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:17,105
-Yeah?

287
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:18,171
You wait.

288
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:21,805
It looks like Michiru's
got a job for him.

289
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:23,538
-Like he's gonna sew it for her?

290
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:24,405
-Just wait and watch.

291
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:48,505
-Hey, it's almost
as good as new.

292
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:49,405
Thanks so much, Uryu.

293
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:50,071
-It's all right.

294
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:51,638
Don't mention it.

295
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:55,605
In fact, don't talk
to me anymore at all.

296
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:58,705
-Uh, I'll see you later then.

297
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,271
-Why would he do
something so nice

298
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:02,505
and then say
something so unkind?

299
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:06,371
-Because he's
insane, that's why.

300
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:10,938
-Ichigo, wait a sec, Do you and
Uryu have some kind of problem?

301
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:14,705
-Well, you could say that, but
it's nothing I can't handle.

302
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:15,238
-That's good.

303
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:20,705
[giggles]

304
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:21,705
[sighs]

305
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:39,871
-Do you intend to follow me all
the way home, Ichigo Kurosaki?

306
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,905
-Guess I'm not as sneaky
as I thought I was.

307
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:46,738
So when did you first notice me?

308
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:49,938
-From the time you and Orihime
saw me in the classroom.

309
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:52,071
You've been ducking in and
out of shadows behind me

310
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:54,271
ever since.

311
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:55,505
-That long, huh?

312
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:56,971
Now that's impressive.

313
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:59,338
-The careless way you let
your spirit energy leak out,

314
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:02,205
even a monkey would
have noticed it.

315
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:03,971
Amateur stuff

316
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:05,571
-What did you say?

317
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:06,871
-You heard me.

318
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,571
It's obvious that you lack
even the most basic ability

319
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:12,338
to detect those around you
with high spirit energy.

320
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,705
How else can you
explain the fact

321
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:17,005
that you weren't even aware
of my existence until today?

322
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:18,505
-Yeah, sorry about that.

323
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:21,138
It's just that I've always been
really bad at remembering names

324
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,405
and faces.

325
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:23,938
-That's not what I mean.

326
00:15:23,971 --> 00:15:26,038
There's a difference
between you and me.

327
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:27,638
When you first started
at this school,

328
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:29,471
I sensed your high
spirit energy.

329
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:32,505
If you were any good, you
would have sensed mine.

330
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:37,938
I even know the day in mid-May
when you became a Soul Reaper.

331
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,971
And I know Rukia
Kuchiki's true identity.

332
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:50,138
-Spirit ribbons.

333
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:51,905
-For a change, you're right.

334
00:15:51,938 --> 00:15:54,105
Spirit ribbons are the
physical manifestation

335
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:57,171
of spirit energy
in the atmosphere.

336
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:57,671
And--

337
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,438
-What is that?

338
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:05,905
-This is your spirit ribbon.

339
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,171
You didn't know that?

340
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,305
Soul Reapers' spirit ribbons
are a different color

341
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:16,171
than normal ones.

342
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:26,038
Why don't we play a little
game, Ichigo Kurosaki.

343
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:28,305
Let's have a duel to
determine which one of us

344
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:31,171
is stronger, the Quincy
or the Soul Reaper.

345
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:33,271
I'll show you just
how unnecessary Soul

346
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:35,738
Reapers are in this world.

347
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:37,571
JINTA (OFFSCREEN): All
right, practice duel.

348
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:40,571
Rock, paper, scissors.

349
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:41,538
Rock wins!

350
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:42,471
Ha ha.

351
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:43,705
This one's for real.

352
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:46,405
Know Rock, paper, scissors.

353
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,138
-It looks like you lose.

354
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:48,638
-Argh.

355
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:53,938
-I get to choose a
chore for you, Jinta,

356
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,605
and I choose sweeping up.

357
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:56,471
-Oh, no, not so fast.

358
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:58,171
You haven't won yet, Ururu.

359
00:16:58,205 --> 00:17:00,305
I said it's not over till
you win two out of three.

360
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:03,038
-Hey, you never
said that before.

361
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:04,438
No fair.

362
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:05,638
No, Jinta stop it.

363
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:10,338
-Aw, quite your
complaining, Ururu,.

364
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:13,105
The rules are whatever
I say they are.

365
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:14,638
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): Maybe you'd

366
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:18,005
like to try that technique
on my head, Jinta.

367
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,438
-Ow, put me down.

368
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,238
I was just trying to teach
her rock, paper, scissors.

369
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:29,338
-Huh?

370
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:31,338
-Oh, hello there, Miss Kuchiki.

371
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:32,405
I didn't see you come in.

372
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:35,038
Is there something
wrong with your foot.

373
00:17:35,071 --> 00:17:36,371
-Never mind.

374
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:37,305
Urahara here?

375
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:40,071
-If it isn't my
favorite customer.

376
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:43,638
What can I do for you?

377
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:45,805
-Don't play innocent
with me, Urahara.

378
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:47,305
I had to come in
person because I've

379
00:17:47,338 --> 00:17:49,171
been calling for days
with a major problem,

380
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:51,038
and you don't respond.

381
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,638
-Oh, sorry about that.

382
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,305
It's just we've been
really busy lately,

383
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:56,105
but I was gonna call you today.

384
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:57,305
-Where's your friend?

385
00:17:57,338 --> 00:18:00,071
You know, that weird,
orange, spiky-haired dude.

386
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:01,305
I don't see him.

387
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:03,605
I guess he must have
broke up with you.

388
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:05,838
Can't really say
I blame the guy.

389
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:07,471
-Cut her some slack, Jinta.

390
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:08,938
-It's serious.

391
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,905
I need information.

392
00:18:10,938 --> 00:18:13,238
-About what?

393
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:16,171
-So when is this duel between
us supposed to take place?

394
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:17,371
-Right now.

395
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,305
-That idea is ridiculous.

396
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:29,405
-Why do you say that?

397
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:31,105
-Because it would
be a waste of time,

398
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:32,738
and I've got nothing
to prove to you.

399
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:34,505
I've never heard
of Quincys before,

400
00:18:34,538 --> 00:18:36,605
and I don't know what you
have again Soul Reapers,

401
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:39,071
but it's got nothing
to do with me.

402
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:40,338
-What a surprise.

403
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:41,838
You're afraid to fight.

404
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,771
-Forget trying to
goad me into it.

405
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:46,705
Besides, I'd mop
the floor with you.

406
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:48,205
-Oh, now I get it.

407
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:50,205
You don't have permission.

408
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:51,271
I forgot.

409
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:54,305
Your Soul Reapers
powers came from Rukia.

410
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:57,371
You're actually just a
substitute Soul Reaper.

411
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:59,405
That probably means
that on your own,

412
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,871
you can't so much
as lift a finger.

413
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:04,871
You have to have her
permission to duel, don't you?

414
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:07,805
-That does it.

415
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:09,471
URAHARA (OFFSCREEN): A Quincy.

416
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:12,305
I haven't heard that
word in a long time.

417
00:19:12,338 --> 00:19:15,671
-It does have kind of an
ancient ring to it, doesn't it?

418
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:18,005
If I'm not mistaken,
it's been 200 years

419
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:20,905
since I've heard anyone
speak of Quincys.

420
00:19:20,938 --> 00:19:21,771
-Well, who are they?

421
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:23,971
-Who were they, you mean.

422
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:26,705
The last of the Quincys
became extinct centuries ago,

423
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:30,505
but they were once a clan that
specialized in killing Hollows.

424
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:32,238
And at one time,
there are many of them

425
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,938
scattered throughout the world.

426
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:36,371
-So what happened?

427
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:40,005
-Well, I suppose I should
begin at the beginning.

428
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:42,005
The clan started out
as a group of humans

429
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:45,271
who had powers like Ichigo to
sense the presence of Hollows

430
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:48,438
in the world and began to
train to fight against them.

431
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:51,538
The whole mission of the
Quincys was to defeat Hollows,

432
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:53,971
just as it is for Soul
Reapers like yourself,

433
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:56,971
but there was a deep
division between the two.

434
00:19:57,005 --> 00:20:00,438
It was a question of whether
to cleanse Hollows or just kill

435
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:01,638
them.

436
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:03,738
Soul Reapers, as you know,
seek to purify Hollows

437
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:06,105
with their zanpakuto
and thereby allow

438
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,405
them to pass over
into the Soul society.

439
00:20:08,438 --> 00:20:10,538
But the Quincys
believed the Hollows

440
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:13,605
deserved only destruction and
sought to annihilate them.

441
00:20:17,938 --> 00:20:19,405
[screaming]

442
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:24,038
URAHARA (OFFSCREEN):
When you think about it,

443
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:25,805
it was a natural reaction.

444
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:27,905
Hollows devour human Souls.

445
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:30,238
They kill and maim our
friends and family.

446
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,371
Why should they deserve the
peace of a Soul society?

447
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:36,605
The Quincys couldn't
understand showing such mercy,

448
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:40,238
and eventually began to hate
the Soul Reapers for it.

449
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:43,171
They were sure the only
answer was to kill Hollows.

450
00:20:43,205 --> 00:20:45,038
They believed in
doing so that they

451
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:46,705
were avenging their
fallen comrades.

452
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:51,471
But then, it was
this same belief

453
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:53,238
that eventually led
to their destruction.

454
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:59,338
-All right, if a
duel's what you want,

455
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:01,838
then a duel's what you'll get.

456
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:03,271
-It's about time, Ichigo.

457
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,138
-Huh?

458
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:07,138
-Why'd you leave me in
that stupid bag all day?

459
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:08,505
You trying to kill me?

460
00:21:08,538 --> 00:21:10,938
I don't care what Rukia says,
don't you ever do that to me

461
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:11,571
again.

462
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,505
-Cough it up.

463
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,438
-Wait a sec.

464
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:15,838
Forget what I said
about the bag.

465
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:19,271
You can put me back there--

466
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:19,771
-Aha.

467
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,771
Ko, you better get back.

468
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:36,605
I'm about to give Mr.
Handicrafts some stitches

469
00:21:36,638 --> 00:21:37,871
to sew.

470
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:40,271
-Uh, I'll be over here.

471
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:42,671
-So, how does you
little duel work?

472
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:45,105
Tell me the rules,
and let's get to it.

00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:56,447

475
00:22:57,016 --> 00:22:59,483
Hi its Rukia Kuchiki the
prettiest girl in the Bleach
cast

476
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:02,216
And I'd like to read you one of
my many fan letters.

477
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:05,983
Momako Inakino asks, "Rukia,
what's the secret to your
beauty?"

478
00:23:06,016 --> 00:23:07,449
This is not a gossip column.

479
00:23:07,483 --> 00:23:09,949
You're just jealous because you
didn't get any fan mail yet.

480
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:11,416
What!
Ha Ha Ha
