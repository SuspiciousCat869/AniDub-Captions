00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,842
NARRATOR: Ichigo defeated
Grimmjow, Espada Number

3
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:55,642
Six, in a deadly battle, and
successfully rescued Orihime.

4
00:01:55,675 --> 00:01:59,342
But shortly afterwards,
Nnoitra, Espada Number Five,

5
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,508
appeared, and challenged him.

6
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,708
Ichigo was forced into
yet another battle

7
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:06,908
without having time to
recover from his injuries.

8
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:09,175
His mobility was
greatly affected,

9
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,675
putting him in a
clear disadvantage.

10
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:14,875
-Well, I have news for you.

11
00:02:19,742 --> 00:02:21,208
So now you know.

12
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,508
That's my rank.

13
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,108
That careless piece
of garbage you barely

14
00:02:25,142 --> 00:02:26,875
managed to defeat back there?

15
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:30,108
I rank higher than he does.

16
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:32,775
You're as good as dead.

17
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:33,908
Look at that.

18
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:35,508
I forgot your name.

19
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,275
--[panting] Why are we
running away again?

20
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:43,242
Why?

21
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:47,275
-Meanwhile, Uryu, Renji,
Pesche, and Dondochakka

22
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:49,275
escaped from
Szayelaporro's palace

23
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:51,042
and were heading
deep into Las Noches.

24
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:53,008
-You want to wait around
for that guy in a room

25
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:55,108
where we can't use our powers?

26
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,442
-No way.

27
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:58,175
And besides, now
it looks like we're

28
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,742
going to have to save Rukia
and Chad as well as Orihime.

29
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:02,908
-It certainly does.

30
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:14,375
-What?

31
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:15,875
It can't be.

32
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:19,342
Is this--

33
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,808
-Welcome back.

34
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:22,308
-Huh?

35
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:31,275
-Now then, shall show we
raise the curtain on Act 2?

36
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:34,875
[interposing voices]

37
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:43,342
-I said move!

38
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,242
I can't see!

39
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:45,708
Why are you crying like that?

40
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,042
What is it?

41
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:48,975
I wanna be upset
too, but I can't

42
00:03:49,008 --> 00:03:50,775
see what I'm supposed
to be upset about.

43
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:52,642
Now move!

44
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:54,775
-Whoa!

45
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:55,242
-Finally.

46
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,042
Oh, no!

47
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:57,908
I didn't wanna see that!

48
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:01,575
-[laughing] Well?

49
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:02,908
How was it?

50
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,775
Did you have a nice little
stroll through my palace?

51
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:09,342
I don't think I owe
you any explanations,

52
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,508
but let me tell you anyway.

53
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,042
The palace and myself are one.

54
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:17,008
Being inside of it is like
being inside of my own body,

55
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:19,508
where I will it
to do what I want.

56
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:23,142
Must bring back fond
memories, Soul Reaper.

57
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:26,042
Do you remember the first time
you stepped inside this place?

58
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:32,675
-Bankai!

59
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:45,175

61
00:04:56,408 --> 00:04:56,875
-Huh?

62
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,775
-There's something
you should know.

63
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:12,808
You can't use your Bankai here.

64
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:16,008
I have complete information
about your Bankai.

65
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:19,108
Its structure, abilities,
and spiritual pressure,

66
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:22,108
how it explosively
increases its attack power,

67
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:25,975
not to mention its
Reishi composition.

68
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:29,575
I've used all that
information and devised a trap

69
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:33,808
within the palace to
seal away your Bankai.

70
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:36,742
Naturally, I looked into
your spiritual pressure

71
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:38,375
as well, Quincy.

72
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:46,675
-[gasp]

00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:01,508

-[laughing] You ignorant fool.

75
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:21,042
Did you think your
measly little arrow

76
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:22,942
was actually going
to take me down?

77
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,208
What did you think occurred?

78
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:27,975
That you'd pierced my
body and ran me through?

79
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,642
Is that it?

80
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:32,508
[laughing]

81
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:36,008
I am invincible
inside this palace.

82
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,342
However, under
the circumstances,

83
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,675
I do give you credit for what
you were able to accomplish.

84
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,842
You actually managed
to tatter my clothes.

85
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,975
-But I think nonetheless
that even if the difference

86
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:53,375
in our powers is great,
and there is no comparison

87
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:54,142
in our strength--

You lousy Soul Reaper!

94
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,175
Do you know who
you're dealing with?

95
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,042
Huh?

96
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:22,508
-Exactly as planned.

Where are you going?

111
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,708
-Where am I going?

112
00:09:05,742 --> 00:09:07,408
SZAYELAPORRO (VOICEOVER):
I had no choice

113
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,242
but to change my clothes.

114
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:13,142
However, even during that
time, I kept watch on you all.

115
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:16,808
There are hidden cameras in
every wall of this palace.

116
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:26,508
And I can rearrange the
corridors any way I desire.

117
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:30,042
If I leave you behind in a
room, it's only natural for you

118
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:31,608
to try and escape.

119
00:09:31,642 --> 00:09:34,975
Sort of like a tiny
little fly trying

120
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:40,542
to escape from the
mouth of a giant dragon.

121
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:44,642
All I did was trick you into
running around in circles,

122
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:47,442
moving from corridor
to corridor, only

123
00:09:47,475 --> 00:09:50,175
to return to the
exact same place.

124
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:56,675
Pretty good joke,
wouldn't you say?

125
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,575
Then again, maybe you
wouldn't say that.

126
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:02,842
You probably think making
you run around long corridors

127
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,708
and then up and down
extremely tall stairways,

128
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:08,108
only to end up back
in the original room,

129
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:11,075
is one of the worst
jokes you've ever heard.

130
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:15,242
But I've got a much worse joke.

131
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:18,042
The fact that such
lowly worms as you

132
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,175
dare to irritate
me to this extent

133
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,642
and force me to release my
full power to destroy you?

134
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:29,342
Well, that, to me,
is a much worse joke.

135
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:29,842
Sip.

136
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:32,775

-Unbelievable!

-What is this?

-Sorry to keep you all waiting.

147
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:30,842
Now, the curtain shall rise
on the long awaited Act Two.

148
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,608
Oh, that's not right.

149
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:36,542
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,275
I take that back.

151
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:42,242
To be more precise, it's
not how Act Two begins.

152
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,208
Its how it ends.

-[whimpering]

154
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:48,508
-What is it?

155
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,275
-I have no idea.

156
00:11:51,308 --> 00:11:52,908
-Watch out!

157
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:54,908
I don't know what it
is, but don't touch it.

158
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:56,708
-Easier said than done!

159
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:02,008
-Oh boy!

160
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,342
Whoa, I think I'm
coming out of my head.

161
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,875
-Huh?

162
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:07,875
Damn it!

163
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,108
-What the hell are you doing?

164
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:24,842
-Hey, no fair!

165
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,608
You said don't touch it, but
now you all have doubles and I

166
00:12:28,642 --> 00:12:29,108
don't!

00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,375
-Yahoo!

169
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:32,142
More of me to go around!

170
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:34,108
-What is the matter with you?

171
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:35,775
-We weren't trying to get hit!

172
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:36,975
-Now you tell me!

173
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:40,142
I thought you guys were
leaving me out on purpose!

174
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:42,342
-I'd like to leave
you out of everything!

175
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,742
-Please allow me my
last shred of dignity.

176
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:47,008
-Hey, will you two
just cut the crap?

177
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:55,742
-[laughing]

178
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,608
Now then, all the characters
are assembled on stage.

179
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:02,442
Let's not make the
audience wait anymore.

180
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:04,875
As you might presume,
your doppelgangers

181
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:07,975
possess the same powers
and abilities as you.

182
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:10,975
Fighting haphazardly
only invites death.

183
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:12,408
-[growling]

184
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:13,875
-[whimper]

185
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:16,475
-However, you
should all be happy.

186
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:20,775
I have one piece of
deliciously good news for you.

187
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:23,608
I decided to lift the
trap that seals off

188
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,375
your powers in this room.

189
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:27,075
Just consider it a gift.

190
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:29,275
-Huh?

191
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,242
-And so you can fight
to your heart's content

192
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:35,542
against your alter egos
and kill yourselves off.

193
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:37,742
[laughing]

194
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,442
-Damn it!

195
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:42,208
-So before we can
fight our enemy,

196
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:44,308
we must fight ourselves first.

197
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:47,075
It's kind of like a
zen riddle, in a way.

198
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,308
He's right about one thing.

199
00:13:54,342 --> 00:13:55,608
This is a bad joke.

200
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,475
-Your moves are
quite impressive.

201
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:16,142
First time fighting against
a long range weapon?

202
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:19,008
-Second time, actually.

203
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,508
-Is that so?

204
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:22,108
-Ichigo, no!

205
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:26,942
Please stop this!

206
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:28,342
I'm begging you!

207
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,175
Can't you see that
Ichigo is hurt?

208
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,642
-Shut up, you
ignorant little fool!

209
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:33,942
Who cares if he's
injured or not?

210
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:35,475
This is a battle.

211
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,375
It's not supposed
to be a fair fight.

212
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:41,875
A battle is a monster from
which inequality and intolerance

213
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:42,842
are born.

214
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,342
A battle forms in stages.

215
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,142
First, hatred develops.

216
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:49,042
Then hell is unleashed.

217
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:51,975
For various reasons,
one makes an enemy.

218
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:55,608
And at that moment, everything
pulses towards a battle.

219
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:59,075
You think you can come wandering
into your enemy's backyard,

220
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,708
cause a ruckus with
all that fighting,

221
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:04,075
and expect to sneak out
without being noticed?

222
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:08,242
Bring it on.

223
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,675
Obviously, I watched you
fight against Grimmjow

224
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:14,842
from the beginning, so I
already know your every move

225
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,475
even before you make it.

226
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:24,442
-[whimpering]

227
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:39,908
-This is bad!

228
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:41,042
This is bad, Uryu!

229
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:42,442
-It's a little late to panic.

230
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,242
-You don't understand
what's going on.

231
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,708
With another handsome
guy like that around,

232
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:49,242
all the girls are gonna go for
him and I'll wind up alone!

233
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:51,142
-That's what you're
worried about?

234
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:53,275
-Don't pay any
attention to that idiot!

235
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:54,075
-Roar!

236
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:54,575
Zabimaru!

237
00:15:57,308 --> 00:15:58,342
-[wailing]

238
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,342
-Will you two quit
talking nonsense already

239
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,575
and start fighting?

240
00:16:01,608 --> 00:16:04,708
Let's go!

241
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:05,275
Roar!

242
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:05,775
Zabimaru!

243
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:15,342
-Well, I guess we
have no choice.

244
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,808
What do you say we
get down to business?

245
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:18,375
-Yeah!

246
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:21,942
Let's get it on!

247
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:22,808
-[screaming]

248
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:24,442
-Uh-oh!

249
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:26,042
-Why avoid it?

250
00:16:26,075 --> 00:16:27,875
I thought I'd give you
a chance to increase

251
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:29,875
your handsome numbers even more.

252
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:30,775
-Oh, thanks anyway!

253
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:39,375
-Oh, no!

254
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:41,275
Now a bunch more appeared!

255
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:42,508
-What are you doing?

256
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:45,308
-But I'm not cut out for this!

257
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:47,308
-Hm.

258
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:51,308
-[laughing]

259
00:16:54,308 --> 00:17:01,742
-[panting]

260
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:05,742
-Oh, Ichigo.

261
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,708
-[laughing]

262
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,675
-Too slow.

263
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,175
Huh?

264
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:35,675
Such a nice sword.

265
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,308
But it's a real shame
that it only looks sharp.

266
00:17:38,342 --> 00:17:40,342
I shouldn't have
bothered dodging it.

267
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:46,142
-Ichigo!

268
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:50,908
-Please don't even
think about it.

269
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:53,808
With your level of power,
you cannot hope to win.

270
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:56,675
It may be true that your
power is tremendous,

271
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,775
but the Reishi called
Rikka that configures

272
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:01,742
your power is extremely fragile.

273
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:04,442
Even I could easily
destroy them.

274
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:08,608
The only reason I don't do
so is because your power

275
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:11,842
belongs to Lord Aizen.

276
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,675
Lord Aizen has
strictly ordered us

277
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:17,775
not to destroy your
Rikka unless attacked.

278
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:22,375
If you do attack,
I shall destroy it.

279
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:24,942
So don't force my hand.

280
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:26,108
ORIHIME (VOICEOVER): Ichigo.

281
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,208
Wait a minute.

282
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:37,342
I don't see Nell.

283
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,808
-Is something wrong?

284
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:40,908
ORIHIME (VOICEOVER): Oh no!

285
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:43,842
-No, it's-- it's nothing.

286
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:44,975
-Hm?

287
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:48,075
I see why you're worried.

288
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:55,705
I don't see the little Arrancar
who was with you earlier.

289
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:08,974
There she is.

290
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:15,608
-[scream]

291
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:17,541
-Leave her alone!

292
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:21,708
-[whimpering]

293
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:29,674
-Ichi!

294
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,174
Huh?

295
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:46,041
-Are you Nell?

296
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:49,774
-Huh?

297
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:57,841
-Uh-huh.

298
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:59,341
-I thought it was you.

299
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:01,474
That scar gives you away.

300
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:04,774
Boy, you've really let yourself
become all shabby, huh?

301
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:10,341
Tell me, does your mask throb
after it's been cracked?

302
00:20:10,374 --> 00:20:13,708
-[whimpering]

303
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:16,908
-What's going on
here, you bastard?

304
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:17,941
-Huh?

305
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:21,208
-How the hell do you
know who Nell is?

306
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:23,674
--[wailing] I'm being
chased by myself!

307
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,641
Help me, please!

308
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:26,141
-Whoa!

309
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:30,474
-Oh, why'd you move?

310
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:32,274
I was counting on
you to break my fall.

311
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:34,774
Don't you want to help out a
scared friend who's in trouble?

312
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:37,074
All I really want
is to be accepted.

313
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:38,274
-Stop your nonsense!

314
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:40,408
This isn't some self-help
group therapy session!

315
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:43,274
It's a battle for our lives!

316
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,941
-[wail]

317
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:48,674
-Damn you two!

318
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,974
You managed to dodge our
Dondochakka Press Attack!

319
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:54,141
-Starting to get the
picture now, crybaby?

320
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:57,241
-Why am I always being
attacked by everyone?

321
00:20:57,274 --> 00:20:58,974
I have no time for this!

322
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,641
Someone's out there
waiting for me!

323
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:01,708
-Waiting?

324
00:21:01,741 --> 00:21:03,374
-Who knows what's
happening to poor Nell?

325
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:05,174
We have to look
for her right away!

326
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,708
-I know we have
to look for Nell,

327
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:09,574
but we can't do that until
we get out of here first!

328
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:10,141
-No, please!

329
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:11,208
Right away!

330
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:12,774
We have to find her
as soon as possible.

331
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:13,708
-Hm?

332
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,041
-I've been sensing
it for a while.

333
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,241
She's frightened!

334
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,141
Something terrible is
out there threatening her

335
00:21:18,174 --> 00:21:19,708
and scaring her!

336
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:22,708
We have to get out
of here now, please!

337
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:27,541
We can't let Nell get any
deeper into Las Noches!

338
00:21:27,574 --> 00:21:31,874
-I wonder, what possible
reason would you

339
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:33,808
have for coming back here again?

340
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:36,441
Did you bring her
here, Soul Reaper?

341
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:37,541
Don't bother.

342
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:39,908
I can tell from your
expression that's a yes.

343
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:41,674
Funny you've been
dragging her around

344
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,674
without ever knowing who she is.

345
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,641
-What?

346
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:47,374
What do you mean?

347
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:53,574
--[laughing] Well, if you
don't know, I'll tell you.

348
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:56,441
You only know her as
Nell, but her full name

349
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:59,341
is Nelliel Tu Odelschwanck.

350
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:01,908
She's a former Espada.

351
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:08,641
-[whimpering]

352
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:18,609
[theme song]

353
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:49,358
ORIHIME (VOICEOVER):
Nelliel Tu Odelschwanck

354
00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:51,325
can't be Nell's real name.

355
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:53,692
I mean, the Nell
I know can't even

356
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,158
pronounce a name like that.

357
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:56,725
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
Come on, Orihime.

358
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:59,025
Even Nell can say her own name.

359
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:00,325
Um, right, Hell?

360
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:01,825
NELL (VOICEOVER):
[nervous laughter]

361
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:05,358
Can't say for sure!
