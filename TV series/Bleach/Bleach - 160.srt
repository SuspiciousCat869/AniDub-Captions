NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

4
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:53,548
who was kidnapped by Sosuke
Aizen, Ichigo and his friends

5
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:56,315
snuck into Hueco Mundo,
the realm of the Hollows,

6
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:59,975
and infiltrated Aizen's
fortress, Las Noches.

7
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:03,675
While battling the Privaron
Espada, Gantenbaine Mosqueda,

8
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:05,809
Chad found he had
awakened a new power that

9
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,442
had been sleeping within him.

10
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,575
After defeating
Gantenbaine, Chad

11
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:12,542
was confronted by
Nnoitra, a full Espada,

12
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:16,809
and discovered he was
powerless against him.

13
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:18,075
-I knew it.

14
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:19,309
You're as weak as a newborn.

15
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:31,542
-Chad couldn't
have been defeated.

16
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:33,009
We made a vow.

17
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:36,475
We vowed we'd all come back,
and we'd all return alive.

18
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,709
-Obviously you're
aware of what happened.

19
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:45,609
If I were you, I'd be angry that
they were all foolish enough

20
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:48,175
to sneak into Hueco
Mundo in the first place.

21
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:54,475
NARRATOR: Meanwhile, Rukia, who
has been fighting the Espada

22
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,242
Aaroniero, finds
herself in grave danger.

23
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:10,709
-My true ability is
called Glotoneria.

24
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:13,042
It's quite simple, I
devour dead Hollows

25
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:17,142
and absorb both their
spirit energy and abilities.

26
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:18,709
Understand?

27
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,709
When Metastacia came back
in Kaien Shiba's body,

28
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:25,209
I devoured him and was able to
absorb both their abilities.

29
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:28,109
Because this body really
did belong to Kaien Shiba.

30
00:03:28,142 --> 00:03:31,075
The muscles retain
all his experience,

31
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:33,375
and the mind retains
all of his memories.

32
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:35,742
They're accessible for my use.

33
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:38,075
It's an elegantly
effective system,

34
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,409
when you think about it.

35
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:41,575
I simply accessed
all of his memories,

36
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:43,575
and acted accordingly.

37
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:45,375
It's the end game.

38
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:47,009
Allow me to demonstrate for you.

39
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:49,642
I'll show you what an Espada
sword release actually

40
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:50,909
looks like.

41
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:51,709
Devour here!

42
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:52,309
Glotoneria!

43
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:53,309
[music playing]

44
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:25,209
-It's there on your face.

45
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:26,642
You're terrified.

46
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:28,475
That fear is well-founded.

47
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,509
The form you see before you
is the result of combining

48
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:35,109
the strengths of every
Hollow I've ever devoured.

49
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,242
Don't imagine that the
release of a regular Arrancar

50
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:41,975
compares in any way with
the power of an Espada.

51
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,875
For your information,
my Glotoneria

52
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,709
can simultaneously display the
abilities of all the Hollows

53
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:48,609
that I've ever eaten.

54
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:52,675
The last time I
did an estimate, I

55
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:58,575
had devoured 33,650
Hollows, more or less.

56
00:04:58,609 --> 00:05:01,009
In case you can't do the math,
that means that this moment,

57
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,809
as you stand there alone
and consider fighting me,

58
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:09,763
you're facing off an army
of over 30,000 Hollows.

59
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:10,809
-Kaien.

60
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,342
[laughter]

61
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:32,942
-I'm very sorry,
Lieutenant Kaien.

62
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:36,109
But it looks like this
is as far as I can go.

63
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:45,009
It is because I killed
you that your body fell

64
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:46,675
into the hands of the Hollows.

65
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:56,709
If I'm honest with
myself, I killed you

66
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:59,442
in order to save my own life.

67
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:01,742
But even so--

68
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:04,642
I know this was painful.

69
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:08,509
But thanks to you, I'm saved.

70
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:13,075
Now I can still
leave my heart here.

71
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:16,375
-In the end, I got your
body back from the enemy.

72
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:21,675
And I kept telling myself that,
no matter how I felt initially,

73
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:26,375
my actions had actually
saved your life.

74
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:28,909
I can see now that I was wrong.

75
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,442
Here, in these last
moments of confrontation,

76
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:40,709
I accept the reality
of my defeat.

77
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:43,109
I no longer have the
strength to raise my sword

79
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:49,375
I no longer have the will to

-Because you wouldn't respond.

The wind whispers
against my face.

106
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:05,275
The forest path
opens up before me.

107
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:09,142
The rustling of the
leaves in the trees,

108
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:10,375
the smell of the grass.

I remember each tree.

115
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:47,975
I remember my feelings,

between anxiety,

What kind of greeting
is that supposed to be?

128

I am your commanding officer.

129
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:31,042
You are supposed to
state your name and say,

130
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:32,575
pleased to meet you, sir.

131
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:35,609
What's your name, dammit?

-It's Rukia Kuchiki, sir.

-Hm.

134

And?

00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:42,575
-And, and I'm pleased
to meet you, sir!

136
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:44,309
-All right.

137
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:46,509
You're OK, Rukia.

138
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:47,975
-A normal greeting.

139
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:49,575
A normal scolding.

140
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:53,909
A normal relationship between
officer and subordinate.

141
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:56,775
-Welcome to Squad 13, the
best squad of them all.

142
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,442
Unfortunately, our Captain
isn't in the best of health.

143
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,609
So I pretty much run
things around here.

144
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,575
In fact, it's not
a problem if now

145
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:07,909
and then you forget and actually
address me as Captain Kaien.

146
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,109
-Uh, OK.

147
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,875
I'll try to remember.

148
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:14,742
Yes, an ordinary relationship.

149
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:17,309
But this sense of
ordinary was exactly what

150
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:18,675
I'd been looking for.

151
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,042
-We're not finished yet.

152
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:22,442
Let's go.

153
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:23,442
-Right.

154
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:24,442
Are you ready?

155
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:33,075
In the middle of my
attack, a bird flew by,

156
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:36,175
and I was distracted
for a moment.

157
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:39,142
So as I made my second strike,
Kaien deflected it from below.

158
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:47,209
I remember every last detail.

159
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:48,842
I was supposed to
be concentrating

160
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,342
so hard that I would lose
sight of anything else.

161
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:55,275
Hm.

162
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,409
-So you're hungry, are ya?

163
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:04,075
Well all right then, fine.

that insistent about it.

165
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,442
-I beg your pardon, Lieutenant.

166
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:08,542
That's not it at all.

167
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:09,342
It was just that--

168
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,442
-Whatever, it's no big deal.

169
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:20,242
-What are you doing, Lieutenant?

170
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:22,342
You're not supposed to
toss a sword at someone

171
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,209
when it's unsheathed.

172
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:24,209
It's dangerous!

173
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:26,409
-What are you getting
so upset about?

174
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:29,042
Are you embarrassed, just
because you're hungry?

175
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:31,409
-I'm not hungry.

176
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:34,409
I was upset back then,
but not over being hungry.

177
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:37,742
It was something else.

178
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:38,909
Lord Byakuya.

179
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:41,175
My entrance to Squad 13
today was successful.

180
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:47,796
-What seat were you named?

181
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:51,029
-Well, my deepest
apologies, brother.

182
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:55,196
But with my abilities, I wasn't
able to qualify for an officer

183
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:57,729
seat upon entry.

184
00:11:57,762 --> 00:12:00,029
-I see.

185
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:00,529
You may go.

186
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,229
-I soon discovered I didn't have
the gift for sword fighting.

187
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:21,162
Dig your claws into the
wall of sinless dreams.

188
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:21,662
Hado #33.

189
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:24,896
Sokatsui!

190
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:33,262
While I was at the Spirit
Technique Soul Reaper Academy,

191
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,896
my Kido received high marks.

192
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:46,129
But when I joined
the 13th Squad,

193
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:49,296
my abilities were just average.

194
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:52,729
I'm obviously not as good as
the rest of these recruits.

195
00:12:52,762 --> 00:12:54,896
Why am I even here?

196
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:56,329
What is my purpose?

197
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:05,296
-I don't really measure up to
the others, so why am I here?

198
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:06,529
-What are you talking about?

199
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:07,929
Isn't your role obvious?

200
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:11,062
You're here so you
can fight and defend.

201
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:12,762
-I'm not clear.

202
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:14,462
What am I defending?

203
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:17,862
-You don't know what
you're defending?

204
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:20,729
A bunch of things, all
sorts of things, everything.

205
00:13:20,762 --> 00:13:22,629
-That's a really lame answer.

206
00:13:22,662 --> 00:13:24,429
That's like, nothing at all.

207
00:13:24,462 --> 00:13:27,896
Can't you give me something that
paints a more specific picture?

208
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:30,296
-Hm?

209
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:34,162
You want something
more specific, huh?

210
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:36,462
Rukia.

211
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:39,196
Have you ever heard our
Captain's view on life?

212
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:42,229
-Not really, no.

213
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:46,496
-In his opinion, there are two
types of battles in this world.

214
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,529
He's thought about
this quite a bit.

215
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:50,762
He says there are battles
to defend your life,

216
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,196
and battles to
defend your pride.

217
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,829
That makes sense, right?

218
00:13:54,862 --> 00:13:56,496
Seems like a fairly
clear separation.

219
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:03,629
But personally, Rukia, I don't
believe that's quite accurate.

220
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:05,396
Because in the
final analysis, you

221
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,162
end up defending the
exact same thing.

222
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:09,596
-The same thing?

223
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:12,896
What would that be?

224
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:16,029
-Your heart, of course.

225
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:16,862
-Please.

226
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:17,729
Get real.

227
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:18,462
-Do what?

228
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:19,662
I'm being serious here.

229
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,796
Show some respect.

230
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:24,762
Rukia, let me ask you something.

231
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:27,562
From your experience, where
do you think your heart is?

232
00:14:33,729 --> 00:14:37,462
-Well, if I had to guess, I
think somewhere around here.

233
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:40,129
Isn't that right?

234
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:41,596
-Ha.

235
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:45,896
If you want to be
literal about it.

236
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:49,462
But in my opinion, it's
more a state of mind.

237
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:51,896
I believe it's right here.

238
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:55,029
Not inside our bodies at all.

239
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,229
I think a heart is
created between people

240
00:14:57,262 --> 00:14:59,396
when they meet for
the first time.

241
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:03,196
A bond that's brought to
life between individuals.

242
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:05,596
It's an emotional connection.

243
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:08,729
When you think about something,
or care about someone,

244
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:10,296
that's where your heart is born.

245
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:13,162
If you were the only person
who existed in this world,

246
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:15,029
your heart would have
no way of forming,

247
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:17,062
so it just wouldn't be anywhere.

248
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:20,462
-I remember clearly,
those were the exact words

249
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:21,962
Kaien said to me.

250
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:24,129
-There's nothing to
worry about, Rukia.

251
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:27,829
If you believe, with all of your
heart, that you belong here,

252
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:29,696
then this is where you'll stay.

253
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,729
-He also said, if your
heart is here, then

254
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:35,562
that's all the reason in the
world you need to be here.

255
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:39,129
You must never doubt that.

256
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:40,562
-But listen, Rukia.

257
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:42,229
In the fights to come,
there's something

258
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:43,896
I must warn you about.

259
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:47,296
Something you must promise
me you will never, ever do.

260
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,562
I mean this.

261
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:53,496
You must never die alone.

262
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:56,662
Our souls are our bodies.

263
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:59,496
And when we die, our bodies
turn to dust and become

264
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,696
the reishi that go on to
form the Soul Society.

265
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,596
But where do our hearts go?

266
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:13,429
We entrust our hearts
to our friends.

267
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:16,796
-I'm not sure I
completely understand.

268
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:19,329
If you entrust your
heart to your friends,

269
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:23,896
it will continue to
live on inside them.

270
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:28,229
That's the most important thing
you'll learn from my training.

271
00:16:28,262 --> 00:16:30,396
Don't you dare die alone, Rukia.

272

-Huh?

278
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,801
I see you're still
conscious, somehow.

279
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,034
That's admirable.

280
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:24,601
Or perhaps, I should
say, it's pitiful.

281
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:28,567
You can struggle all you want,
but the fact still remains,

282
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:29,701
this fight is over.

283
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:30,801
And you're about to die.

284
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:41,901
It's amusing that you
still have the strength

285
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:44,567
to grasp your sword.

-Remembered what?

Whatever you're doing,
it's a useless gesture.

289

Are you going to take me on
with that stub of a sword?

290
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:00,634
You're pathetic!

-I finally remembered
where his heart resides.

You may have Kaien

after you devoured him.

You may have his memories,
and his techniques.

But Kaien lives within me.

if I went with you,

00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:33,834
I'd be free from
all my suffering.

You promised, didn't you?

So why am I in so much pain?

It's more than I can bear.

-I've known loneliness.

327
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:23,262
The loneliness of one
who's been locked away.

328
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:25,595
And I've known happiness.

329
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:28,562
The happiness felt when your
friends come to rescue you.

330
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:35,962
-Hey.

331
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:38,928
-And I've known something else.

332
00:21:38,962 --> 00:21:40,428
I've known terror.

333
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:43,928
The terror of seeing those very
friends injured and defeated.

334
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:55,362
Don't worry, Orihime.

335
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:58,719
I'm coming to save you.

-Master Nnoitra,
what were you doing

339
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:51,489
when you placed your finger
in the ground the other day?

340
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:53,056
-If you must know,
that's how I search

341
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:55,356
for different spiritual
pressures within Las Noches.

342
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:56,489
-You can do that?

343
00:23:56,523 --> 00:23:58,456
I'm going to try it, too!

344
00:23:58,489 --> 00:23:59,523
-Let's go, Tesla.

345
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:00,823
-Yes, sir.

346
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,356
-Hey, don't you even want
to see if I can pull it off?
