1
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,466
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
I'm Ichigo Kurosaki,

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,566
and other than having the
ability to see spirits,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,566
I used to be an ordinary
high school student.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,266
But the day I met
Rukia Kuchiki, I

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,100
was given the powers
of a soul reaper

6
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:16,133
in order to protect the
world of the living.

7
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,500
As I began my work as a
substitute Soul Reaper,

8
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,966
I found myself thrown
into a neverending battle.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,700
In the midst of everything,
my best friend Orihime Inoue

10
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:26,833
was abducted by ex-Soul
Reaper Captain Sosuke Aizen.

11
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:28,600
My friends Chad
and Uryu joined me

12
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:30,433
as I raced to rescue Orihime.

13
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:32,833
Once we arrived in Hueco
Mundo, we entered a fight

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,100
with powerful enemies
known as Arrancars.

15
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:36,933
We were too late to
keep Aizen from entering

16
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:39,566
the world of the living, but
luckily, the 13 Court Guard

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,666
Squads were already
there to stop him.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,433
An all out war was
about to begin!

19
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:46,433
[theme song]

20
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,115
NARRATOR: In order to prevent
Sosuke Aizen from wiping out

21
00:02:31,148 --> 00:02:34,415
Karakura Town, the Soul Reapers
moved the town to safety

22
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:35,748
within the Soul Society.

23
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:39,082
They then took up positions in
a fake Karakura Town created

24
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:40,382
within the world of the living.

25
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:46,348
Soul Reapers and Arrancars
then faced off in battle

26
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:47,815
throughout this new town.

27
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:51,315
Rangiku Matsumoto was matched
against the three Arrancars,

28
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:54,015
Apacci, Mila Rose, and Sung-Sun.

29
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:57,548
Lieutenant Momo Hinamori of
Squad 5 soon joined the battle.

30
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:03,248
The two Soul Reapers momentarily
gained the upper hand

31
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:06,615
through the use of Momo's Kido,
but the situation suddenly

32
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:09,048
changed after the three
Arrancars transitioned

33
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:11,348
to their Resurreccion forms.

34
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:11,982
-Quimera Parca.

35
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:22,082
-[gasp] What the--

36
00:03:25,548 --> 00:03:27,082
-What in the world is that?

37
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:41,915
-[hiss]

38
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:48,682
-Quimera Parca.

39
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:50,882
It's our pet, created
when the three of us

40
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:52,548
combine our left arms together.

41
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:55,582
You have to admit,
he's a work of art.

42
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:57,482
We like to call him Ayon.

43
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:09,415
-Why do I feel so
cold all of a sudden?

44
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:11,282
It's like I'm peering
into a deep pit,

45
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:14,682
and the bottom is so far
away I can't even see it.

46
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:27,115
-Oh, did I forget to warn you?

47
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:30,715
Ion is deadly, so you have to be
careful when you're around him.

48
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:32,682
-[gasp]

49
00:04:36,715 --> 00:04:41,148
-There are broken bones
throughout my body.

50
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:43,415
Both Rangiku and myself
have been taken out

51
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:45,115
within moments of each other.

52
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:46,248
This is crazy.

53
00:04:46,282 --> 00:04:50,582
There's no way we can
win against this thing.

54
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:53,315
-Bakudo Number 37, Tsuriboshi!

55
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:19,082
IZURU (VOICEOVER):
Rangiku's condition

56
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:21,582
is even more critical.

57
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:23,082
-[grunt]

58
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:32,548
-[grunt]

59
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,548
-[yelling]

60
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:37,048
Huh?

61
00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:40,048
Damn it!

62
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:42,048
-[roar]

63
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:45,048
-[groan]

64
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,315
-It hasn't noticed me yet.

65
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,115
I think I've got it.

66
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:57,482
Huh?

67
00:05:57,515 --> 00:05:59,448
[scream]

68
00:06:02,915 --> 00:06:03,382
-Huh?

69
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,282
-I need a little more time.

70
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,182
I'm so close to finishing.

71
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,615
You're almost there!

72
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:34,815
-[gasp]

73
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,715
-[scream]

74
00:06:45,148 --> 00:06:48,282
-Captain, what was that?

75
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:49,515
-Calm down, you fool.

76
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:51,882
It's just the head captain.

77
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:53,282
-What?

78
00:06:53,315 --> 00:06:55,915
The head captain himself came
out and took part in the fight?

79
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,282
-Omaeda, come here, please.

80
00:06:58,315 --> 00:06:59,382
-Huh?

81
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:02,015
What is it?

82
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:04,782
Nice try, captain, but I won't
fall for the same trick twi--

83
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:10,915
-We've all come here
to fight, and that

84
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:14,448
means even the head
captain is no exception.

85
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:16,448
Now quit acting
like such an idiot.

86
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:18,248
-That's mean of you.

87
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:19,982
[groaning]

88
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:29,248
-It's Head Captain Yamamoto.

89
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:35,015
-Who's this geezer?

90
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:35,748
-Another soldier.

91
00:07:35,782 --> 00:07:36,915
Big deal.

92
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:38,548
-But he's a pretty good fighter.

93
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:41,048
He was able to injure
Aion, but now he'll

94
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:43,315
find out what happens when
you get our creation angry.

95
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:48,748
I wouldn't want to be him
in the next few minutes.

96
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:50,548
-Inexcusable, making
your head captain

97
00:07:50,582 --> 00:07:52,815
come out here to
the front lines!

98
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:57,182
You squad members are
quite a disappointment!

99
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:58,882
-Please forgive us, Captain.

100
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:00,315
-No need for that.

101
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:03,048
Now stay focused.

102
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,982
Instead of
apologizing to me, you

103
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:07,215
should be keeping a sharp
eye on your opponents.

104
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:14,882
-[roar]

105
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:16,382
-What happened?

106
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:21,415
You mean that injury
wasn't enough to kill him?

107
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:22,382
-[groaning]

108
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:25,282
-Rangiku, hang in there.

109
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,248
-Hm.

110
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:35,748
Well, it appears you have
not learned your lesson.

111
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,715
-[roar]

112
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:47,648
-[roar]

113
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:57,082
[roar]

114
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:10,015
--[laughing] It looks like
he's finally lost it.

115
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:56,715
-When you are ready,
I will be right here.

116
00:10:56,748 --> 00:10:58,448
-What?

117
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:00,982
-It is obvious to
me that you are

118
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:03,315
a simple beast who
only lives for killing.

119
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:06,948
How pitiful.

120
00:11:12,248 --> 00:11:15,548
Ryujin Jakka, Hitotsume.

121
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:16,048
Nadegiri.

122
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:45,315
-No way!

123
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:56,282
-So you refuse to
die, is that it?

124
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,748
How unfortunate.

125
00:11:57,782 --> 00:12:00,748
It pains me to have to
continuously beat on

126
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:02,148
such a pitiful beast.

127
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,148
This is your last warning.

128
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:08,882
-[roar]

129
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:09,815
-As you wish.

130
00:12:23,648 --> 00:12:25,015
-Such power.

131
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:42,518
-Your energy and focus
have increased quite a bit.

132
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:44,551
Is it because your
subordinate is safe now

133
00:12:44,585 --> 00:12:47,818
that your head captain
has joined the battle?

134
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,185
-That's none of your business!

135
00:13:09,985 --> 00:13:12,851
-Izuru, strengthen your barrier.

136
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:14,951
This fight is not yet over.

137
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,951
-Wha--

138
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:21,418
-[yelling]

139
00:13:21,451 --> 00:13:23,451
-I admire your bravery
in challenging me

140
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:24,551
with only one arm.

141
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:33,918
-[scream]

142
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:41,318
-As a show of respect, I'll
let you off with just burns.

143
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:03,318
-What?

144
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:08,285
-What's that?

145
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:17,118
-Apacci, Sung-Sun, Mila Rose.

146
00:14:17,151 --> 00:14:19,451
You have all fought well.

147
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:34,518
-As powerful as you are, you're
still just the third strongest?

148
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:37,451
-As powerful as I am, you say.

149
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:40,018
I don't recall showing you
the full extent of my power

150
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:40,851
just yet.

151
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:53,818
-Bankai!

152
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,651
Daiguren Hyorinmaru!

153
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:14,418
-You're strong,
you Soul Reapers.

154
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:16,818
-Thank you for the compliment.

155
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:19,685
-I wanted to dodge
any confrontations

156
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,118
and wait until the
battle had ended.

157
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:25,951
But I see now that's not
going to be possible.

158
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:28,185
-I'm happy to hear it.

159
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,285
At this point in the
battle, there's only three

160
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:31,785
of you left to challenge us.

161
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:33,851
From what I can see
up there, that girl

162
00:15:33,885 --> 00:15:35,485
is number three, right?

163
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:44,751
On a personal note, I'm hoping
that old man is number one.

164
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:47,618
I'd be much more comfortable
if you were number two.

165
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:49,751
-Hm.

166
00:15:49,785 --> 00:15:50,251
I see.

167
00:15:58,051 --> 00:16:00,585
Sorry, but I'm number one.

168
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:08,618
-[sigh] I was afraid of that.

169
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:10,418
Too bad for me.

170
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:13,985
If you're the strongest, it
makes my battle more difficult,

171
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,285
especially because
we are so much alike.

172
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:48,585
-C-Captain.

173
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:50,118
-Here they come.

174
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:56,618
-[screaming]

175
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:38,012
-[growling] Roar, Zabimaru!

176
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:43,607
Did you like that?

177
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,907
Here I come again!

178
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:49,340
-El Directo!

179
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:56,373
-[screaming]

180
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:04,273
-There are more.

181
00:18:04,307 --> 00:18:04,773
-Right.

182
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,407
-Hm.

183
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:36,007
-They're not getting past us.

184
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,373
-Tsugi no Mai!

185
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:37,873
Hakuren!

186
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:41,273
-[screaming]

187
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:43,240
-[grunting]

188
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:02,207
-The Exequias Army
has been wiped out.

189
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,607
You are the only
one that's left.

190
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:09,073
-You're very foolish.

191
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,707
Even if you are to
sacrifice yourself in order

192
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,373
to allow Ichigo Kurosaki
to get beyond this point,

193
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:18,373
all that awaits him
is certain death.

194
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,373
-Nothing you say is
going to intimidate me.

195
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:25,607
And besides, I have no
intention of sacrificing myself.

196
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,973
-I see.

197
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:28,607
So be it.

198
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,540
In that case, I shall serve as
a guide to your destruction.

199
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,143
-I'm not intimidated by
you, as I already said.

200
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:51,701
-[growling]

201
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:26,479
-Ichigo!

202
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:55,179
-What's the point in continuing?

203
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,446
-What?

204
00:20:57,479 --> 00:21:00,113
-The Garganta is closed.

205
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:03,879
Those of you who were injured
battling against Espadas

206
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:06,279
no longer have anywhere to go.

207
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:10,513
You will spend your time here
without direction or purpose,

208
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:14,079
and eventually die by our hands.

209
00:21:14,113 --> 00:21:16,713
In a short time, Karakura
Town will disappear, along

210
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:18,679
with the Soul Society.

211
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:20,513
They will be destroyed
by Lord Aizen

212
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,679
after he creates the Oken.

213
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:25,846
You will have no way to
stop that from happening.

214
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:26,913
-Quiet!

215
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:27,879
We're not done!

216
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:33,813
Don't underestimate my power!

217
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:37,979
I know the 13 Court Guard Squads
will be able to stop Aizen!

218
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:42,479
And if that's still not enough,
then I'll stop him myself.

219
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:46,013
I'll defeat you, and
then destroy him!

220
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:46,513
Ulquiorra!

221
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:55,146
You're going down, damn you,
and I'll make sure of it!

222
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:57,779
I'm gonna be taking
Orihime back with me!

223
00:21:57,813 --> 00:21:59,246
-Ichigo.

224
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,213
-[yelling]

225
00:22:05,713 --> 00:22:08,679
[yelling]

226
00:22:15,861 --> 00:22:17,828
[theme song]

227
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:47,018
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
Get ready, Ulquiorra!

228
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,151
Here I come!

229
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:49,818
ULQUIORRA (VOICEOVER):
Wait a minute, Ichigo.

230
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:51,051
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): What?

231
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:51,884
ULQUIORRA (VOICEOVER):
Apparently

232
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:53,384
we have a programming problem.

233
00:23:53,418 --> 00:23:55,818
I have to temporarily
suspend this battle.

234
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,851
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): W-what
are you talking about?

235
00:23:57,884 --> 00:23:58,651
ULQUIORRA (VOICEOVER):
The producers

236
00:23:58,684 --> 00:23:59,751
are shifting the storyline.

237
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:03,284
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
Why would they do that?
