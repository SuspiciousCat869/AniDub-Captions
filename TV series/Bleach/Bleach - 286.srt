1
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:12,666
Quit your damn jumping around,
ya gutless loser!

2
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,566
Wauughh!

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,566
Yaah-hoo-hoo!

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Uh?

5
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,424
Tell me, what do
you have to fear?

6
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:13,291
Remember a hundred years ago?
Every single one of you died.

7
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:16,024
Have you forgotten that night?

8
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:19,457
Hiyori!!

9
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:22,458
[rising yell]
Yaaahh!

10
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:29,424
[gasp]

11
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,591
Well at least now you
are leaving us.

12
00:02:55,591 --> 00:03:00,058
(Short CT Giving in Exhale)

13
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,364
Hiyori!!

14
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:22,298
Hiyori...

15
00:03:22,564 --> 00:03:27,498
Ngh... I'm so sorry Shinji.

16
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:28,498
Don't speak.

17
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:32,498
I... did hear you...

18
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:35,364
I just couldn't hold back...

19
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:40,798
Hiyori... Tell me...

20
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:44,564
What can I do to save you?
How can I help you now?!

21
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:54,431
That's it... Orihime...!

22
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:58,364
Orihime's healing powers
should be able to heal
your wounds.

23
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:02,338
Ichigo... Damn it, what the hell
is taking you so long?!

24
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:06,471
Ichigo!!

25
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:23,038
Damn it!

26
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:31,304
Ah! Now I've
caught you!

27
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:35,671
<i>You're the last one.</i>

28
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:39,137
<i>Catching you wasn't easy</i>
<i>'cuz you're so tiny...</i>

29
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:43,704
Ha ha ha ha!
But now you're
all mine!

30
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,538
<i>Don't struggle.</i>

31
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:51,538
This requires
a delicate
touch from me.

32
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:54,704
It's not easy to hold
you without crushing you.

33
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:02,911
Now, then...
How exactly should
I kill you?

34
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,944
Hmm... Let me think...

35
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:09,678
Squeezing you into a
bloody pulp with my hands
just isn't that amusing.

36
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:14,144
Huh?

37
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:15,678
Sokatsui!

38
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:25,444
[overselling]
Ow! That stung! That hurt!
That really hurt me!

39
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:27,711
You sure got me
with that one!

40
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,678
<i>[Gasp] That didn't</i>
<i>do a thing to him!</i>

41
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:33,978
That was so painful...

42
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:38,011
Guess it made me lose my grip!!

43
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:40,544
Aahh!

44
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:43,544
Hunh!

45
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,678
<i>What incredible power!</i>

46
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:52,578
<i>I can't get back into my</i>
<i>posture because the wind</i>
<i>pressure's too intense!</i>

47
00:05:58,578 --> 00:06:00,011
Huh.

48
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:03,418
That was boring...
It wasn't a bit
satisfying.

49
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:07,618
Now let's see...

50
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:10,118
Guess I'll go kill
that guy who
defeated Ulquiorra.

51
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:11,684
[Ichigo]
And who might that be?

52
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:12,718
Huh?

53
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,018
So! You're here!

54
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:30,551
Hey.

55
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:36,651
You've really packed on some
pounds since the last time I
saw you. You look bloated.

56
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:38,251
Ichigo!

57
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:43,951
Ichigo Kurosaki...You are dead!

58
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,584
Urrgg...

59
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,151
<i>Ichigo...</i>

60
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:02,024
You came. But where
are the others?

61
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:05,991
I thought you'd headed
out to save Orihime
and bring her back.

62
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,624
I did save her...

63
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,058
Right now, she's above
us healing Uryu.

64
00:07:18,158 --> 00:07:20,224
She's safer
there anyway.

65
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:23,624
Ichi--

66
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:33,191
Hm?

67
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:40,624
Quit your damn jumping around,
ya gutless loser!

68
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:47,158
Stay here Rukia,
got it?

69
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:52,491
I don't have much time
to finish this guy off
before I head back to
the World of the Living.

70
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:55,358
This stupid war
has gotta end now.

71
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,658
<i>Ichigo...</i>

72
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:05,631
<i>What happened to you</i>
<i>while you were up there?</i>

73
00:08:06,464 --> 00:08:11,064
<i>You don't have the look of</i>
<i>someone who's just been</i>
<i>victorious in battle...</i>

74
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:15,164
And you don't look like someone
who's ready to fight again...

75
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:19,431
Something has changed in you...

76
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:22,431
<i>What happened? Ichigo...</i>

77
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:27,564
[charging yell]
Yaahhh!

78
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:32,564
I told you to stop
moving around so much!

79
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:36,164
C'mon! Is your plan to just have
me chase you?!

80
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:43,164
Stop running away!

81
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,664
Got-cha!

82
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:48,364
Damn you're loud.

83
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:53,264
I may be moving around,
but I'm definitely not
running away.

84
00:08:55,598 --> 00:08:58,598
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>I'm just trying to get</i>
<i>you in an area that's far</i>
<i>enough from the others!</i>

85
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:02,471
Now that it's just you and me...

86
00:09:02,571 --> 00:09:04,004
Mmm?

87
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:08,304
I can crush you...with force.

88
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:14,604
Wauuughhh!!

89
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,471
<i>What was that?</i>
<i>Am I seeing things?!</i>

90
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:37,704
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>I couldn't see</i>
<i>everything clearly...</i>

91
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:42,704
<i>But it looked like...</i>
<i>the markings on his</i>
<i>mask were different!</i>

92
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:48,338
<i>I'm almost positive Ichigo's</i>
<i>mask has been changing...</i>

93
00:09:49,404 --> 00:09:53,471
<i>And I've never seen a</i>
<i>mask with markings like</i>
<i>the one he just used...</i>

94
00:09:57,238 --> 00:10:00,504
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>Ichigo!</i>

95
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:11,911
<i>That's weird... Something</i>
<i>doesn't feel right...!</i>

96
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:16,144
<i>My Hollowfication...</i>
<i>there was something</i>
<i>really different about it.</i>

97
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:20,111
<i>My mask...it seemed heavier.</i>

98
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:25,111
<i>Is it because of that?!</i>

99
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:31,044
<i>That battle...Did it somehow</i>
<i>affect my Hollowfication...?</i>

100
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:35,278
RAAHHHH!!!

101
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:43,444
Aum... P-too!

102
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:48,278
Damn it...

103
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:52,178
Your attack actually
nicked me a little.
You pest!

104
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:54,578
Nicked him a little?!

105
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:58,244
I hit him with my Getsuga Tensho
while I was Hollowfied...

106
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:00,244
<i>All it did was nick him?!</i>

107
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,318
What's up?! You look
pretty surprised!

108
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:07,518
<i>Take a good look at my number;</i>
<i>it's Zero!</i>

109
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:12,551
Yammy Riyalgo,
Espada Number
Zero...

110
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:19,118
None of those other Espadas you
fought before me even come close
to being as strong as I am.

111
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:23,251
I'm stronger than Grimmjow,
Nnoitora, and Ulquiorra
combined!

112
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:26,651
Those others were worthless
garbage compared to me!

113
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:28,351
[punching]
Hyaahhh!

114
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:41,451
You like that? I do!
That's not a Cero.
It's a Bala!

115
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,318
And that's real power!

116
00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:46,251
So tell me, do you have a
way to defend against that?

117
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:49,984
You mean do I have a defense?
Truth is...

118
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:53,651
I've never really had any plans
against any attacks.

119
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:56,384
I just knew
I had to win, so I did.

120
00:11:57,118 --> 00:11:58,651
That's my plan.

121
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:02,224
I don't care if you're higher
ranked than the other Espadas
were.

122
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:04,991
To me, it's all the
same...

123
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:08,991
I've gotta defeat you, so
I'll find a way to do it.

124
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:11,124
It's simple.

125
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:12,124
Urgh.

126
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:14,124
Oh yeah?!

127
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,624
You think that you're
pretty smart, huh kid!?

128
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:23,291
<i>Well all that confidence</i>
<i>of yours won't stop me</i>
<i>from crushing you</i>

129
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:25,224
'Cuz I'm too
strong for you!!

130
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,024
Ichigo!

131
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:35,024
<i>Those others were worthless</i>
<i>garbage compared to me!</i>

132
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:37,391
<i>That's odd...</i>

133
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:42,391
I'm stronger than Grimmjow,
Nnoitora, and Ulquiorra
combined!

134
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:44,324
<i>Why would he say that?</i>

135
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:53,991
<i>A few of his Espada</i>
<i>comrades died...</i>

136
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,658
<i>Even Orihime felt</i>
<i>more pain about their</i>
<i>deaths than this guy.</i>

137
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,331
Huh??

138
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:13,064
It's strange, I never
expected any of you Espadas to
be friends with each other.

139
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:17,031
And I sure don't have regrets
defeating your comrades.

140
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:22,031
But I still don't think
it's right for you to
trash the other Espadas.

141
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:25,498
Your words dishonor them.

142
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:31,231
Hah!

143
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:32,464
Wha??

144
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:34,331
Ngh!

145
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:36,931
My mask!

146
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:40,398
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

147
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:42,064
I'm not sure what
just happened,

148
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:45,598
but it looks like you
can't use that irritating
mask of yours anymore!

149
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:48,398
<i>Damn it, what</i>
<i>happened to my mask?!</i>

150
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:51,264
<i>Does it have something to</i>
<i>do with that weird feeling</i>
<i>I had earlier?!</i>

151
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,131
Oh well, bad luck.
You did well to last
this long.

152
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:59,998
<i>I mean, you did better than</i>
<i>the scum lying back there...</i>

153
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:03,204
Mmmmm.
Time to die.

154
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:07,438
Errgghh!

155
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:11,104
[scream of anguish]
Eyahhhh!!

156
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,140
[Mayuri]
My, my...

157
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,573
How long is it going to take
for us to reach the place where
those morons are fighting?

158
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:34,406
I wonder sometimes
about that Aizen...

159
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:38,540
He does have his own ways
and has certainly done
some crazy things,

160
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:42,540
Like creating this giant
desert below the ceiling
of Las Noches...

161
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,806
It might be best if this
silly showdown of theirs
ended before I arrive.

162
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:51,140
Then I won't have to
waste any time waiting.

163
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,473
I can just collect
specimens.

164
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:58,173
Travelling at this
leisurely pace may not be
such a bad idea after all.

165
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:04,446
AUUGHH!!

166
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,546
Hado Number
Thirty Three.

167
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:10,580
<i>Sokatsui.</i>

168
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,580
WHAT THE HELL!!

169
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,613
Huh??

170
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,346
Ngh, that hurt...
What caused that blast?

171
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,813
How'd I get out
of his grip?

172
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:38,313
huh?!!

173
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:44,146
Why did you move to
attack him before me?
Stay out of this.

174
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:45,480
Why should I?

175
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,546
I made it here
before you did.
You really need to
learn your place.

176
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:55,613
Ha! It won't be my
fault if I slice
you up by mistake.

177
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:57,580
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Byakuya! Kenpachi!</i>

178
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:01,413
Huh?!

179
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:06,620
What? He's already getting up!?

180
00:16:07,086 --> 00:16:09,520
<i>Step aside,</i>
<i>Ichigo Kurosaki.</i>

181
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:13,520
Don't be stupid.

182
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,486
You always get your ass
whipped wherever you wind up!

183
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:19,620
It's pathetic.
Get out of the
way, you loser!

184
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:24,353
Huh?

185
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,086
Yahh!

186
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,653
Whu-What the hell
was that, Kenpachi?!

187
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:31,153
You really swung at me!
That's dangerous!

188
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:32,520
What're you trying
to do-Kill me?!??

189
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,486
That's right.
Cowards should die.

190
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:41,386
Wait, Kenpachi!
Now isn't the time for this!

191
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:48,520
Kenpachi!

192
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:51,420
Hurgh... my leg!

193
00:16:52,153 --> 00:16:54,386
You sneaky piece of crap,
that hurt!

194
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:57,786
That was a bad move and
you'll pay for that!

195
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,320
How dare you interfere
and cut my leg off!

196
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:04,460
I'm gonna kill you,
you damn insect!!

197
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,293
<i>[Kenpachi]</i>
<i>Oh good, so you can punch.</i>

198
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,060
That first one was bad,
it felt like a fly
buzzing around me.

199
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,093
But if you're going to hit me,
why don't you do it with all
your strength, maggot?

200
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,793
You're the pest here...
And it's time to swat you!

201
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,260
How's that, ya damn bug!

202
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,460
Can't talk so big now,
can yah?!

203
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:45,726
Kenpachi!

204
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,793
I told you to step aside,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

205
00:17:51,526 --> 00:17:52,493
But I--!

206
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,393
There's nothing for
you to do here.

207
00:17:55,093 --> 00:17:58,126
Get going and return to
the World of the Living.

208
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:02,426
I will I promise! But I've
got to defeat this guy first!

209
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,166
Besides, it's not like it's that
easy for me to get out of here!

210
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:09,466
Kisuke has to open things up on
the other side for me to go.

211
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,233
Really! You sure make a big
fuss about Kisuke Urahara
having to help you.

212
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:25,300
Mayuri Kurotsuchi...?!

213
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:28,766
How dare you!
Addressing me
in that manner!

214
00:18:29,466 --> 00:18:35,266
Well! It seems a substitute
Soul Reaper like yourself
doesn't give proper respect
to any authority figure.

215
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:39,333
You seem relaxed.
Is it because of
that wagon?

216
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,133
Very perceptive.

217
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:46,400
I have obtained some rather
rare treasures, so I'm
actually in a very good mood.

218
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,400
Furthermore, while I
was obtaining these
unique treasures,

219
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,100
I also had a chance to
analyze the structure
of the Garganta.

220
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,633
You analyzed
the Garganta?!!

221
00:18:55,733 --> 00:19:01,633
That's right. And I have
determined it has no flaws
and in fact it lasts
nearly indefinitely!

222
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,440
Just imagine Kisuke's
frustration!

223
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:09,540
This has me so pleased it's easy
to overlook the chattering of a
rude monkey like you!

224
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,106
<i>Prepare Nemu! We're sending</i>
<i>this half-Soul Reaper back</i>
<i>to the World of the Living!</i>

225
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:14,640
Yessir.

226
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:16,440
Wait! I still have
stuff to do here!

227
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,073
Oh shut up.

228
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:20,573
Test subjects like
yourself are supposed
to be silent.

229
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:25,073
This is an experiment,
so you have no right to
decide anything at all.

230
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,706
Listen closely, you
will be known as test
subject number one!

231
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:31,173
Test subject?!?

232
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,206
<i>There's no</i>
<i>need to worry.</i>

233
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,440
I'll make the trip
along with you.

234
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:42,440
Miss Unohana!

235
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,840
I never expected a volunteer.
Have you perhaps lost your mind,
Squad 4 Captain?

236
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:54,740
Why no. I have great trust
in your scientific abilities,
Captain Kurotsuchi.

237
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:59,473
I know you. I'm sure your
experiment will be successful.

238
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,146
You came all this way to
Hueco Mundo, saying you've
analyzed a Garganta.

239
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:08,513
If your experiment
fails, Kisuke Urahara
will laugh at you,

240
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:11,113
and I don't think you'd
allow that to happen...

241
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:13,546
You should think
before saying so much.

242
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:19,213
Since I've thoroughly analyzed
the Garganta, I do have the
ability to close it while
you're passing through it.

243
00:20:19,713 --> 00:20:21,746
That's quite
impressive.

244
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:23,680
Isane!

245
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,546
Yes ma'am!

246
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,813
You will stay here and
assist Captain Kuchiki
with whatever he needs.

247
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:30,180
Yes, I understand.

248
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:33,280
Now then Ichigo,
shall we be on our way?

249
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,680
But I have things
to finish up here!

250
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,280
Listen that Yammy guy
is really powerful!

251
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,213
I should stay so that
all three of us can
fight him together!

252
00:20:41,313 --> 00:20:43,646
<i>Ichigo, don't</i>
<i>overestimate</i>
<i>yourself...</i>

253
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:49,646
A captain of the 13 Court Guard
Squads doesn't need help from
the likes of you in a battle...

254
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Byakuya...

255
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:54,346
What is your duty?

256
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,613
<i>You know the answer.</i>

257
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:01,313
Your duty is to
protect Karakura town.

258
00:21:05,186 --> 00:21:08,586
Go on... You are their
Substitute Soul Reaper.

259
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:22,786
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Yeah, You're right.</i>

00:22:03,753 --> 00:22:05,093
I'm going.

263
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:50,535

<i>My name is not Rukia.</i>
