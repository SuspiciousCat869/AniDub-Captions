1
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:10,133
Enrage!! Ira!!!

2
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:12,900
[grunting]

3
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:13,833
Shut up!

4
00:02:13,156 --> 00:02:15,222
Ulquiorra...!

5
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:26,222
Pick it up. Let's
finish this battle now.

6
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:30,956
The entity fighting you
earlier was a Hollowfied
being with no consciousness.

7
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:32,922
It was not
really me.

8
00:02:37,022 --> 00:02:38,756
If we're going to
settle this fight,

9
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:42,756
I have to be in the same
condition as you, or we
won't be evenly matched.

10
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:50,322
I am fine with it. If
that is what you want,
that is what you will get.

11
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:53,256
[gasping]

12
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:01,389
So this is how it ends.

13
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:08,122
Kill me, Ichigo.

14
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:12,522
I can't
do it.

15
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:14,822
What are you saying?

16
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:17,656
I don't want to,
not like this.

17
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:22,156
It's wrong.

18
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:24,789
This is not the way I
want to defeat you!

19
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:35,322
To the very end...
you just won't do
what I want.

20
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,522
And just when I was
finally becoming...

21
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:48,056
...a little bit intrigued
with the way you people
behave.

22
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:08,622
So let me ask you again,
girl...

23
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:10,256
Are you afraid of me?

24
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:19,522
No, I'm not afraid.

25
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,522
I understand.

26
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:40,622
I see now...

27
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:44,856
In the palm of my hand...

28
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,756
...is a heart.

29
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:05,122
Huh!

30
00:05:10,422 --> 00:05:14,422
[gasping]

31
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:19,989
Hey, do you guys feel
that? That Spiritual
Pressure... it's gone.

32
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:22,689
So does that mean
Ichigo won?

33
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,222
Aw, man! Right after I
got done killing all of
these guys,

34
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:40,356
I've been planning on
goin' to help out
Ulquiorra!

35
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:43,122
And then he just goes
and dies on me.

36
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:51,456
You three won't be
enough to satisfy me!

37
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:55,622
So I wasted all this
time eating, sleeping

38
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:58,956
and storing up my Spirit
energy for a real fight!

39
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:05,656
All to kill you leftover
punks! I won't even come
close to using all of my
energy!

40
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:11,089
Looks like he got bigger
again. What the hell's
going on with him?

41
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:15,789
He's definitely changed
since I fought him in the
World of the Living...

42
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:18,456
Do you see that?

43
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:20,789
Take a look at
his shoulder...

44
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,289
He's number ten.

45
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:29,822
So before this... did
you guys experience going
up against an Espada?

46
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:38,756
We did...

47
00:06:40,022 --> 00:06:42,256
I won't ask how
it ended for you...

48
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:45,656
I didn't exactly do
so well, either.

49
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:00,289
I'm sure your fights
were equally as tough.

50
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:06,356
Nevertheless, however
we did it, we managed to
overcome all the Espadas
we faced.

51
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:10,422
And at number ten, this
guy is the weakest of
them all.

52
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:13,389
There's no reason to be
intimidated by his
size....

53
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:16,389
Let's take him out! Then
we'll go pick up Ichigo!

54
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:22,856
What was that? What are
you three mumbling about
down there?

55
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:27,656
You really think that I
can be taken out by tiny
insects like you?

56
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:31,656
That's right. I
certainly hope you're
ready for this!

57
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:34,089
Don't make me laugh.

58
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:37,389
Enrage!! Ira!!!

59
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,322
[grunting]

60
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:43,756
Mm!

61
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,922
[roaring]

62
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:49,889
Uh!

63
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:54,989
[roaring]

64
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:57,656
Damn! He just grew
10 times bigger!

65
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:02,522
What's happening?

66
00:08:05,956 --> 00:08:08,022
His number's changing!!

67
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:31,889
There's no way!

68
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:33,022
What now?

69
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:39,122
How can this be? What
happened to his number?!
It's a zero?!

70
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:46,689
Did someone tell you that
the ten Espadas were numbered
for their strength from one
through ten?

71
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:47,922
They're not?!

72
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:51,522
Espadas are actually
numbered from zero to
nine.

73
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:54,622
I'm the only Espada
capable of changing
his number

74
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:58,189
by accumulating power
and going into full
release state!

75
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:02,156
Espada Zero! I am Yammy
Riyalgo!

76
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:02,756
Look out!

77
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:09,989
Roar! Zabimaru!!

78
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:13,389
[grunting]

79
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:15,189
Shut up!

80
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:17,956
Renji!!

81
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:22,722
Now, dance, Sodenoshirayuki!
Somenomai Tsukishiro!

82
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:31,889

83
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,822
Oh no!

You stupid human!

87
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:54,189
Hah!

88
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:59,256
La Muerte!

89
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:04,922
What?!

90
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:08,889
You got him?!

91
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:16,856
Uh! Not good!

92
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:22,256
Let's face it, you
guys are garbage!

93
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,022
He's a monster!

94
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:28,056
What's the problem? Is
that all you've got?

95
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:30,856
Save it! The real battle
starts now!

96
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:34,989
Bankai!!

97
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:48,889
Hihio Zabimaru!

98
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:56,289
No matter how hard
you try, it's useless!

99
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:00,422
Ridiculous.

100
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:07,789
Huh?!
What's this?!

101
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:09,389
[growling]

102
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:11,656
Rukia! Chad!
Now!

103
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:12,456
Right!

104
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:15,189
Dance! Sodenoshirayuki!

105
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:18,322
Tsuginomai Hakuren!

106
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:22,922
Brazo Derecho del
Gigante.

[yelling]

108
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:30,022

You should't
be so confident!

109
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,389
[roaring]

110
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:38,556
Watch out!!

111
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:48,322

Hm!

115
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:04,422
How can he be...
completely unharmed?!

116
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:08,089
Your pathetic efforts to
hurt me will never work!

117
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:13,056
Uh!

118
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:24,122
[gasping]

119
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:29,322
As powerful as you are,
you're still just the
third strongest?

120
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:32,556
As powerful as
I am, you say...

121
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:37,156
I don't recall showing
you the full extent of
my power just yet.

122
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:47,987

Daiguren Hyorinmaru!

125
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,222
So is that
all you've got?

126
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:11,256
[struggling]
Dammit!

127
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:18,056
How pitiful.

How pitiful.

Mmmm...

136
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:17,307
This can't...
be happening.

00:14:45,774 --> 00:14:47,574
They're not doing
so well.

140
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:54,407
Hmm...

141
00:14:58,341 --> 00:15:00,341
Hmmm!

142
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:04,841
You're quite agile, my
friend. And you're very
strong, that's for sure!

143
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:07,807
I'd say the same!

144
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:12,674
You dodged my sword
attacks, and kept your
hat and composure.

145
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:17,141
You're surprising. Much
more so than I've been.

146
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,407
Ola Azul!

147
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,707

This battle is no
contest...

152
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:55,007
All your techniques, and
you can't even make me
budge from this spot!

153
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,607
Uh!

154
00:15:57,574 --> 00:15:58,707
Hmph.

155
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:15,607
Now then... I wonder which
of you I should split in
half first?

156
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:18,607
Uh, Captain?

157
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:19,707
What is it?

158
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:23,207
Uh, isn't it about
time now?

159
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:24,341
Time for what?

160
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:28,907
Don't play dumb! I'm
talking about the
Gentei Kaijo!!

161
00:16:29,374 --> 00:16:34,774
Come on! We've held
back long enough. It's
about time we use Gentei
Kaijo, 'cause with that

162
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:37,307
you'll blow this old
geezer away!!

163
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:41,341
What's that? Oh, really?
You have some tricks up
your sleeve, huh?

164
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:43,441
Damn right, you
old goat!

165
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:48,207
We use Gentai Kaijo, and
you'll be gone in two
seconds, get it?!

166
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:52,041
Sounds intriguing.
Go on, try it.

167
00:16:52,374 --> 00:16:57,174
Hey-I don't think
we're asking for your
permission to do it!
Right, Captain?!

168
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:58,541
I can't.

169
00:16:58,574 --> 00:16:59,441
Huh?!

170
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,174
The Spirit Restriction
Seal.

171
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:12,174
When a Soul Reaper
captain passes through the
Senkaimon, it's automatically
sealed onto our bodies.

172
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:22,274
The purpose of this
restriction is to limit
our Spirit Energy from
exerting too much

173
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:29,407
influence. That way our
immense Spirit Energy doesn't
end up affecting spirits in
the World of the Living.

174
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:35,441
The Gentei Kaijo removes
that Spirit Restriction
Seal and releases our
full Spirit Energy.

175
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:39,474
However, there are
exceptions to this.

176
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:44,941
Before passing through
the Senkaimon gate, the
automatic seal function
can be bypassed.

177
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,274
So, then... what's
that mean?

178
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:52,574
It means this time, we
entered the World of the
Living without getting a
Spirit Restriction Seal.

179
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:56,541
Take a look. There's no
seal anywhere on your
body, is there?

180
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:59,274
Uh?! Uh! Oh?!

181
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:02,474
There isn't
one... so...

182
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:07,807
You want Gentei Kaijo...
But you see, we are already
in an unrestricted state.

183
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:11,807
What?!! So you mean
we've been fighting at
full-strength all this
time?!

184
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:16,407
That is all we've got?!
Naah! What the hell are
we gonna do?!

185
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:21,107
So that means...

186
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:27,707
So, is that it?

187
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,974
This is the extent of a
Captain's strength?

188
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:40,141
It's hard to believe...
Apache and the others
were beaten by this.

189
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:03,074
I will end this here.

190
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,541
I will crush you.

191
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:14,774
And make sure you will
not have the will to get
up again...

192
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:17,441
You will be broken
into pieces.

193
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:21,574
Hunt. Tiburon!

194
00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:24,641
Uh!

195
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,507
So that's her
Resurrection...

196
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:49,541
From appearances, there's
not as much of a change as
I had expected.

197
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:55,941
But taking her lightly
could lead to my death.
I must stay focused.

198
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:12,241
[gasping]

199
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:21,207
You are powerless.

200
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:27,407
Your ice dragon is
drowned by a single
strike from a shark.

201
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:37,841
Captain get outta there!

202
00:20:37,874 --> 00:20:40,041
<i>Izuru!</i>

203
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,974
Continue giving
treatment.

204
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,207
But sir--

205
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:46,907
Listen to me. You must
trust the captain's
abilities.

206
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:51,774
Yes, sir.

207
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:58,141
You are next...

208
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:04,841
I will avenge those three
you burned.

209
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,407
You will suffer.

210
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:13,807
How can you still be
alive?

211
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:21,041
After your sword release
I didn't think that your
speed and range would
increase so quickly.

212
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,707
But I took a
few precautions.

213
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:29,974
An illusion?
Made of ice?

214
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:35,874
I can only use a move
like this once, so I held
off using it until I knew
it would have the maximum

215
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:37,841
effect on our battle.

216
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:48,674
Our strength is not...
to be underestimated.

217
00:23:45,606 --> 00:23:46,839
Now I know what happened!

218
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:48,506
<i>What is it, Izuru?</i>

219
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,806
Rangiku tried to dump
some of her work on
Captain Hitsugaya once,
but didn't get any

220
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,139
response from him, so she
ended up doing the work
herself. I remember hearing
her complain about it.

221
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:57,672
<i>He used that ice</i>
<i>illusion?</i>

222
00:23:57,706 --> 00:24:00,072
Guess it was the best way
to avoid Rangiku.
