[theme music]

00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:52,963
NARRATOR: Shusuke Amagai, former
leader of an expedition unit,

3
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:55,529
was named the new
captain of squad three.

4
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:59,296
Despite his incredible power,
Amagai was also quite humble.

5
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:02,229
The morale of squad three
grew as their new captain

6
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:03,829
fought alongside them.

7
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:07,596
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Izuru Kira
had discovered a darker side

8
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:11,363
to Amagi's right hand man,
the mild-mannered third seat

9
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:12,729
Kibune.

10
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:15,629
The more time he spent with
him, the more Kira's suspicions

11
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:16,163
grew.

12
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:33,196
-I heard of this place, but I
never actually set foot in it.

13
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:34,396
-Me neither.

14
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:37,396
Nobody uses fighting
arenas like this anymore.

15
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:40,096
Seeing how we have access
to it, third seat Kibune

16
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,196
thought we might as well
use it for training drills.

17
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,729
-All right, fall in.

18
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:49,329
-But sir, where
is Captain Amagai?

19
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:51,296
-Right, about the Captain.

20
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,663
AMAGAI: Permission
to speak, sir?

21
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:07,896
-Well, what is it, Amagai?

22
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:10,863
-I realize I'm the newest
member of the captain's counsel

23
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:12,896
and I'm speaking
out of turn, but I'd

24
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:13,929
like to share an opinion.

25
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:18,929
-Very well, speak.

26
00:03:18,963 --> 00:03:19,863
-Sir.

27
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:21,596
The incident in
question occurred

28
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:26,096
just after I was appointed
captain of squad three.

29
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,396
When we battled the Menos
in the Precipice World,

30
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:30,896
I requested that the Department
of Research and Development

31
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:32,863
shut down the
restrictive current,

32
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,363
but it was reactivated
while we were inside.

33
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:39,629
My squad could have been
wiped out by that current.

34
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:40,929
Luckily, they made it out.

35
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:43,063
-What is the meaning
of this outburst?

36
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:44,363
-What?

37
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:46,663
-If you're here to whine,
you came to the wrong place.

38
00:03:46,696 --> 00:03:49,329
This council has neither
the time nor the inclination

39
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,929
to listen to every squad's
petty little complaints.

40
00:03:52,963 --> 00:03:54,163
-I know.

41
00:03:54,196 --> 00:03:55,796
As a matter of fact, that's
what I want to discuss.

42
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,463
-Is it?

43
00:03:57,496 --> 00:04:00,763
-The 13 Court Guard Squads are
comprised of independent units,

44
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,496
each with their own
unique skill set.

45
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:05,763
I understand that.

46
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:07,663
But from an
organizational standpoint,

47
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:12,329
there's no cooperation between
us, no strength in unity.

48
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:14,563
This Precipice World
blunder perfectly

49
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:19,029
illustrates the 13 Court Guard
Squad's most basic weakness.

50
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:21,896
-What do you suggest,
that all of us hold hands

51
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,296
and get friendly
around a campfire?

52
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:27,063
-No, I wouldn't
go that far, but I

53
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:30,363
do think we should at least
conduct joint training.

54
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,096
-Not on your life.

55
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:34,796
I'm not wasting my
men's time with games.

56
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:36,163
Laughable.

57
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:39,763
-Actually, Kenpachi, there's
nothing humorous about it.

58
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:40,863
-That so?

59
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:45,296
-Think about Aizen,
Ichimaru, Tousen-- three

60
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:48,029
dangerous rebels, who each
took advantage of gaps

61
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:48,896
in our communication.

62
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:56,529
Unifying our squads would
make us all stronger.

63
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,096
To me, Captain Amagai's
suggestion makes sense.

64
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:09,063
[quiet crying]

65
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:16,063
-Come on, now, don't get
discouraged, Shusuke.

66
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:18,263
You made some very
good points back there.

67
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:19,529
-Who cares?

68
00:05:19,563 --> 00:05:21,596
I didn't get a commitment
for joint training sessions,

69
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,396
so the whole thing
was a failure.

70
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:27,963
I can't feel any lower
than I do at this moment.

71
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,696
[sobbing]

72
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,929
-He hasn't had a lot
to drink, has he?

73
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:34,729
-Nope, he's hardly had anything.

74
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:36,396
-Then why's he like this?

75
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,996
-Apparently, the smell's
enough to get him drunk.

76
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:40,563
[sobbing]

77
00:05:40,596 --> 00:05:43,129
-Don't give up on your
idea so soon, Shusuke.

78
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:46,029
It has a lot of potential.

79
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:47,396
-You really think so?

80
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:48,663
-Sure.

81
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:50,896
I know it looks like your
proposal was rejected out

82
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:53,763
of hand, but you have the
council a lot to think about.

83
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:56,029
-And it helps that
Jushiro got involved

84
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,596
explaining what
you have in mind.

85
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:01,796
-Captain Ukitake,
I owe you big time.

86
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,396
-Hey, easy!

87
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,596
-What the heck?

88
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,063
-Shusuke, you OK?

89
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:08,429
-I'm great!

90
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:10,396
Thanks to you, that is.

91
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:13,563
Now I'm even more
motivated than before!

92
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:16,329
I should get back to
strategizing right away.

93
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:16,963
Bottoms up!

94
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:26,129
-Look at that.

95
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:29,496
[snoring]

96
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:31,429
-What do you think?

97
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:32,429
-About him?

98
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:33,729
-Yes, him.

99
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:37,263
-Well, he certainly doesn't
hold back, but I like him.

100
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,496
-Yes, I agree.

101
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:40,063
-It is tough, though.

102
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:42,296
-What is it?

103
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:44,496
-I just hope his
enthusiasm doesn't

104
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,129
alienate the other captains.

105
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:48,129
[snoring]

106
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:54,663
-Joint exercises?

107
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:55,896
No way.

108
00:06:55,929 --> 00:07:00,929
-Yes, the new captain of
squad three suggested them.

109
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,229
-Huh.

110
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:05,229
Well if you ask me, they'd
be a massive waste of time.

111
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:07,063
-Joint training sessions, huh?

112
00:07:12,196 --> 00:07:15,896
-It's a pleasure
to work with you.

113
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,163
-I bet it would be a lot
of fun to train together.

114
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:21,529
-I don't know, I doubt it.

115
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:25,563
-Oh come on now, you can't be
sure unless you give it a try.

116
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:27,196
-I'm already sure.

117
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,163
-I think it sounds delightful.

118
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:32,063
-Seems like Jushiro and Shunsui
are throwing a lot of support

119
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:34,463
behind Shusuke's plan.

120
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,963
I hope it doesn't
cause any problems

121
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,263
with the members in opposition.

122
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:44,929
-Unfortunately, I'm told the
proposal for joint training

123
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,329
was scrapped.

124
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:47,929
-So squad three is all alone.

125
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:50,829
We're the only ones doing
coordinated training drills.

126
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:52,529
-This was going to
be our big chance

127
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:56,596
to show the other
squads what we can do.

128
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:58,163
-Well, it looks like
we're going back

129
00:07:58,196 --> 00:08:00,296
to all those meaningless
chores again.

130
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:04,929
Like the other day, when I had
to clean squad seven's toilets.

131
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:06,729
-That's nothing.

132
00:08:06,763 --> 00:08:08,996
I've becomes squad 11's gofer.

133
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,363
It's awful.

134
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:14,496
They chew me out even if
I'm just 30 seconds late.

135
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:17,696
-Could be worse, at least
not as bad off as squad four.

136
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:18,763
-Absolutely.

137
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:21,229
It's like squad four
exists to do chores.

138
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:26,296
[grunting]

139
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,063
-Wait, don't tell me.

140
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:31,496
-Squad four made me
do their laundry.

141
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:32,996
-What?

142
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:37,963
[grumbling]

143
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:40,929
-There's no reason
to be so glum.

144
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:44,196
It turns out, the captains
of both squad eight and 13

145
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,896
have agreed to support Captain
Amagai's reorganization

146
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:47,896
strategy.

147
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:49,029
Who knows?

148
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,696
The initial rejection
by the Captain's Council

149
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,196
might soon be reversed.

150
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:52,896
-Really?

151
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:54,996
-That's tremendous news.

152
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:56,429
-I got my fingers crossed.

153
00:08:56,463 --> 00:08:58,629
-About time already, too.

154
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,196
-And from the looks of it, you
have no discipline, either.

155
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:15,696
-Lieutenant Kira?

156
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:18,029
Is something wrong?

157
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:19,463
You're looking at me funny.

158
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:21,129
Is that something on my face?

159
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:22,663
-Oh, uh, no.

160
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,396
Actually, well,
third seat Kibune,

161
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:30,763
it's just that I spotted you
entering the Kasumioji house.

162
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:32,263
-I beg your pardon?

163
00:09:32,296 --> 00:09:35,796
-Whoa, third seed
Kibune, is this true?

164
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:36,963
-Not at all.

165
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:38,729
I'm afraid I do
not have the status

166
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:40,996
to visit a place as
exclusive as that.

167
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:42,496
Must've been someone else.

168
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,796
-But I could have sworn.

169
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:45,829
-Be reasonable.

170
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:47,863
I'm just a common soul
reaper, I couldn't

171
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:51,096
begin to impose myself on
such an aristocratic clan.

172
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:52,829
-Yeah, that's a good point.

173
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:55,463
-You had us confused
there for a second.

174
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,463
-Was I mistaken?

175
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,496
No, I'm sure it was him.

176
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,429
-Urgent message, urgent message!

177
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:05,863
Menos have been detected
entering the Seireitei!

178
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,929
All squads, proceed to guard
posts and prepare to intercept!

179
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:12,996
-Menos are here?

180
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:13,896
-Really?

181
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:14,829
But how?

182
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:16,363
-What the heck's going on?

183
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:21,963
-What do we do?

184
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,063
-I-- I don't know.

185
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:25,296
Isn't it obvious, sir?

186
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:28,196
We've got to attack, and
fast before the other squads

187
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:28,829
beat us to it!

188
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:29,896
-But how?

189
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,029
The captain didn't--

190
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,096
-This is our chance to
show the others just how

191
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:36,329
strong our squad can be,
right third seat Kibune?

192
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:41,796
-Right, then let's roll out.

193
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:44,429
-Yeah!

194
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:46,463
-No, stop.

195
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:48,363
We must wait for the Captain.

196
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:49,563
-But sir--

197
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:52,296
-Without his orders, there
is nothing we can do.

198
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,963
We should stand by until
the Captain returns.

199
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:57,696
-No, Izuru, if we've
trained properly,

200
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:59,929
the squad will remember
how to maneuver even

201
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:01,996
without the Captain by our side.

202
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,163
Wouldn't you agree?

203
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,163
Your fellow squad members are
confident that they can fight,

204
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:09,496
but you seem determined
to undermine them.

205
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:12,529
That's not what I call
leadership, Lieutenant Kira.

206
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:14,596
-No, that's not what I'm saying.

207
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:16,429
The fact is, it's
reckless to launch

208
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:18,929
an assault without knowing
more about the circumstances

209
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:19,796
we're facing.

210
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:21,196
-Is that so?

211
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:24,163
Because it sounds like you
don't think we can handle it.

212
00:11:24,196 --> 00:11:26,563
-Third seat Kibune's
absolutely right.

213
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:28,563
Our squad's strong
enough to do this.

214
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:29,729
-Let's mount an attack!

215
00:11:29,763 --> 00:11:30,696
-Well, Lieutenant Kira?

216
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:36,796
-He can't even make a decision.

217
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,096
Third seat Kibune,
you take over.

218
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:40,396
-What?

219
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:41,329
-That's right.

220
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:43,329
I will follow your
commands, sir.

221
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:44,163
-Me too.

222
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:46,096
-I'm in as well.

223
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,729
-Your men have decided
to take action.

224
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:52,163
Will you support them, or not?

225
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:52,663
-I--

226
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:58,163
-It appears that you are
unable to make up your mind.

227
00:11:58,196 --> 00:12:01,863
You leave me no choice but
to lead this mission myself.

228
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,529
Everyone, let's move.

229
00:12:03,563 --> 00:12:04,029
-Sir!

230
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:28,270
-Listen up, men.

231
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:29,670
Don't let anyone get by us.

232
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:32,304
Squad 11 is the one that's
going to catch this prey.

233
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:41,404
How the hell did you
and your men get here?

234
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:43,670
-Funny, I was going to
ask you the same thing.

235
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:45,570
-My squad doesn't
have time to waste.

236
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:47,170
-And neither does mine!

237
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:48,137
[growling]

238
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,137
-Quit following us!

239
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,437
-Same to you, pal!

240
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,870
Can't you see my
squad's got a job to do?

241
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:57,804
-We're the ones
with the job to do!

242
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,304
-For now, get to
your guard positions.

243
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:07,437
And don't wear yourselves out.

244
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,637
It's odd that we haven't
received any eyewitness

245
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,337
information about the enemy.

246
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,704
-What about you?

247
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:16,637
-I'm leaving you in
charge of this area.

248
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,104
-Captain!

249
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:18,604
-Lieutenant.

250
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,137
-Wait, what's the
meaning of this sign?

251
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,404
-It's highly unusual for Menos
to set foot in the Seireitei.

252
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:33,237
I advise you to stay out of our
way and let us take care of it.

253
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:33,737
-Huh?

254
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,470
-Squad alert!

255
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:44,537
Menos detected in the northeast
sector of the Seireitei!

256
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,637
Proceed in that direction!

257
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,104
I repeat-- Menos
detected in the--

258
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:49,104
-Did you hear that, men?

259
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:50,070
Head northeast!

260
00:13:50,104 --> 00:13:51,004
-Hurry up now!

261
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:51,770
No falling behind!

262
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,137
-I don't get it.

263
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,737
-According to the messenger,
they should be right here.

264
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,337
-It sure doesn't feel like
there are any Menos nearby.

265
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,870
-Third seat Kibune.

266
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:09,670
I really think the squad
should pull back at once.

267
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:11,837
We don't have visual
confirmation of a target,

268
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,204
and on top of
that, we don't know

269
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:15,137
what powers they may possess.

270
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,204
-Lieutenant Kira, you want us
to turn back after all this?

271
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:20,137
-No way.

272
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,337
If we take them
down, squad three

273
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,337
will finally get
some recognition!

274
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,270
-Listen--

275
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:25,904
-Lieutenant Kira,
if I were you, I

276
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:28,004
would refrain from
confusing the squad

277
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:30,737
with any more of these
contradictory orders.

278
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,670
Besides, I thought
you were vehemently

279
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:34,404
opposed to this assault.

280
00:14:34,437 --> 00:14:38,370
So why did you
bother showing up?

281
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:40,837
-Why you--

282
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,904
-Sir, there are now
several conflicts

283
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:46,070
between squads
deployed in the field.

284
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:49,070
-Thanks for the report.

285
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,037
-Captain.

286
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,504
-Hmm.

287
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:54,904
Well, Nanao, what do you think?

288
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:58,404
-Sir, clearly something
is going wrong.

289
00:14:58,437 --> 00:15:02,137
There's no enemy in sight, yet
there's tension in the air.

290
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,670
-Yeah, you're right.

291
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,804
Well, wanna head home?

292
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:08,804
-Wait, what are
you talking about?

293
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:11,637
Menos are inside the perimeter.

294
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,170
-Menos?

295
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,104
I don't know about that.

296
00:15:16,137 --> 00:15:17,304
-Huh?

297
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:18,370
-You have doubts, too?

298
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:24,970
-What?

299
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:27,704
-What are you saying, this
has all just been some ruse?

300
00:15:27,737 --> 00:15:29,370
-In all likelihood, yes.

301
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:31,604
-What makes you say that?

302
00:15:31,637 --> 00:15:34,137
-Thus far, we only have
rather vague reports,

303
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:38,204
but no actual sightings, and I'm
only sensing spiritual pressure

304
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,437
from the squads.

305
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,137
If I were to venture
a guess, I would

306
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,104
say someone has
played a trick on us.

307
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:45,104
-Oh.

308
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:48,037
That's our Captain for you!

309
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,737
-Hey Sentaro, that
was totally my line!

310
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,970
Stop stealing my thunder!

311
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:53,404
-Oh cram it, pipsqueak.

312
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,937
You're the one who
was copying me!

313
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,104
[growling]

314
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:59,637
-No way I would ever
copy you, you moron!

315
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,137
-What did you just call me?

316
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,570
-In any case, someone
sounded the alarm.

317
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:10,470
Someone provided false
information that led to this.

318
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,737
Everyone, from captains
and lieutenants

319
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,070
down to the average
soul reaper believed it.

320
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:18,604
They all took the
bait, proving how easy

321
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:20,737
it is to trick
the 13 Court Guard

322
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,004
Squads into chasing an
enemy that does not exist.

323
00:16:24,037 --> 00:16:29,037
Though now the real question
becomes who's responsible?

324
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,270
-It was I.

325
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:30,770
-Huh?

326
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:34,270
-Head Captain.

327
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:39,004
KIBUNE: Well
Lieutenant, what exactly

328
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:40,937
are you suggesting we do?

329
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,437
-Call off this attack.

330
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,070
However, if my men insist
on pressing forward--

331
00:16:49,737 --> 00:16:51,804
-I just don't get you.

332
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:53,304
Very well then.

333
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:54,870
Let's get to it.

334
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:55,704
AMAGAI: Not so fast.

335
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,437
-I'm sorry everybody.

336
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,037
I didn't mean to
abandon my duties.

337
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,870
-Captain!

338
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:05,337
Where were you?

339
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,304
-Heh heh heh.

340
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:07,437
Too much alcohol.

341
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,670
I passed out.

342
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:09,970
-Again?

343
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:11,904
What a lush.

344
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:13,504
-Oh, and Makoto.

345
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:14,504
-Sir?

346
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:16,837
-The squad doesn't
vote on decisions.

347
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,170
When I'm not here, Izuru
will give the orders.

348
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,804
Remember your rank.

349
00:17:22,837 --> 00:17:25,304
-I apologize, sir.

350
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,037
-Captain Amagai.

351
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,837
-Sorry about that, Izuru.

352
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,770
If only I could
handle my liquor.

353
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:33,770
Next time, though, you
should take control.

354
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,737
-Sir--

355
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,704
-What's the matter?

356
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,104
-There it is!

357
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:53,604
-Charge!

358
00:17:57,637 --> 00:17:58,737
-Let's hurry it up, men.

359
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,137
Squad 11 will be the
first ones on the scene.

360
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,304
-I don't think so.

361
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:04,104
We're more ready
than you'll ever be.

362
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:04,770
-Move it.

363
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:05,770
Victory is ours.

364
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:07,904
We can't let some
other squad swoop in

365
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:09,804
and take what rightfully
belongs to us!

366
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:13,970
-I have no idea what's
going on, but hurry!

367
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:15,370
-What the hell?

368
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:16,770
A dead end?

369
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,404
-What do we do?

370
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:29,170
-The five Menos
you see, the truth

371
00:18:29,204 --> 00:18:33,270
is, I created em myself
using the Tenshintai.

372
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:37,970
I wanted to study how each squad
would react to my false alarm.

373
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:40,937
Alas, it has gone as I expected.

374
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,770
All that's left is to see
how the new captain deals

375
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:47,737
with the chaos.

376
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,170
-Don't panic.

377
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:50,837
Just do as you were
trained, and there's

378
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,537
nothing that can stop us.

379
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,970
-Uh, right.

380
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:57,737
-Go to the other squads and tell
them how we usually maneuver.

381
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,237
I'll give the order.

382
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,237
-Understood, sir.

383
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,770
-Sorry to do this, everyone,
but from here on out,

384
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:37,404
you'll have to do what
squad three asks of you.

385
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,065
-All right, squad seven.

386
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:45,465
Let's fall back.

387
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:46,631
-You serious?

388
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:48,731
-Ikkaku, squad seven
is pulling out,

389
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:50,831
and I suggest you do the same.

390
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:53,031
-Why should I?

391
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:54,565
-Just listen to me.

392
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:56,398
-Fine, whatever.

393
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:59,065
All right, squad 11,
we're falling back.

394
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:06,931
-OK Aida, have squad
six move to the right!

395
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:07,931
-Sir!

396
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:09,931
-Please flank right!

397
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:11,398
-Got it.

398
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:12,798
-Kano, heads up!

399
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:14,798
Move squad ten over to the left!

400
00:20:14,831 --> 00:20:17,698
-Sir!

401
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:18,765
-Now, Izuru!

402
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:21,331
Take squad eleven
right down the middle!

403
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,731
-Yes, sir!

404
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:24,098
-Do it now!

405
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:27,998
-Yeah, I got it!

406
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,965
[shouts]

407
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:41,931
-OK, Inose, lead squad
seven to the back right!

408
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:01,798
-And so it appears the
five Menos were destroyed

409
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:04,031
by fast-moving,
coordinated formations,

410
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:07,231
each following orders
from squad three.

411
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:07,898
-I see.

412
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,231
The proposed joint
exercises will

413
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:25,398
be carried out with my approval.

414
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:27,465
-Man, that felt great.

415
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:28,798
-Sure did.

416
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:31,398
And the best part of it is,
the other squads can't turn up

417
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:33,931
their noses at squad
three ever again.

418
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:35,731
-Yeah, with Captain
Amagai at the helm,

419
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:37,698
squad three is in good hands.

420
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:39,131
-You know it.

421
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:42,431
Ain't that right, Captain?

422
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:43,565
-I'm relieved.

423
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:47,365
But maybe that's
the liquor talking!

424
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:48,831
[snoring]

425
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:18,980
[theme music]

426
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,674
-Kenryu, I have not been
attending school lately.

427
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,808
Is is not necessary
to go there every day?

428
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:56,708
-Do not fret, m'lady, Ichigo
Kurosaki and the others have

429
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:59,074
been with us this whole
time, so it must be fine.

430
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:01,774
-Actually, it's not fine.
