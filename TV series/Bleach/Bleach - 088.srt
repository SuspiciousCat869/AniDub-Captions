We've got to save him!

12
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,355
I tried to get here to alert
you as fast as I could,

13
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:59,522
but this stuffed buffoon
Kon got lost on the way

14
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:01,322
and it took us forever.

15
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,088
-Listen!

16
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,722
Ichigo needs us now! [cries]

00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,722
URAHARA: Ririn, calm down now.

18
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:09,188
Calm down.

19
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:11,122
There's nothing to worry about.

20
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:13,688
Ichigo is fine.

21
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:15,488
-Sorry to worry you.

22
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:19,588
I was just so desperate to save
Keigo I left you behind, Ririn.

RIRIN: You insensitive idiot!

24
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:25,755
I was going crazy!

25
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:27,822
-Well, I didn't mean
to get you so upset.

26
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:30,288
-Oh, you've got a
lot of nerve to think

27
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:33,455
I'd be upset and concerned
about the likes of you.

28
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,522
-Sorry.

29

32
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:46,822
There's nothing to
be so upset about.

-Shut up!

34
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:50,822
-Come on, now.

35
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:53,388
You have to decide if
you're angry or just sad.

38

How's Keigo?

39
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:00,488
-He should be up
and around soon.

40
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:02,555
I was able to inject him
with some of your Reishi,

41
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:04,788
and that helped him
recover quickly.

42
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:07,155
I also went ahead and
replaced his memories.

43
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,988
So after just a
little more rest,

44
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,555
he should be able to go home
soon, like nothing happened.

00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:13,788
-That's good.

46
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:15,188
Thanks Hanataro.

have just returned.

00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:27,622
-About time you--
Rukia, what happened?

51
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:28,888
-It's nothing.

52
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:31,555
I'll be fine in a day or so.

53
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:34,255
-I am responsible
for Rukia's injuries.

54
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:36,322
I was there and
failed to protect her.

55
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:37,422
-Don't worry, though.

56
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:40,722
I'll tend to Rukia's
wounds myself, Ichigo.

57
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:43,122
-That's all right, Orihime.

58
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:46,155
The way you saved me in the
battle was more than enough.

59
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:48,822
Besides, you have your
own injuries to tend to.

60
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:50,088
You're covered in cuts.

61
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:50,755
-Oh, these?

62
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:52,322
It doesn't hurt.

63
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:53,722
-Enough, enough.

64
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:55,788
Let's go inside and get
everyone comfortable.

65
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:24,222
-Judging by your speed, I
assume you found the Bounts.

66
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:25,355
SHUHEI: Yes.

67
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:27,422
Apparently, while we
were busy fighting them,

68
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:30,988
Yumichicka was searching for
the Bounts hideout on his own.

69
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,288
RANGIKU: What happened
to Ichigo and the others?

70
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:34,588
-They're safe.

71
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:36,655
They have all gathered to
recuperate from their wounds

72
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:37,955
at Urahara's.

73
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:39,055
-Good.

74
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:41,455
In that case, we should
go join Yumichicka.

75
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:44,322
It's time we settled
this once and for all.

MABASHI: I made a mistake.

77
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:57,855
-Well, it's not serious.

78
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:01,688
And besides, you were able
to exercise your powers.

79
00:05:01,722 --> 00:05:05,322
Even though you sucked
only a few living souls,

80
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,755
that's pretty good.

81
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:11,488
MABASHI: It still wasn't
enough-- nowhere near enough.

82
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:14,055
-Mabashi, don't get addicted.

83
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:16,622
I guarantee that you'll
live to regret it.

84
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:18,022
KARIYA: It's all right.

85
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:21,422
You did well, Mabashi.

86
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:25,122
Don't be too hard on yourself
over a single defeat.

87
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:26,588
-I didn't lose.

88
00:05:26,622 --> 00:05:29,122
In fact, I have
never been defeated.

89
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:33,855
I would have beaten them,
except he stopped me.

90
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:35,322
-You would have
been turned to sand

91
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:36,788
if you had continued to fight.

92
00:05:36,822 --> 00:05:37,888
And you know it.

93
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:40,188
-You don't know what
you're talking about.

94
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:43,788
You have no idea
what my limits are!

95
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:44,522
-They are coming.

96
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:53,022
Don't panic.

97
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,988
All of you are to
continue as you

98
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,888
were, using the Bittos
to absorb souls.

99
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:00,022
Ugaki.

100
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,555
-Yes, Master Kariya.

101
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:04,088
Is it time for me to
make an appearance?

102
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:05,755
-First a question.

103
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:07,522
-Yes, what's that?

104
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:09,755
-What's the status of the
young Quincy we encountered?

105
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,288
[laughs]

106
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:16,722
-He seems to be struggling.

107
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:21,322
He hasn't been able to
regain any of his powers.

108
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:22,755
-I see.

109
00:06:22,788 --> 00:06:24,288
Go, then.

110
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:26,222
-As you wish, Master.

111
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:28,955
And may I suggest to all of
you that you watch carefully,

112
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,622
as I can guarantee you
will not be disappointed.

113
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:35,855
I shall give a demonstration
that will be truly magnificent.

114
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:38,522
The performance
shall begin soon.

115
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:42,188
-Ichinose.

116
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:43,988
-Sir?

117
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:46,122
-What about the other matter?

118
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,155
-Yes.

119
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:49,688
They'll soon make
their move as well.

120
00:06:49,722 --> 00:06:50,622
-So be it.

121
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:57,222
-Are you sure?

122
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:58,388
-Mhm.

123
00:06:58,422 --> 00:06:59,088
-Ah!

124
00:06:59,122 --> 00:07:00,022
But that's impossible!

125
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:01,255
You must have done
something wrong.

126
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,822
He should be getting
better by now.

127
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:03,822
-Hey, Renji.

128
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:05,788
What the hell are
you doing to him?

129
00:07:05,822 --> 00:07:07,188
RUKIA: Leave him alone, Renji.

130
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:08,388
-Stay out of it.

131
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:10,222
You're supposed to
be resting, anyway.

132
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:12,455
RUKIA: How am I supposed
to rest with fool like you

133
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:13,988
starting fights in the house?

134
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:16,488
Why can't you just act
normal for a change?

135
00:07:16,522 --> 00:07:18,155
-Hey.

136
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,888
-Hanataro, so what's happening?

137
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:24,088
-Well, unfortunately,
this boy's injuries

138
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:26,655
are much worse than I
first thought they were.

139
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:28,755
I've tried my best
and done everything

140
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:31,022
I can think of, but--

141
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:32,522
-What are you saying?

142
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:34,255
-It seems like his
soul just keeps

143
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,322
getting weaker and weaker.

144
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:38,688
-How sad.

145
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:41,422
-Well, then, why don't you
try using my soul, Hanataro?

146
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:42,422
I'm fine.

147
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:44,188
I don't have any
serious injuries at all.

148
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:46,722
Let me do the same
thing Ichigo did for him

149
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:47,988
-We can't.

150
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:50,488
Unfortunately, it's
already too late for that.

151
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:53,288
All we can do now is trust
in the boy's own life force

152
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:54,055
to bring him back.

153
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:58,255
RENJI: It's all my fault.

154
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:08,322
I should have handled things
differently during the attack.

155
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:16,722
If only I had handled
the situation better,

156
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:17,955
he wouldn't be in this shape.

157
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:22,588
-Calm down, Renji.

158
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:24,488
-And just shut up!

159
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:27,588
-Listen, Lieutenant Matsumoto
and the others are on their way

160
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:28,655
right now.

161
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:29,888
And they're going to
confront the Bounts.

162
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:34,522
I understand your feelings.

163
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,088
But if we charge into this
with our personal emotions

164
00:08:37,122 --> 00:08:41,288
getting in the way, things
really aren't going to go well.

165
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:41,755
-Damn.

166
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:49,555
-Look, the boy's
going to be all right.

167
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:51,255
I'm sure of it.

168
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:52,788
-Thanks, Ichigo.

169
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:56,055
-In the Soul Society, when
I thought I couldn't go on,

170
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:58,688
it was Hanataro who saved me.

171
00:08:58,722 --> 00:08:59,888
We should trust him.

172
00:09:04,722 --> 00:09:07,822
And then you and I can focus
on fighting these guys.

173
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:09,722
We can't just keep letting
the Bounts get away

174
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:13,122
with whatever the
hell they want.

175
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:14,455
-Ha.

176
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,788
Well, I must be getting
pretty soft lately

177
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,255
if you're the one
giving me the lectures.

178
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:20,322
-What do you mean by that?

179
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:30,555
URAHARA: Ichigo, can I
talk to you for a minute?

180
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:44,088
Would you agree that the Bounts
are stronger than we originally

181
00:09:44,122 --> 00:09:45,155
expected?

182
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:47,922
-Yeah, I'd say so.

183
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,855
-Do you think you can win
without having your Bankai?

184
00:09:50,888 --> 00:10:04,322
-It's strange, but even though
I can use my Bankai-- how do

185
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,122
I explain it?

186
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:08,355
I have this feeling I
can almost use it again.

187
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:13,822
I'm gonna be all right.

188
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:19,922
-I sure hope so.

189
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:21,222
Very well, my friend.

190
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:23,288
Then I'll leave it up to you.

191
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,722
-[sigh]

192
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:34,222
Hm?

193
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:39,255
-What are you
doing standing here

194
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:40,755
in front of the Bounts' hideout?

195
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:42,222
-What would you
have done if they'd

196
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:44,522
learned you were out
here by yourself?

197
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:46,255
-Well, it's too late for that.

198
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:47,888
They already know I'm here.

199
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:53,888
I hate to admit it,
but apparently we

200
00:10:53,922 --> 00:10:56,655
have a formidable opponent
here in the Bounts.

201
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,488
-Pssh.

202
00:10:58,522 --> 00:10:59,055
-All right.

203
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:00,988
Let's do this.

204
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,422
-I should tell you
that I've never

205
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:04,655
been very good
working in a group.

206
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:21,131
BYAKUYA: I see.

207
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:22,598
But--

208
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:25,198
YAMAMOTO: It is hard
to believe, I know.

209
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,798
But it is true nonetheless.

210
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:30,365
You know me well enough
to know that I would not

211
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,631
have called you here otherwise.

212
00:11:35,798 --> 00:11:39,131
Captain Kurotsuchi may think
he can make a fool of me.

213
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,231
But he cannot.

214
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:43,198
No matter how hard he
may try to hide it,

215
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,765
something dangerous
is happening here ,

216
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:48,931
a devastatingly destructive
movement is in the works.

217
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:52,198
And it is related to
last night's ruckus.

218
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,998
Somewhere right here
in the very midst of us

219
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:58,465
there is a traitor
among the Soul Reapers.

220
00:11:58,498 --> 00:12:02,265
-Could it be Sosuke Aizen again?

221
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:06,331
-We cannot entirely rule
out the possibility of that.

222
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:12,898
But I think it unlikely that he
would want to help the Bounts.

223
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,165
-Then--

224
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:16,931
-We know exactly how many
Soul Reapers have left us.

225
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:19,465
Soon we will have
investigated all of them.

226
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:23,565
That aside, I have a favor
I would like to ask of you.

227
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:31,731
As you know, of the
four great noble clans,

228
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:34,231
it is the Kuchiki clan
that has traditionally

229
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:36,865
been charged with
compiling and protecting

230
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:38,731
the Soul Society's history.

231
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:43,798
In those stories,
can you tell me,

232
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:45,698
do any records of
the Bounts exist?

233
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:53,131
I would like you to
research the matter for me.

234
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:56,498
-As you wish.

235
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:57,398
-Hey, Kon.

236
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:59,365
Are you coming, too?

237
00:12:59,398 --> 00:13:00,665
-What do you think?

238
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,798
My sweet Rukia is going off
to kick some serious butt,

239
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:05,131
isn't she?

240
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,531
Of course I'm going with her.

241
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:09,531
And by the way, I'm sick
of you underestimating me.

242
00:13:09,565 --> 00:13:12,065
I'm the one who's been
protecting her, not you.

243
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:15,265
-You know, he might come
in handy as a shield!

244
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:16,265
-What!

245
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:17,731
Oh.

246
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:20,331
-Ririn, Kurodo, Noba.

247
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,065
This is going to
be your assignment.

248
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:23,731
-You can count on us!

249
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:25,898
-We won't let you down, Master.

250
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,198
-Understood.

251
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:29,331
-Hey, you big moocher.

252
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:36,598
-What's this.

253
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:39,631
-Just some rice, you know.

254
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:43,365
I know what a pain you can be
when you're hungry, so just

255
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:44,931
take that with you.

256
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:48,065
-Mr. Moocher, Jinta made
that especially for you,

257
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:50,531
because he felt bad he
couldn't give you seconds--

258
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:51,665
-Ah!

259
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:53,498
No one wants to hear
your details, all right?

260
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:53,998
-Ow.

261
00:13:57,065 --> 00:13:58,098
-Hm.

262
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:00,398
Thanks a lot, little man.

263
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:02,065
Hey, Hanataro.

264
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:03,165
-Yes?

265
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:05,065
-You take good care of that kid.

266
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:05,798
-I will.

267
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:08,331
I'll do my best.

268
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:09,531
-All right.

269
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:10,031
Let's go.

270
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:22,198
-It feels wrong somehow to let
them head out alone like this.

271
00:14:22,231 --> 00:14:24,398
-From time to time, we
encounter challenges

272
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:25,731
where that is all we can do.

273
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:37,365
-Now then, it's time
to begin the game.

274
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:52,498
Zeige Dich, Gesell.

275
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:03,031
-Wait.

276
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:05,231
What's this?

277
00:15:05,265 --> 00:15:07,598
-I'm getting an ugly
feeling about this.

278
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:15,631
-All right.

279
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,231
Let's go.

280
00:15:26,965 --> 00:15:27,931
-What's that?

281
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,098
-Looks like an advance party
of four Soul Reapers being

282
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:38,031
led on a journey to
their own deaths.

283
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:46,765
But first, a little
test is in order.

284
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:48,865
-What do you think
this thing is for?

285
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:51,831
-Whatever it's for, it's
certainly no think of beauty.

286
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:53,965
-Look, there's
another one over here.

287
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:54,998
-Strange.

288
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:57,365
RANGIKU: They must
just be decoration.

289
00:15:57,398 --> 00:15:58,498
SHUHEI: You're right.

290
00:15:58,531 --> 00:15:59,365
Come on.

291
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:00,698
Let's keep moving.

292
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:13,865
-Huh?

293
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:20,831
We shouldn't have
let our guard down.

294
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:21,331
-Yumichicka!

295
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:29,065
-Where the hell did
all this come from?

296
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:36,765
-[laugh]

297
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:37,998
-Guess we're surrounded.

298
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,231
You think we should split up?

299
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,998
-That would give
us an advantage.

300
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:45,665
-Let's go, Shuhei.

301
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:48,331
--[laughs] Exactly
what I was hoping for.

302
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:10,298
RANGIKU: Roar, Haineko!

303
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:20,298
No one there.

304
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:33,265
[gasp]

305
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:00,931
-One down already.

306
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:02,931
[laughs]

307
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:18,965
SHUHEI: This way!

308
00:18:23,465 --> 00:18:24,431
No good.

309
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:25,931
It's a dead end.

310
00:18:37,398 --> 00:18:37,865
-Ah!

311
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:41,331
-Izuru!

312
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:50,798
-[grunting]

313
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:04,398
IZURU (VOICEOVER):
Something's keeping

314
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:06,165
the head from attacking him.

315
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:07,665
Maybe it can't come
out any further.

316
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:12,998
-Hado Four, Byakurai.

317
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,565
-Very well.

318
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:19,831
Then how about this?

319
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:29,631
[grunting]

320
00:19:40,498 --> 00:19:43,765
[shouting]

321
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:45,231
-[laughs]

322
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:56,165
[laughs] Only one left.

323
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:59,565
YUMICHICKA: These things
sure are ugly, not beautiful

324
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,765
in any way.

325
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:04,965
I really don't
appreciate such things.

00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:07,431
Now, bloom, Fuju Kugaku!

327
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:17,698
-Gesell, show him what your true
form is for just a few moments.

328
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:18,965
That should finish this.

00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:57,198
-What was that?

332
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:59,798
-It would seem that
it's already begun.

333
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:00,798
ICHIGO: Then let's go.

334
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:22,565
-Don't squeeze too tight.

335
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:26,665
Must pull straight back and
then release with my heart.

336
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:41,031
[sigh] Master, I--

-You?

339
00:22:14,331 --> 00:22:16,798
-It has been quite
a while, has it not?

Bounts.

343

Gorilla man, scary old lady,
gross dude, grandpa fish eater,

344
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:14,011
old man with glasses,
and the big shot.

345
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:15,511
All together, that's, um, five.

346
00:24:15,544 --> 00:24:16,244
RIRIN: That's six.

347
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:17,678
What are you, stupid?

348
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:19,278
ICHIGO: [sigh] This
nonsense is only

349
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:22,611
making things more confusing.

00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:39,411
-What is it?

356
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,978
-Well, I can't start fighting
until I've had something

357
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:43,178
to eat.

gave you earlier.

have time for this.

-Shut up!

361
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:51,411
How am I supposed to have any
energy for battling Bounts

362
00:24:51,444 --> 00:24:52,278
if I don't eat first?

hot chili peppers in it.

ICHIGO: Well, at least
he'll have his energy.
