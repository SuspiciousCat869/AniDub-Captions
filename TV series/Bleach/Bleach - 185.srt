00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,897
NARRATOR: In their quest to
rescue Princess Rurichiyo,

3
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:54,097
Ichigo and Rukia entered
the Soul Society,

4
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,964
where they met fierce
opposition interrupting

5
00:01:55,997 --> 00:01:58,764
Rurichiyo's wedding
to Shu Kannogi.

6
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:01,064
Captain Amagai joined
Ichigo's group,

7
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:03,297
and they all searched
for Rurichiyo.

8
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,430
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Izuru Kira
saw Rurichiyo on the Kasumioji

9
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:09,397
grounds, but he
had his hands full

10
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,164
fighting Third
Seat Makoto Kibune.

11
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:15,230
Makoto admitted his selfish
and reckless actions

12
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:19,064
had gotten him ostracized by
the 13 Court Guard Squads.

13
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,797
Angry about his rejection,
he had reached out

14
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,030
to the Kasumioji clan and
became a brutal guardian

15
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:27,830
of their interests
at a high cost.

16
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:31,730
And now, he possesses a
supremely powerful bakoto

17
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:35,830
crafted by the Kasumioji clan.

18
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,330
-I will have more!

19
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:39,430
I now hold here the
key to great power!

20
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:49,264
Possessing such absolute power
will force every Soul Reaper

21
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:52,497
to respect me and
bow down to me!

22
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,397
Look at you, Izuru.

23
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,797
People like you who
have no real ability

24
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,997
yet still get promoted
to Lieutenant.

25
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,164
It's your kind I
exterminate from this world.

26
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:05,430
Your weakness is a crime.

27
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:07,264
A sniveling toad
like you doesn't

28
00:03:07,297 --> 00:03:08,964
deserve to have
what you possess.

29
00:03:08,997 --> 00:03:11,064
When the last
captain went berserk,

30
00:03:11,097 --> 00:03:14,230
you couldn't even stop him.

31
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:17,930
Powerless people like you don't
deserve to stand above me!

32
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,164
Your life's done!

33
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:35,097
Here's the killing blow!

34
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:53,630
-Damn it.

35
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:54,264
You're through!

36
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:09,664
Nice move, but I'm not done!

37
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,764
You are pathetic.

38
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,264
You don't stand a chance
against my strength.

39
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:35,530
-What was your motivation
in coming to Squad 3?

40
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:38,497
Did you think it was the best
way to become more powerful?

41
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,164
You must've known there
were better ways to do that.

42
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:44,730
-To truly have one's
power recognized,

43
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:48,297
one must be at a level
where it may be displayed.

44
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,964
-Really?

45
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:52,697
But that strategy won't work.

46
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,830
Captain Amagai is well aware
of the destructive actions

47
00:04:55,864 --> 00:04:56,997
you've taken.

48
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,564
Even if you kill me
now, you have no future.

49
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:02,397
-Who needs a future here?

50
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,764
-What?

51
00:05:03,797 --> 00:05:07,164
The Kasumioji clan's
strategy is to use the bakoto

52
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:10,897
to create a new order.

53
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,164
It's simple.

54
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:14,664
This bakoto is filled
with enough raw power

55
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:17,264
to allow me to annihilate
all of Squad 3,

56
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:18,897
and that's just the beginning.

57
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,630
-That's your goal?

58
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:23,564
You and the Kasumioji clan?

59
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:26,364
-Why do you insist
on questioning me?

60
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:28,064
Truth won't help you
when you're dead.

61
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,297
-[screaming]

62
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,464
-Just give up.

63
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:46,030
-I can't do that.

64
00:05:46,064 --> 00:05:46,797
How shameless.

65
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,264
When Squad 3 trusted you.

66
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:53,697
-I can't wait to
kill all of you!

67
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:58,297
Like I told you before, all of
you are filled with weakness.

68
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,030
I never considered anyone
on Squad 3 to be my equal.

69
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:03,364
-Really?

70
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,830
Very well then.

71
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,397
You are not worthy
of forgiveness.

72
00:06:09,397 --> 00:06:11,797
Your heart's filled
with nothing but venom.

73
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,097
You will not change.

74
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,097
I can see that.

75
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,964
We are all just
enemies in your way.

76
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:18,197
Is that it?

77
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,464
-Do you have a point?

78
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:22,564
-You've deceived
everyone who trusted you.

79
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:24,530
You say you hate
weakness, yet it's

80
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:26,597
you who's lost his
sense of honor.

81
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,830
The way you used others
proves you're the weak one.

82
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,130
-Let's see about that.

83
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,897

Better catch your breath.

87
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,330
I must say, I'm surprised
you're still standing.

88
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:08,597
I'll see to it you never become
the strongest Soul Reaper.

89
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,164
-That's where you're wrong.

90
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:16,897
-Down here!

91
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,664
-Hado Number 31, Shakkaho!

92
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,464
-But how?

93
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:53,764
-You've lost all perspective.

94
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:56,464
Instead of you controlling
the power of the sword,

95
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:59,397
its power has now taken
complete control of you.

96
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,764
-No.

97
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:01,330
You're wrong!

98
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,497
-You think you
possess power, but you

99
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,730
don't have true strength.

100
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:10,664
You were right.

101
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:12,130
I couldn't stop
Captain Ichimaru.

102
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:18,064
I was not strong enough.

103
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:22,030
But I feel responsible
for my squad,

104
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:23,930
and that gives me
inner strength.

105
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:26,930
I will risk my own
life to defend them!

106

[growling]

107
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:40,497
I'd lose my life before
letting them down!

108
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,230
-Your resolve can't
defeat my power.

109
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:56,664
I earned this power!

110
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:59,830
I've sacrificed more
than you ever could!

111
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:05,664
-Force alone isn't enough!

112
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:08,030
I'm fighting for a cause!

113

[grunting]

115
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,897
-What's that?

116
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,397
-The bakoto!

117
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:32,364
-Oh, I see.

118
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,164
That stuff moving
around covering

119
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:36,164
your zanpakuto--
that's your bakoto.

120
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:39,830
And so--

121
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:47,697
-That was it.

122
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,564
That's what negated the effects
of my Wabisuke's ability.

123
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:56,397
It appears your
so-called strength

124
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,164
was as big a fraud as you.

Wabisuke's attacking force

127
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:06,064
may not be as strong as yours.

128
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:09,264
But that's only part of
what makes up one's power.

129
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:12,364
Zan Ken So Ki, right
action, and a heart

130
00:10:12,397 --> 00:10:16,097
filled with good
intention form true power.

00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:41,598
And as for that
substitute Soul Reaper--

167
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,731
-Sorry.

168
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:48,565
Move aside.

169
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:54,398
-Just what are they
trying to achieve?

170
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:56,031
-You really haven't
changed, Soi Fon.

171
00:12:58,665 --> 00:12:59,265
-Lady Yoruichi.

172
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:05,498
-You seem confused
by what's happened.

173
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:09,798
-You're right.

174
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,565
-I have some information
that might help you out.

175
00:13:12,598 --> 00:13:13,065
-Huh?

176
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:18,865
-Hold it!

177
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,731
Damn you, stop!

178
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:23,431
-I've got them.

179
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:32,131
-Huh?

180
00:13:39,598 --> 00:13:40,365
-Forget it.

181
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:42,965
You're done!

182
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:43,665
Let Rurichiyo go.

183
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:04,298
-[groaning]

184
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:06,531
-Is she all right?

185
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:08,365
-It's a doll.

186
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:08,865
-Ichigo!

187
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:15,065
-How's Rurichiyo?

188
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:16,865
-It was a fake.

189
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:17,731
-Not again!

190
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:19,331
-So where is she?

191
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:20,665
-Who knows.

192
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:23,931
But by now, they must have
moved her to another location.

193
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:24,431
Huh?

194
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:30,865
What's that?

195
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:32,898
They're at the arena?

196
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:36,331
-I see.

197
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:36,865
Thanks.

198
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:41,331
-So this Makoto
really was involved

199
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:44,065
with the Kasumioji clan.

200
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:45,465
-All this time.

201
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:47,698
It's just hard to believe.

202
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:49,131
-It is.

203
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:52,965
I never thought their clan's
influence extended this far.

204
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:56,265
-As for him, you three take
Lieutenant Kira to Squad 4.

205
00:14:56,298 --> 00:14:56,965
-Yes sir.

206
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:59,431
You can count on us.

207
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,065
-So what's your next move?

208
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:02,331
-Tough call.

209
00:15:02,365 --> 00:15:04,298
This means this isn't just
a matter of the succession

210
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:05,665
rights anymore.

211
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:09,398
The bakoto's power overtook
and killed one of my own men.

212
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:11,665
That's a problem.

213
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:12,665
-What's that?

214
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:14,131
What's a problem?

215
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:14,631
-Huh?

216
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:18,098
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Renji!

217
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:23,931
-What was t that
brought you here?

218
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,398
-I got this feeling.

219
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:28,298
I sensed the spiritual
pressure of Izuru fighting,

220
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:30,465
and I was right to come here.

221
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:31,531
Now explain this.

222
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:33,565
Why'd you take so
long to contact me?

223
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:34,698
Huh?

224
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:37,331
-I'm surprised you
found us, Lieutenant.

225
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:40,598
I will fight you if you
plan to arrest them.

226
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:42,898
-Captain Amagai, wait a minute.

227
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:45,398
Ichigo and Rukia are
close friends of mine.

228
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:53,565
[sigh] So you
spoke of a problem.

229
00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:55,698
Was Izuru getting
injured part of it?

230
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:58,231
-The Third Seat
from Squad 3 became

231
00:15:58,265 --> 00:16:00,998
linked with the Kasumioji clan.

232
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:04,165
Izuru discovered this fact
and was forced to stop him.

233
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,298
-There's not enough time to sit
here and explain everything,

234
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:10,365
but a lot of bad
stuff's going on here.

235
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:11,731
-Huh.

236
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:15,531
Sounds like you're in the middle
of a real sticky situation.

237
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:17,765
-Lieutenant Abarai.

238
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:20,165
Since you consider
yourself a close friend,

239
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:22,731
would you be willing
to help us out?

240
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:23,231
-Huh?

241
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:33,698
-This weapon is evidence
of the Kasumioji clan's

242
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:35,265
treasonous deeds.

243
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:38,198
This must be delivered
to Head Captain Yamamoto.

244
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,631
And tell him what
you've just heard.

245
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:44,298
-I would like to help,
but I don't know.

246
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:47,731
You'd do a much better job
explaining what's going on.

247
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:50,365
-That's true, but I think
it's important to get

248
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:55,098
to the Kasumioji palace
just as soon as possible.

249
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:56,865
I believe that's going
to be where they're

250
00:16:56,898 --> 00:17:00,365
holding the princess,
and time is running out.

251
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,665
-What makes you think
they've taken her there?

252
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:04,698
-A few reasons
immediately come to mind.

253
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:09,898
First, it's their fortified
stronghold, and well defended.

254
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:12,265
The second reason is that we
already found her there once

255
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,065
before, so they may assume
we crossed it off our list--

256
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:18,031
that the palace is the last
place we'd think to look.

257
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:19,298
Another thought.

258
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:22,598
If Makoto was really
their big trump card--

259
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:24,431
-Then when they hear
Makoto's been defeated,

260
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:27,431
they're sure to kill Rurichiyo.

261
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:29,298
-I see what you mean.

262
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:30,665
So of course I'll help.

263
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:33,298
I'll make sure this gets
to the head captain.

264
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:35,498
-We're counting on you, Renji.

265
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:36,365
-No worries.

266
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:39,498
I won't let you down.

267
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:40,331
-Captain, sir!

268
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,898
We're fully prepared to deploy!

269
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,131
-Wait a little longer.

270
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,431
-But captain, didn't we
already receive orders

271
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:49,965
to deploy quite
a while ago, sir?

272
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:51,765
We shouldn't wait.

273
00:17:51,798 --> 00:17:53,098
-You speak the truth.

274
00:17:53,131 --> 00:18:00,465
However-- Yoruichi Shihouin.

275
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,531
-Still full of questions?

276
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:05,531
Well, I have something
that might help you.

277
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:07,731
Come on, just hear me out.

278
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:14,131
-Once the Head Captain gives
the order to not be disturbed,

279
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:14,865
he means it!

280
00:18:14,898 --> 00:18:15,798
-I know that!

281
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:16,998
Of course!

282
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:20,865
And I'm not asking you to
reinvent the wheel here!

283
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,931
-Then what do you expect of me?

284
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:24,498
-It's just I've
got something here

285
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:27,731
that he needs to take a look
at, and I need to talk with him!

286
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:29,998
-In that case,
give me some time.

287
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:31,631
-Time is something I don't have.

288
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:37,898
-What is all this commotion?

289
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,098
-Damn.

290
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:59,765
Getting around them
is going to be hard.

291
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:01,431
-Now what?

292
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:03,231
-I thought you
had the plan here.

293
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:03,931
-Ichigo Kurosaki!

294
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:06,031
-Huh?

295
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:08,165
-I'm aware that
you are out there.

296
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,065
Now come out.

297
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:16,028
-Toshiro.

298
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:21,394
-I knew that you'd
show up again.

299
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:22,628
-Please wait, Captain.

300
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,894
I'm asking you to listen
to what we have to say.

301
00:19:25,928 --> 00:19:26,961
-All right.

302
00:19:26,994 --> 00:19:28,861
Maybe all of you should
explain yourselves

303
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:30,628
in front of the Head Captain.

304
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:34,228
-Huh?

305
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:45,261
-Shusuke?

306
00:19:45,294 --> 00:19:46,628
Why you?

307
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:47,161
-Go!

308
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:48,128
Out!

309
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:50,294
Just leave this place to me!

310
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:51,494
-Are you sure about that?

311
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:52,694
-Right, thanks.

312
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:54,494
Let's go, Shu.

313
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,428
[guards yelling]

314
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:03,694
-I can't just let you pass.

315
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:05,328
-Lieutenant Matsumoto!

316
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:07,461
-We don't have time
to explain now.

317
00:20:07,494 --> 00:20:10,061
Just let us get by, please!

318
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:12,361
-I can't defy my orders.

319
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:14,961
I wish that I could.

320
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:15,461
-Go on.

321
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:16,528
Move it.

322
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:17,694
I'll handle her.

323
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:18,228
-Rukia, wait.

324
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:23,828
-Go, Ichigo!

325
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:24,828
-All right.

326
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,694
-[growling]

327
00:20:31,728 --> 00:20:34,761
-Stand down, Shusuke.

328
00:20:34,794 --> 00:20:38,094
-I'm sorry, but I can't
do that right now.

329
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:39,461
-Since that's your
answer, you've

330
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:42,128
left me no other choice here.

331
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:43,961
I warn you.

332
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,728
Rain over the frosted
heavens, Hyorinmaru!

333
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:52,961
-Sever, Raika!

334
00:21:07,794 --> 00:21:09,561
-Now the real battle will start.

335
00:21:14,028 --> 00:21:15,928
-Notice to all.

336
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:17,694
It has been brought
to my attention

337
00:21:17,728 --> 00:21:19,461
that possible acts
of treason have

338
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:22,528
been committed by
the Kasumioji clan.

339
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:25,228
All 13 Court Guard
Squads are hereby

340
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:27,394
commanded to occupy
the Kasumioji

341
00:21:27,428 --> 00:21:30,161
grounds to search for
and seize any evidence.

342
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:32,794
-Ho!

343
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:33,594
-Won't get by me!

344
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:34,494
Ha!

345
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:34,994
Oof!

346
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:42,761
-[groaning]

347
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:44,894
-Sorry, guys.

348
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,428
Shu, any idea
where Rurichiyo is?

349
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:52,494
-Uh, there are many
places where she could be,

350
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:55,594
but I think they might have
taken her to the back tower.

351
00:21:55,628 --> 00:21:59,228
That was one part of the palace
we were never allowed to visit.

352
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:00,828
-So which way?

353
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,661
-That way.

354
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:05,761
SHU (VOICEOVER): Rurichiyo.

355
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:07,161
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
Where are you?

356
00:22:12,861 --> 00:22:14,794
[theme song]

357
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,210
RENJI (VOICEOVER): Hey, Izuru.

358
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:49,176
Are you all right?

359
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,210
IZURU (VOICEOVER): Renji?

360
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:51,476
What are you doing here?

361
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,576
RENJI (VOICEOVER): When a
buddy like you gets hurt,

362
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,276
I always take the time
to pay him a visit.

363
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,543
[MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
The real reason you're here

364
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:59,076
is because you missed deployment
with the rest of your squad.

365
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,043
IZURU (VOICEOVER): Wow.

366
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:00,843
You're a real pal.

367
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:01,910
RENJI (VOICEOVER): Shh.
