2
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,668
-What are you trying
to do, poison us?

3
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:45,968
This crap wouldn't
pass for dog food!

4
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:48,402
-I only bring what
they tell me to, sir.

5
00:01:48,435 --> 00:01:49,968
-We're the patients here.

6
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:51,235
Bring us some better food.

7
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:52,035
-Yeah!

8
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:53,268
-What's with all the noise?

9
00:01:53,302 --> 00:01:53,835
What's up?

10
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:55,468
-Squad 11 agian.

11
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:57,568
-Now it's the food
they don't like.

12
00:01:57,602 --> 00:01:58,702
-Huh?

13
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,102
-You maggots don't know
who you're dealing with.

14
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:02,035
-Do you men have some
complaints about the way

15
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:04,002
you're being treated?

16
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:05,468
-Ah!

17
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:06,235
-Sorry about that.

18
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:07,435
-Oh, hello there, captain.

19
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:09,802
-We didn't realize you
were standing right there.

20
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:12,068
-Obviously you're feeling
better if you're up and able

21
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:13,435
to criticize.

22
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:16,335
Just the same, you would
do well to remember

23
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:18,602
that you are in my
care now, and that I

24
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:21,002
am in charge of everything
that goes on here.

25
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:22,702
As such, well you
ar eunder this roof,

26
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:26,368
the members of my squad four
have your lives completely

27
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:28,335
in their hands.

28
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:29,335
-Sorry!

29
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:30,302
We're sorry!

30
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:31,468
-It won't happen again!

31
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:35,602
-Wow.

32
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:39,402
I wonder why they're acting
as if I'm some kind of ghost.

33
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:39,902
Huh?

34
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:45,602
-Urgh!

35
00:02:45,635 --> 00:02:47,035
-Just like that.

36
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:48,602
All right, who's next?

37
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:49,635
-Uh--

38
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:51,235
-Aw, come on!

39
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:55,602
Don't tell me not one
of you has the nerve!

40
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:59,868
-Well, in that case, I'll take
you on, if no one else will,

41
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:00,802
Ikkaku.

42
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:02,035
-Ichigo.

43
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:04,402
Well, you've got guts,
I'll give you that.

44
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,435
But can you handle it?

45
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:07,235
Aren't you still in recovery?

46
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,368
-Both of us had
serious injuries.

47
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:12,435
When you say recovery, it
sounds like I have some disease.

48
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:14,468
-Recovery just means
getting over something.

49
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:16,702
You could use it for
either, you simpleton.

50
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:17,968
-Cannot!

51
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:20,735
-OK, if it's not recovery,
then what word do you use?

52
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:23,868
-Well, I'd use--
look, I don't now!

53
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:24,368
-Ha!

54
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:25,402
I knew it!

55
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:27,235
You're all brawn and
no brain, Ichigo.

56
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:28,302
-Me?

57
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:29,635
Nothing goes into
your bald, shiny head.

58
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,302
It just bounces off!

59
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:32,735
-Ha!

60
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:36,402
Let's fight, and the
winner is the smarter one!

61
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:37,735
-You got it, Ikkaku!

62
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:40,868
There's nothing I
can't beat you at!

63
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:41,602
-Hey.

64
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:42,402
Eh?

65
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:44,602
-Good morning, captain, sir.

66
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:45,435
-Huh?

67
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:47,568
What are you doing, Ichigo?

68
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,102
-Ichi!

69
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:49,468
How are you?

70
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:51,435
KENPACHI (OFFSCREEN):
Have your wounds healed?

71
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:53,068
-Well, yeah.

72
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:56,502
And in fact, I was
just about to-- eh?

73
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:58,435
-I see.

74
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:01,368
That is good news,
because it means you

75
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:05,235
and I can fight again!

76
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,002
-Whoa!

77
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:08,835
-Heh, heh, heh.

78
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:09,735
Huh?

79
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:11,402
Hey, that's the wrong guy.

80
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:13,335
-I'm never fighting
you again, you--

81
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:14,268
-Kenny, look!

82
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:15,135
He's getting away!

83
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:16,068
-Hey, Ichigo!

84
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:18,668
Come back here and fight me!

85
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:20,168
-Such a commotion.

86
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:22,902
Those guys need to
relax, if you ask me.

87
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:26,235
-At least with Ichigo in squad
11, things are never boring.

88
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:27,635
-True.

89
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:31,035
Now that you mention it, you've
been around a lot lately, too.

90
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:33,902
What happened to
Captain Komamura?

91
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:35,902
-Well, I wish I knew.

92
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:39,868
Lately it seems like the captain
just wants to be left alone.

93
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:45,235
-Friend of Kaname Tosen.

94
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:47,835
You whose name I do not know.

95
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:49,668
What would you have done?

96
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:52,102
What would you have
said to stop him?

97
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:58,535
-Wha--?

98
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,535
Captain Komamura.

99
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:07,468
Do you think he'll come back?

100
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:11,968
Or is Captain Tosen
gone for good?

101
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:13,468
-He'll be back.

102
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:19,568
But we must find a way to
open his eyes to the truth.

103
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:22,468
-I wouldn't have minded being
your captive be little longer.

104
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:24,402
So long, Rangiku.

105
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:27,335
Maybe next time.

106
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,235
-That's the thing I
hate most about you.

107
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:38,168
So stupid.

108
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:39,202
-Talking about yourself?

109
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:40,302
-Ah!

110
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:42,335
Don't sneak up on me like that.

111
00:05:42,368 --> 00:05:45,035
You scared me so bad I
almost popped out of my robe.

112
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:45,835
-What if you had?

113
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:47,202
-Then I'd have been exposed.

114
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:48,935
-Which I doubt would bother you.

115
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:50,202
Anyway, you have a guest.

116
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:52,068
-Hm?

117
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,368
Izuru.

118
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:57,468
-I need to talk to you.

119
00:05:57,502 --> 00:05:58,902
-Hm.

120
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:00,335
I have some sweet buns here.

121
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:02,335
Help yourself.

122
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:04,035
And sake, of course!

123
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:05,735
-Huh?

124
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:06,568
-No.

125
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:08,368
No more, Rangiku.

126
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,735
-No wimping out!

127
00:06:10,768 --> 00:06:13,402
-Rangiku, back there
I was a little--

128
00:06:13,435 --> 00:06:14,335
-Forget it.

129
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:17,368
-I just wanted to
say I was sorry.

130
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:18,435
-Don't worry.

131
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:19,168
It's OK.

132
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:20,368
-Yeah?

133
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:22,935
-Though it's true you came
at me with full force.

134
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:23,902
Didn't you?

135
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,368
And to think you
thought you hurt me

136
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:28,068
when you barely
laid a hit on me!

137
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:29,768
But don't feel bad.

138
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:33,168
The fact that you came to
visit, that makes it all right.

139
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:34,002
Really.

140
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:35,202
-Yeah?

141
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:37,735
-Sitting down face to face
and talking about things

142
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:40,635
might not solve everything,
but if we don't do it,

143
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,668
we'll never understand
each other at all.

144
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,235
You know what I mean?

145
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:45,902
-I think so.

146
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:48,235
I guess you're right,
as usual, Rangiku.

147
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,302
-Captain?

148
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:08,235
Before you go, could you talked
to her for a few moments?

149
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:10,135
She's waiting.

150
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:12,202
She's waiting for someone
who's closer to her

151
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:17,202
than I am to sit and talk to
her, just for a little while.

152
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:21,002
-Unfortunately, right
now I don't have anything

153
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:23,668
to say to her.

154
00:07:23,702 --> 00:07:26,302
-Right now?

155
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:27,368
-If you'll excuse me.

156
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:31,935
-Finally finished.

157
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:34,335
Since we can't go back to the
world of the living dressed

158
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:36,802
like soul reapers, I've made
new clothes for all of us.

159
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:37,902
Pretty nice, huh?

160
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:40,802
-Yeah, but it's sort
of different, isn't it?

161
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,068
You changed something.

162
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:43,035
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

163
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:44,168
It's better, huh?

164
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,768
As for you, Orihime,
I couldn't duplicate

165
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:49,068
the design your old
shirt had, so instead I

166
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,835
did this one with some
lace down one side,

167
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:52,668
then sewed these flowers
here at the bottom.

168
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:54,068
What do you think?

169
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:54,902
-Uh, yeah.

170
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:55,735
Cute.

171
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,435
-I'm glad you like it.

172
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:59,868
I also made this one for Rukia.

173
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:01,468
I made it kind of
like the one she

174
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:04,368
was wearing when she came
to our world the first time.

175
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:06,068
-Yeah, this is great!

176
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:07,435
Whoa.

177
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:10,002
-You're, uh, better at making
clothes for girls than guys,

178
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:10,968
aren't you, Uryu?

179
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:11,535
-What?

180
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:12,935
-Hey, I know.

181
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:15,368
I'm gonna take Rukia her dress
and show it to her right now.

182
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:17,468
-Uh-- so, what do you say, Chad?

183
00:08:17,502 --> 00:08:19,402
Why don't you try that
on and see how it fits?

184
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,702
[giggling]

185
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:24,835
-Uryu's not a bad designer.

186
00:08:24,868 --> 00:08:28,002
I think Rukia's really
going to like this.

187
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:32,002
She's been so depressed lately.

188
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:34,968
But now, when she sees
this, it'll cheer her up.

189
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:37,435
It's strange Uryu made
something so pretty for Rukia.

190
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:40,002
I wonder why he went
to so much trouble.

191
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:45,202
This can only mean that Urye
is secretly in love with Rukia.

192
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,368
It's cool that I
noticed it, though.

193
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,768
Only 15 years old and
already, my female intuition

194
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:52,202
is razor sharp!

195
00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:53,168
Rukia!

196
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:56,568
I have something for you!

197
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,468
Rukia?

198
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:00,568
-Man, my feet are killing me.

199
00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:02,402
That crazy Kenpachi
must've chased me

200
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:04,402
for hours trying
to fight me again.

201
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:06,135
That guy is totally insane.

202
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:08,402
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Ichigo!

203
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:09,968
-Orihime?

204
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:12,768
What are you doing Here And
what's with those clothes?

205
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,768
-There's something wrong.

206
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:16,735
I can't find Rukia.

207
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:17,235
-Huh?

208
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:23,202
-Renji.

209
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:26,668
Why are you here?

210
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:30,102
-I'm here because
you're my captain.

211
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:33,602
-You probably wish I were dead.

212
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:37,002
I imagine that's what
you're thinking now.

213
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,935
-No, you're wrong.

214
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:41,468
If you were to die, then
what motivation would

215
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:42,568
I have to get stronger?

216
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,802
And in fact, captain--

217
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,735
[footsteps]

218
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,502
-Renji!

219
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:53,902
-What the hell?

220
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,568
How dare you charge
in here like that.

221
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:57,768
I was just about ready to
say something really cool,

222
00:09:57,802 --> 00:09:59,535
and you totally
ruined the moment!

223
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:00,335
-Sorry.

224
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:02,968
How was I supposed to know?

225
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,935
Hey have you seen Rukia
around anywhere lately?

226
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:05,968
-What?

227
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:07,502
You better not have
lost Rukia again.

228
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:08,035
-No.

229
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:09,135
No.

230
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:10,302
I just thought you might
know where she was.

231
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:12,135
-What's going on, Ichigo?

232
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:13,502
So, what did you find out?

233
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:16,002
-How did you get
all the way up here?

234
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:17,235
No way.

235
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:19,635
Sorry to barge in
on you, Byakuya.

236
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:20,335
Later, Renji.

237
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:22,935
-We'll be going, now.

238
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:26,502
-Wonder what the hell
those two are up to.

239
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:27,202
-What is it?

240
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,335
Is something wrong, sir?

241
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:31,168
-Just that-- well,
I certainly hope

242
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:33,035
this Ichigo doesn't
intend to keep

243
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:35,202
calling me by my first name.

244
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,202
I find his lack of
respect disturbing.

245
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:39,802
-Huh?

246
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:41,402
-Where are we going, Ichigo?

247
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:44,735
Did Renji give you some idea
where to look for Rukia?

248
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:45,868
-Well, sort of.

249
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:47,402
If she's not with
Renji, then there's

250
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:50,468
only one other place to look.

251
00:10:50,502 --> 00:10:51,468
-Ow!

252
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:52,468
Stop it, Kukaku!

253
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:53,568
I can't take it!

254
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:55,902
-Quit your whining and
give me 1,000 more!

255
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:56,902
- --cracked my spine!

256
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:57,935
Come on!

257
00:10:57,968 --> 00:10:59,602
How about I give
you 50 of them now,

258
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:00,902
and the rest of them later?

259
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:02,168
Hah!

260
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:04,535
Still got injuries from
fighting so heroically before.

261
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:05,368
-Hah!

262
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:07,768
That's not exactly what I heard.

263
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:10,002
I heard you were nowhere
near the front lines,

264
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,402
and in fact, you
were practically

265
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:13,568
useless the whole second
half of the fight.

266
00:11:13,602 --> 00:11:14,068
-What?

267
00:11:14,102 --> 00:11:14,802
Lies!

268
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:16,135
Who told you that?

269
00:11:16,168 --> 00:11:18,268
-Now I'm going to make you sorry
that you came back and lied.

270
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,802
You shame the Shiba name!

271
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:20,302
-Ah!

272
00:11:20,335 --> 00:11:20,802
-Huh?

273
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:27,568
Yeah?

274
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:28,235
What do you want?

275
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:29,068
-Hm?

276
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:29,902
Oh, Rukia!

277
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:31,068
It's her, Kukaku!

278
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:32,902
It's the person this
whole thing was all about.

279
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:35,602
She's the one Ichigo came here
and risked his life to save!

280
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:38,235
-I know who she is.

281
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:42,568
Rukia Kuchiki, the soul reaper
who killed our brother Kaien.

282
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,335
I know who you are.

283
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:45,935
Now, what did you come here for?

284
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:49,568
-I'm sorry.

285
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:00,345
-I know who you are.

286
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:04,111
Now, what did you come here for?

287
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:05,078
-I'm sorry.

288
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:10,878
I-- I know I should
have come sooner.

289
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:14,278
I wanted to, but I was a coward.

290
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:17,811
I should've apologized to
you the first chance I got.

291
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:21,111
The longer I waited, the
harder it seemed to become,

292
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:24,711
until I ran.

293
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:25,645
I ran and I'm sorry.

294
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:26,211
-Stop.

295
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,245
That's enough.

296
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:28,345
What is this?

297
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:30,278
The world's longest apology?

298
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:33,511
-I'm, um-- I'm so sorry-- oh!

299
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,078
-Enough, I said!

300
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:35,545
-Oh!

301
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:37,345
I, um, uh--

302
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:38,878
-It's all right.

303
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,411
I mean it.

304
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:43,978
Anyway, I already heard the
whole story from Ukitake.

305
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:46,645
I know that Kaien's
death wasn't your fault.

306
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:48,645
And I know that
ever since that day,

307
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:52,178
you've been carrying more than
your share of guilt over it.

308
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:54,911
So long ago I
decided in my heart

309
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:57,778
that if you said just
one word of apology,

310
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:01,778
I would forgive you.

311
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:03,411
-(THINKING) Of course.

312
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:06,978
She knew Kaien,
better than anyone.

313
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:10,211
She knows what he
would have wanted.

314
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:13,178
All this time I was
only thinking of myself,

315
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:15,778
when she's the one
who was hurt the most

316
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:17,245
by the loss of her brother.

317
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:21,611
Thank you.

318
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:23,878
I'm just so sorry I--

319
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,678
-Enough apologizing.

320
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:26,611
-Um, OK.

321
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:28,011
I'm sorry-- Wait.

322
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:29,678
I mean, thank you.

323
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:30,678
-Ah-ha.

324
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,278
I thought I'd find you here.

325
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,811
-Ichigo?

326
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:35,045
Orihime?

327
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:37,745
-Sorry to interrupt
your little chat,

328
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:40,145
but right now we should
probably head back

329
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:42,045
and try to get some
rest before tomorrow.

330
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:44,145
In the morning they're
going to open a gate for us

331
00:13:44,178 --> 00:13:45,278
to return to our world.

332
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:47,245
And you're still not
back to full health.

333
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,145
-I have to tell you something.

334
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:57,378
It's only right that you
be the first to know.

335
00:13:57,411 --> 00:13:59,345
-Uh-huh?

336
00:13:59,378 --> 00:14:05,111
-I've decided, Ichigo, to
stay here in the Soul Society.

337
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:11,778
-Well, that's fine.

338
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:12,978
Good for you.

339
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:14,178
-Huh?

340
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:17,545
-Well, it sounds like
you've made up your mind,

341
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:19,578
so there's not much else to say.

342
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:22,845
If you've decided that
you want to stay here,

343
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:24,178
then that's what you should do.

344
00:14:30,378 --> 00:14:33,278
(THINKING) Looking at her
now, I remember exactly why

345
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:35,011
I wanted to save her
in the first place.

346
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:38,878
-Hmph!

347
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,045
Ichigo, you finally
showed up, huh?

348
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:41,478
-Well, I, uh-- I mean--

349
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:42,878
-Hello again, Kukaku.

350
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:45,178
-So you're checking out and
leaving in the morning, huh?

351
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:47,245
Then stay and have
dinner with us tonight!

352
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:48,211
-Well, thanks.

353
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:50,045
I would, but I don't
know if I can--

354
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:51,345
-Not this again.

355
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:53,778
The correct answer is yes,
I'd love to stay for dinner.

356
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,111
-You know, I was thinking
dinner tonight would be great.

357
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,611
Thank you.

358
00:14:58,645 --> 00:14:59,611
-No, no, that was great.

359
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:14,378
-Hey!

360
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:15,878
Rukia!

361
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:19,045
Where the hell
could she have gone?

362
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:19,945
-Orihime!

363
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:22,911
Orihime, where'd
you disappear to?

364
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:23,845
-Ichigo!

365
00:15:23,878 --> 00:15:26,511
Come out and fight
me, you bastard!

366
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:29,811
-Too much free time
on their hands.

367
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,445
-What happened here?

368
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:32,811
-No, no more sake.

369
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:36,545
-That was close.

370
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:37,778
I almost died!

371
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,345
-How?

372
00:15:38,378 --> 00:15:39,678
What happened?

373
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:41,645
-I can't breathe if I lie
face down because of my boobs!

374
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:43,111
Don't you know what
the feels like?

375
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:44,145
-I don't.

376
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,345
-Well, you should
have more sympathy.

377
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,045
It's not easy being a
girl and being beautiful.

378
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:49,845
-Oh, shut up.

379
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:52,478
-This is the official
Senkaimon for your departure

380
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:54,211
from the Soul Society.

381
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,245
It incorporates a
reishi [inaudible]

382
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:58,411
made specifically for you.

383
00:15:58,445 --> 00:15:59,445
Ichigo.

384
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:00,545
-Yeah?

385
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:02,578
-This is for you.

386
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:03,478
-Hm?

387
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:05,045
What's this thing?

388
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:07,311
-A substitute soul reaper badge.

389
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:08,645
-Huh?

390
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:11,078
-Over the centuries, there
have been a few other instances

391
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:13,845
where substitute soul reapers
have been deemed useful.

392
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:17,178
They too were given this badges
as proof of their status.

393
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:19,111
You can use it to
become a soul reaper

394
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,211
whenever you wish to do so.

395
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,578
Of course, such a mere
token can never really

396
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:25,811
repay you for what
you have done here.

397
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:27,478
-It's all right.

398
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:30,078
The reason I did it all
is because I wanted to.

399
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,111
But I'll gladly accept this.

400
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,111
It's an honor.

401
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:34,411
Thank you.

402
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:37,545
-(THINKING) This man
is truly exceptional.

403
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:39,411
-There's something
here for you too,

404
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,278
Rukia, that Uryu made for you.

405
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,678
-Oh.

406
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,778
But since I'm staying here, I
won't need a dress like that.

407
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:46,911
-Rukia, you have got
to wear this dress!

408
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:48,711
-All right, then, I will.

409
00:16:48,745 --> 00:16:49,445
-It is time.

410
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:56,911
-Well, see you around, Rukia.

411
00:16:56,945 --> 00:16:58,611
-Yeah.

412
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:01,611
Thank you, Ichigo.

413
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,111
-That's my line.

414
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:05,745
Thank you, Rukia.

415
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:09,245
Thanks to you, now it
will finally stop raining.

416
00:17:14,278 --> 00:17:15,378
-Aw.

417
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:18,045
Ichi's spiritual pressure
just disappeared.

418
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:18,945
-Yeah.

419
00:17:18,978 --> 00:17:20,611
-Why didn't you go see them off?

420
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:21,911
-What for?

421
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:25,111
-Well, do you think you're
ever going to see him again?

422
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,878
-Someday, yes.

423
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:27,911
-Huh?

424
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,811
-You heard what old
man Yamamoto said.

425
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:32,745
This fight isn't over.

426
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:34,811
Not by a long shot.

427
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,378
Ichigo and I will meet again.

428
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:43,311
Besides, we're a
lot alike, he and I.

429
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:46,145
-Kenny, you've learned you
don't have to win every fight.

430
00:17:46,178 --> 00:17:48,845
-Don't patronize me.

431
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:50,678
-What the hell, Yoruichi?

432
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:52,545
If this is the
official gate, then why

433
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:54,545
do we have to run for our
lives through it, just

434
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:55,578
like the last time?

435
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:57,011
URYU (OFFSCREEN):
We each need a hell

436
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,478
butterfly to clear
the gate safely!

437
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,278
Only soul reapers
can handle them.

438
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:01,045
Relax!

439
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,745
We're almost at the exit!

440
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:12,478
[screaming]

441
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:14,511
-I'm locked on target.

442
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:16,145
Fire one.

443
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,578
[screaming]

444
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:20,745
-There's the pitch, and
here comes the swing!

445
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:23,211
Jinta home run!

446
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:24,478
-[inaudible] catch!

447
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:28,411
-My, my.

448
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:31,445
Welcome back, everyone.

449
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:31,945
-Urahara.

450
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:33,278
But how?

451
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:36,811
-It's good to see you
again, young Ichigo.

452
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:42,911
I imagine by now you've
heard the truth about me.

453
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:43,411
-I have.

454
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:52,345
-Words cannot express
how sorry I am.

455
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:00,445
-Stop.

456
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:01,278
It's all right.

457
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:04,245
I'm not mad about it anymore.

458
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:07,145
Look, you really didn't
do anything wrong.

459
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,845
I'm not sure what
your motivation was,

460
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:14,045
but the fact is you helped
all of us become stronger,

461
00:19:14,078 --> 00:19:17,278
and in the end, you
probably saved our lives.

462
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:19,811
For that, we're thankful.

463
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:21,978
So please don't apologize.

464
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:23,045
-OK.

465
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,311
-But I do want to
ask you one question.

466
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:28,778
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth?

467
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:33,178
Did you think I would
get scared and run away?

468
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:35,745
-Exactly right!

469
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:37,711
-Now, that just pisses me off.

470
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:39,578
-You were taking it so well.

471
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,111
I wasn't expecting
an elbow in the face.

472
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:43,845
-One other thing.

473
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:46,978
I want you to apologize
to Rukia when you see her.

474
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:50,078
And know she will say
the same thing I'd say.

475
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:51,945
Will you do that for me?

476
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:52,445
-Hm.

477
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:55,845
Yes.

478
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:01,711
-Mr. Urahara, do you suppose you
could drop me off around here?

479
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:02,411
-Of course.

480
00:20:02,445 --> 00:20:03,545
Consider it done.

481
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,145
-See you later, Uryu.

482
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:07,845
I'll be sure to call you
if anything big comes up.

483
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:09,411
-What are you talking about?

484
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:10,211
-Hm?

485
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:12,145
-Have you forgotten, Ichigo?

486
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:16,178
You are a soul reaper,
and I am a Quincy.

487
00:20:16,211 --> 00:20:19,811
The next time you and I
meet, we'll be enemies.

488
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:21,711
-He's a stubborn guy.

489
00:20:21,745 --> 00:20:23,178
-Yeah, that's for sure.

490
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:26,078
-But that stubborn streak is one
of Uryu's best chatacteristics.

491
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:28,045
-You really think so?

492
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:28,545
-Yeah.

493
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:29,111
It's true.

494
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,311
-No way.

495
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:33,745
Man, you guys are more
understanding than I am.

496
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:37,245
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Well,
this is my stop, guys.

497
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:37,745
Goodbye!

498
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:51,978
-Shall I drop you off
at your house, Ichigo?

499
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:52,645
-Yeah.

500
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:55,378
That would be great.

501
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:57,778
Actually, I think I'll
get off right here.

502
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:58,578
-Wait a second.

503
00:20:58,611 --> 00:20:59,345
-See ya.

504
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:00,678
Thanks for the ride.

505
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:01,178
-Ichigo!

506
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:12,878
-Hm.

507
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:14,978
-What's wrong, Yoruichi?

508
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:16,111
-Hm?

509
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:18,245
I was just thinking.

510
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,811
This has been quite a
long journey, hasn't it?

511
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:22,645
-It has.

512
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:24,645
-Tell me something, Kisuke.

513
00:21:24,678 --> 00:21:25,511
-What?

514
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:28,145
-What are you going to do now?

515
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:30,745
-That's a good question.

516
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:32,645
It feels like we've
won a big victory,

517
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:36,211
but in fact, this all started
after we suffered a big defeat.

518
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:40,778
So really, all we've done is
get things back to normal.

519
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:42,278
To win this thing
for good, we're

520
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:45,611
going to have to count on
Ichigo and the others even more.

521
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:49,278
I'm afraid the battle
has just begun.

522
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:51,278
-Then I guess for
you and me, there'll

523
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:54,045
be no dying
peacefully of old age.

524
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:56,111
-Probably not.

525
00:21:56,145 --> 00:21:59,511
But that really can't
be helped, I guess.

526
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:02,011
-Yoruichi and the boss sure
are a couple of odd ducks,

527
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,045
aren't they?

528
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:04,978
-They look like a
cat and a man to me.

529
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:06,678
-It's just an expression-- ow!

530
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:07,178
-Ow!

531
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:18,345
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): I'm home.

532
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,913
[theme music]

533
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:57,617
-Give me some suggestions
for the next episode.

534
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:59,317
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Dr. Kurosaki's
serious medical drama!

535
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:01,251
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Kon's
steamy and suggestive diary.

536
00:23:01,284 --> 00:23:02,851
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): How
about a horror mystery?

537
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:03,651
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
You're all wrong.

538
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:04,917
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Who's left?

539
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,117
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Wasn't it
someone you know, Ichigo?

540
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:06,851
-I don't know.

541
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:07,984
Aw, time's up!

542
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:09,917
MAN (OFFSCREEN): That
sure is nostalgic.
