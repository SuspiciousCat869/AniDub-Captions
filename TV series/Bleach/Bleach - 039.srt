Well, you probably shouldn't
have revealed that.

me your sword isn't

Don't mention it.

166
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:17,941
After all, he's the king
of this world, isn't he?

167
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:22,074
We need him to win, right?

168
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:24,341
Well, my work is done here.

169
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:26,541
So can I go back now?

170
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:27,374
-Very well.

171
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:36,974
He's a strong one, Zangetsu.

172
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:38,341
Train him well.

173
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:41,474
All that power is going
to be mine, eventually.

174
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:50,441
-(THINKING) Ichigo, do
you know I hate the rain?

175
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:53,174
And it rains in this world, too.

176
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,441
If your heart is troubled,
the skies will become cloudy.

177
00:11:57,474 --> 00:12:00,474
If you grieve, it will
rain ever so easily.

178
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:09,408
I wonder if you can understand
the fear of being rained on

179
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:10,508
in this lonely world.

180
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:19,408
To stop that rain, I shall lend
you any strength, any power.

181
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:22,441
If you just have faith
in me, I will not

182
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:27,608
allow any rain to
fall upon this world.

183
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:29,874
Trust me, Ichigo.

184
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:32,408
As long as I am here,
you'll never fight alone.

185
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:40,008
-(THINKING) What the hell?

186
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,441
He had no pulse.

187
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:45,008
And yet he's standing again.

188
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,641
His spiritual pressure.

189
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:50,541
-[panting]

190
00:12:57,808 --> 00:13:02,641
-(THINKING) And his chest--
the bleeding has stopped.

191
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:04,608
[music playing]

192
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:11,041
-[roaring]

193
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:12,508
-[gasp]

194
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,008
[ROARING, GRUNTING,
BLADES CLASHING]

195
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,474
-(THINKING) I can't hold him.

196
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:20,941
-[roaring]

197
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:30,874
[panting]

198
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:34,574
-Sorry, but I haven't got
any time to waste here.

199
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:37,108
I'm going to have to
make quick work of this.

200
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:43,041
-[chuckling] You want to
finish it quickly, eh?

201
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:47,574
Oh, there's no way I can allow
that, not now, when we're just

202
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:51,174
starting to have so much fun!

203
00:13:51,208 --> 00:14:01,774
[roaring] I love it!

204
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:05,508
How did you come
back from the dead?

205
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:09,941
And how come you seem so much
stronger all of a sudden?

206
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,374
This battle has opened the
door to so many questions.

207
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:16,241
But I'm willing to forget
about them for the moment.

208
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:18,774
Let's just have fun
with this fight.

209
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:23,674
[grunting and slashing]

210
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:35,608
-[roaring]

211
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,108
-(THINKING) Damn it.

212
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:40,708
No matter how much I cut
him, he still won't go down.

213
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:43,474
-Yeah.

214
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,108
-Something's not right here.

215
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:46,741
What's wrong with you?

216
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:49,608
Do you really love
fighting that much?

217
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:50,708
That's crazy.

218
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:53,708
Aren't you afraid of dying?

219
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:55,974
-Afraid of dying?

220
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:58,674
I can't believe you'd ask
such a stupid question.

221
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:02,441
Someone so strong, how could
you not love doing battle?

222
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:05,941
You should enjoy it, revel
in death and in pain.

223
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:08,308
Isn't that the price
than we warriors pay?

224
00:15:12,841 --> 00:15:15,808
-[sighing] What's going on?

225
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:21,774
[laughing maniacally] Whoa!

226
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:23,941
What the hell
happened to your hair?

227
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:24,874
[laughing]

228
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:27,174
-Hey!

229
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,908
Enjoy!

230
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:33,108
-Huh? [screaming]

231
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,108
-Those fireworks gave you
a new look, all right!

232
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:35,741
-Fine.

233
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:37,208
I'll put this on.

234
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:37,741
Happy now?

235
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:41,074
-[laughing]

236
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,308
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
What are you thinking about?

237
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:46,308
-I was just sensing
that the captain

238
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:48,441
is having fun right now.

239
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:49,208
-You're right.

240
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,208
But with who?

241
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,374
His opponent has
incredible strength.

242
00:15:53,408 --> 00:15:56,174
-[shouting]

243
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,574
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): Ichigo,

244
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,174
the kid who defeated me.

245
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,808
But he's stronger now, almost
a completely different person.

246
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:04,541
-[roaring].

247
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:06,374
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
This could be bad.

248
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:09,608
I'm sensing that the captain is
on the defensive in this fight.

249
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:11,874
Do you suppose he
might actually--

250
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:13,608
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Don't be a fool.

251
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:16,241
There's no way the
captain will ever lose.

252
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:28,441
-[laughing] [panting] At last,
finally, I have met my equal.

253
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:33,074
In fact, you might even be
slightly better than me.

254
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:37,274
I can't remember when I've
ever felt such elation.

255
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:39,008
-(THINKING) Why is he
still so confident?

256
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:47,374
-Against you, I think I can
fight with no restraints

257
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:48,274
at all.

258
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:51,674
-Oh!

259
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:03,841
-Lieutenant Kusajishi, I have
an urgent message for you.

260
00:17:03,874 --> 00:17:05,541
-Um, not right now.

261
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:10,174
-Uh, but, lieutenant,
this is a high priority.

262
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,274
It's been signed by both Head
Captain Yamamoto and Captain

263
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:15,374
Hitsugaya of Squad 10.

264
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:17,574
-Um, come back later.

265
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:20,741
-But lieutenant, you're going
to get me in big trouble.

266
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,274
I have to follow orders.

267
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,908
If I don't get this
delivered to you,

268
00:17:23,941 --> 00:17:25,574
and headquarters finds out--

269
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:27,508
-Shut up, you!

270
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,974
-[moaning]

271
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:31,274
-Kenny is fighting,
so stop bothering me.

272
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:31,774
Understand?

273
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:37,208
-(THINKING) What the hell?

274
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:39,541
When he took off his eye
patch, his spiritual energy

275
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:40,674
went through the roof.

276
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:44,808
-[chuckling]

277
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:45,841
-Heh.

278
00:17:45,874 --> 00:17:47,108
It's a little late
in the fight for you

279
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,908
to be trying something
new, Isn't it?

280
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:50,741
What nasty little
secret have you

281
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:52,974
been hiding behind
that eye patch?

282
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:54,774
-Hiding?

283
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,041
Ha!

284
00:17:56,074 --> 00:18:01,508
As if I'd stoop so low as
to use tactics like that.

285
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,641
I had the technology
department design

286
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:05,141
this little monster for me.

287
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:07,674
It consumes huge
amounts of spirit energy

288
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,441
from the one wearing it.

289
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:12,541
Now that I've taken
it off, I'm releasing

290
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,374
100% of my spirit energy.

291
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:29,441
And I'm going to use every
bit of it to kill you.

292
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:30,908
It's that simple.

293
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,508
-Can you hear that, Ichigo?

294
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,708
Can you hear the
cries of his sword?

295
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:53,141
[shrieking]

296
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,108
-You hear it.

297
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:55,608
But he can not.

298
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:59,308
And when two who do not trust
each other fight together,

299
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:03,474
the strength they each
process is diminished.

300
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:08,974
One who believes only in
himself can not understand this.

301
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:12,908
Ichigo, do you have complete
and utter trust in me?

302
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:15,474
-(THINKING) It goes
without saying.

303
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:18,841
I'm putting all of my power
in your hands, Zangetsu.

304
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,808
Do with me what you will.

305
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:25,674
And lend me all your power
in order to win this fight.

306
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,174
-Yes.

307
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:33,741
-Even now your spiritual
force still increases.

308
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:34,274
-Excellent.

309
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:35,641
-Of course.

310
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,041
It keeps increasing, because
I'm borrowing Zangetsu's power,

311
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:41,108
and fighting alongside him.

312
00:19:41,141 --> 00:19:45,174
I can never lose to someone
like you, who fights all alone.

313
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,808
I'm twice as strong.

314
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:49,074
CAPTAIN (OFFSCREEN): Zangetsu?

315
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:51,674
Is that the name
of your zanpakuto?

316
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,341
And so you are borrowing
the power of your sword,

317
00:19:54,374 --> 00:19:55,741
and fighting alongside it?

318
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:56,308
Heh.

319
00:19:56,341 --> 00:19:57,208
What nonsense.

320
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,474
Zanpakuto are simply weapons.

321
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:05,908
Your approach is
that of a weakling,

322
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:09,408
a boy who has so little
confidence in his own strength

323
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,474
that he must borrow
the power of zanpakuto.

324
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:15,108
