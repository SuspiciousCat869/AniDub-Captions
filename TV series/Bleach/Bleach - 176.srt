to eliminate Princess Rurichiyo.

He entrusted the head of his

him to the world of the living.

-What's so funny?

156
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:11,849
-This sword is no
Zanpakuto, my friend.

157
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:12,683
It is a Bakkoto.

158
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:20,316
-Which is different from a Soul
Reaper's blade how, exactly?

159
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:22,683
-Why, there's no comparison.

160
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:28,949
Bakkoto are not restricted by
things like Shikai and Bankai,

161
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:30,949
hence it's unique appearance.

162
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:33,249
And its power is
contingent upon the spirit

163
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:36,083
energy of its wielder.

164
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:38,649
-Sounds like a Zanpakuto to me.

165
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:39,916
-Not at all.

166
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:43,849
A Soul Reaper and his Zanpakuto
complement one another,

167
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:48,616
gradually increasing the
power of both man and blade.

168
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,916
But this sword takes nothing
but its wielder's spirit energy

169
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:55,616
and converts it into power.

170
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,549
-You don't say.

171
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,349
I still find it hard to
believe that blade of yours

172
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:03,916
is any stronger
than a Zanpakuto.

173
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:04,416
-Huh?

174
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,349
-Hit him!

175
00:11:09,383 --> 00:11:09,849
-What?

176
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:15,316
-Did I get him?

177
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:15,816
Huh!

178
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,283
The spiritual pressure!

179
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:27,183
It's-- Mmm-- mmmmh.

180
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:36,616
Now what?

181
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:38,083
Why the new costume?

182
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:41,883
--[chuckles] You're looking at
the true form of my Shiragiri.

183
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:48,016
[laughs]

184
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,949
-What in the?

185
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:54,016
-I'm afraid your Reishi
arrows won't work on me.

186
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:57,149
-We'll see about that.

187
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,549
-Shiragiri, Mugen Kairo.

188
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,016
[boom]

189
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:08,383
-Where is he?

190
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:12,316
RYU KUZU: [laughs]

191
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:14,616
-Over there!

192
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,449
How is he-- huh?

193
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:27,883
RYU KUZU: [laughs]
Over here. [laughs]

194
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,849
-Some sort of illusion?

195
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:42,283
RYU KUZU: [laughs]

196
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:44,049
URYU ISHIDA (VOICEOVER):
Where is he?

197
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,249
Which is the real one?

198
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:50,949
RYU KUZU: It's useless searching
for my spiritual pressure.

199
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:54,016
You're never going to find me.

200
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:56,416
URYU ISHIDA: There.

201
00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:01,949
RYU KUZU: [laughs] I
told you it's useless.

202
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:03,349
URYU ISHIDA
(VOICEOVER): Strange.

203
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,549
There's no way this
rooftop is this big.

204
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,516
Is my perception off?

205
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:09,016
Or--

206
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:12,983
[gasp]

207
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:14,949
-Nnnngh!

208
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:19,416
RYU KUZU: [laughs] How long
do you think you can run?

209
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:32,690
[running footsteps]

210
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:37,457
[panting]

211
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,890
ORIHIME INOUE
(VOICEOVER): Ichigo.

212
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:39,924
Rukia.

213
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:40,990
Uryu.

214
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:43,357
I can feel each of their
spiritual pressures.

215
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,357
I have to hurry!

216
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:49,424
[gasp]

217
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:50,257
ORIHIME INOUE: Chad!

[glass shatters]

219
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,157
GENGA: How much longer
are you gonna run?

220
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,824
-I'm not running away.

221
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:09,657
I just didn't want to
fight you back in town.

222
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,657
-That so, huh?

223
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,357
Huh.

224
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,757
-Listen for a minute.

225
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,057
We don't have to do this.

226
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,290
It's not too late
for you to walk away.

227
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:21,290
-Excuse me?

228
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:25,924
-Believe me, I'm no expert
in Soul Society politics.

229
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:30,090
But I do know this much--
those entrusted with the power

230
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:33,124
that nobility affords have
a heavy responsibility

231
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:34,924
to shoulder.

232
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,157
Byakuya Kuchiki
can attest to that.

233
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,524
-What are you trying to say?

234
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:44,090
YASUTORA SADO: Rurichiyo
is still young,

235
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:49,024
but she's prepared to
embrace her future role.

236
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:52,124
When the time
comes, she'll return

237
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:55,290
to the Soul Society
with Kenryu and Enryu

238
00:14:55,324 --> 00:15:01,624
at her side to confront her
destiny and forge her own path.

239
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:02,857
-Your point?

240
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,924
-Sooner or later, she'll
have to settle all this,

241
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:07,790
like it or not.

242
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,424
Give her a chance.

243
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:10,990
At least wait until she's grown.

244
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:17,724
GENGA: [laughs]

245
00:15:17,757 --> 00:15:19,057
YASUTORA SADO: What's so funny?

246
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:24,490
--[laughs] So that's where
you're going with all this.

247
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,857
Not gonna happen.

248
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,724
-All right, then.

249
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:31,090
Guess I'm just going to
have to force you to go.

250
00:15:31,124 --> 00:15:32,957
-Big talk there, son.

251
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,157
But you might want
to save your words

252
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,824
until after you've
had a go at me!

253
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:39,790
-Hnnn-nnnh!

254
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:41,757
-Rrrrrrrah!

255
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,257
-Aughh!

256
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:47,190
Smash!

257
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:48,190
Kakuyoku!

00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:50,157
[sound of shattering glass]

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,524
-That blade.

260
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:04,824
The assassin that Ichigo
defeated had one just like it.

261
00:16:04,857 --> 00:16:05,957
What's going on here?

262
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,924
-Not just like it, no.

263
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:11,624
Now you're seeing
its real power!

264
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:14,924
I'm wielding the
Bakkoto Kakuyoku.

265
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,790
The runt your friend
bested earlier

266
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:18,590
could barely throw up a wall.

267
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:21,524
My spiritual pressure's
a whole other story.

268
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:23,257
-I see.

269
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,724
So the blade isn't bound to
any one person then, is it?

270
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:27,190
-Precisely.

271
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,357
Rrrrraahhhh!

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,324
-Unh!

00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:43,057
-Oh, enough is enough!

274
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,590
You can't keep dodging forever.

275
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:48,757
-Mmmnnh!

276
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,390

Well, that should do it.

Hm?

yours isn't just for show.

You're pretty tough, kid.

00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,590
Very well, then.

Interesting.

kick things up a notch

You're one to talk.

You're breathing so hard

00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:21,847
You've got some thick
skin, but how long

337
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:24,814
do you honestly think
you can keep this up?

338
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:27,447
-I could ask the same of you.

339
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:29,914
Your spirit energy is
also being exhausted

340
00:20:29,947 --> 00:20:31,914
by that sword of yours.

341
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:35,281
At this rate, it's
going to consume you.

342
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:36,114
-Hah!

343
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:38,447
My spirit energy is infinite.

344
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:40,414
This is nothing for me.

345
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,781
I haven't even started yet.

346
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:54,314
Feast your eyes on the
true power of my Kakuyoku.

347
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:54,947
Rrroooorrrghhhh!

348
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:09,514
-You're just wasting your time.

349
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:11,947
These walls aren't
gonna hold me.

350
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:14,414
[frustrated sigh]

351
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:15,914
[gasp]

352
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,347
-There's no sign
of his presence.

353
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:30,081
[quiet rush of air]

354
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,014
[quiet rush of air]

355
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:39,514
-Hmmm.

356
00:21:58,514 --> 00:21:59,481
GENGA (VOICEOVER): Hah.

357
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:01,914
You're mine.

358
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,914
-Rrrraaaoaooooooah!

359
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:05,414
-Unnngh!

360
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:17,381
[music - lil' b, "orange"]

361
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:48,396
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Rukia, I

362
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:50,249
hear your enemy was
eating his own sword!

363
00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:52,182
URYU ISHIDA (VOICEOVER):
Mine is able to summon

364
00:23:52,216 --> 00:23:53,449
a fog of some kind.

365
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:54,916
YASUTORA SADO (VOICEOVER):
And mine throws up walls.

366
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:56,116
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER): Ooh!

367
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:57,449
So they build a stage,
add some smoke for effect,

368
00:23:57,482 --> 00:23:59,216
and put on a magic show!

369
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:01,449
RUKIA KUCHIKI
(VOICEOVER): Not exactly.
