00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,733
NARRATOR: In his mad quest to
become the most powerful Soul

3
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:52,333
Reaper, Third Seat Makoto Kubine
took possession of a Bakkoto

4
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:54,166
from the Kasumioji clan.

5
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,533
Lieutenant Izuru Kira challenged
Makoto in a desperate attempt

6
00:01:57,566 --> 00:02:00,533
to keep him from achieving
his goal of gaining more power

7
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:02,766
and attacking his
fellow Soul Reapers.

8
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,300
After an intense battle,
Izuru was finally

9
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,366
able to defeat Makoto.

10
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,766
Meanwhile, Ichigo
and his friends,

11
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,100
in an attempt to rescue
Princess Rurichiyo,

12
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,933
entered the Kasumioji palace.

13
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,100
There, they encountered
Toshiro Hitsugaya and squad 10,

14
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:19,233
who had been waiting for them.

15
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:19,733
-Go.

16
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:20,833
Out.

17
00:02:20,866 --> 00:02:22,200
Just leave this place to me.

18
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:22,700
-Right.

19
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:23,533
Thanks.

20
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:24,366
Let's go, Shu.

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
-Ray over the frosted
heavens, Hyorinmaru!

22
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,100
-Sever, Raika!

23
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,733
NARRATOR: As this
fight continued,

24
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:46,633
Head Captain Yamamoto was
shown the Bakkoto retrieved

25
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,100
from Makoto Kibune.

26
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,333
Armed with proof of
the Kasumioji treason,

27
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:52,266
he took immediate action.

28
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,566
-It has been brought
to my attention

29
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,733
possibly acts of trason have
been committed by the Kasumioji

30
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:58,233
clan.

31
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,766
All 13 court guards
squads are hereby

32
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
commanded to occupy
the Kasumioji

33
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,833
grounds to search for
and seize any evidence.

34
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:09,533
-Won't get by me.

35
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:10,033
Ha!

36
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:17,633
-Sorry, guys.

37
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,700
Shu, any idea
where Rurichiyo is?

38
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,033
-Uh-- but I think they might
have taken her to the back

39
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,433
tower.

40
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:28,700
That was one part of the palace
we were never allowed to visit.

41
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,433
-So, which way?

42
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:31,066
-That way.

43
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,533
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
Where are you, Rurichiyo?

44
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,000
YAMAMOTO: For generations,
to Kasumioji clan

45
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:46,366
forged heirloom swords
for the royal family

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,133
to be used for
ceremonial purposes.

47
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,600
The techniques to make these
swords were kept secret,

48
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:55,166
and for that reason,
the Kasumioji

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,833
have maintained the
right of immunity.

50
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:00,166
However, certain
factions within the clan

51
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,966
have taken advantage of
this cloak of secrecy

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,700
and have broken the taboo
against the production

53
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:09,666
of forbidden blades, such as
the one you see before us.

54
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,400
Now that we know what
they've been up to,

55
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:14,700
we must move against the
Kasumioji immediately.

56
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:15,666
-Head Captain.

57
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,233
Did you expect this
to be uncovered

58
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,600
when the substitute
Soul Reaper went--

59
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,100
-Hm.

60
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,666
I'm assigning Captain
Kuchiki of Squad Six

61
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,400
to lead the raiding party.

62
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:32,233
-Yes, sir.

63
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:38,233
[cheering]

64
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:42,700
-Reporting, sir.

65
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,000
-Hm?

66
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,000
-Head Captain Yamamoto has
given new orders to his troops.

67
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:49,566
He has directed all
13 court guard squads

68
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,366
to move in and take
control of our clan.

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
-What?

70
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:54,833
That bastard.

71
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:56,700
I knew he was too arrogant.

72
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,766
the one thing I was
worried about the most.

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,766
He assured me this
would never happen.

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
-They won't figure it out
until we're ready to move.

75
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:07,100
I can absolutely guarantee your
safety in a position of power

76
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,166
once we've taken over.

77
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Now I have no choice but to
use these to protect myself.

78
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:17,400
RANGIKU: What?

79
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,466
What do you mean a
change of orders?

80
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,666
-Yes ma'am.

81
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,333
We are now being told to
seize the Kasumjioji clan.

82
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:24,000
-What are you talking about?

83
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,000
That's the opposite of
what we were told before.

84
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:29,333
-That's the word
from headquarters.

85
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:33,166
-If that's the case, I guess
we don't have to fight anymore.

86
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,266
-Finally, some good news.

87
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,700
Huh?

88
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:37,666
-Look out!

89
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,633
He's coming in!

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,700
-Who are they?

91
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:47,100
-They're trained assassins
from Kasumioji clan.

92
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,766
I should've known.

93
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,166
Be careful, Lieutenant.

94
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,800
These men are using a forbidden
blade called the Bakkoto.

95
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,666
-Bakkoto?

96
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,933
RUKIA: It's the
secret the Kasumioji

97
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:00,333
clan has been protecting.

98
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:01,900
RANGIKU: Intersting.

99
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:05,033
Then we can use our
entire arsenal, right?

100
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,033
Growl, Heineko!

101
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,233
I don't understand.

102
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:21,200
Don't they feel any pain
when they're attacked?

103
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:28,733
Shuhei!

104
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:30,300
-The head captain
has given the order

105
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,100
to raid the clan's palace.

106
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:36,633
From what I heard, the Kasumioji
are accused of treason.

107
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,200
His orders are to assist
the substitute Soul Reaper.

108
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:49,333
-Step right up.

109
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:50,900
I'm ready for you.

110
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,833
-Their swords are very unusual.

111
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:54,900
But not much to look at.

112
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,366
Even with those weapons, you
boys are hardly a match for us.

113
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:10,500
-Don't let all the
other squads show us up.

114
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,833
Let's prove that Squad
7 has the best fighters.

115
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,733
-Looks like they were
able to make it in time.

116
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,133
-Captain Hitsugaya.

117
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,833
It appears evidence of trason
in the form of forbidden arts

118
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,933
has been found in
the Kasumioji clan.

119
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:30,466
We've been given orders
to take over immediately.

120
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,833
-Treason?

121
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:34,566
-I'm glad we're back at the
same side, Captain Hitsugaya.

122
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,600
This could have been unpleasant

123
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:39,100
-Wait.

124
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,066
Come back.

125
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,566
-Rurichiyo!

126
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:45,766
Damn.

127
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,400
Just how big is this place?

128
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,333
-It's enormous,
even for a palace.

129
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,366
-We'll have to keep
going until we find her.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,233
-Ichigo!

131
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,133
-Get back, Shu!

132
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:15,433
What the-- You've
gotta be kidding me.

133
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:17,100
You mean all their
swords are Bakkotos?

134
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,866
Unbelievable.

135
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,533
Their souls have been
taken over by their swords.

136
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:28,100
RUKIA: Ichigo.

137
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,000
Hado number 33.

138
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:30,500
Sokatsui!

139
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,066
-Rukia.

140
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,066
-Renji was able to get the
proof back to headquarters.

141
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,500
The order was given to
raid the Kasumioji clan.

142
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,633
-They're on our side?

143
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,633
-Which means that
bastard Kumoi decided

144
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,400
to arm his men with
his secret weapons.

145
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:49,133
RUKIA: That's right.

146
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,166
I can't believe they were
able to produce so many

147
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,700
of the Bakkoto.

148
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:53,800
-Rukia.

149
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,633
You and Shu go on ahead.

150
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,166
The fact that they've chosen
to beef up their defenses

151
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,566
here tells me that something
important must be up ahead.

152
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,666
-You're right.

153
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,500
You keep them busy,
and we'll slip through.

154
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:05,533
-Come on, Rukia!

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,900
We have some
unfinished business.

156
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,200
Now, which one's first?

157
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:21,533
-Enryu, I can hear the sounds
of fighting in the mansion.

158
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:26,300
Ichigo and the others must
be taking on Kumoi's army.

159
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,433
Good.

160
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,133
We need to take advantage
of this commotion

161
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,233
to rescue Lady Rurichiyo.

162
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,933
You can feel it,
can't you, Enryu?

163
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,366
The princess is
somewhere nearby.

164
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:52,655
-Man.

165
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:53,555
Nobody surrenders.

166
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:54,988
What's up with these guys?

167
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:57,522
-No matter what we do to
them, they keep charging us.

168
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,888
We're gonna have to
step up our efforts.

169
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:02,922
-I can't believe how
they're reacting.

170
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:04,322
They keep getting back up.

171
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,455
They don't even seem to
care about their own lives.

172
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:08,222
It's like they're possessed.

173
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,588
-It must be the power of
their swords, the Bakkoto,

174
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:11,955
or whatever they call them.

175
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:14,622
-Maybe so, but if they think
that power's going to stop us,

176
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,588
they're sadly mistaken.

177
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:19,022
-Captain.

178
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:19,888
What's happening?

179
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:21,688
-Just what it looks like.

180
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,455
As confusing as
this seems, this was

181
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:25,555
all part of the
head captain's plan.

182
00:10:25,588 --> 00:10:27,288
-What are you talking about?

183
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:28,622
-It's the Kaumioji clan.

184
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:31,188
They're protected by
their aristocracy.

185
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:33,122
Under ordinary
circumstances, nobody

186
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:34,455
could interfere with them.

187
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:37,288
-The head captain had received
information some time ago

188
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:39,055
that the clan was up
to no good, but he

189
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:41,288
had no way to go after them.

190
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:44,255
By chance, Ichigo came along and
got involved in their affairs,

191
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:45,388
so he used him.

192
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:46,522
-Without telling him?

193
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:47,988
-He couldn't take the chance.

194
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:52,555
It shows how much he trusts
in Ichigo's abilities.

195
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:54,488
He's a wily old fox.

196
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:01,455
-Master Kumoi?

197
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:03,355
Why are you dressed like that?

198
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:04,222
-Silence.

199
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:06,955
Man your posts and keep alert.

200
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:07,988
-Reporting, sir.

201
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:09,788
The central gate
has been breached,

202
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:12,922
and the main building is now
occupied by the Soul Reapers.

203
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:14,788
Fighting is still
going on in the garden,

204
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:17,322
but we're not going to be able
to hold them back much longer.

205
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:19,055
-I'm aware of that.

206
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:22,422
All I need at the moment is for
my forces to buy me some time.

207
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:26,755
Just a few minutes until I get
inside the Bakkoto workshop.

208
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:28,522
Then we'll be fine.

209
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,822
-Sir.

210
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,055
The Soul Reapers have broken
into the Bakkoto workshop.

211
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,155
-They what?

212
00:11:33,188 --> 00:11:34,355
That's impossible.

213
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:36,022
The barrier to that
building was bestowed on us

214
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:37,388
by the royal family.

215
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:39,688
It cannot be breached
by a mere Soul Reaper.

216
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:56,055
[confused mumbling]

217

-I'm Jushiro
Ukitake of Squad 13.

220
00:12:08,055 --> 00:12:09,455
Everyone remain where you are.

221
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:12,555
We're going to conduct an
inspection of these premises.

222
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:14,888
Resistance will be
dealt with severely.

223
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:17,755
[whimpering]

224
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:23,122
-Forget it, boys.

225
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:24,422
All the exits are covered.

226
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:29,188
The jig's up, fellas.

227
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:34,022
There's no way out, so you
might as well start talking.

228
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:35,222
-Sui-Feng.

229
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,855
Fine work back there.

230
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:39,055
You did a good job breaking
through that barrier.

231
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:40,188
-Thanks.

232
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:42,355
But really, it was very strong.

233
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:45,488
We couldn't have begun to break
through without your insight.

234
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:47,155
How did you find
the vulnerabilities

235
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,688
in the barrier's
composition that

236
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:51,455
allowed us to breach
its weaknesses?

237
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:54,288
-I got a blueprint from a man
who was angry at the Kasumioji

238
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:56,622
clan for interfering
with his business.

239
00:12:56,655 --> 00:12:58,688
-We're surrounded.

240
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:01,355
Curse those Soul Reapers.

241
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:03,888
-Master Kumoi, we have
nowhere else to run.

242
00:13:03,922 --> 00:13:05,755
-I'm aware of that.

243
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:06,755
The princess!

244
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:09,688
Go quickly and bring her to me.

245
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,588
We have no options left.

246
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:13,122
We'll have to use
her as a shield.

247
00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:26,255
[grunting]

248
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:26,755
-Incredible.

249
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:30,522
Wait.

250
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:40,422
Listen, you guys.

251
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:42,022
You'll die if you keep fighting!

252
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,355
-Huh?

253
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:54,788
We've reached a dead end.

254
00:13:54,822 --> 00:13:55,755
-I don't get it.

255
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:57,022
What were all
those guards trying

256
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:59,522
to protect if
there's nobody here?

257
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:00,455
-Huh?

258
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:00,955
What's that?

[mumbling]

260

SHU: Those girls are
Rurichiyo's attendants!

261
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:13,488
-They kidnapped her.

262
00:14:13,522 --> 00:14:16,422
Some horrible men took
Lady Rurichiyo away.

263
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,722
-So I was right.

264
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,455
Rurichiyo was here, wasn't she?

265
00:14:19,488 --> 00:14:20,755
-Yes.

266
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,655
She returned a while ago,
and was locked in this wing.

267
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:24,122
No one was allowed
to speak to her.

268
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,288
-We were told to stay
here and look after her,

269
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:27,955
but we weren't allowed
to leave, either.

270
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:29,588
-How were they able
to get out of here?

271
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:31,388
-They used a secret passageway.

272
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:34,722
The man standing guard
opened that wall over there.

273
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:36,022
-A hidden escape route.

274
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:37,022
It's heading up.

275
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,522
There must be a
hatchway near the roof.

276
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:39,222
-You're right.

277
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:39,955
We better move.

278
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:42,322
Quickly.

-We've been waiting for you.

00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:51,322
Where have you
been all this time?

283
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:52,555
-Everywhere.

284
00:14:52,588 --> 00:14:54,222
There were many things
that required my attention.

285
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:56,488
-Under the circumstances,
only one thing

286
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,155
should have required
your attention.

287
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,755
Squads from the 13 Court
Guards have stormed the palace.

288
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:05,355
As of now, they've taken
control of most of the property.

289
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:06,322
-Is that right?

290
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:07,888
-You have to diffuse
the situation.

291
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:10,122
Go to the front lines and
talk to their commanders.

quite a problem.

-What?

294
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:14,688
What kind of problem?

00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:16,455
We're not idiots.

00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:19,388
We hear stories from the
servants and the soldiers.

Don't you think we
know what you've

You, princess, are nothing

You have no more power.

00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:23,788
What is it you are so afraid of?

327
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:25,288
Speak up, you coward!

328
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:28,555
-Go away, princess!

329
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,122
-How dare you.

330
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,655
I want to know why I'm being
treated in this manner.

331
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:34,555
Explain yourself.

332
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:36,422
-Don't you ever stop talking?

333
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:36,922
Come on.

334
00:16:39,922 --> 00:16:40,488
RUKIA: Ichigo!

335
00:16:40,522 --> 00:16:41,222
-Huh?

336
00:16:41,255 --> 00:16:42,288
Rukia, Shou.

337
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:43,322
There you are.

338
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:45,655
-Lady Rurichiyo is
in this building.

339
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:46,588
-What?

340
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,022
So she was here, after all.

341
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:49,055
-Yes.

342
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:50,088
-She was brought up
in this direction

343
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,955
through a secret passage.

344
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:57,155
-Then she has to be-- there!

345
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:57,655
Rurichiyo!

346
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:10,316
-Enough!

347
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,049
Stop mistreating
me this instant!

348
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,216
-Will you shut up?

349
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:14,949
You seem to forget
that you're my hostage.

350
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:17,416
You should be thankful
I'm allowing you to live.

351
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:18,549
-Well, excuse me.

352
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,483
I'm just a mindless hostage.

353
00:17:20,516 --> 00:17:23,649
I have no idea what I
should be thankful for.

354
00:17:23,683 --> 00:17:25,149
-If that's the
case, then perhaps I

355
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:26,483
should give you a little lesson.

356
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,716
ICHIGO: Get away from her!

357
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:42,949
-Who said that?

358
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:45,883
RURICHIYO: Ichigo!

359
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,983
-Sorry I couldn't get
here sooner, Rurichiyo.

360
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:50,283
-I'm sorry, too.

361
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:51,983
You're very late.

362
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:52,916
What took you so long?

363
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:55,149
I was getting tired of waiting.

364
00:17:55,183 --> 00:17:57,316
As my bodyguard, you
should be more prompt.

365
00:17:57,349 --> 00:17:58,949
-Well, then, don't worry.

366
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:01,983
I'm here to rescue you now.

367
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:03,083
-Kill this fool.

368
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:08,183
-I think not!

369
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,483
-Damn him.

370
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,916
-I'm taking Rurichiyo
back, you traitor.

371
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,416
-Oh, really?

372
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:23,249
-Lady Rurichiyo!

373
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:24,649
-Rurichiyo!

374
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:25,916
-Miss Kuchiki!

375
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:27,349
And Shu, as well.

376
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:30,183
KUMOI: Don't you move.

377
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:30,916
-You bastard.

378
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:31,416
-Rurichiyo.

379
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:37,316
-I'll cut her throat if
you attempt to approach.

380
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,083
-Oh, no.

381
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:39,516
-Damn.

382
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:41,449
-Tell me something, Kumoi.

383
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:43,549
Why are you doing all of this?

384
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,449
Why did you even develop
a weapon like the Bakkoto?

385
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:48,649
-I don't have to explain.

386
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:50,749
I have my reasons.

387
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:53,449
-He was planning to use the
Bakkoto to disrupt the Soul

388
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:56,016
Society, and in the midst
of the chaos that followed,

389
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,416
he was going to grab power as
the leader of the nobility.

390
00:18:58,449 --> 00:18:59,849
-Shut up.

391
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:01,583
-You are sick.

392
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:04,716
That's the reason you did
all this to Rurichiyo?

393
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:06,416
-Eliminate the opposition.

394
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:09,916
That's one of the primary
rules of achieving victory.

395
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,683
-Unforgivable.

396
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:14,383
-Fortunately for me, I
don't need your forgiveness,

397
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,416
you half-wit.

398
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:18,316
-Kumoi, you're delusional.

399
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:21,316
It's absurd that you aspire
to lead the nobility.

400
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:23,816
-I will be the most
powerful ruler in history,

401
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:26,483
and I assure you
nothing will stop me.

402
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:30,983
I may already be old, but
will still savor my triumph.

403
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:31,983
-Rurichiyo!

404
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:34,983
[laughter]

405
00:19:35,016 --> 00:19:36,983
-Stop it!

406
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:37,483
-Huh?

407
00:19:49,183 --> 00:19:50,016
-It's Captain Amagai.

408
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:56,849
-I'm surprised you
could find this place.

409
00:19:56,883 --> 00:19:59,583
-Yes.

410
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,583
RUKIA: From what we
can tell, it appears

411
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:03,349
that Kumoi has
been the mastermind

412
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:05,216
behind this entire plot.

413
00:20:05,249 --> 00:20:06,216
-So it would seem.

414
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:11,949
-Captain, are you all right?

415
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,349
-Ichigo!

416
00:20:29,216 --> 00:20:31,183
[scream]

417
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:39,849
IHCHIGO: Shusuke,
why did you do that?

418
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:44,983
-Why do you think?

419
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:46,083
RUKIA: I don't understand.

420
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:47,749
Now that you've
killed the mastermind,

421
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:49,149
how are we ever
going to find out

422
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:51,049
the truth of what
he was planning?

423
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,083
-What truth do you mean?

424
00:20:57,649 --> 00:20:59,683
ICHIGO: What's going on here?

425
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,749
What did you just do?

426
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:08,583
-You've been most helpful,
Substitute Soul Reaper.

427
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:10,216
-What do you mean,
I've been helpful?

428
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:19,749
-Ichigo!

429
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:20,249
-Rurichiyo!

430
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,149
-See you around.

431
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,249
-I don't get it.

432
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:32,149
What the hell just
happened here?

433
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:37,216
-Tell me why-- I
followed orders.

434
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:40,116
I did everything
you asked of me.

435
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:41,583
I don't understand.

436
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:43,049
Why did you betray me?

437
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:46,916
-Wait a minute.

438
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:54,016
-Kumoi and Captain Amagai
were working-- it couldn't be.

439
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:54,883
-Dammit.

440
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,216
What the hell was that?

441
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:57,483
What's going on?

442
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:20,278
[theme music]

443
00:23:48,311 --> 00:23:51,611
AMAGAI: Out past the
fields lay darkness.

444
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:55,611
A life that faded away,
feelings that we're left behind.

445
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:58,211
Many years have passed
since that moment,

446
00:23:58,245 --> 00:24:02,211
and now I have come
back to this place.
