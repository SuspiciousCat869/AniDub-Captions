they refused to sever their

And the Soul Reapers themselves
are even more corrupt.

They selfishly created the
Bounts in the beginning,

-Don't worry.

170
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:02,033
The Crests are hidden
far apart from each other

171
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:05,666
inside the Seireitei, so if I
detonate a single one of them,

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,533
the explosion won't have
any effect on the others.

long to get here.

190
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:16,819
Anyway, right now Ukitake
and the other Soul Reapers

191
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:20,753
are busy sealing all of the
Crests in the Seireitei.

However, It's going to
take a while to finish it.

now is, will they

be detonated before we
have time to seal them?

before he sets them off?

If Kariya unleashes
the Jokai Crest,

we must be ready to seal
it away with my Shunko

Ichigo thinks of himself

as being similar to the Bounts.

Before he gained his
Soul Reaper powers,

292
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:22,153
what he desired most
was the strength

00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:24,553
to protect those close to him.

294
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:29,186
He got the power he wanted,
but from that point on he

295
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:32,119
was pulled between
two worlds-- the world

the Soul Society.

-Bounts are human too,
but not like any other.

303
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:57,186
They are of two worlds, and
they have suffered in both.

304
00:17:57,219 --> 00:18:01,586
That's why Kariya can only be
stopped by Ichigo because he

305
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,519
bears the same burden.

stay here and trust him.

Your friends aren't
any different.

334
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:26,519
Over time, even
people who you trusted

335
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:29,519
will come to fear
your power and they'll

336
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:33,119
begin to distance
themselves from you.

337
00:19:33,153 --> 00:19:37,153
Where is the logic in protecting
disloyal people like that?

338
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:38,553
-It's not about logic!

339
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:39,686
It's what I feel.

340
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:42,219
I protect them
because I want to!

341
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:44,486
For them, I'd even risk my soul!

342
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,553
-Then you will lose your soul!

343

-There he goes.

344
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:50,053
He activated it.

345
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:52,686
Byakuya, we have to seal it!

346
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:54,686
Byakuya, what are
you waiting for?

347
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:56,686
He's unleashing it now.

348
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:57,186
Byakuya!

349
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:02,586

00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:51,453
I am a little disappointed.

355
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:54,753
I suppose I won't get
to see whether or not

356
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,219
you walked on the
same path that I have.

I'm so glad to
see you! (CRYING-)

let me heal your wounds.

-We can do that later.

In the end, Kariya decided
to submit on his own.

his plan from the beginning?

-Who knows.

Seemed like, what he wanted was
to bring his never-ending life

382

I sealed away ten.

that many Jokai Crests?

me here for a while.
