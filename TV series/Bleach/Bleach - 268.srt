00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,133
Hey, Ulquiorra, how's
it going?

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,700
We are going to drag her
back down from that palace!

4
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:22,733
Orihimeeee!

5
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:11,762
Goodbye.

6
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:15,029
[grunting]

7
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:19,396
I can do this...I can see
all his moves and still
react in time...

8
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:20,396
Watch!

9
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,696
Mm!

10
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:24,962
Uh!

11
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,562
[roaring]

12
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:39,596
The last time that we
battled together, I couldn't
read any of your moves at all.

13
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:43,729
So why am I able to
read your moves this time?

14
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:47,129
Actually, I think it's
because you've become
more human.

15
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:57,929
Did you say that... I've
become more human?

16
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:01,829
I see.

17
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:05,929
You must feel very proud
just being able to keep up
at this level.

18
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:08,729
Let's see how long
that will last you.

19
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:15,996
[gasping]

20
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:22,329
Uh!

21
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:23,729
Not a chance!

22
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:54,296
Hey, are you
coming or what?

23
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:59,429
I don't know, Loly.
This feels like a bad
idea.

24
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:02,329
I don't want anything
to do with her anymore.

25
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,062
You heard what he said,
didn't you? Lord Aizen
couldn't have been
clearer.

26
00:04:17,862 --> 00:04:21,496
This is our chance. It's
the only shot we've got.

27
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:26,162
Just you wait. We are
going to find her...

28
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:30,996
... and then... we are
going to drag her back
down from that palace!

29
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:45,696
What do you think
you're doing, girl?

30
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:47,596
[gasping]

31
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:51,729
Why would you even bother
trying to save him now?

32
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:55,596
What do you mean?
Why wouldn't I?

33
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:02,729
He's your friend, is he?
And yet, you didn't protect
him from my first attack...

34
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:08,129
Why did you hesitate?

35
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:10,796
What?! You don't
understand, I--!

36
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:16,496
You actually don't know.
Then let me enlighten you.
The truth is--

37
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:17,729
<i>Shut up.</i>

38
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:22,096
You sure do love the
sound of your own voice.

39
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:25,062
Quit picking apart every
little thing she does or
says.

40
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:28,896
None of what you're
saying matters anyway,
all right?

41
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:32,662
Orihime, thanks
for stepping in.

42
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:33,962
Uh!

43
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:37,662
Find cover. It's gonna
get too dangerous for
you in here.

44
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:40,996
Just be careful.

45
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:50,362
You know, it's funny. I
didn't peg you for much
of a talker.

46
00:05:51,196 --> 00:05:54,529
But you're a regular
chatterbox, aren't ya?

47
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:07,162
A Getsuga. You still don't
get it, do you? That won't
have any effect on me.

48
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:16,096

[yelling and grunting]

51
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:35,029
Huh?

52
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:39,096
He's wrapped a Getsuga
around his blade instead
of discharging it.

53
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:42,762
So that his sword
strike has the strength
of a Getsuga.

54
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,962
[yelling]

55
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:52,129
Not good enough.

[yelling]

57
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:08,762
I suppose you feel
that you're awfully clever.
Yet, you've learned nothing.

58
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:14,496
You forgot that even when
you had your mask on, you
were unable to defeat me
with Getsuga.

59
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:17,062
Wield it how you may,
it won't matter.

60
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:20,296
Using the Getsuga without
a mask is useless.

61
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:25,662

Uh!

64
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:42,029
Ichigo.

65
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:52,562
[gasping]

66
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:57,762
Well, well, well,
what have we here?

67
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,829
[grunting]

68
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:07,396

00:08:09,662 --> 00:08:11,929
Uh! Orihime?!

70
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:15,262
Hey, what's the
matter with you?

71
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:18,996
There might not be that
many of them left, but we're
still in the middle of a
battle right now.

72
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:20,629
Yeah, but...
Orihime.

73
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:23,129
What about her?
Ichigo will take
care of her.

74
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:26,596
I don't know. He's up
against an immense amount
of Spiritual Pressure...

75
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:28,696
[grunting]

76
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:30,696
Damn it.

77
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,096
Better wrap it up
quick, then. We don't
wanna be too late.

78
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:45,196
<i>Uryu!</i>

79
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:50,796
Sorry it took me so long.
Mayuri's treatments took
longer than expected.

80
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:55,562
Well, get a load of you,
it looks like you made a
complete recovery, huh?

81
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,329
Uryu, we've gotta
get moving.

82
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:59,296
Yeah, I figured
as much.

83
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:03,196
Man, what the hell is
Ichigo doing up there?

84
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:05,462
Hmm.

85
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:11,129
[gasping]
[giggling]

86
00:09:12,296 --> 00:09:14,862
Hey there, sweetheart.
Remember me?

87
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:18,229
Huh. I
guess not.

88
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:28,896
Aww, that's all right. I
mean, I can't say I'm
surprised, really.

89
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:32,196
I'm so ordinary, why
would the little freak
of nature trouble her

90
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:34,429
precious mind with
the likes of me?

91
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:36,862
[trembling]

92
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:41,729
That's about to change,
though. Say goodbye to your
ivory tower, hun. Your little
reign is over.

93
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:44,996
[gasping]
Orihime!

94
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:47,296
Who the hell are they?!

95
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:52,262
Stay back! Don't you
even think about it,
you hear me?!

96
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:54,796
Any closer and I'll
gouge her eyes out!

97
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:58,296
Getsuga!

98
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:04,029
Ulquiorra!

99
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:08,196
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea. I wasn't
acting out of a desire to
save you.

100
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:12,329
Out of the way!

101
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,929
I'm not going anywhere!

102
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:18,396
Ichigo!

103
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:24,629
Aw, that's a real shame.
Guess your knight in shining
armor, doesn't have what it
takes.

104
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:29,496
All right then! Tear this
tramp to pieces, Menoly,
and take it slow!

105
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:36,562
Menoly?

106
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,429
I don't want to.
There isn't any point.

107
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:42,896
No point?! What the
hell are you talking
about?!

108
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:47,029
Think about it. This
girl has the ability to
heal any wound, remember?

109
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:49,662
We'd just be
wasting our time.

110
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:53,296
And anyway, it's not like
it would make us feel any
less empty.

111
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,162
Oh, so what, you're
having a sudden change
of heart

112
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:01,229
all because this simpering
little idiot saved your life,
is that it?

113
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:02,729
Of course not!

114
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:03,829
[grunting]

115
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:05,162
You coward!

116
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:08,996
Forget it, then. I'll
handle her on my own.

117
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:12,029
[trembling]

118
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:12,829
Loly, wait!

119
00:11:12,862 --> 00:11:14,129
Quiet!!

120
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:17,362
[whimpering]

121
00:11:17,396 --> 00:11:23,829
Lord Aizen doesn't give a
damn about you. You're no
use to him now, he said it
himself. Got it?

122
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:28,762
I can do whatever
I want with you.

123
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:31,896
Without fear of
Lord Aizen's wrath.

124
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:36,762
You're a dead woman,
you just don't know
it yet.

125
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:42,562
And once I'm finally
finished with you, I'm
going to reach inside
your corpse...

126
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:46,129
... and tear out everything
you stole from me!

127
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:49,096
Orihime!

128
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:51,696
Getsuga...

129
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:53,229
... Tensho!

130
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:15,729
I said, get
out of the way!

131
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,029
If you want a new opponent,
you'll have to kill me first.

132
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:21,596
Finish me, if you
think you're capable.

133
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:24,462
Shut up!
And move!

134
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:29,229

00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,562
Get away from her!

Huh?

00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:47,296
What?!

143
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:49,529
What's that?

00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:03,596

Ha!

<i>What's the matter?</i>

150
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:39,478
Tell me again... what
you were saying before.

151
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:44,078
Was it that all of my
subordinates have
fallen?

152
00:13:44,378 --> 00:13:45,678
Uh!

153
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:50,178
Hm. But that's all right.
Prattle on as much as you
like.

154
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:07,245
[laughing]
Oh, you should see the
look on your face.

155
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:15,412
Something's happening
with Master Ulquiorra.
Could this be...?

156
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:20,745
Another massive amount of
Spiritual Pressure has
appeared near Ichigo...

157
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,012
What could be happening
this time?

158
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:29,878
Hey, Ulquiorra, how's
it going!

159
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,745
I thought I'd come and
back you up. Need a hand?

160
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:37,612
You can't be serious. I
don't need any help and
certainly not from you.

161
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:39,912
What?

162
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,445
It's that guy again.

163
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:48,812
[chuckling]
Ah, don't be such a
stick in the mud.

164
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:50,878
Besides, this Soul
Reaper kid,

165
00:14:50,912 --> 00:14:53,945
he's lookin' a lot
stronger than he used
to, am I right?

166
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:56,278
Let me have
a crack at him!

167
00:14:57,912 --> 00:14:59,412
You're looking well.

168
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:03,412
It appears that you've
made a decent recovery.

169
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:08,845
But I'll pass. There's
nothing for you to do
here, Yammy.

170
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:09,778
Huh?

171
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:12,078
Go back and get a
little more bed rest.

172
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,812
Or find some other Soul
Reapers captains to play
with.

173
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:16,545
What are you
talking about?!

174
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:19,378
You're not gonna hog all
the fun for yourself now,
are ya?!

175
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:27,412
You know how you get
once you've entered that
state... You become too
greedy. The answer is no.

176
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:30,512
Ah, come on, lighten up,
Ullquiorra.

177
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:31,845
<i>Yammy...!</i>

178
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:33,078
Huh?!

179
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:35,812
Uh! Look, don't mind us!
We're not involved in any
of this!

180
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:37,778
We'll just get out
of your hair, okay?

181
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,312
Come on, Loly,
let's go!

182
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:43,245
You have got to be
joking! After we've
come this far?!

183
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:44,145
<i>Loly!</i>

184
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:46,345
We're in over our
heads, OK?

185
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,512
[screaming]

186
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:51,278
Menoly!!

187
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:57,312
Hey, Ulquiorra,
what gives, huh?

188
00:15:57,345 --> 00:16:01,845
If you wanted to be alone,
then what the hell are all
these girls doing up here
with you?

189
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,578
Why don't
you ask them?

190
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:05,978
Huh. Yeah, I
guess you're right.

191
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:08,778
So, what's the story
with you two?

192
00:16:08,812 --> 00:16:12,578
Why would a couple of
losers like you come
slithering out of your hole?

193
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:15,678
You're not
welcome here.

194
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:18,212
Here. Let me help
you find your way.

195
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,545
Get lost!

196
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:23,112
[grunting]

197
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:27,745
Are you kidding me?!
Don't tell me you're
done already!

198
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,145
Heh. Pathetic. I
didn't even break
a sweat.

199
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:37,178
Hey, Ulquiorra! These
two are a couple of duds!
I'm gonna come join you
over there!

200
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:42,212
[struggling]
Yammy, you bastard.

201
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,178
What are you
lookin' at?

202
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:50,945
Heh. I'm sure you're
getting a kick out
of this.

203
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:57,045
I was just about to
kill you... now look
at me.

204
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:01,545
Go ahead.
Laugh it up.

205
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:05,145
[gasping]

206
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:08,912
What are you doing?!
Get away from me! I
don't need your pity!

207
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:13,845
What's the matter with
you?! I mean, are you
out of your mind, or what?!

208
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:21,712
I was an inch away from
killing you, you little fool!
Why are you--- why are you
trying to help me?!

209
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:35,712
I don't understand.
What the hell are you?

210
00:17:37,978 --> 00:17:39,545
[growling]

211
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:41,945
[screaming]

212
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,445
Orihime!

213
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:51,412
This is getting old. I've
already told you, you're
going to have to deal with
me first.

214
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:54,145
What? You're
still alive?!

215
00:17:54,178 --> 00:17:59,278
You'd be better off dead
than to be wasting time
making friends with a human!

216
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:04,145
Ah, whatever. I think I'd
rather play with you! You
seem like you're more fun!

217
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:05,978
Leave her alone!

218
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:08,578
[chuckling]

219
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:11,612
[gasping]

220
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,212
[gasping]

221
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:18,645
Hmmm?

222
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:20,845
What the hell?

223
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:27,745
Now where were could you
have possibly been hiding
that dagger. Naughty little
thing, aren't ya?

224
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:30,845
You got a problem?

225
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:35,745
I don't give a damn about
you, okay? I just don't
wanna owe you any favors!

226
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:40,178
I'm sorry. Did you want
me to backhand your ass
again?

227
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:45,545
Shut the hell up Yammy!
Keep your filthy hands
off my catch, you hear
me?!

228
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:49,212
Poison! Escolopendra!!

229
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:04,712
I don't wanna hear one
more word out of you,
you dumb prick.

230
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:10,345
I didn't come all this way
to let a complete idiot like
you defeat me!

231
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:12,345
Ahhh!

232
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:17,312
Hmmm?

233
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:25,845
All of you are dead...!
You, Ulquiorra, everyone!

234
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:30,745
I'll cover you in so
much poison; there'll
be nothing left of you
but a reduced pile of scum!

235
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:34,545
Haaaaaa!

236
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,478
Hmm-hmm!

237
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:43,545
Heh.

238
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:44,678
[gasping]

239
00:19:44,712 --> 00:19:47,445
[screaming]

240
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:50,278
[gasping]

241
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:52,812
Hmm!

242
00:19:52,845 --> 00:20:02,178
[struggling]

243
00:20:02,812 --> 00:20:04,312
Wait! Don't
hurt her!

244
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:05,312
Get back!

245
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:06,912
[gasping]

246
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:11,378
Nothing's changed. I
still don't care about
you.

247
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,978
I hate you more
than anything.

248
00:20:18,712 --> 00:20:20,378
Heh.

249
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:23,145
[groaning]

250
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:27,645
Man, for such a dainty
little thing, you sure do
have an awful big mouth,
girl.

251
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:29,578
[struggling]

252
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:36,578
Damn it. Screw you. Think
I give a damn what you say?
You're pathetic. Ya know that?

253
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:39,078
Huh?! What'd
you call me?!

254
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:43,112
You heard me... you
pathetic scumbag.

255
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:45,412
[growling]

256
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,512
[laughing]

257
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:53,812
What were you saying?
Couldn't hear ya!

258
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:01,712
Hmmm. Well, that's no
fun, she already died
on me.

259
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:04,512
Knew this was gonna be
a waste of my time.

260
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:09,412
No!

261
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:12,278
Hmm? What, you got
something to say?!

262
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:15,978
Huh. Hey! Ulquiorra!

263
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:19,412
What's the deal with
this one?! Can I kill
her yet?

264
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,312
[gasping]

265
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,178
Don't touch her!

266
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:24,312
[grunting]

267
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:26,345

268
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:27,812
Orihime!!

00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:30,378
[chuckling]

00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:32,978

272
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:42,145
Hmmm?

273
00:21:47,212 --> 00:21:51,945
[groaning]

274
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:56,712
Uryu!

275
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:58,645
Don't let yourself
get distracted.

276
00:21:59,312 --> 00:22:03,012
You just focus on your
own opponent, Ichigo.
I'll deal with him.

277
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:07,845
Don't you worry. I can
handle his friend on my own.

278
00:23:45,597 --> 00:23:48,197
How did Uryu get all the
way up to the Fifth
tower?

279
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:51,231
<i>Making that kind of</i>
<i>entrance? I'm gonna</i>
<i>guess he flew.</i>

280
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:56,431
Oh! Wait! I've heard there's
a tribe in the World of the
Living that gets around by
riding on broomsticks!

281
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:57,564
<i>Bingo!</i>

282
00:23:57,597 --> 00:24:00,231
<i>Uh, yeah, I'm a Quincy,</i>
<i>not a witch, OK?</i>
