-Yeah.

7
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:38,933
Is it nearby?

8
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:46,400
Guess I'm on call.

9
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:47,600
-Wait.

10
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:48,533
-Huh?

11
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:49,200
-It's gone.

12
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:53,900
-What?

13
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:56,033
Don't tell me it's
another false alarm.

spiritual pressure.

-What's happening, Ichigo?

ICHIGO: You guys
wanna stay with me?

20
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:07,381
-Care to explain
what's going on?

21
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:09,481
Well, it's all pretty hush hush.

22
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:11,914
We're both on
special assignment.

23
00:03:11,947 --> 00:03:14,114
-Excuse me?

24
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:15,714
-The other day,
some Hollows that

25
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:18,314
had been used for experiments
were being transported,

26
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,214
and a few of them got away.

27
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,181
On top that, one of
them appears to have

28
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:23,647
snuck into the
world of the living.

29
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:32,981
-OK?

30
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:34,081
And?

31
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,281
-That's our assignment.

32
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:37,047
We were sent here to
recapture that Hollow

33
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:40,047
and make sure it gets
back to the Soul Society.

34
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:42,514
-How come they didn't just have
us take care of the problem

35
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:44,647
here on our end?

36
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:46,547
-Apparently the information
from this Hollow

37
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:50,647
is very valuable, so they wanted
it to be recaptured unharmed.

38
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,714
That's what we were told.

39
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:54,481
-This won't take long.

40
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:57,447
We will be counting on your help
while we track this thing down.

41
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:58,181
-Help?

42
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:00,114
Help in what way?

43
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:01,081
-Many ways.

44
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:02,981
Like, for starters,
we'd appreciate

45
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:05,081
if you'd put us up for a week.

46
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:06,514
-Wait a minute, you guys.

47
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:11,047
Just who do you think
you are, dropping

48
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:12,614
in on these people
out of the blue?

49
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:15,514
You can't ask for a favor
like this without my input.

50
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,147
-And who do you think you are,
dropping in out of the blue?

51
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:20,147
-You have some nerve,
talking like that to me.

52
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:23,681
This is a love nest where Rukia
and I can admire each other.

53
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:25,514
You people need to get lost.

54
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:26,414
Wait a minute.

55
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:26,981
Who turned out the lights.

56
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:28,114
What's going on?

57
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:30,147
-What do you think about
their request, Ichigo?

58
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:31,281
-Huh?

59
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,981
KON: I'm not just some
pretty face, you know.

60
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:35,447
-Sorry guys, but there's
not enough room at my place

61
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:37,814
to put up the two of
you, even for a week.

62
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,547
And as I recall,
you once said you

63
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:42,214
had no intention of ever
asking me for favors.

64
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:43,314
So what's the deal?

65
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:44,981
Why the sudden change of heart?

66
00:04:45,014 --> 00:04:47,881
-Yeah, but we didn't expect--

67
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:48,814
-Anyway.

68
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:49,847
I'm not gonna be
able to help you.

69
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,681
-It says out indefinitely.

70
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:06,514
-Oh boy.

71
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:07,847
Wonder where he could have gone.

72
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:11,481
-So, is there anybody else
you could possibly stay with?

73
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:14,081
-Well, now, to be
perfectly honest about it--

74
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,047
-Nobody.

75
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,114
At all.

76
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:18,147
-Um, there is one
choice as a last resort.

77
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,747
-Anyway, that's the story.

78
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,147
Do you think these
two guys could

79
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,881
stay with you again
for about a week?

80
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:35,114
-OK, well, good luck.

81
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:36,581
-Hang on a minute!

82
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:37,714
Where are you going?

83
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:39,514
You can't leave me alone
with these two thugs!

84
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,681
You act like it's as simple
as passing the soy sauce!

85
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:43,614
-What's the big deal?

86
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:44,714
I mean, you put
up with these two

87
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:46,581
when they visited here
before, didn't you?

88
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:48,114
You'll manage somehow.

89
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,614
-What do you mean, somehow?

90
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:51,414
You think these guys
are friends of mine?

91
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:53,047
-Thanks for the hospitality.

92
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,914
Long time no see, old pal.

93
00:05:57,614 --> 00:06:00,047
-Hey, they obviously
miss being around you.

94
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:01,314
Talk to you later.

95
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:03,314
What do you mean they
miss being around me.

96
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:04,447
They're threatening me.

97
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:05,847
Have you gone blind?

98
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:09,014
The bald headed guy is a
threat just standing there!

99
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,647
-I'm not bald, remember?

100
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:12,414
-Oh, yeah, I forgot.

101
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:13,781
I'm very sorry.

102
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:15,214
MIZUHO: Keigo, what's going on?

103
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:17,547
What are you doing out there?

104
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:20,347
Don't you know what time it is?

105
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,914
You know how the
neighbors get if you

106
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:23,347
make too much
noise at this hour.

107
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:37,314
Ah!

108
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:39,481
You've come back.

109
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:40,314
Darling.

110
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:41,747
-Did you just call him darling?

111
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:44,581
Why are you treating
him like family?

112
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:45,514
-I've been waiting.

113
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,381
I left the front
door open for you.

114
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:49,647
-How can you lie to
the man like that?

115
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:52,014
Why are you playing
the devoted wife?

116
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:53,914
-Would you hold it
down over there?

117
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,614
I'm trying to have a reunion
with my future husband!

118
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:59,147
-I don't want you to
have a reunion with him.

119
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,281
I think he's a nutcase.

120
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:02,414
And I don't want him to
be your future husband.

121
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:03,347
-It's all right.

122
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,214
I know this man
is hurt, and lost,

123
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:06,814
and has many flaws
in his character,

124
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:09,914
but I accept him as he
is without reservation.

125
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:13,114
That's the kind of woman I
wanna be when I'm around him.

126
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,014
-I don't care what
kind of woman you

127
00:07:15,047 --> 00:07:16,414
wanna be around this psycho.

128
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:19,014
I don't give a rat's about
your feelings for him.

129
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:21,714
You should ask yourself why
you feel anything at all!

130
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:24,447
-I have asked myself
about that, and I

131
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:26,247
guess I'm just in love
with his shaved head.

132
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:27,381
-Are you kidding me?

133
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,014
That's the whole basis
for your attraction?

134
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:30,747
He's not shaven, he's bald!

135
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:31,581
-I keep telling you.

136
00:07:31,614 --> 00:07:33,381
I'm not bald, big mouth.

137
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:34,647
Have you got it?

138
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:35,581
-Yes, of course, sir.

139
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:37,914
I don't know what
I was thinking.

140
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:39,947
YUMICHIKA (VOICEOVER):
This is getting old fast.

141
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:48,081
-His family is so
loud and crazy.

142
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:51,614
That's one of the reasons
I didn't wanna come here.

143
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,214
-It should be all right.

144
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:55,881
We'll both be away from
the house most of the time.

145
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:57,881
And even though it's
a special assignment,

146
00:07:57,914 --> 00:08:01,347
we should be able to
finish up in about a week.

147
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,514
-I hope you're right.

148
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:12,481
MIZUHO (VOICEOVER):
The last time,

149
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:15,581
he left before I had a chance to
establish a solid relationship.

150
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:17,347
This time, I have
to get him used

151
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:19,047
to the idea of the
two of us as a couple

152
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,747
before he has to go back home.

153
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:22,747
and I think I know how.

154
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:28,214
-Oh my.

155
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:29,781
This is delicious.

156
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:30,747
-Thanks, darling.

157
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:34,614
I made it just for you.

158
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:38,781
Here's your wallet, your cell
phone, your handkerchief,

159
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:41,781
your keys, and your train pass.

160
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:42,647
-Thanks, my dear.

161
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:46,781
Hello?

162
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:48,047
I'm home.

163
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,847
-Welcome back.

164
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:51,747
Which would you
like to have first?

165
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,047
Dinner or a bath?

166
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:55,847
I wasn't sure, so
I prepared both.

167
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:57,547
-I'm such a lucky man.

168
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,714
You're so thoughtful.

169
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,147
Really.

170
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:04,347
Without you, my life
would have no meaning.

171
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:04,847
-Darling.

172
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:10,014
Yes!

173
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:13,414
I'm calling this operation
thoughtful woman turns her man

174
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:15,881
right into putty.

175
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:16,881
It's perfect.

176
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:19,347
This plan is flawless.

177
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:22,314
[screechy giggling]

178
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,776
-Well, good morning,
my darling. you're

179
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,476
just in time for breakfast.

180
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,743
-Excuse me?

181
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:36,776
Barbecue in the morning?

182
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,110
-I can't eat something
so heavy at this hour.

183
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,110
-Oh.

184
00:09:40,143 --> 00:09:40,810
Really?

185
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:43,076
You want this instead?

186
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,643
-Shark fin?

187
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:45,110
Forget it!

188
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:46,110
-All right, then.

189
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:47,076
How about this?

190
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,343
-An energy drink
would make me manic!

191
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:50,843
-Mm.

192
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:55,343
The fact is, it's pretty good.

193
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:57,710
-You're not helping things
by pigging out over there.

194
00:09:57,743 --> 00:10:00,043
-Speaking of which, these
pigs' feet are very tasty too.

195
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:01,610
-Who cares?

196
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,943
-Oh!

197
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:06,210
-Oh yeah, by the way, did you
happen to see our clothes?

198
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:08,110
-You mean the clothes
you had on yesterday?

199
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:09,710
I dropped them all
off at the cleaners.

200
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:10,943
-You took everything?

201
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:16,376
-Looks great, don't you think?

202
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,676
-I can't wear this!

203
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,576
Aw, come on now.

204
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,910
It's kinda cute.

205
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:21,276
-Quiet down, will you?

206
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,343
You're enjoying my
humiliation, aren't you?

207
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:26,210
-You should try to relax.

208
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:28,710
Are you sure you're not just
jealous because I look good

209
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:30,276
in my outfit?

210
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,576
-You should try
wearing this shirt!

211
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,443
-I have several other
styles to choose from.

212
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:38,376
-I don't wanna wear
any of this stuff!

213
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:50,143
I'm telling you, this
is really messing me up.

214
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:52,143
-Ah, what can I say?

215
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:54,243
As long as we're
staying there, we're

216
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:55,910
just going to have
to put up with it.

217
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:56,610
-You jerk.

218
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:58,010
You're enjoying this.

219
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:58,810
Admit it!

220
00:10:58,843 --> 00:11:01,276
-Not really.

221
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,876
-I wanna get this
over with quickly

222
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,776
so we can get back
to the Soul Society.

223
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,010
[beeping]

224
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,010
-What's that about?

225
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:12,443
-It must be to remind
us of something.

226
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:14,710
MIZUHO: Oh, darling!

227
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:16,510
It's time for lunch.

228
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,510
-What are you doing?

229
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,076
Do you plan on
following me everywhere?

230
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:23,643
Oh brother.

231
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:26,076
What is the problem
with that woman?

232
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:31,010
MIZUHO: I've come to
wash your back for you.

233
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:34,676
-What are you doing?

234
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,443
What's the matter with you?

235
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:36,343
You can't be in here!

236
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:42,176
What the hell is
your problem, lady?

237
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,543
You need to back off
and give me some space.

238
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:46,176
If you continue
this crazy behavior,

239
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,043
I'll be forced to take action.

240
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:48,976
You need discipline!

241
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:54,943
-Do you mean it?

242
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:57,376
That might be kinda fun!

243
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,510
-Are you completely
out of your mind, lady?

244
00:12:01,543 --> 00:12:02,010
Oh.

245
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,643
If that woman's behavior
escalates any further,

246
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:10,810
I'm afraid will have no
choice but to leave here.

247
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:12,810
-So, do you have
someplace else we can go?

248
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:16,176
Otherwise we're both gonna
end up sleeping on the street.

249
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,576
-All right then.

250
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,810
We'll have to come up with some
kind of plan to deal with her.

251
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:22,276
She's on her way to
jeopardizing our mission now.

252
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,443
-That's it.

253
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:28,043
I believe I have an idea.

254
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:49,784
How do you feel about that one?

255
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,984
-Tell me what the hell
this is all about.

256
00:12:52,017 --> 00:12:53,417
I don't get it.

257
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:54,284
-Really?

258
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:55,684
Think back a little.

259
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:56,817
-I have asked myself.

260
00:12:56,851 --> 00:12:59,784
I guess I'm just in love
with his shaved head.

261
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:02,684
-So, that being the case,
here's what I figured.

262
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:04,317
If you wear a wig,
she'll lose interest

263
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,917
in you, just like that.

264
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,117
-Don't be ridiculous.

265
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:08,517
It'll never work!

266
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:09,817
-How come you're so sure?

267
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:13,417
You don't really know
unless you give it a try.

268
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:14,684
Do you have a better idea?

269
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:30,717
That one looks great on you.

270
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,251
-You find all this
amusing, do you?

271
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:34,384
-No.

272
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:35,517
I'm trying to take this
as seriously as I can.

273
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:36,217
It's just that--

274
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:37,151
[laughing]

275
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,951
-You're asking for it.

276
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:39,651
-Take it easy.

277
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:44,351
Well, I think that's
the best one yet.

278
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:45,984
How do you feel?

279
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:48,351
-I feel like a complete idiot.

280
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:51,351
No way I'm wearing this thing.

281
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:52,684
Now what the hell's the problem?

282
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:57,051
I can't seem to get
the damn thing off.

283
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:58,884
What's going on?

284
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,451
Is it some kind of black magic?

285
00:14:01,484 --> 00:14:04,917
-If it came off too easily,
it would give the trick away.

286
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:07,217
So I glued it on.

287
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:08,451
-Damn you, Yumichika!

288
00:14:08,484 --> 00:14:09,784
You used super glue on me?

289
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:10,884
This'll never come off.

290
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,417
What are we gonna do?

291
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:15,651
When I'm done with you,
you're gonna need a wig!

292
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:17,384
[laughter]

293
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:20,984
YUMICHIKA: It looks
very natural, Ikkaku.

294
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:21,951
-Oh dear.

295
00:14:21,984 --> 00:14:23,851
Are you all right?

296
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:25,517
-Damn it, you
blind or something?

297
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:26,517
-Hey.

298
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:29,217
You're the one who
stepped in my way.

299
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:30,717
It's you Ichigo.

300
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:32,684
-Hm?

301
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:33,817
Who are you?

302
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:38,117
Oh.

303
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:43,584
-Somebody needs to
learn some manners.

304
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,951
What do you find
so funny, wise ass?

305
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:49,584
All I wasn't laughing
at you exactly.

306
00:14:49,617 --> 00:14:52,251
-That piece does look
unexpectedly good on you.

307
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:55,151
-Don't patronize me.

308
00:14:55,184 --> 00:14:58,351
-By the way, have you made
any progress on your mission?

309
00:14:58,384 --> 00:14:59,851
-No luck so far.

310
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:02,317
We've been searching around
for its spiritual pressure,

311
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:03,917
but we haven't been
able to find it.

312
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:05,284
-Maybe it's all that hair.

313
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:06,584
It could be blocking you.

314
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:07,617
-You looking for a fight?

315
00:15:07,651 --> 00:15:08,684
Is that it?

316
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:10,051
-Take it easy, Ikkaku.

317
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:12,584
Don't flip your wig.

318
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:13,851
-Well.

319
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:16,617
I can see it's a waste of
time talking to you guys.

320
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:17,151
Come on.

321
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:17,851
-See you.

322
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:18,517
-We've got a job to do.

323
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:24,051
-Oh.

324
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:25,484
Was that Ikkaku?

325
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:26,617
He looks so different.

326
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:30,584
CHAD (VOICEOVER): She
just realized that now?

327
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:33,251
MIZUHO: I'm home!

328
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:33,817
-Hey.

329
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,217
Welcome back.

330
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:41,117
-I figured you might be hungry
darling, so-- Uh, who are you?

331
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,951
-You don't recognize him?

332
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:43,984
-Huh?

333
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:44,684
-Oh please.

334
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:46,151
Can't you tell?

335
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:47,317
It's me, for goodness' sake.

336
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:58,084
-Wha-- What have you done?

337
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:01,084
Take this dead raccoon
off your head right now.

338
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:02,351
It's hideous!

339
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:03,184
-Let go!

340
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:07,651
-This is horrible.

341
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:11,917
Why in the world
do you have hair?

342
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:12,717
-Heh.

343
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:15,384
I decided to change my look.

344
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,517
Let's get going, Yumichika.

345
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,784
-Uh.

346
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:27,284
Uh.

347
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:35,517
Why am I being treated so badly?

348
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:36,351
-And me as well.

349
00:16:36,384 --> 00:16:38,251
I'm not the one wearing the wig.

350
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:40,384
-I don't know what
you're talking about.

351
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,584
-You're trying to
get back to us.

352
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:44,217
Don't flatter yourselves.

353
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:46,084
And how long do
you plan to stay?

354
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:48,951
I want you out of here
as soon as possible.

355
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:51,117
-That's the most effective
plan I ever came up with.

356
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:53,451
-With just one little
miscalculation.

357
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:55,251
We get treated like dogs.

358
00:16:55,284 --> 00:16:58,417
-If I had a dog, I'd
treat him much better.

359
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,117
-I think she's saying she has
no further interest in you now

360
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,251
that you have hair?

361
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:04,784
-You were only attracted
to my shaved head?

362
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:07,217
-You got it.

363
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,517
-Fine!

364
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:10,317
If that's the way you feel
about it, then I'm leaving!

365
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:11,984
I have no interest
in staying some place

366
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:13,451
where I'm not wanted!

367
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:14,584
-Is that so?

368
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,251
Well, don't let the door
hit you on the way out.

369
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:17,717
-And just so we're
clear, I'm never

370
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:19,884
gonna take this wig off
when I'm around you.

371
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:20,684
Never, you hear me?

372
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:25,551
-I couldn't care less.

373
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:28,051
Any man who'd grow his hair
just to break a woman's heart

374
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:29,251
isn't worth the time of day.

375
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:37,351
-So, that's it?

376
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:38,417
You're done with him?

377
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:39,184
-Oh, yes.

378
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:40,317
Absolutely.

379
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,084
That mops he's wearing
gives me the willies.

380
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,317
Where are you going?

381
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:49,084
-Just out to buy some juice.

382
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:53,017
-Shoot.

383
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:55,151
Looks like we're going to be
sleeping outside for a while.

384
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:56,951
-No big deal.

385
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:59,417
We probably should have done
this right from the beginning.

386
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:10,851
-Wha-- Sis?

387
00:18:14,951 --> 00:18:17,217
-I realized I wanted
to get some juice too.

388
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:19,284
-You ought to try being
more honest with yourself.

389
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:20,351
Hurting me!

390
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:22,684
-I said I just wanted
juice, all right?

391
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:25,551
-What ever.

392
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,651
-Well, are you coming?

Don't move.

-What is it?

00:18:34,617 --> 00:18:38,917
-G-G-G-G-- Look out!

-Hm?

399
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:43,617
Is that rain?

00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:44,117
-OK.

401
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:45,084
Move now!

402
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:48,951
-Got it.

403
00:18:48,984 --> 00:18:50,451
It must be the one
we've been looking for.

404
00:18:50,484 --> 00:18:50,951
-Yeah.

405
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:01,284
-Help.

406
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:03,784
Somebody-- help me.

00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:09,717
-What happened to you?

408
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:11,517
-It's my sister.

409
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,784
Something weird
just kidnapped her.

410
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:15,517
Please, you've gotta save her.

411
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:16,984
-What?

412
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:17,951

What are you waiting for?

414
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:24,617
We have a mission, Ikkaku!

415
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:25,451
-Right.

416
00:19:25,484 --> 00:19:27,051
I guess I'll have to suck it up.

417
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:37,951
What's the matter?

418
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:39,951
Why can't I get out?

00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:41,784
-Huh?

420
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:43,151
A warning on the label.

421
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:45,317
This glues the Gigai and
the Konpaku together.

-This just gets better
and better, doesn't it?

Damn!

try and force my way out!

If you come this way again,
you're welcome to stay here!
