00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:54,826
-Guess I found one.

3
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,826
Who are you?

4
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,893
-Maki Ichinose.

5
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:01,093
-I see you're the
Soul Reaper who's

6
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:03,826
been working for the
Bounts, aren't you?

7
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,793
-I am no longer a Soul Reaper.

8
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,193
My allegiance is to the
great Master Kariya.

9
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:13,826
-So where are the Bounts, then?

10
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,593
-Enough of your
questions, Captain.

11
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:20,593
-If you won't answer, then I'll
have to force it out of you.

12
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:29,726
At least tell me why
you choose to fight

13
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,926
on the side of the Bounts
when you have this much skill.

14
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,126
-Because Master Kariya's
way is paved with justice.

15
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,093
There's no justice anymore
in the Soul Society,

16
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,660
but now Master Kariya
will cleanse this place

17
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:42,926
and purify it.

18
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,660
-You traitor.

19
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:56,326
Is that Ichigo?

20
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,426
-Well, it's Toshiro.

21
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,393
-Rangiku and Renji.

22
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:04,260
-It would appear that
most of the thugs

23
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,693
have already left
the forest, captain.

I want off, I want
off, I want off.

27
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,693
Oh.

28
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,093
Uryu and Ichigo.

29
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:17,393
-What are you doing here?

30
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:19,893
-Chad and I came along
with Ganju and his friends

31
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,460
to try and stop all
of Kariya's thugs

32
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,660
from gathering in the forest.

33
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:24,126
-But for some
reason, there doesn't

34
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,060
seem to be as many of them as
we were told there would be.

35
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:27,693
-Hm.

36
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:29,660
I'm aware of that.

37
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:31,460
MAKI: You're all
too late anyway.

38
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:31,960
-Huh?

39
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:34,593
-Hm?

40
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,226
-You can't interfere.

41
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,093
I won't let you get
to master Kariya.

42
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,826
-And just how to you plan to
keep us from getting to Kariya?

43
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,326
Considering the fact that
you're outnumbered seven to one,

44
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,326
you're pretty confident.

45
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:55,793
-Go on ahead.

46
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,760
I'll handle this
situation myself.

47
00:03:57,793 --> 00:03:59,093
-But Captain.

48
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:01,560
-I doubt that the Seireitei
is under any serious threat,

49
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:02,693
but still.

50
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:04,093
They've been steadily
increasing their powers

51
00:04:04,126 --> 00:04:07,693
by absorbing reishi
ever since they arrived.

52
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:09,493
-We'll go warm the others.

53
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:10,226
Come on, Renji.

54
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:10,926
Let's go.

55
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,693
-I'm ready when you are.

56
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:16,793
-None of you are going anywhere.

57
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:18,626
Flash and brust.

59
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,093
-What the devil just happened?

60
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:31,093
It's too early for the sun
to be shining this brightly.

61
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:32,093
-I can't see anything.

62
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:42,060
-What?

63
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:47,560
What is going on?

64
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:52,460
Ichinose!

65
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:58,126
-Captain Hitsugaya.

66
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,260
-Renji?

67
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:01,626
Where did you come from?

68
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,993
-I was about to ask
you the same thing.

69
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:06,226
I could've sworn that
Ichinose was attacking me

70
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,126
but it turned out to be you.

71
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,993
-But I don't get it.

72
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:12,593
-What the hell's going
on around here anyway?

73
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,326
-Don't get reckless.

74
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,993
We'll end up
attacking each other.

75
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:17,093
-What's he mean?

76
00:05:17,126 --> 00:05:21,093
-It appears any movement
could be hazardous.

77
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:22,826
-Damn it.

78
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,560
This must be his
Zanpakuto's power.

79
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:26,993
-That's correct.

80
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,126
My Nijigasumi is a
Zanpakuto of light.

81
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,026
The light that
Nijigasumi releases

82
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,660
reflects and refracts
the air around you,

83
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:38,560
bending and altering the course
of light to create a new space.

84
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:41,126
-So the reflections
cause an illusion.

85
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,693
Still.

86
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:44,160
Even though he's
with the Bounts,

87
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,226
he is a Soul Reaper after all.

88
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,860
He must have spiritual pressure.

89
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:51,960
Then why can't I sense it?

90
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,760
-Is he shifting through
dimensions the way you do?

91
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:55,993
-No.

92
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:58,593
It's different I never
sensed him opening up space.

93
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,560
-He couldn't disguise
his spiritual pressure.

94
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:01,760
That would be impossible.

95
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:03,626
HITSUGAYA: That cave the
Bounts were hiding in

96
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,760
had a special mineral
that blocked our ability

97
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:07,760
to detect spiritual pressure.

98
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:10,660
Could he somehow be using that?

99
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:11,593
Damn.

100
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:12,393
We're wasting time.

101
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,660
-If we stand here
doing nothing, he'll

102
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,860
just pick us off one by one.

103
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:23,626
ICHINOSE: None of you
will leaving here alive.

104
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,693
-Everyone.

105
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:25,193
Be careful.

106
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:28,893
-(IN HEAD) It's useless.

107
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,693
-What was that explosion?

108
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,126
-What the hell?

109
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,093
-Well, if it isn't Ichinose.

110
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:57,560
It's been a while.

111
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:58,060
-Zaraki.

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,493
-We did it!

113
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:05,493
We found Ichi!

114
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,460
-Yachiru!

115
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,426
-Hey, jiggles!

116
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,426
How you doing?

117
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,826
I haven't seen you in a while.

118
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,226
ORIHIME: I'm good,
what about you?

119
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,226
-Ichigo.

120
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,293
When you visit the
Soul Society, you

121
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:16,393
should stop by and
say hello to me first.

122
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:18,360
I'll fire up the barbecue.

123
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:21,260
-I'll definitely
do that next time.

124
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:22,426
-Zaraki.

125
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,760
-Hey.

126
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,626
Looks like things have been
getting pretty entertaining

127
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,760
around here lately.

128
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,326
Hm.

129
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,793
-His spiritual pressure is
so immense it just blew away

130
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,726
Ichinose's spiritual pressure.

131
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,726
I can't believe it.

132
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,826
-Captain Zaraki.

133
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,793
The other Bounts have already
left to attack the Seireitei.

134
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:45,193
We would have gone as well,
but Ichinose stopped us.

135
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:46,526
-Huh?

136
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,726
-Kenpachi Zaraki.

137
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,893
-Ichinose.

138
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:52,926
They tell me you'd
rather live with Bounts

139
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,626
than with your own kind.

140
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,460
-What I do is none
of your concern.

141
00:07:57,493 --> 00:08:00,826
-The head of the Bounts,
his name is Kariya, right?

142
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,860
-I don't have to
tell you anything.

143
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:03,660
-Ha.

144
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,660
You haven't changed at all.

145
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,860
So, what's your plan?

146
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:10,560
You were probably given
orders to stop these guys,

147
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:13,126
weren't you?

148
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,360
And if that's what you want,
then I won't try to stop you.

149
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:17,326
-What?

150
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,160
Have you completely
lost your mind?

151
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:21,693
-That is, unless you've still
got a grudge against me,

152
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:23,993
in which case maybe you'd
like to fight me instead.

153
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:32,993
-(IN HEAD) I should do
as Master Kariya asked.

154
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:34,926
I should dispatch this
group of Soul Reapers

155
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,960
as quickly as possible,
then move on to support him

156
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:41,493
and the others in the Seireitei.

157
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:42,460
Damn it.

158
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,860
Damn it.

159
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,626
-Ha.

160
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,593
-(IN HEAD) Master Kariya.

161
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:02,526
Forgive me.

162
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,360
-Your face shows
more determination

163
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:06,693
than the last time I saw
you, although that's not

164
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:07,826
saying much.

165
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,026
-Kenpachi Zaraki.

166
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,093
I will cut you down!

167
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:20,293
-Excellent.

168
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,993
I was beginning to get bored.

169
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:24,626
Let's get started then.

170
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,693
Show me what this
Bount has taught you.

171
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:28,193
Have you improved at all?

172
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:29,293
-All right Kenny and Maki.

173
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:30,693
Give it everything you've got!

174
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:32,660
-Be quiet and let
me concentrate.

175
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:34,026
Go watch some place else.

176
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,926
-OK.

177
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,526
-Kenpachi.

178
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,726
-Hey.

179
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,593
I think it's best if you
let Kenny and Maki settle

180
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:42,393
this one by themselves.

181
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:43,460
-Are you sure about that?

182
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:44,793
-Mhmm.

183
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:46,360
After all that's
happened, I think

184
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:48,393
Maki would like it that way.

185
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:49,660
-I guess I understand.

186
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:50,560
-We gotta go.

187
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:52,060
-Right.

188
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:52,893
-He's all yours.

189
00:09:58,126 --> 00:10:00,960
-Now we can get
down to business.

190
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:02,226
Come on.

191
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,226
Hit me with your best shot.

192
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:04,893
-My pleasure.

193
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,660
-You've gotta be kidding.

194
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:17,460
You didn't actually
believe you could cut me

195
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:18,460
with those weak attacks?

196
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,160
That's all you gott?

197
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,793
I had expected better.

198
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:32,593
-I'm not done.

199
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:33,560
-What the--?

200
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,393
What an idiot.

201
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:47,060
Don't waste my time with
these foolish tactics.

202
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,693
Your time is up.

203
00:10:53,726 --> 00:10:56,193
-Not so fast!

204
00:10:56,226 --> 00:10:57,326
Flash brightly, Nijigasumi.

205
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:19,393
My Nijigasumi manipulates light
and makes all things invisible

206
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:20,960
when it shines.

207
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:24,026
When Nijigasumi is released
it dispels every shadow,

208
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,026
leaving nowhere to hide.

209
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,426
-How disappointing.

210
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,460
You haven't changed
one bit, have you?

211
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:38,860
-He deflected it with just
his spiritual pressure.

212
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:40,860
-Did you really believe
such a low level

213
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:42,826
attack could defeat me?

214
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,693
I thought you left the Soul
Society to improve your skills,

215
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:46,793
but I guess I was wrong.

216
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:51,593
You're not even a challenge.

217
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:53,260
I'm going to put an end to this.

218
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,226
-Maki's spiritual
pressure just transformed.

219
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:12,760
-You've been hiding something
from me, haven't you?

220
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:16,160
You should know better
than to hold back with me.

221
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,693
-Kenpachi Zaraki.

222
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,560
This is where the fight begins.

223
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,693
Flash brightly.

224
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:25,526
Saigyoku Nijigasume!

225
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,067
-Kenpachi Zaraki.

226
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:44,301
This is where the fight begins.

227
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:45,467
Flash brightly.

228
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:46,301
Saigyoku Nijigasume!

229
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:51,434
-Yeah.

230
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:54,634
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

231
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:58,034
That's the way.

232
00:12:58,067 --> 00:12:59,734
Nice, quick reflexes.

233
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,234
You have gotten better.

234
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:14,267
When you really try,
you're not half bad.

235
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:15,267
-Bastard.

236
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:17,101
You're as arrogant
as you ever were.

237
00:13:17,134 --> 00:13:19,301
You haven't changed at all.

238
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,234
How could the 13
Court Guard Squads

239
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,467
allow someone like
you to be a captain?

240
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,534
It's completely ridiculous.

241
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,967
A captain of the 13
Court Guard Squads

242
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,867
is supposed to protect
those under him,

243
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,767
but who have you ever protected?

244
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:34,101
When you fight,
just who is it for?

245
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:38,334
How do you justify your
insane lust for blood?

246
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,901
-The same old song
and dance, isn't it?

247
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:43,667
You want to know the
reason why I fight?

248
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:46,467
I do it because it amuses me.

249
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:47,901
That's all the reason I need!

250
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,134
-You never even
earned the right to be

251
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,367
called a captain of a
13 Court Guard Quads.

252
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,201
The philosophy of
the Soul Society

253
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:01,501
has become rancid and deceitful.

254
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:03,567
Master Kariya sees
that corruption.

255
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,734
That's why I brought
him back here with me.

256
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:07,434
Master Kariya has
a vision, and I'm

257
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:09,967
willing to risk everything
to help him achieve it.

258
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:12,501
I gained this power
for just that reason.

259
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:13,601
-What are you going to do?

260
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:14,734
Talk me to death?

261
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,501
If you've got a
problem with me, why

262
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:19,667
don't you use that
power of yours?

263
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:20,167
What the--?

264
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:27,501
What the hell is this?

265
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,267
-You're seeing
Nijigasume's true power.

266
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,667
This is Saigyoku Nijigasume.

267
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,667
Now disappear, Kenpachi Zaraki!

268
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:56,301
Kenpachi Zaraki is dead.

269
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:58,801
Nijigasume uses my
spiritual pressure

270
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,901
to create limitless
beams of light.

271
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:04,634
Those beams will devour every
shadow as thy consume Kenpachi.

272
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:05,367
-He's not dead.

273
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,301
I can feel it.

274
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,834
-He is breathing, but it's
only a matter of time.

275
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:14,601
The light that has
engulfed him will soon

276
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:16,967
compress into a
high density being,

277
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,967
squeezing the life out of him.

278
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,134
There is no way to escape.

279
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,901
-Kenny won't lose to you.

280
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:27,701
-How pathetic.

281
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:29,601
Look, the compression
is beginning.

282
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,567
-Where am I?

283
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:41,734
For some reason, it's getting
harder and harder to move.

284
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,434
Heh.

285
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:50,867
My spirit energy.

286
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:51,767
Is there enough?

287
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:01,601
-Where are you going?

288
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:03,601
-I must assist Master Kariya.

289
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:05,934
-Don't you want to finish
your fight with Kenny?

290
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,567
-There's nothing left to fight.

291
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:09,901
-Kenny's not dead.

292
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,167
He's alive.

293
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,467
-He's dead.

294
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:15,634
And I'll do the same thing
to if you try to interfere.

295
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,967
KENPACHI: I might have
something to say about that.

296
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:21,934
Heh.

297
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:33,267
-But how?

298
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:38,734
Impossible.

299
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:44,634
What?

300
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:00,467
-Heh, heh.

301
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,067
-But how?

302
00:17:02,101 --> 00:17:03,967
How did you--

303
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:06,201
-I released some of the
spiritual pressure which

304
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:10,167
I keep hidden inside me for
an occasion such as this.

305
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:11,667
-It can't be.

306
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:14,967
The way you could have blocked
Nijigasume's spiritual pressure

307
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,101
is with an even stronger
spiritual pressure.

308
00:17:17,134 --> 00:17:18,534
And that's impossible!

309
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:22,867
-Your Zanpakuto derives its
power from Kido, doesn't it?

310
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:23,601
-Why?

311
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:25,201
What are you getting at?

312
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:27,534
-You haven't changed
at all, have you?

313
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,701
But I should congratulate
you, because even

314
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:31,134
though your
technique stinks, you

315
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:34,867
did make me use my full
powers for a second, there.

316
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:37,667
Although to believe that a
light could dispel all shadows

317
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:40,867
and engulf you-- it's idiotic.

318
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:43,167
The concept of shining
light on everything

319
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:45,601
is impossible to begin with.

320
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:47,434
It doesn't take a
scientist to tell you

321
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,167
that no matter how
much light you create,

322
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,834
there will always be a shadow.

323
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:55,201
-How does someone like
you get to this position?

324
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:58,234
A person without noble
goals or any sense of honor.

325
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:01,134
Why does someone like you
have this kind of power?

326
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:03,634
My captain based his entire
life on the principles

327
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,067
of justice and honor!

328
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:11,867
And then you-- How can you trust
anything the Soul Society says

329
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:14,601
when they let a barbarian
like you become a captain?

330
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,967
We have come to deliver justice
to the Soul Society that

331
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:23,667
is long overdue, and you
will not stand in our way.

332
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:27,234
It's because of people like
you that this is happening.

333
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:29,834
It's all your fault!

334
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:30,567
-You stupid idiot!

335
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,801
You talk about nobility.

336
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,301
Then why don't you
tell me about one

337
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:42,134
of these noble goals of yours?

338
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:43,901
And are they really
yours, or were they

339
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:45,967
just given to you
by someone else?

340
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,567
-Don't act like you
understand what I'm doing.

341
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,967
-All I'm saying is,
that's why you're a loser.

342
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:56,467
Relying on people and loyalty
are two different things.

343
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:59,967
It's no fun fighting someone
who doesn't have his own goals.

344
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:02,567
There is no passion.

345
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,767
-Why, then?

346
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:06,201
Why did you come all the
way out here to fight me?

347
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:07,867
Was it just to humiliate me?

348
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:09,334
-Heh.

349
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:10,867
If you had to really
been concerned

350
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,001
about achieving Kariya's
goals, then wouldn't you

351
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:16,067
have ignored me and stopped
Ichigo and the others first?

352
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:20,201
But you chose to ignore Kariya's
orders and face me instead.

353
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:22,601
Sounds to me like you
put your goals above his.

354
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:28,101
You believe that your power
had come through Kariya,

355
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,101
but that kind of power
can only be spawned

356
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:33,634
by hatred and your
desire to kill me.

357
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:38,001
If you really wanted to hurt
me, then use that hatred.

358
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:41,667
-(IN HEAD) This man--
could it be true?

359
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,601
-Oh, Kenny.

360
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:49,601
Oh, Maki.

361
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,401
-Have you made up your mind?

362
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:05,667
-(IN HEAD) Master Kariya.

363
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:07,501
I'm sorry.

364
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:09,667
When you achieve
your ultimate goal,

365
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:13,101
I may not be there
to share the glory.

366
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:15,801
Even so-- please forgive me.

367
00:20:50,401 --> 00:20:53,201
-Come on.

368
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:53,901
-Kenpachi Zaraki!

369
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:21,301
My captain.

370
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:31,367
-Seems your hatred
wasn't enough.

371
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:36,234
Hm?

372
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:39,134
-Kenny, did you?

373
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,601
-I gave it everything I had.

374
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:49,834
Let's go home.

375

YACHIRU: Kenny, shouldn't you be
heading back to the Seireitei?

377
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:41,708
KENPACHI: There's
no need to hurry.

378
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:44,642
Ichigo will become stronger
when he fights the Bounts,

379
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:46,375
and I'll defeat
him when he does.

380
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:47,908
YACHIRU: That's so smart.

381
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:49,575
KENPACHI: So let's
wish Ichigo luck.

382
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:50,675
ICHIGO: Gah.

383
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,842
Why does my stomach
hurt all of a sudden?

KON: Illustrated
guide to Soul Reapers.

386
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:06,008
-Welcome.

387
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:07,242
-Hanataro Yamada.

388
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:08,975
About this document.

389
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:10,175
-Right.

390
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:13,075
You see, it's a plan to
build a convenience store.

391
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,342
-Hm.

392
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,342
Please tell me you're not
really serious about this.

393
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,775
-Well, with the training I got
in the world of the living,

394
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:19,942
it'll be a piece of cake.

395
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:21,875
-It's not that I don't
think you can handle it.

396
00:24:21,908 --> 00:24:23,408
It's just-- argh.

397
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:25,575
Captain, please talk
some sense into him.

398
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:26,542
-Hanataro Yamada.

399
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:28,575
-Yes?

400
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:31,275
-Make sure you carry
some cosmetics, too.

401
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:31,842
-Sure.

402
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,142
-Oh, Captain.
