2
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:51,021
NARRATOR: The final
showdown with the Arrancars

3
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:53,054
is this winter.

4
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:57,154
Ichigo, Chad, Uryu,
Rukia, and Orihime

5
00:01:57,187 --> 00:01:59,521
have all been undergoing
intense training,

6
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:01,087
pushing their
bodies to the limit

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,621
to get as strong as possible
with the little time they have.

8
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:07,421
Meanwhile, Captain Hitsugaya
and his advanced troops

9
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:09,521
have remained in Karakura Town.

10
00:02:09,554 --> 00:02:11,854
As they prepare for the
inevitable showdown,

11
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:15,787
they're forced to
battle powerful Hollows.

12
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:18,487
Then, the situation
takes a dramatic turn.

13
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:25,921
Several of the Espada
appeared in Karakura Town.

14
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:29,287
Hitsugaya and this team
confronted the Espada,

15
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:32,854
but Luppi, the new number
six, released his Zanpakuto

16
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,354
Trepadora, and easily
defeated Hitsugaya.

17
00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:39,687
-But just think.

18
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:41,121
That attack.

19
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:43,587
the one you were able
to block just now,

20
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:48,954
would you be able to stop it if
it were eight times stronger?

21
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:50,854
-What the-- What is that?

22
00:02:58,587 --> 00:03:01,187
-Rangiku!

23
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:03,254
-Yumichika!

24
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:03,821
Damn it.

25
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:04,854
Let go of me.

26
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:11,587
NARRATOR: Rangiku and the
others were in great danger.

27
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,054
Then, suddenly, Kisuke
Urahara appeared.

28
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:17,587
-Well, looks like I
made it just in time.

29
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:19,387
That was certainly
close, wasn't it?

30
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:29,687
NARRATOR: Meanwhile, Ichigo
abandoned his Visored training

31
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:33,354
in order to fight Grimmjow.

32
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:37,754
And while the battle continued
to unfold across Karakura Town,

33
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:41,821
Orihime headed to the world of
a living from the Soul Society

34
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,254
to do her part in the fight.

35
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:46,787
But she was ambushed by someone
unexpected in the Dongai.

36
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:54,187
-Come with me, little girl.

37
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:13,954
-Ah.

38
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,921
-Well, you surprised me.

39
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:19,654
What was that attack just now?

40
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:22,921
That was a first for me.

41
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:23,921
-Ah.

42
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:24,421
Ah.

43
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:35,587
[wicked laughter]

44
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:37,654
-I'll tell you what was.

45
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:39,521
It's called a Bala.

46
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:43,787
A Bala is a projectile
of spiritual energy.

47
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:46,221
It's not as strong as a Cero.

48
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:48,254
Doesn't need the power.

49
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:49,487
It's 20 times faster.

50
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,454
Hey, what's wrong?

51
00:04:58,487 --> 00:04:59,921
Can you dodge this?

52
00:04:59,954 --> 00:05:01,554
You can't, can you?

53
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:04,554
Die, die, die, you dumb bastard.

54
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:06,554
-My, my.

55
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:08,921
When someone gets
in my way, they die.

56
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:11,554
I wanted to kill the
guy wearing the hat.

57
00:05:11,587 --> 00:05:17,421
But Yammy is-- Whatever the
case, he's not alive now.

58
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:19,254
-Well, such is life.

59
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,487
It's time we return
to the task at hand.

60
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,821
Don't you agree, dear?

61
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:28,854
You really are pathetic.

62
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:30,921
Even after that
clog-wearing bastard

63
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:33,554
came along and saved you,
what did you do but get caught

64
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:35,721
again?

65
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:37,021
Oh well.

66
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:40,421
I suppose you can't escape
if it's eight against three.

67
00:05:40,454 --> 00:05:41,921
-Just give it a rest.

68
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:42,921
-Hm?

69
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:45,021
-I've heard enough of your crap.

70
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,887
I think you've got a big mouth.

71
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:50,221
-And what would your point be?

72
00:05:50,254 --> 00:05:53,654
-There's nothing more disgusting
than a man who won't shut up.

73
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,654
Do you ever even
listen to yourself?

74
00:05:57,687 --> 00:05:58,754
-Look, lady.

75
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:03,654
Have you forgotten that
I have captured you?

76
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:07,087
You should be aware that if I
get upset, you'll be skewered!

77
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:15,487
Wha-- what is this?

78
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:18,621
HITSUGAYA: Huge mistake
to let your guard down.

79
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:21,854
Against any of your opponents.

80
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:24,087
Be ready minded, you see.

81
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:24,787
Always alert.

82
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,654
-You're dead.

83
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:33,654
You have to be dead.

84
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:37,054
-Hyorinmaru's power
is without limit.

85
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:41,354
Hyorinmaru will always reform as
long as there is water around.

86
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:45,554
It can be reborn a
countless number of times.

87
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:47,854
You have no chance
of winning now.

88
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:50,687
I've had too much
time to prepare.

89
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:53,087
You made a critical
mistake in your strategy.

90
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,887
The fact of the matter
is your resources

91
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:57,854
are limited and finite.

92
00:06:57,887 --> 00:06:59,754
Your weapon is eight arms.

93
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:04,187
My weapon is all the
water in the atmosphere.

94
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:04,721
Sennen Hyoro.

95
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:12,154
[scream]

96
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:21,087
-Those eight arms of
yours just weren't

97
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:22,787
enough to defeat me, Arrancar.

98
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:27,621
-Captain!

99
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:32,487
-What the hell just happened?

100
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:35,454
Did those bastards defeat Luppi?

101
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:36,587
Moron.

102
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:39,354
When you underestimate
your enemy, you lose.

103
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:40,954
Hurry up, or--

104
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:42,554
-Lord Aizen will
be terribly mad!

105
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,054
-Huh?

106
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:51,454
-Alive?

107
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:53,454
But how?

108
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:54,987
-You're asking if
I'm still alive?

109
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:57,954
Is that what you want to know?

110
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:00,887
Well, I'm wondering
about that myself.

111
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:03,221
-So you're making
fun of me, huh?

112
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:06,421
I'll show you where
that gets you.

113
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:09,654
You are powerless against me!

114
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:10,154
Bala!

115
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,587
Ha ha ha!

116
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,754
Idiot.

117
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:18,554
Dead and gone.

118
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:19,054
Huh?

119
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:22,887
-I know that attack.

120
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:25,321
I can't get hit by it anymore.

121
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:27,821
You find all of this
puzzling, don't you?

122
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:39,654
In your flurry of Bala attacks,
you felt all of them connect.

123
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:45,254
But I know you're wondering
why it is that I'm still alive.

124
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:49,854
It's only natural
that you'd be curious.

125
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:53,621
The answer is right here.

126
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:54,121
-Huh?

127
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:02,887
What?

128
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:06,554
-A portable gigai!

129
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,287
-What are you talking about?

130
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:11,554
I've never heard of anything
like a portable gigai.

131
00:09:11,587 --> 00:09:12,987
-That's because
I've never shown it

132
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:14,954
to anyone since I invented it.

133
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,621
-Huh?

134
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:19,021
-Well, this is a prototype.

135
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:23,221
Actually, it turns out it's
very difficult to operate.

136
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:26,321
I don't think that anyone
else aside from me can use it.

137
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:28,154
It needs to be done right.

138
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:30,221
And getting the
timing right is hard,

139
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:34,154
whatever I want it to
take my place for a while.

140
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:35,287
So, what do you think?

141
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:37,854
Did I do a good job?

142
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:42,754
When I switched places just
now, did you suspect I had?

143
00:09:42,787 --> 00:09:45,254
-You'll die!

144
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,821
-You just don't get it.

145
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,221
I can't be hit.

146
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:58,187
Earlier, I analyzed the reishi
structure of your technique.

147
00:09:58,221 --> 00:10:03,421
I've even analyzed how your
muscles move when you fire it.

148
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:07,321
So as long as I have
determined these two things,

149
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:10,954
I can dodge it, and I can even
match your timing in order

150
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:13,921
to cancel your move
out completely.

151
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:18,287
Well, it's pretty
difficult to accomplish.

152
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:21,221
Now then, is it
time to end this?

153
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:27,654
[crying out]

154
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:48,487
-Damn.

155
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:15,187
-Ha ha ha!

156
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:17,387
Well, it seems you
have a problem.

157
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:21,554
Once that mask is broken,
you just can't bring it back.

158
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:22,987
Wait.

159
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:24,121
You're not gonna try again?

160
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:25,687
That's crazy.

161
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:28,521
It seems I was wrong.

162
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,021
But you've either
taken too much damage,

163
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:34,021
or you've spent all of
your spiritual energy.

164
00:11:34,054 --> 00:11:38,187
Maybe you have a limit as to
how many times you can use it.

165
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:40,787
It doesn't matter
what the reason is.

166
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:42,887
That mask isn't here now, is it?

167
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:56,221
It's a moot point,
whatever the reason.

168
00:11:56,254 --> 00:11:57,021
Don't worry.

169
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:06,721
because a Cero at close
range will wipe away

170
00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:08,454
that mask wearing head of yours.

171
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:20,721
-Tsugi no mai.

172
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:33,421
Hakuren.

173
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:52,244
Hakuren.

174
00:13:26,844 --> 00:13:27,310
Ichigo!

175
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:35,944
-That's a pretty
incredible move.

176
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,877
When did you--

177
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,077
-Don't speak.

178
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,377
This is tricky.

179
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,110
It's hard enough to
get you free as is.

180
00:13:45,377 --> 00:13:47,077
It's really stuck.

181
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,610
The power that you're
using certainly

182
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:50,644
seems ridiculous, too.

183
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:53,410
You're in bad shape.

184
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:54,710
-Just shut your mouth.

185
00:13:57,677 --> 00:14:00,077
-Ichigo.

186
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,577
Huh?

187
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:11,777
-Don't underestimate
me, Soul Reaper.

188
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,677
Did you think that
you could kill me

189
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,077
by freezing me under
a thin sheet of ice?

190
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,510
You're an idiot!

191
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:23,944
-Rukia!

192
00:14:23,977 --> 00:14:27,410
[laughter]

193
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:51,110
-What was that?

194
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,044
SHINJI: My, oh, my.

195
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,177
I just detest
having to interfere

196
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,877
with another Soul
Reaper's fight.

197
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,910
And yet, I have no choice.

198
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:23,877
I can't ignore you-- if
you're making so much noise.

199
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:29,310
-It's Shinji.

200
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:31,344
-Who the hell are you?

201
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:33,010
Are you a friend of theirs?

202
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:35,477
-Do I look like I am?

203
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,077
-Who are you, then?

204
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,377
-Does it really matter?

205
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:40,944
-No.

206
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:42,110
You're right.

207
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:51,977
Whoever you are-- you're dead!

208
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,944
Because I am gonna
rip you to shreds!

209
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:06,710
[groan]

210
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:08,910
-If every time I
dodge an attack,

211
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:12,544
you destroy a building,
I won't be able to dodge,

212
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:14,577
because I'll just
feel so guilty.

213
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,677
Try to hold back a little
when you're fighting.

214
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,510
-Can't move any
better than that?

215
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:25,010
Huh?

216
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:31,677
-He's obviously a
hot-headed one, this guy.

217
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:38,444
-That mask you have on--
you are one of his friends.

218
00:17:38,477 --> 00:17:40,110
Go on, admit it!

219
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,277
-Don't make me repeat myself.

220
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,410
Does it really matter?

221
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:52,577
-Huh?

222
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:59,477
-Sorry, Arrancar.

223
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,210
-It can't be.

224
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:04,244
SHINJI: You're pretty strong.

225
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:08,377
So I'm not going to hold back.

226
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,377
-A Cero?

227
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,644
[coughing]

228
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:35,110
-Damn.

229
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:36,110
Damn.

230
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:37,510
Damn.

231
00:18:37,544 --> 00:18:38,010
Damn!

232
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,510
-So, you countered with
your own Cero right

233
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:46,744
before it hit to
reduce the damage.

234
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:47,877
That's pretty good.

235
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:13,710
-Now grind!

236
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:20,910
-Huh?

237
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:29,310
-Ulquiorra?

238
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:34,710
-Our mission is complete.

239
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:35,277
We're leaving.

240
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:49,177
-Our mission's over?

241
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:49,677
-Huh.

242
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:02,510
-Negacion.

243
00:20:02,544 --> 00:20:06,977
-How unfortunate, Captain.

244
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,677
You weren't able to
kill me, you see?

245
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,444
Be sure not to forget my face.

246
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:18,677
When we meet again,
I'll have my revenge.

247
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,077
I will twist off
your little head!

248
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,310
You and I shall meet
again, Soul Reaper.

249
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,810
-Ah.

250
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:30,310
Ah.

251
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,477
-You said you're going to
finish this, didn't you?

252
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,444
I won't forget that.

253
00:20:38,477 --> 00:20:40,644
I'll be back soon enough.

254
00:20:40,677 --> 00:20:44,710
And the next time we
meet, I will crush you!

255
00:20:57,744 --> 00:21:01,177
-I should've known.

256
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,744
-Captain!

257
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:05,977
Thank you very much.

258
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,577
-We still haven't defeated them.

259
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,910
It's only going
to become harder.

260
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:13,044
-Dammit.

261
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:14,977
-What an inelegant ending.

262
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,010
ULQUIORRA: There are some
traces of spiritual pressure.

263
00:21:31,044 --> 00:21:34,277
It seems that he has
gained a new power.

264
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:43,644
Still, is that the
best he can do?

265
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,844
It's over.

266
00:21:45,877 --> 00:21:51,444
You have no means
to fight anymore.

267
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,677
The sun has set.

268
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,977
The day is ours.

269
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:16,908
[theme music]

270
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:48,652
ORIHIME: There were so
many things I wanted to do.

271
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:53,052
[sigh] I wish I could have had
five different lives, instead

272
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:53,952
of one.

273
00:23:53,986 --> 00:23:58,419
Ichigo-- I--
