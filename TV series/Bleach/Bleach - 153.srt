NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

3
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:52,394
who was kidnapped
by the Arrancars,

4
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:55,327
Icihgo, Chad, Uryu,
Rukia, and Renji

5
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:58,994
have all snuck into Hueco
Mundo, the realm of the hollows.

6
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:01,594
On the journey to Aizen's
fortress, Las Noches,

7
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:03,761
our heroes struggled
against endless attacks

8
00:02:03,794 --> 00:02:05,694
from the Arrancar forces.

9
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:07,794
Upon breaking into the
fortress, the group

10
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,794
split up and took
five different paths

11
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:11,594
in their search for Orihime.

12
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,927
Standing guard over
Ichigo and Nel's path

13
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:17,961
was Privaron Espada number
103, known as Dordoni.

14
00:02:17,994 --> 00:02:20,494
in the fight that
followed, Ichigo gravely

15
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:24,761
underestimated his
opponent's abilities.

16
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:26,427
-Well, Giralda!

17
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:48,794
-I hope it was worth the wait.

18
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:52,894
Let me introduce
you to my Bankai.

19
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:54,794
-It's about time.

20
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:57,661
I knew you'd have to
use it eventually.

21
00:02:57,694 --> 00:03:02,494
And yet, you have a
stronger form, don't you?

22
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:06,527
I know all about
your hollowfication.

23
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,694
Now you need to use it!

24
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:20,161
Do it now, or I'll
force you to, nino.

25
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:30,461
-Is that so?

26
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:31,527
Don't you have any shame?

27
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,994
-Of course I do.

28
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:36,894
I'm ashamed at myself
for not getting

29
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,994
you to fight at full
strength before now!

30
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:43,127
-All right then.

31
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:51,461
Sorry, but I can only show
it to you for an instant.

32
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,727
-Oh?

33
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:10,694
What happened?

34
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:11,527
What's going on?

35
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:16,494
-I told you.

36
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:17,727
Only an instant.

37
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:24,261
-While hollowfied, Ichigo
was able to defeat Dordoni.

38
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:26,161
Nel then healed
Dordoni's wounds,

39
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:28,527
but within moments
after his treatment,

40
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,927
Dordoni surprised them
by attacking once again.

41
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,194
-How could you be foolish
enough to allow someone

42
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:34,794
to heal your enemy's wound?

43
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:36,694
You think I'm not going
to attack you again!

44
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:37,727
-That's insane!

45
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:39,194
You're barely in one
piece and now you

46
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:40,994
wanna come back for more?

47
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:44,627
-Wounds can injure one's
body, but not one's spirit.

48
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,994
As long as my will to
fight remains strong,

49
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:50,861
my physical wounds
are insignificant!

50
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:53,827
You're just as sweet
as the chocolate!

51
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,327
Nino!

52
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:10,794
-Ichigo.

53
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:31,527
-Huh?

54
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:42,627
What a surprise.

55
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:44,727
What brings the Exequias here?

56
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,461
-We have orders to locate
the injured intruder

57
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,661
and execute him.

58
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:51,861
-That order came from whom?

59
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,561
-I really can't say.

60
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:56,094
-You want to get
past me, I presume?

61
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:58,427
-Are you threatening
to block our way?

62
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:01,827
It would be hopeless for you
to resist us in your condition.

63
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,661
You're a Pivaron Espada.

64
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:06,361
Besides, your sword is broken
and you can't release it.

65
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:08,861
You don't stand a chance
against us in a fight.

66
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:11,594
-Heh.

67
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:12,727
Is that true, [spanish]?

68
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:15,361
I'm more powerful
than you think.

69
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:18,761
I am glad you were able to make
it out of here in time, nino.

70
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:21,194
If you had not countered
my final attack,

71
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:22,827
you would still
be here, and you'd

72
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:24,827
have been executed by
the squad of morons.

73
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:30,694
My powers have
weakened so badly,

74
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:34,294
you probably could have
defeated me without Hollowfying.

75
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,794
You must have sensed
how humiliating

76
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,994
that would have been for me.

77
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:41,461
You transformed, even though
it would drain your long term

78
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:43,361
strength to do so.

79
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:47,594
You preserved my
dignity as a warrior.

80
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:48,994
I am grateful for that.

81
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:52,294
This is the least I can do
to thank you, but beware

82
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,994
of the ones you encounter as you
move deeper into the fortress.

83
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:58,061
They will cut you down
without a moment's thought.

84
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:00,461
Do not hesitate to
attack your enemy,

85
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:03,861
do not waver when you
deliver the finishing blow.

86
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:06,561
Above all, do not
heal his wounds

87
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,227
once we have defeated him.

88
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,494
You'll have to leave your
chocolate sweetness behind.

89
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:17,627
You have to become like
the devil himself, nino.

90
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:23,427
Become as strong as a demon.

91
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:25,494
Become as fierce as a demon.

92
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:28,827
You must learn that the
only way to endure cruelty

93
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:32,694
is to become cruel yourself.

94
00:07:32,727 --> 00:07:35,427
Otherwise, you will be consumed.

95
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:59,561
-I could be in trouble here.

96
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:01,961
Damn it.

97
00:08:01,994 --> 00:08:04,061
-I have an update, Lord Aizen.

98
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:05,694
It's not good news.

99
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:09,627
We've just received word that
Parivaron Espada, number 103,

100
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:12,727
Dordoni Allessandro
Del Socaccio,

101
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:16,494
has been killed
by the intruders.

102
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:17,027
-I see.

103
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:22,494
Apparently it was a
bit harder for the boy

104
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,394
than I thought it would be.

105
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:28,727
I assumed defeating someone
of Dordoni's skill level

106
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:31,261
would've been less of a
challenge, and far easier

107
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:31,994
for him.

108
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:35,227
How interesting.

109
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:39,627
Regardless.

110
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:42,161
There's something you failed
to report to me, isn't there?

111
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:46,727
Tell me.

112
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,127
Who specifically
sent the Exequias out

113
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:53,027
to eliminate the boy?

114
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:58,327
-I-- It-- It--

115
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:00,794
-What's the problem?

116
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:03,127
Didn't I make the question
clear enough for you?

117
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:07,561
SZAYELAPORRO: It
was me, Lord Aizen.

118
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:15,394
-It was you, Szayelaporro.

119
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:21,927
-My humblest apologies, sir.

120
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,794
I wanted to make sure
we eliminated him

121
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:25,661
while he was injured.

122
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:28,294
I thought it was a
rare opportunity,

123
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:31,461
so I ordered them to go at
my own discretion, My Lord.

124
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:38,227
I realize, Lord Aizen, that,
even though I did it for you,

125
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,694
I was wrong not
to ask permission.

126
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,227
I'll accept any
form of punishment

127
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:43,194
you wish to administer.

128
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:50,794
-That won't be necessary.

129
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:56,461
Just as long as you
had a good reason,

130
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:59,661
there's no need to punish you.

131
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:02,794
-Thank you very much, my lord.

132
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:04,027
I should return to my duties.

133
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:12,561
-However, in the
future, Szayelaporro,

134
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:16,327
I want your reports to be
more detailed and accurate.

135
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:21,094
The data that you collected from
Dordoni regarding the intruder,

136
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,061
will it be of any help
with your research?

137
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:28,661
-Yes.

138
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,361
It will.

139
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:32,894
-That's splendid.

140
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:33,994
Keep up the good work.

141
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:44,161
-Interesting.

142
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:46,527
You seem to be having
quite a lot of fun,

143
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:48,761
even though one of your
subordinates was just killed.

144
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:55,561
-Do I look happy?

145
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:57,594
-You seem to be amused.

146
00:10:57,627 --> 00:11:00,694
I think maybe energized
is the right word.

147
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,561
Excited that those kids are
winning fight after fight,

148
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:05,461
overcoming your
defenses, and making

149
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:08,161
their way to your inner sanctum.

150
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:10,327
AIZEN: Amused, you say?

151
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:12,927
Maybe so.

152
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:15,561
I suppose I do feel something
akin to that emotion.

153
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:23,761
Do you find that strange, Gin?

154
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:25,894
-Not at all, my lord.

155
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:28,427
Oddly enough, I feel
somewhat the same myself.

156
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,027
[laughter]

157
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:54,561
-You think you can save
yourself by hiding?

158
00:11:58,994 --> 00:11:59,461
Hmph.

159
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:17,229
[mumbling]

160
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:21,481
[shouting]

161
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:32,381
-Huh?

162
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:34,669
Tell me, why was I
carrying you like that?

163
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:36,835
-What do you mean, why
are you carrying me?

164
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:38,535
That's my question, you egghead.

165
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:41,269
You said, I feel Nel's
spiritual pressure nearby,

166
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,269
forget about it.

167
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:43,735
Then you got hyped
up, grabbed at me,

168
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,169
and brought me
down this corridor.

169
00:12:45,202 --> 00:12:46,435
Are you messing with me?

170
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:47,002
-No!

171
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,202
It's not that.

172
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,302
I just got excited when
I thought Nel was nearby.

173
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:51,902
Everything else is just a blur.

174
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:52,702
-You know what?

175
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:54,935
Your whole brain is a blur.

176
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,235
-I really couldn't help myself.

177
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:58,369
-Now you're telling me you
have no impulse control.

178
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,702
Great.

179
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:00,802
All right, stand up.

180
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:02,202
I guess there's
no way around it.

181
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:03,869
We'll have to go look for Nel.

182
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:05,835
-That hurts, you know?

183
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,569
I'd like it if you
didn't keep doing that.

184
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:11,269
RENJI: What you did to
me hurt a whole lot more.

185
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:11,769
-Hm?

186
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:17,302
Huh?

187
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:19,069
Pe--

188
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:19,902
-What?

189
00:13:19,935 --> 00:13:21,102
Now what's wrong?

190
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:21,802
-Wait a minute.

191
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:22,535
Pesche's gone.

192
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,369
Where is he?

193
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,535
When did he disappear?

194
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:25,869
-What do you mean?

195
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:27,902
Are you talking about that
guy who looks like a skeleton?

196
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,802
He was never here to begin with!

197
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:30,735
-What?

198
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,069
Are you sure about that?

199
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:36,169
You mean Pesche, who's
with me all this time,

200
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:39,169
he's never been anything more
than an illusion in my mind,

201
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,602
right from the very beginning?

202
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:43,002
-How did you come up with that?

203
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:47,769
You are a mental case, an
hysterical personality.

204
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:48,269
-Pesche!

205
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:58,935
[shivering]

206
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:01,735
-How many times do I
have to tell you, moron?

207
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:06,169
You're not going to be
getting away from me.

208
00:14:06,202 --> 00:14:06,669
Huh?

209
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:12,669
Where are your manners, idiot?

210
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:15,735
You shouldn't attack me when
I'm trying to talk to you.

211
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,135
Don't you have any matters?

212
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:20,269
Honestly.

213
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:25,369
I hope human men
aren't all like you.

214
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:26,735
It's hardly worth
the effort it's

215
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:28,969
going to take to wipe you out!

216
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:35,969
Come back here, fancy pants!

217
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:38,202
-That's a joke, coming from you!

218
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:45,302
-I told you that won't work!

219
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:57,402
-She may be an
Arrancar, but she's

220
00:14:57,435 --> 00:14:59,302
a small, lightweight girl.

221
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:01,569
She's fast enough
to repel my attacks.

222
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,069
I'll just have to
keep coming at her

223
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:07,069
and hope I'm able to
score a direct hit.

224
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:09,302
-You're becoming a
pest, you weirdo.

225
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:13,735
-Veer, now!

226
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:17,402
Now strike!

227
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:23,069
Good.

228
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:24,102
I can do this.

229
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,902
-Nice try, four eyes.

230
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:37,735
-Her weapon moves in a straight
line when it's released.

231
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,535
Even after she throws it.

232
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:43,302
Or when she pulls it back.

233
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:45,969
So I should avoid
attacking her head on,

234
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:48,969
and focus on shooting at her
from positions she can't easily

235
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:50,002
respond to.

236
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:51,969
That way--

237
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:53,835
-Weirdo!

238
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,202
Having trouble
aiming that thing?

239
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:01,135
Hm?

240
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,035
-Now I just have to
control the arrows

241
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,169
with my spiritual pressure.

242
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:17,135
-Oh, no you don't!

243
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:34,769
Stop moving around!

244
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:35,302
Yah!

245
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:56,235
-I got her.

246
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:05,169
-It's time to quit
playing around.

247
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:11,469
-It's curving!

248
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:15,502
-You're not very bright.

249
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,669
Take a good look around you.

250
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,502
You just dug your own grave.

251
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:21,569
I tricked you, moron.

252
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:24,735
While you were on the offensive,
you broke all these pillars,

253
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,902
and now you're left wide open.

254
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:29,935
There were just too many of
them for me to destroy alone.

255
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:33,602
And decides, it
would've been a bother.

256
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,535
Thank you.

257
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:36,102
Now I can weave
my weapon around,

258
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,835
and you have nowhere
left to hide.

259
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:41,035
-Dammit!

260
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:45,535
-Now watch this!

261
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:46,535
Spin around!

262
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:03,469
Aw, what's wrong?

263
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:05,702
You're not giving
up already, are you?

264
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:18,502
-I'm in trouble here.

265
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:26,802
-You can't keep that up forever.

266
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:28,135
You're just wasting your time.

267
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:37,335
-Damn.

268
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:40,769

RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Uryu and
Chad's spiritual pressures

271
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:10,469
have been fluctuating
for a while now.

272
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:13,635
Are they in battle
with the enemy?

273
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:15,002
No.

274
00:19:15,035 --> 00:19:16,935
I don't need to
worry about them.

275
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:19,969
I need to focus on getting to
Orihime as quickly as possible.

276
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:46,157
What in the world?

277
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:46,657
Ah?

278
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:58,257
What's this?

279
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,924
How can there be
blue skies here?

280
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:04,691
All I did was follow that
corridor, and now I'm outside?

281
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:05,624
What's going on?

282
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:17,124
-Do you want me to
explain it to you?

283
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:17,624
-Huh?

284
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:30,791
-Come with me.

285
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:36,724
-Wait!

286
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:02,524
ARRANCAR: Ah.

287
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:04,024
Good.

288
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:06,491
I can finally relax now.

289
00:21:18,957 --> 00:21:20,424
Sorry.

290
00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:27,324
But I simply cannot stand
the sunlight out there.

291
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:29,924
It does not reach
inside the palace.

-Allow me to take off my
mask and greet you properly.

293
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,591
-My name is Aaroniero.

294
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:56,024
Aaroniero Arruruerie, also
known as Espada number nine.

-Kaien.

00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:05,957

SZAYELAPORRO: Lord
Aizen has finally

299
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:47,466
given me permission to
carry out my experiments

300
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:48,832
without restriction!

301
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:51,066
I just have to figure out which
subject will be the first one

302
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,432
to provide samples.

to let Szayelaporro

do whatever he wants?

Let's leave him to
his own devices.
