1
00:01:56,797 --> 00:01:58,869
(Ichigo)
Hey! Sorry
to keep you
waiting...

2
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,272
(All)
[gasps]

3
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:03,279
(Uryu)
Ichigo, are you
really sure about
doing this?

4
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:04,681
Yeah, I'm
sure.

5
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:07,255
There's no time
to waste worrying
about stuff.

6
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:11,297
Hey, they're right
to be worried
about trying to restore
your Spirit Energy.

7
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,336
Even by just
attempting to do
this you're taking
a huge risk.

8
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:19,348
But, the fact
is, taking that
gamble is our
only hope.

9
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:22,556
Well, Ichigo, we
should probably
go. Let's move out.

10
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:24,159
(Kon)
Wait!

11
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:26,197
(Ichigo)
What is it,
Kon?

12
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,535
I'm going
too!

13
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,449
That's a
noble thought,
but...

14
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:35,886
Well, you
see...

15
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,458
I don't know if
I'll be any kind
of help, really.

16
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,862
I mean, ya
know...

17
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:42,935
...since I'm
soft like this.
But well...

18
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:45,407
I wanna try
to save
Nozomi too.

19
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,746
No! I will
save her!

20
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,822
Nozomi!
Wait!

21
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:53,459
[shouting]

22
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,463
Grrrr!

23
00:02:55,463 --> 00:03:00,207
Nozomi!!!

24
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:08,893
So, can
I go?

25
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,506
[sighs]

26
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:16,611
[sad grumble]

27
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:18,683
(Ichigo)
Of course you
can come with
us.

28
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:19,918
[happy gasp]

29
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:22,992
Well, you were
the one who
brought her to
us after all.

30
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:26,867
I'd say it's
your duty to
see this thing
to the end.

31
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:28,906
Thank you.

32
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,650
(Ichigo)
You better
hold onto it
this time...

33
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,620
For good luck!

34
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:37,358
You'll do
great!

35
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,262
Now don't
get in our
way.

36
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,668
And don't
blame us if
you end up
in pieces.

37
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,273
If that
happens, I'll
patch him
back up.

38
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:44,942
Mhm.

39
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:46,712
(Chad)
Do your best.

40
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:49,586
Alright.
Let's go!

41
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:51,824
(Kisuke)
But, before we
leave, there's
something else...

42
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,029
I've got a
favor to
ask of you.

43
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:55,732
(All)
Hm???

44
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,005
[sinister chuckle]

45
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:20,522
[Alarm sounding]
Hm!?

46
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:21,591
[gasp]

47
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:23,563
Master
Kageroza!

48
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,600
Is it them?

49
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:29,977
Yes. We've picked
up several Spirit
Energy signatures in
the Precipice World.

50
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:34,587
(Nanao)
I'll alert our forces to
intercept them at the
Senkaimon immediately...

51
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,601
All right!
Time to come
on out!

52
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:58,909
[running breaths]

53
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,080
[running breaths]

54
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:11,036
That's odd.
there's no sign
of any of them
exiting.

55
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,611
(Toshiro)
Hey!

56
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:18,052
It seems stupid
to just wait for
them to show up
here at the gate.

57
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,057
I'll go
greet em!

58
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:22,762
[frustrated grunt]

59
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:26,638
[grunt]

60
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:27,640
[grunt]

61
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:28,776
[attack yell]

62
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,750
[attack roar]

63
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:35,726
I thought I'd
come and greet
you properly.

64
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:37,830
[gasp]

65
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:38,798
(Toshiro Reigai)
Hold it!

66
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:39,935
Huh?

67
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,405
(Toshiro Reigai)
Look!

68
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,545
Heh.

69
00:05:45,547 --> 00:05:47,552
(Kisuke)
I've got a
favor to ask
of you...

70
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,962
My plan is that
Ichigo, myself,
and Kon--

71
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:54,835
--we three will
make our way into
the Soul Society.

72
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:55,904
Yeah!

73
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:01,650
I'd say it's safe to assume
that the invading Reigai army
has already set up a defense
line around the Senkaimon--

74
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:03,789
--to prevent us
from getting
through.

75
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,194
So how are we
going to get
past their
defense line?

76
00:06:06,227 --> 00:06:11,038
Ichigo and I are best
suited to do it because
I can shut down my
own Spirit Energy--

77
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:13,110
--and he's
unfortunately
lost his...

78
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,582
So. then what do
you want us to do
to help out?

79
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:18,456
(Kisuke)
I want all of you
to get the Reigai
to focus on you.

80
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:22,197
Meaning... act
as a decoy.

81
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:29,012
Hold on. Just how
exactly are you planning
to sneak yourselves into
the Soul Society?

82
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:32,120
I have a way.

83
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,543
Oh- This place!?

84
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:52,165
This is where
Nozomi tried to
hide from
Kageroza.

85
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:53,501
That's right.

86
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:56,608
Even Kageroza
would never
expect it.

87
00:06:56,642 --> 00:07:02,054
Trying to enter the
Soul Society from such
an unstable portal as
this particular place...

88
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:06,798
Well, time
to go, boys.

89
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,802
Okay!

90
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:16,185
[gasp]
So that's what
they've done!

91
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,190
Kenpachi!
Come with me!

92
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:20,061
Hell if
I will!

93
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:23,803
You expect me to
ignore our prey
when it's right
in front of me!?

94
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:24,638
[gasp]

95
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,244
[attack roar]

96
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:34,661
You idiot!!

97
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:37,835
These guys are
just decoys!
Let's go!

98
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:40,340
[grunt]

99
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:45,585
That's enough,
Renji!
[grunt]

100
00:07:45,618 --> 00:07:47,055
We should
fall back.

101
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:47,990
Yeah.

102
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,899
All we can do
now is hope
for the best.

103
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:55,006
[thinking]
Ichigo...

104
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,220
So far so good!

105
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:03,024
Ahhhg I'm
gonna die!!!

106
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:06,633
Suck it up, Kon!
If the Reigai find
us here, it's
all over!

107
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,604
We're almost
there!

108
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,675
(Kon)
[whimpering]

109
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:13,816
[grunt]

110
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:16,756
Hey!! Why the
sudden flop and
stop, jerk face!?

111
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:19,195
I thought you
guys didn't want
them to discover
us here!!

112
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:20,765
Exactly.

113
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:24,674
Which is why we're
going to take a
slightly different
approach.

114
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:46,256
Let's begin,
Lieutenant Ise.
Time is of the
essence,

115
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:48,895
Yes Sir,
but...

116
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,735
...considering
your present state,
are you sure you
want to do this?

117
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:53,772
I'm aware
of the risks.

118
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:57,047
It's possible that
the fusion might be
rather unstable...

119
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:59,786
...but with my
medications,
I'll manage it.

120
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:08,172
Alright, I'm
counting on the
two of you to make
this succeed.

121
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:24,977
[yawn]

122
00:09:27,849 --> 00:09:29,454
(Ichigo)
Is this the
place?

123
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:31,091
(Kisuke)
It should be...

124
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:33,328
[panting]
[gasp]

125
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:35,433
Nozomi!!!

126
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:38,106
We've come
to rescue you!

127
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,844
(Kon)
Nozomi!!!

128
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:41,414
What the hell?

129
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,153
This whole
place is
completely
empty!

130
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:46,125
What's going
on here!?

131
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:47,929
(Kisuke)
Just calm
down, Ichigo.

132
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,100
I can't stay
calm when we
find this!

133
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:54,743
Look there's no
one in here, much
less Nozomi or
Kageroza!

134
00:09:54,743 --> 00:09:56,448
[gasp]

135
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:59,989
I'm just as
worried about
Nozomi as you
are--

136
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:03,296
But right now,
we should focus
on the task at
hand.

137
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:07,740
(Kisuke)
I've locked us in so
that no one from
outside will disturb us.

138
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,112
That should buy
us a little more
time in here.

139
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:15,491
I'd say we should
being by restoring
your powers, Ichigo.

140
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:21,772
(Kon)
Hey! What's
this!?

141
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,315
It seems to be
a device for
creating Soul
Candies...

142
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:27,985
Soul Candies!?

143
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,825
I thought this
room was for
making Mod Souls.

144
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:32,462
(Kisuke)
It's just here
as a cover up.

145
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:36,305
Supposedly he was
working for the
Department of Research
and Development.

146
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:40,213
It would draw
suspicion if he wasn't
doing legitimate
research here.

147
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:42,184
(Kisuke)
To avert unwanted
questions--

148
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:45,893
(Kisuke)
--he used this Soul
Candy-making device
to justify his work.

149
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:47,263
But the fact
is...

150
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:51,539
Every piece of
equipment in here is
specifically used for
creating Reigai.

151
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:54,479
Are you
serious!?

152
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:58,355
This whole time
Kageroza was
creating Reigai,
right here!?

153
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:01,027
In the Department
of Research and
Development!?

154
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,099
Right.

155
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:16,963
Let's get
to work.

156
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:18,834
It's show
time, here
we go.

157
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,158
So what
now?

158
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:36,006
I'm gonna apply the
technology used to
create Mod Souls to
restore your Spirit Energy.

159
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:39,346
(Kisuke)
First, I'll restore the
Reishi data in the form
of a Mod Soul--

160
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,120
(Kisuke)
--then fuse that
data with your
own soul.

161
00:11:42,153 --> 00:11:48,234
(Kisuke)
I'd imagine this was the same
method Kageroza used to create
each member of his clone army.

162
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:52,243
However, since you're
not a Reigai, there's
a lot more risk involved.

163
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:56,419
Your soul will
be extremely strained
by this process.

164
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:59,559
Right. I'm
sure I can
handle it.

165
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,103
Very well then.
So let's get
started.

166
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:15,428
So what exactly
are you doing now?

167
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:19,404
I'm acquiring the
Mod Soul-creation
data that Kageroza
accessed--

168
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:21,643
--so we can
utilize it for
our purposes.

169
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:24,482
You could say that
I'm hacking into
the system...

170
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:27,322
Hacking!?
Wow, Kisuke!
That's awesome!

171
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:31,464
Well, I was the founder
of the Department
of Research and
Development, you know.

172
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:45,195
Guys! Keep in mind
we can't spend too
much time in here!

173
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:51,076
Lieutenant
Kurotsuchi!

174
00:12:52,044 --> 00:12:55,018
The fusion index
is not increasing!

175
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:57,958
It's just as we
feared! What's
the status on
your end?!

176
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:07,713
Okay! Soon
we'll have a
Mod Soul.

177
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:18,070
Wait, there's
something I
don't get--

178
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:22,547
--The way I understand
this, Kageroza wasn't
able to reproduce my
Hollow powers.

179
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,151
Correct.

180
00:13:24,184 --> 00:13:28,293
What we're doing
here is extracting
only the Spirit Energy
from your Reishi--

181
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:31,667
--then copying it,
and putting that
energy into a
Mod Soul.

182
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:35,343
(Kisuke)
But this process
won't restore your
Hollow powers.

183
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:38,282
Is it enough to
restore my Spirit
Energy though?

184
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:41,490
Yeah. If my
calculations
are right.

185
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:45,566
What's wrong!?
[gasp]

186
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:46,735
[gasp]

187
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:50,310
It looks like
Kageroza knew
our plan all
along.

188
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:51,579
Whaaaa?!

189
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,350
[pleased chuckle]

190
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:14,264
(Reaper)
Yushima!?

191
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:16,334
Hnh?

192
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:18,606
What a surprise!
I thought it was you!

193
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:23,284
Somebody told me
you were getting
inducted. So then
it is true!

194
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:27,861
Seems to me that when
you were at the Soul
Reaper Academy, you had
a hard time graduating!

195
00:14:28,094 --> 00:14:30,300
I'm very glad
things worked
out for you!

196
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,305
Hm. Thanks.

197
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,077
(Reaper)
Hey! If you need
anything, just ask!

198
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,421
You see, starting
this Spring, I've been
appointed as Eighth Seat
of Squad Nine--

199
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:42,628
I might be
able to help
you sometime.

200
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:46,236
[angry groan]

201
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:48,574
(Commander)
We've confirmed the
appearance of a Hollow
in the Rukon District!

202
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:49,610
[gasp]

203
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:51,848
Move out immediately
and subdue it!

204
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:52,750
(Reapers)
Yessir!

205
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:53,519
Uhh, Sir?

206
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,655
(Reapers)
Hm?

207
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:58,129
Excuse me, Sir.
But could I go
along on this
patrol too?

208
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,533
You're just
not up to this!

209
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,406
Subduing a Hollow
is a real battle, son!

210
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:07,117
And sending a rookie like
you on a patrol where
men's lives are on the line
would be too reckless!

211
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,856
I can do this!
I'm not weak!

212
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:13,230
[gasp]
A transfer?

213
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:18,576
Yes, starting next week
you will be transferred to
Squad Twelve- The Department
of Research and Development,

214
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:21,783
But, Sir! I
was just recently
assigned here!

215
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:25,157
Yushima, you are
simply not cut out
for combat...

216
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,162
[gasp]

217
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:29,601
(Commanding Officer)
Listen, young man, You're
very smart and it's pretty
obvious you're a hard worker.

218
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:34,745
(commanding Officer)
Now wouldn't you rather be
assigned to a Squad where you
can use your unique talents?

219
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:40,926
(Yushima)
[attack yell]

220
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:43,431
(Yushima)
[attack yell]

221
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:46,840
(Yushima)
[attack yell]

222
00:15:47,575 --> 00:15:52,386
(Yushima)
Why!? Why won't
they acknowledge
me!? Why!?

223
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,691
(Yushima)
[frustrated yell]

224
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:58,332
(Yushima)
[frustrated yell]

225
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,804
What are you
saying!?

226
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:05,615
Your project Spearhead
has been deemed too
inhumane to continue
forward.

227
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:08,822
(Judge)
As of this moment,
Project Spearhead
will be terminated--

228
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:12,364
(Judge)
--and all research
data concerning Mod
Souls is to be destroyed!

229
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:13,199
[shocked gasp]

230
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,871
No wait! Please!
I beg of you!

231
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,213
I demand an
explanation!!

232
00:16:23,622 --> 00:16:27,698
(Officer 1)
Open up! This
research wing was
ordered closed!

233
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,407
(Officer 2)
You need to open this
door! And relinquish
control immediately!

234
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,746
(Officer 2)
Any resistance
will be considered
treason!

235
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,951
(Officer 3)
Open up right
now! This is your
last warning!

236
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:38,890
[frantic breaths]

237
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:39,826
[determined grunt]

238
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:49,247
[grunting]

239
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:51,619
(Officer 1)
Don't move!

240
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,270
(Officers)
[gasps]

241
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,706
(Officer 2)
Hey, what
happened!?

242
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,942
(Officer 4)
Damn it!
Call Squad
Four! Quickly!

243
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:10,628
(Thinking)
Hide... Lose yourself
among those incompetent
Soul Reapers...

244
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,335
(Thinking)
...and hide
your existence...

245
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:16,676
(Yushima Thinking)
...and one day, my
legacy shall be
fulfilled.

246
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:21,420
(Yushima Thinking)
You two will carry
on my will and
complete my research!

247
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:40,396
(Thinking)
Kon...
Ichigo...

248
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,614
(Ichigo)
[Grunting]

249
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:51,621
[groaning]

250
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:52,991
Huh?

251
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:55,430
Is my power
back?

252
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:56,532
(Kisuke)
Ichigo!

253
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:57,401
[gasp]

254
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:59,806
What a relief,
you're alright.

255
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,348
Yeah. But-
What happened?

256
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:05,553
This was all
Kageroza's doing.

257
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:07,925
He had us
completely
figured out.

258
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:12,636
I kinda had this
feeling the whole time
that our plan was going
a little too smoothly.

259
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:14,506
But, hey!
It's all
good!

260
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,678
Look! I got
my Spirit
Energy back.

261
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,517
[gasp] You did!?
So how did that
happen?

262
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:21,723
Well...

263
00:18:21,756 --> 00:18:24,596
(Ichigo)
A few seconds before
the explosion, I grabbed
the Mod Soul Candy--

264
00:18:24,629 --> 00:18:26,901
(Ichigo)
--from inside the
capsule...

265
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:29,039
Okay, I see.

266
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:29,974
But that...

267
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:30,944
(Ichigo)
Kon!

268
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,146
Hnh?

269
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:33,883
Kon's not
here!

270
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,487
We have to
find him!

271
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:42,804
Kon! Where
are you!?
Hey!!

272
00:18:42,804 --> 00:18:44,106
Kon!

273
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,180
[struggling grunts]

274
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,058
Kon... are
you,,, dead?

275
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:53,628
I'm not dead!!!

276
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:57,738
You can't kill
me off! I am
invincible!

277
00:18:57,771 --> 00:19:01,412
Hey, there's
something coming
out of your elbow.

278
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:03,951
Ahhhh!
My stuffing!
Ahhhh!

279
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:08,595
Oh no! I'm
going to
die...

280
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:10,967
Didn't you just
just say you were
invincible?

281
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,805
(Reaper 1)
It sounded like
it was over here!

282
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,576
(Reaper 2)
Yeah! The explosion
came from Inaba's
lab!

283
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:17,181
They're heading
here. So we better
get moving, quick.

284
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:18,016
Right!

285
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:20,222
[gasp in pain]

286
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:23,529
Ichigo! What's
wrong!?

287
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,071
What's...
happening...
[painful grunts]

288
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:29,075
[groaning]

289
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:30,845
Woah! Your
eyes! What
the--!?

290
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:32,582
[gasp]

291
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:36,993
Hey! What's
going on here!?

292
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:38,763
This isn't
good.

293
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:42,772
That Mod Soul
that you swallowed
earlier wasn't
completely formed.

294
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:47,684
(Kisuke)
So as a result, your
restored Spirit Energy
is extremely unstable.

295
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:53,162
(Kisuke)
In your current state,
your Hollow powers will
rage our of control--

296
00:19:53,197 --> 00:19:55,635
And then they
will take
over me!?

297
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:58,809
Are you serious!?
Can't we help him
out at all!?

298
00:19:58,842 --> 00:20:01,113
There is a
way...

299
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:04,922
(Kisuke)
Even though Kageroza's
main objective is to
fuse with Nozomi--

300
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:07,061
(Kisuke)
He still possesses
a huge ego.

301
00:20:07,094 --> 00:20:12,105
(Kisuke)
Because of that, he wouldn't
be willing to sacrifice his
precious research...

302
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:16,649
So that's gotta
mean that he must
have a separate lab
located somewhere else.

303
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,251
A lab?

304
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:19,054
A research
laboratory.

305
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:20,791
I know
that!

306
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:22,997
So let's
go find
that lab!

307
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,533
Okay.

308
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:27,941
Once we're there,
we should be able
to stabilize your
Spirit Energy.

309
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:32,051
And also, I
think we'll
find Nozomi
there as well.

310
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:34,757
[struggling breaths]

311
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:39,601
Hold on!
Are you sure
you're okay?!

312
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:41,305
Yeah, I'll
be fine.

313
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:43,176
(Reaper 1)
Who's there!?
You!

314
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,682
(Reaper 2)
What are you
doing here! Stand
Still!

315
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:47,218
(Reapers)
[attack charge]

316
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:48,889
Come on!

317
00:20:50,926 --> 00:21:02,786
[running breaths]

318
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:07,097
We've expected
you.

319
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,867
Damn, Ichigo.

320
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,609
It sure doesn't
look to me like
you've gotten back
much of your power.

321
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:15,215
But we won't
show you mercy!

322
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:17,620
[angry breath]

323
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:23,266
Damn! We're
surrounded!

324
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:27,075
Just because
we're outnumbered
doesn't mean
we'll give up!

325
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:29,280
Ichigo...
Yeah?

326
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:32,086
I'll keep these
guys occupied...

327
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,625
...while the
two of you
get past them!

328
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,630
What are
you saying!?

329
00:21:39,202 --> 00:21:41,374
(Yoroichi)
A suicide dash!?

330
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:42,911
-Huh?
-[gasp]
-[gasp]

331
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:46,753
How pathetic
of you...

332
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:49,125
What are you
doing here?

333
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:50,929
I'm not
alone.

334
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:00,885
You're all
here! You're
all alive!

335
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:05,294
Now then. It's
time for a real
fight!

336
00:23:46,857 --> 00:23:51,201
(Yoroichi)
Say, Kisuke. Don't you
think I deserve a gift for
saving your butt back there?

337
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:53,406
(Kisuke)
Yes of course.
How bout some
cat nip?

338
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:54,508
(Yoruichi)
Nope.

339
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,145
(Kisuke)
I'll add some
new sand for your
litter box!

340
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:57,247
(Yoruichi)
Nope!

341
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,252
(Kisuke)
Then I'll also
add an expensive
can of cat food.

342
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:00,304
(Yoruichi)
Deal!

343
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:01,239
(Ichigo)
You're good
with that?
