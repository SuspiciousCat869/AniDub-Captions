NARRATOR: The final
showdown with the Arrancars

3
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:51,633
is this winter.

4
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:55,933
Ichigo, Chad, Uryu,
Rukia, and Orihime

5
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:58,300
have all been undergoing
intense training,

6
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,867
pushing their
bodies to the limit

7
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,200
to get as strong as possible
with the little time they have.

8
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:06,967
Meanwhile, Captain Hitsugaya
and his advance troops

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,067
have remained in Karakura Town.

10
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,133
As they prepare for the
inevitable showdown,

11
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:14,567
they're forced to
battle powerful Hollows.

12
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,167
Then the situation
takes a dramatic turn.

-I think I've got it.

15
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:45,033
I've got some kind
of reaction here.

16
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:46,233
-What about the Gentei Kaijo?

17
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,467
-It's been authorized.

18
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,633
-The reaction, what color is it?

19
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,633
-It's crimson.

20
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:54,433
They're Espadas!

-That's quite a coincidence.

24
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,933
I'm also a 10.

Arrancar 10, better
known as Yammy.

00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,267
-That's right.

28

This is exactly what I've
been training for, damn it.

34
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,900
What good is it gonna
do if I don't go?

35
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,600

You don't have a hell butterfly.

If you try to pass through
the Senkaimon with me,

44
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:01,467
you'll end up in the Dongai,
the border between the world

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,167
of the living the Soul Society.

46
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,733
-I just ordered the outer
wall to be stabilized

47
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:09,600
so you'll be able to pass
through the Dongai safely.

48
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:13,833
I know you're in a hurry,
but you have to stay calm.

Understand?

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,967

you on the other side.

-And I've been waiting for you.

00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,500
It's taken me some time,
but I'm ready to show you

55
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:50,300
what I've learned since
the last time we met.

56
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:50,800
-Hm.

57
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,767
-Bankai!

58
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:14,600
-Maybe you've forgotten.

59
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:17,267
Your Bankai couldn't
stop me or do anything

60
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,533
to even slow me down
the first time we met.

61
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:21,200
-Oh really?

62
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,967
Maybe you've forgotten.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,733
I gave you that scar
when I used my Bankai.

64
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,833
Let me ask you one
thing, Grimmjow.

65
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:39,233
Your left arm.

66
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:40,667
Tell me what happened to it.

67
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,200
-Oh, I got rid of
it, because I'm only

68
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:50,533
going to need one
arm to kill you.

69
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:51,467
-Is that right?

70
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:58,667
In that case, I guess I
don't need to hold back.

71
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,433
-If you do, then
you'll just die faster!

-Sorry.

77
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,833
I don't have time to
explain it to you.

00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:11,933
It was so refreshing.

Espada without using my Bankai,

00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,033
-See?

84
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,467
I tried to tell you.

85
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,567
You Really don't stand a chance
in a one-on-one confrontation

86
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
with me.

87
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:29,333
You just don't get it.

88
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:30,400
-Shut the hell up.

89
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:36,233
-Will you please try to talk
some sense into your friend?

90
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:40,133
He doesn't seem to understand
that he's about to die.

91
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,733
-Two on one fights
don't do it for me.

92
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:44,133
-Oh please.

93
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:45,667
This is so annoying.

94
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,567
Yammy?

95
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,867
-Huh?

96
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,367
-Let me have that kid
you're fighting, too.

97
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,467
-What?

98
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,367
-It's so tedious
fighting them this way.

99
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,600
I'd rather take all
four of them on at once.

100
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:06,500
I'll simply release my power
and finally put an end to all

101
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:07,567
your boring lives.

HITSUGAYA (VOICEOVER):
His Zanpakuto.

103
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,933
He's going to release it.

104
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,033
I won't let you.

105
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,000

00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:27,833

-Strangle, Trepadora.

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,500
-You must be kidding.

109
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:57,000
Is that all you've got?

110
00:08:57,033 --> 00:09:01,333
I'd have expected more damage
from your full release.

111
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,767
-That was nicely done.

112
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
I honestly thought
you weren't going

113
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,633
to be able to block that attack.

114
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:08,733
I have to admit.

115
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:09,700
I'm a little surprised.

116
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,433
I guess you captains
are pretty tough, huh?

117
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:16,900
I'll have to watch my step.

118
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,400
But just think.

119
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:26,467
That attack.

120
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,233
the one you were able
to block just now.

121
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:36,000
Would you be able to stop it if
it were eight times stronger?

122
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,400
-What the-- What is that?

123
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:49,733
Damn.

124
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:50,233
-Captain!

125
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,167
-I told you.

126
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,333
Four against one would've
been much better odds.

127
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:03,167
Oh, I'm sorry.

128
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,400
I meant four against eight.

129
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:08,767
-What's taking so long?

130
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,733
Where is it?

131
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,000
Finally.

132
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,267
-Renji!

133
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,800
-Rukia.

134
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,500
How's it going?

135
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,067
-Renji, what are you doing here?

136
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,600
I thought everyone
had been notified

137
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:30,233
that the Espada have appeared.

138
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:34,400
-Yeah, well, I did hear about
that, but I trained so hard

139
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,567
that I exhausted my
spiritual pressure.

140
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,967
-We're massaging him right now.

141
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,600
This will help.

142
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:40,567
-You idiot.

143
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,867
What the hell's the
matter with you?

144
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,700
-Sorry, but they're not
exactly the kind of guys

145
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:48,300
you want to take on
when you're not 100%.

146
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:52,133
And besides, Kisuke
said he'd handle it.

147
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,067
-Kisuke said that?

148
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,567
-You can't come with me.

149
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,133
You've used up too much
energy, so I'll go,

150
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,600
and you stay here and rest.

151
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,533
Understand?

152
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:02,533
-I can't.

153
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,200
-Yes, that's right.

154
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:06,667
It's just as Renji
explained to you.

155
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,567
But it seems to me
that you are nearly

156
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,533
exhausted as well, Renji.

157
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,067
Both of you, stay here and rest.

158
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:22,600
Instead, I'll go.

159
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:42,600
-This power of yours.

160
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:44,200
It's not the power
of a Soul Reaper.

161
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:49,933
Damn you.

162
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:52,833
It's only been a month.

163
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,467
What the hell did
you do to yourself?

164
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,733
-I already told you.

165
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:05,567
I don't have time to explain.

166
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:27,500
[scream]

167
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:28,000
-A Cero!

168
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:44,821
A Cero!

00:12:53,788 --> 00:12:55,255
[shout]

170
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:13,555
-Ha!

171
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:14,055
-Ha!

172
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,755
-It's over, Grimmjow.

173
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,188
Yah!

174
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:56,588
My mask.

175
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:04,555
-Ha.

176
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:06,021
Your luck's run
out, Soul Reaper!

177
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:12,488
-My mask!

178
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:25,788
-Whatever that
power was just now,

179
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:28,088
it looks like you
may have overdone it.

180
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:30,355
You started panting
like a worn out dog

181
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:32,288
the second that mask came off.

182
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:34,155
It's over, Soul Reaper.

183
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:36,521
I have to admit,
you did some damage,

184
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:39,988
but there was never any
doubt of the outcome.

185
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:41,855
You were no match for me!

186
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:55,421
-Resisting is useless.

187
00:15:03,055 --> 00:15:06,655
Man, you guys are too
pathetic for words.

188
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:08,588
Are you sure you're
really officers

189
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:11,055
in the 13 Court Guard Squads?

190
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:12,155
How lame.

191
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:13,221
Really.

192
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:13,955
-You bastard.

193
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:21,321
[sigh]

194
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,088
-I'm bored.

195
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:24,888
Luppi's taken them all.

196
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,655
Now what am I supposed to do?

197
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:30,155
I guess I could go look
for someone else to fight,

198
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:31,655
but that's too much trouble.

199
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:38,155
What the-- hey.

200
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,421
Hey, you.

201
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:40,255
Rookie!

202
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:42,121
What are you doing over there?

203
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,755
Hmph.

204
00:15:58,788 --> 00:15:59,421
I'm so bored.

205
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:03,188
-Huh?

206
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:08,321
-Rangiku!

207
00:16:08,355 --> 00:16:10,855
Hang on!

208
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,488
Yumichika!

209
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,155
Dammit, let go of me!

210
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:16,288
-Could you be anymore repulsive?

211
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:18,188
-Why, you-- I'm gonna--

212
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:30,021
-I don't know if anyone's
ever told you this before,

213
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,955
but you've got a smokin' body.

214
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:36,688
Yes, indeed, you have
definitely got it going on.

215
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:44,688
Wonder how you'd look if I
punched you full of holes.

216
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:45,455
-You bastard!

217
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:46,421
-Dammit, stop!

218
00:16:58,055 --> 00:17:01,288
URAHARA: Well, looks like
I made it just in time.

219
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:04,621
That was certainly
close, wasn't it?

220
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:05,388
-Who are you?

221
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:06,821
Why are you interrupting?

222
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:08,721
-Oh, I'm sorry.

223
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:11,088
I didn't have time to
properly introduce myself.

224
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:18,755
MAN: Inoue.

225
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,688
Orihime Inoue.

226
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:24,621
We have finished stabilizing
the walls of the Dongai.

227
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,421
You may now pass through.

228
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:28,555
-All right.

229
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,388
-Be careful.

230
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:32,688
-Thank you for
everything you've done.

231
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:33,188
Goodbye!

232
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,088
-Huh?

233
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,855
-We shall accompany you.

234
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:46,655
-Oh.

235
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:48,488
But I'll be fine on my own.

236
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:50,088
-You're not an intruder anymore.

237
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:51,921
You're our guest now.

238
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:53,021
-Your guest?

239
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:54,988
-Two Soul Reapers
without hell butterflies

240
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:56,688
customarily escort
a guest when they

241
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:58,721
travel between the two worlds.

242
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:01,188
Sorry for the inconvenience,
but you understand.

243
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:02,021
-Sure.

244
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:02,888
All right.

245
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:04,355
You lead the way, then.

246
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:10,655
If I can get there quickly,
I know it'll be all right.

247
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:14,555
During this past month, I feel
like I've gotten stronger.

248
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:16,455
Once I get there, I
know I can help them.

249
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:18,121
So hang on, Ichigo.

250
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:20,855
I'm coming.

251
00:18:20,888 --> 00:18:22,221
ULQUIORRA: What's this?

252
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:24,855
Only two guards?

253
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,655
-Huh?

254
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,488
ULQUIORRA: The Soul
Society's incompetence

255
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:33,288
never ceases to amaze me.

256
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,788
They just don't
seem to unerstand

257
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:39,721
that a person is most vulnerable
when they're traveling.

258
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:49,555
-The name's Kisuke Urahara.

259
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:52,188
I own a small candy store
in the neighborhood.

260
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:54,155
Perhaps you've heard of it?

261
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:56,488
Anyway, it's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

262
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:04,721
-Ha ha ha!

263
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:06,521
-Uh, don't take this
is the wrong way,

264
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:08,288
but your friend seems
to be a little odd.

265
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:11,488
Huh?

266
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,221
ORIHIME (VOICEOVER):
The one from before.

267
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:40,988
-Only two guards.

268
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:44,555
I must admit, I'm disappointed
in the Soul Society.

269
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:47,321
Although it is convenient that
the restricted currents here

270
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:50,088
have been frozen.

271
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:53,055
It's not in my nature
to burst in like this,

272
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:56,555
but I thought that
we needed to talk.

273
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:58,221
-Who the hell are you, anyway?

274
00:19:58,255 --> 00:20:01,155
Are you an Arrancar?

275
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:02,155
-No, don't!

276
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:04,155
You said you wanted to talk!

277
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:04,655
-Argh!

278
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,621
-Yes, I came here to talk.

279
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:14,188
I have something
important to tell you.

280
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:14,821
-Soten Kisshun!

281
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:21,521
Get out of here.

282
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,688
Run while you still can!

283
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:26,055
-But-- but--

284
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:27,388
-You've gotta get out of here!

285
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:28,821
He'll kill you!

286
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:29,321
-Ah!

287
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:36,155
-Ayame!

288
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:48,888
-I must say, that's quite an
impressive ability you possess.

289
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,555
To heal wounds that deep.

290
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:58,488
Now, come with me, little girl.

291
00:20:58,521 --> 00:20:59,121
Don't speak.

292
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:04,255
Yes is all I want to hear.

293
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:08,588
If you say anything other
than that, people will die.

294
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:09,721
I don't mean you.

295
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:16,455
I'm talking about those
who are closest to you.

296
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:21,555
Don't ask any questions.

297
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:23,921
Don't tell me anything.

298
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:26,121
You have no rights.

299
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:28,721
The only thing you
do have is the rope

300
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:32,321
holding the blade of the
guillotine, safely suspended

301
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:34,888
above the necks of your friends.

302
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:38,821
Make no mistake, little girl.

303
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:41,755
This is not a negotiation.

304
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:42,755
It's an order.

305
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:53,321
For some reason, Lord Aizen has
decided he wants your power.

306
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,255
He dispatched me
here with orders

307
00:21:55,288 --> 00:21:56,388
to bring you back unharmed.

308
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:02,021
I'll only say this
one more time.

309
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:08,588
Come with me, little girl.

KURODO: Would anyone care
to try our mod-soul massage?

312
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,520
Our service can cure your
fatigue in just one minute.

RANGIKU: What are
you doing, Renji?

RENJI: They helped
me out earlier,

317
00:23:54,187 --> 00:23:56,087
so I'm giving them a
hand with their business.
