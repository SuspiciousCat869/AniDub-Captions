1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,966
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,633
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,466
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,633
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper...
And dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,466
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:41,761
All right...I'd better
get going to help out the
others...

7
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,627
<i>Your back is wide</i>
<i>open to attack.</i>

8
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:03,461
You're finished.

9
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,461
What was that?

10
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:25,494
Is that...

11
00:03:35,227 --> 00:03:36,794
That Spiritual
Pressure...

12
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:40,461
That's right. Now you
remember...

13
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:47,861
It belongs to Squad
Eleven's leader.
Captain Kenpachi Zaraki.

14
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:05,894
Kenpachi!

15
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:15,061
Looks like you guys have
been going at this all
wrong, Ichigo.

16
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:20,694
What a way to announce
your belated arrival. It's
bad enough you're late,

17
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,694
but why make a
spectacle of it?

18
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:28,694
Hey, be quiet I rushed
to get here as quick as I
could to help you guys out,
so don't give me any grief.

19
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:32,727
Well, maybe I did make a
little bit of a mess, but
that's just my style.

20
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:35,261
So...

21
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:38,694
I hope you left me one of
them to play with.

22
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:48,161
Doesn't look like it.
Then I'll go do as I
please.

23
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:52,694
You're in my way. I
don't like it...

24
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:00,194
Hey...

25
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:05,827
You're trying to cut me
down, aren't you? Come
on, not with this dull
thing.

26
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:11,327
I really don't have time
to be bothered with someone
like you. You're not at my
level.

27
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:18,794
What No!

28
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,627
Amazing!

29
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:28,694
He forced him back into
sword form in a single
blow!

30
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:33,561
That's what happens
to a Zanpakuto when it is
slain by someone other
than its own wielder.

31
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:39,461
The relationship between
a Zanpakuto and a Soul
Reaper is one of
communication, synergy,

32
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:44,561
and subjugation.
However, when a third
party becomes involved,
that relationship can no

33
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,094
longer be.

34
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:48,827
Let this be a lesson to
all of you.

35
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:51,727
You sure talk big!
You're such a smart-ass!

36
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,561
Who's next?!

37
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:05,627
This is exactly what I
expected from the
bloodthirsty Captain of
Squad Eleven.

38
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:09,361
He snapped that Zanpakuto
without one bit of
finesse!

39
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:15,794
His Spiritual Pressure is
too rough and ugly. It
doesn't appeal to me.

40
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:18,294
You feel the same way
about it, don't you?

41
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,827
What do you mean?

42
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:24,394
You might not want to
admit it, but you and I
are very much alike.

43
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,727
What are you talking
about?

44
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:31,494
You know. We both live
according to our
appreciation for
aesthetics.

45
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:34,294
Beauty must prevail above
all.

46
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:39,594
But you're in the wrong
place right now. I mean,
look, you're here among
these slow-witted,

47
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:45,161
boorish and hot-tempered
Soul Reapers. If you
unleashed your true
power, they'd only make

48
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:49,061
fun of you, and knowing
that worries you quite a
bit, right?

49
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:54,327
Kenpachi Zaraki and
Ikkaku Madarame have no
appreciation for aesthetics.

50
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:58,694
Being unable to express
yourself has made you feel
inadequate in their squad.

51
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:03,061
It really can't be
helped.

52
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:06,661
That's what happens to a
half- hearted narcissist,
preoccupied with himself

53
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:09,694
and always concerned
about how people see him.

54
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:11,661
Just make your point.

55
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:16,627
My point is, you won't
accept your own powers
because you have a fear of how
people will perceive you...

56
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:22,294
...So you can never win
against someone like me,
who willingly accepts and
believes in his own powers.

57
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:25,561
I believe you talk too
much.

58
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:31,661
I don't need your
sarcasm. Well, what do
you think? Shall we end
it now?

59
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:40,161
See you, Master. Or
perhaps not.

60
00:07:45,694 --> 00:07:47,661
Kenpachi Zaraki, eh?

61
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:51,527
Impressive. With the
kind of Spiritual Pressure
that he has, no wonder it
only took a

62
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:54,561
single blow to put
Wabisuke away.

63
00:07:54,594 --> 00:08:00,294
Or maybe it only took a
single blow simply because
Wabisuke was an idiot to
attack in such a careless way!

64
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:04,461
Kenpachi! Where were
you hiding before you
snuck up on us?

65
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:09,761
You think I've just been
hiding? You better watch
your mouth, I don't like
being talked to like that.

66
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:13,861
Hey! Time out!--I'll
explain where he's been!

67
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:18,827
Here's what happened...
Kenny went to get rid of
some Hollows in the outskirts
of the Rucon District!

68
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:23,561
When he got word he was
needed here, he tried to
hurry back, but along the
way he became totally

69
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:28,761
lost---didn't have a clue
where he was. And that's
why he ended up being so
late!

70
00:08:28,794 --> 00:08:31,994
You're blabbering about
unnecessary stuff! Cut
it out!

71
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:34,427
But why? I'm only
telling the truth!

72
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:38,661
We found that sweet shop
on the ridge, but we just
passed it right on by!

73
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:41,161
Don't you remember, I
said we'd go there next
time.

74
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:43,227
<i>Oh, do you really mean</i>
<i>it?!-- Promise?!</i>

75
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:46,627
Time to focus. What's
with this lack of attention?

76
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,961
You'll have to get down.
I must rampage.

77
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:55,661
Now then...

78
00:08:55,694 --> 00:09:01,761
I have a question for
you. Who amongst you
is... the strongest?

79
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:12,727
Looks like we've got a
troublemaker to deal
with.

80
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,594
So it would appear.

81
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:17,427
Why don't you leave this
to me?

82
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:18,761
All right.

83
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,594
You'd better go now.

84
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,127
Bankai.

85
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:36,961
What impudence!

86
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:40,161
A lowly Zanpakuto....

87
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:42,627
...shouldn't be so
arrogant!

88
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:47,494
What's happening?!

89
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:50,094
Is this his true power?

90
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:53,227
He's impressive as
always.

91
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,494
Captain Zaraki!

92
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:02,194
Impossible!

93
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:13,094
What power...

94
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:18,127
Can't stand... this
Spirit Energy!

95
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:27,861
You're in my way...

96
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:54,427
Seems like it's finally
begun.

97
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:57,894
I have to say, to feel
that power from this far
away...

98
00:10:57,927 --> 00:11:01,127
That Soul Reaper must
be truly exceptional.

99
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:06,461
No matter You'll only
be able to feel his
Spiritual Pressure a
few moments more.

100
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:16,561
I like that look on your
face. The look of fear
that comes over you,
right before death.

101
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:19,961
I hope for your sake...
That you die beautifully.

102
00:11:32,227 --> 00:11:34,227
I've decided...

103
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,927
Did you say you've
decided?

104
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,727
Yes... that's
right.

105
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:43,027
And just what did you
decide? You're not
about to tell me that
you've made the decision

106
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:45,894
to accept your death
gracefully, are you?

107
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:47,661
'Cause it's a little
late for that.

108
00:11:47,694 --> 00:11:49,861
Sorry to disappoint
you...

109
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:52,927
But I have no intention
of accepting my death.

110
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:55,161
I've decided to defeat
you.

111
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:03,527
It's indeed true
that I was worried
about what Ikkaku and
Captain Zaraki might think.

112
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:08,327
Of course. That was
simply because you were
so concerned with the
views of others, that it

113
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,461
confused your position on
aesthetics.

114
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:12,761
Wrong.

115
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:19,894
I would choose death
over allowing others
to see your Shikai...
Ruriirokujaku.

116
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:24,461
But that's not all...
There's much more to it!

117
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:32,561
What're you doing??
The more Spirit Energy
you use, the faster the
flowers are going to grow!

118
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:34,361
...until your life force
has been depleted!

119
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:36,827
Maybe so, but it's not
happening.

120
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:40,061
Hado Thirty-One!
Shakkaho!

121
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:55,127
You released a considerable
amount of Spirit Energy in
order to confine the two
of us in battle.

122
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:59,527
That had to have been
very taxing on your body
as well.

123
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:02,427
I guess it took its
toll, but it doesn't
matter.

124
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:04,127
Is that right?

125
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:05,394
That's right.

126
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:08,861
I never intended to take
on the small-fry in the
first place.

127
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:24,361
I will belong forever
to the strongest of the
Thirteen Court Guard
Squads...

128
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:27,761
...I am a member of Squad
Eleven!

129
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:35,427
I'll give it my all and
I'll never quit. No
matter what happens to my
body, I will do whatever

130
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:37,827
it takes to defeat you.

131
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:44,094
That is our style. Our
pride is at stake. We'll
continue fighting until
the job is done.

132
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:49,627
But if I should die
trying, you're permitted...

133
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,127
... to laugh at me.

134
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,633
What happened to Ichigo?

135
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:15,599
Looks like he was blown
away, just like the rest
of us.

136
00:14:24,099 --> 00:14:28,333
We cannot allow any more
of you to stand in
Byakuya's way.

137
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:33,333
Not a single one of you
Zanpakuto knows when you
should give up.

138
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:45,733
<i>Tenken, down here!</i>

139
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:50,866
I'm embarrassed to say
I'm unable to get up...
Would you mind giving me
a hand, please?

140
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,066
Be more careful!
You almost crushed me!

141
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:06,199
What a mess he made,
scattering his Spirit
Energy everywhere.

142
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,566
When will that idiot
learn to fight in a more
subtle way?

143
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,233
You're pretty good.

144
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,866
Surprise attack? Nice
try.

145
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,333
With the tricky footing
on this roof-top, I'll
never be able to keep up
with her movements...

146
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:31,166
Besides, this is no time
for me to be fighting a
quiet little battle,
either...

147
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,566
Running away?!

148
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,333
Changing locations!
Follow me!

149
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:48,133
How do you want to do
this?

150
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:54,233
You want me to come after
you right now? Or would
you rather attack me
first?

151
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:58,166
Neither---I don't have
time to be facing off
against you.

152
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,566
Is that so?

153
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:03,533
Well, if that's the case,
in the interest of time,
I'll attack first!

154
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,966
Let's have some fun!
Byakuya Kuchiki!

155
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,399
Scatter...

156
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:25,533
That doesn't appear to
work.

157
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:35,566
Why don't you stop
playing these little
tricks?

158
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:45,599
Why don't you stop
playing these little
tricks?

159
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:56,333
Why don't you stop
playing these little
tricks?

160
00:16:56,366 --> 00:17:00,199
Surprised I was able to
counter your flash step
with a move of my own?

161
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:07,099
And I suppose you're
thinking you'll now be
able to capture me with
your speed?

162
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:08,866
Well let's find out!

163
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:18,566
Yeah! Go on, run!
Looks like your speed's
only good for running
away!

164
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:20,233
That's laughable.

165
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:34,233
Do you see how futile it
is? There's no way you'll
ever be able to capture me.

166
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:35,933
Is that right?

167
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,233
You've just been caught!

168
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:10,066
Is that the best you can
come up with? My, how far
the great Squad Eleven...
has fallen!

169
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,733
Damn!

170
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:17,333
I used up a considerable
amount of Spirit Energy
to escape those vines!

171
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:22,366
Oh, too bad It appears
you have become much
weaker than before.

172
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:25,166
Maybe you shouldn't be so
impulsive.

173
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:27,899
And maybe you have far
too much to say!

174
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,599
Well, I'm impressed. You
dodged my attack at the
very last moment.

175
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:43,433
Why go this far... just
to fight against me?

176
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:48,566
I thought I'd see what you've
got. This seemed the easiest
way for you to show me your
best.

177
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:50,899
I'm beginning to
understand.

178
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:51,933
Huh?

179
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,466
Scatter...

180
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:58,999
That's very impressive.

181
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:14,799
I'm still unable to use
Shikai. And even if I
continue to run, there's
nothing more I can draw

182
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:19,766
upon. I never thought
I'd suffer because I
can't use Ruriirokujaku.

183
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,299
It appears to me you're
out of options. You
know, I'm willing to
let you use the power of

184
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,866
my Ruriirokujaku if
you'd like...

185
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,333
I think that would be
fair, wouldn't it?

186
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:31,166
No, thank you.

187
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:36,299
Thought you'd say that.
But how about this... would
it be fair if I didn't use
it either?

188
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:41,399
Hm. Yes, it would.
Shouldn't you think
about that?

189
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:46,699
If you don't use that
power, despite your
little speech about
aesthetics then it seems

190
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,566
to me that you lack
confidence...

191
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:54,766
..in the energy and
strength of your Kido
techniques. That says a
lot about your aesthetics.

192
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,733
Yeah, well...

193
00:19:56,766 --> 00:20:02,733
All right, you've convinced
me. I'll fight all the way
to the end using only my
sense of my aesthetics.

194
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:07,199
Unfortunately for you, I
can use the techniques
any number of times.

195
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,833
Tear in Frenzy...

196
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:13,399
Remember what you told me
earlier..

197
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:18,333
You said that I will be
permitted to laugh at you
if your pride should mean
the end of you in battle.

198
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:22,466
Well, I intend to give
the biggest laugh you've
ever heard in your life.

199
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:29,933
Bakudo Number Four!

200
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:31,599
Hainawa!

201
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,333
What is this? You're
using Bakudo?!

202
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,799
This game is over.

203
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:47,299
I got lucky, since you,
like me, are stubborn and
overconfident.

204
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:52,133
If you had stuck to
fighting a normal fight,
I wouldn't have had any
chance of winning at all.

205
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,299
It's true. We're so
alike, that it disgusts
me.

206
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:07,233
I would rather die right
now, than have your
Shikai be seen by others,
Ruriirokujaku.

207
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,299
But that's not all there
is to it.

208
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:16,833
If I don't use
Ruriirokujikau, then I will
use whatever it takes to win.

209
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:19,233
And that is my aesthetic.

210
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:33,333
I don't want you to
bother me any further...

211
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:38,733
If I have to face you
again, I will have
no other choice---I'll be
forced to take your life.

212
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,933
Take my life?! You've
got to be kidding.

213
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:46,866
Go right ahead! Try, if
you dare!

214
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:50,666
I've always wanted to
have a big sword fight
with you to the death.

215
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:53,166
You're finally onboard!

216
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:55,199
Come at me with that
spirit...

217
00:21:55,933 --> 00:22:00,166
I'm ready to take you on
Byakuya Kuchiki!

218
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:06,266
Very well. I see you
leave me no option.

219
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:50,600
Kenpachi's Zanpakuto
hasn't manifested!

220
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:54,500
<i>Of course not! If it</i>
<i>manifested, the Soul</i>
<i>Society would be</i>
<i>destroyed without the</i>

221
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,533
<i>story arc moving forward!</i>

222
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:59,266
So it's just one of those
backstage circumstances?

223
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,533
<i>Exactly!</i>
