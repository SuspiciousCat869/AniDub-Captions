1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,833
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,300
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,733
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:29,233
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul Reaper.

5
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:32,100
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,567
He's here.

7
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:51,534
Yes, I'm quite sure you
know him very well. Head
Captain Genryusai
Yamamoto.

8
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,700
I do, but who are the
others?

9
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:04,567
They are Zanpakuto and
they are working together
to seal away Genryusai
Yamamoto's power.

10
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,200
Things have remained in
this state for quite some
time now.

11
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:11,700
Working together?

12
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey, get away from there!

13
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:45,667
You're going to force
him to use his Spirit
Energy.

14
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,867
Don't blame us if his
Spirit Energy burns you
to ash.

15
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah!

16
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,867
As you could imagine, he
has been very difficult
to reason with.

17
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,000
The Head Captain has
become quite troublesome
for us.

18
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,367
Byakuya!

19
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,567
It's you!

20
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,434
Damn.

21
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,500
What the-?!

22
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,600
W--wait!

23
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:19,467
You said you know where
the Old Man is. So let's
hear it.

24
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,367
Well, I can tell you this...
Not only is it the most likely
place he would be...

25
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:32,867
...But I also sensed the
Head Captain's Spiritual
Pressure near there.

26
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,934
Hmm...

27
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,834
What should we do?
There's not much point
in waiting for them to
come to us.

28
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:44,167
<i>It's never been our</i>
<i>nature to wait, anyway.</i>

29
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,834
Come on, Kenny!--We
really should get going!

30
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:49,767
Our turn to find the old
fella! All right?!

31
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:52,934
You can relax. We're not
playing hide and seek.

32
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,900
Hey!

33
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,534
The guy that I want to
fight is probably there,
right?

34
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,600
Yeah, I'm
pretty sure.

35
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:05,400
You just be sure that
you don't take on the
Head Captain by mistake.

36
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:09,834
I'm pretty sure I can
tell the Old Man apart
from that traitor.

37
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,967
How about it? Will you
two be coming with us?

38
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:34,334
I'm completely bored out
of my mind!

39
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:38,134
Your idea of what
constitutes fun and
excitement on a daily
basis

40
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,834
is enough to give
anybody else a heart
attack.

41
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,700
That sounds just a bit
cruel.

42
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:44,434
Yeah, but it's true.

43
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:48,667
When I became free I
was hoping it would be
the beginning of a much
more interesting life

44
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,800
with my master not
bugging me anymore.

45
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:55,367
Instead, you've gone and
let your master easily
overpower you.

46
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:58,900
What?! That's because
you got in my way!

47
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:03,200
I'm quite aware of that.
And I think I was more
easily overpowered.

48
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:06,400
What's wrong? You're
not even trying to put
up a fight.

49
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,967
Well, I have to agree with
you, I'm just exhausted from
all this overwhelming boredom.

50
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:16,400
[sighing]

51
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,634
Who's there!?

52
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,534
Kazeshini?

53
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,967
You really shouldn't
scare us like that!

54
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,467
Kazeshini!

55
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:52,034
What happened?!

56
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:59,067
Oh, no. His
wounds are bad.

57
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,034
You're right. I'm
surprised he made
it back here.

58
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,534
<i>What are you doing?</i>

59
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:26,900
Glad you could make it
back, Kazeshini.

60
00:08:26,934 --> 00:08:29,667
Now rest up so your
wounds can heal.

61
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:34,600
[struggling]
Muramasa--

62
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,467
What is it,
Kazeshini?

63
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,834
There's something I've
been wanting to ask you.

64
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,367
Go ahead.

65
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,467
You said to use my
intuition, that I must
always follow my instinct.

66
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,434
Of course I
remember that.

67
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:53,167
Well, I'm certain my true
instinct is to reap the
lives of Soul Reapers.

68
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,800
I'm well aware of that.

69
00:08:55,834 --> 00:09:00,767
And my mission is to
release all Zanpakuto from
their Soul Reaper masters.

70
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:02,534
Then...

71
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,500
Tell me why the hell a
Soul Reaper is standing
right there?!

72
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:21,434
That Soul Reaper is Byakuya
Kuchiki, and he plays a
crucial role in achieving
our greater objective.

73
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:27,734
I am very thankful that,
with all your help,
Byakuya was able to make
it here safely.

74
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:33,100
Okay, fine. Then explain
why any of us should have
to suffer just to have this
Soul Reaper around.

75
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,434
Even though we have
a greater objective
to consider,

76
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:41,500
it saddens me that
Zanpakuto have been hurt.

77
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,534
But there's no need to
worry...

78
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,534
...As long as we have
Genryusai Yamamoto, the
Soul Reapers will not do
anything too drastic.

79
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,567
We are very close to
achieving our goal.

80
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:09,200
They should be getting
desperate by now.

81
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:13,234
Sorry to ask this of
you, but you'll have to be
patient for a bit longer.

82
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:26,600
This certainly is
the Head Captain's
Spiritual Pressure.

83
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,267
But I'm also sensing some
kind of powerful barrier
around it.

84
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,067
Ryujinjakka was probably
too much for Muramasa to
manage.

85
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,467
He must have placed
Old Man Yama in a special
containment field.

86
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:43,934
We would be very
fortunate if it's true we
don't have to take on the
power of Ryujinjakka.

87
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:48,400
You seem to be pretty
positive that the Old Man
is down there somewhere.

88
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:51,234
Correct. There's no
mistake. He's here.

89
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:56,400
The only problem is that
this cave meanders through
the ground like a maze.

90
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:58,767
Ooooh.
[sniffing]

91
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,900
Also...

92
00:11:00,934 --> 00:11:04,634
There is another entrance
on the other side but I'm
sure that it's guarded as
well.

93
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:08,434
If they are all in there,
we must proceed with
extreme caution.

94
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,500
What a pain in the ass.
How about we cut the chatter
and start moving?

95
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:19,167
You show them, Kenny! Way
to go, Kenny! Go! Go! Do it!
Go! Go, Kenny!

96
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,767
Brother! I guess there's
no reason to plan a surprise
attack at this point.

97
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,667
Yeah. And no sense in waiting
around to see what they're
going to do. Let's go.

98
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,800
Good idea.

99
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:39,434
Ichigo... We'll use the
other entrance and meet
them inside.

100
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,700
Right.

101
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,149
The Soul Reapers are
coming.

102
00:12:08,183 --> 00:12:08,916
Yeah...

103
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,783
Damn. This sucks.

104
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,616
I came in here ready and
rarin' for a fight.

105
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,849
But how am I supposed
to find a fight if I can't
even see where I'm goin'?

106
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:44,049
Hey, Yachiru. Which way
do you think we should go?

107
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:46,449
Let's see... That way!

108
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:48,816
That's no help. I can't
see which way you're
pointing.

109
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:51,016
No, not this
way! That way!

110
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:54,349
Hey! Stop that, you
idiot! Quit messing
around!

111
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,516
Yoruichi...

112
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,983
Yes? What
is it?

113
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,216
There's something
I need to know.

114
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:07,949
All right.

115
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:10,549
Do you think Byakuya is
here as well?

116
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,949
He's a popular subject
today. Are you worried
about him, too?

117
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:15,749
Yeah...

118
00:13:17,383 --> 00:13:22,549
Byakuya joined the
Zanpakuto and turned
his sword on Renji. He
even threatened Rukia.

119
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,683
I don't understand what
his motivation would be
for all of this.

120
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:29,983
It is really quite simple.
My desire...

121
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:32,583
... Is to uphold
my self respect.

122
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:35,083
That is all.

123
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,849
But I thought...
maybe you would
have more insight.

124
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:40,283
I don't have a clue.

125
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:51,349
Ichigo!

126
00:13:51,383 --> 00:13:53,116
Huh?

127
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:58,116
Relax, my friend. You
need to calm down and
stay focused if you plan
to confront Byakuya.

128
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:05,949
I'm sure that boy has his
reasons, although what they
are is beyond me. But I--

129
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,483
What is this?

130
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,416
That's odd..

131
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:22,116
I had heard that you used
to be the commander of
the Stealth Force.

132
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:24,916
You're not presenting
us with much of a
challenge today.

133
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,449
Stealth Hoho--Shiho
Number Three...

134
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:34,816
Utsusemi!

135
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:48,049
Having a little trouble?
Girls these days are all
talk and no muscle.

136
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:53,083
Go on, don't wait for me,
Ichigo! Right now, saving
the Head Captain takes
top priority!

137
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:57,916
When you're done with
that.. You'll be free
to go off and do whatever
you like.

138
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,516
I'm on it.

139
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:26,749
What a charming array of
steps --My feet tingle
with excitement!

140
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:29,483
That's very positive of
you. Do you mean that?

141
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:32,283
I was being sarcastic!
Look at 'em...

142
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:36,716
You and I are gonna have
to climb all the way up
those steps to make it
through this cave!

143
00:15:43,849 --> 00:15:45,383
What shall we play?

144
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:48,649
Want to play?

145
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,816
Who's there?

146
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:53,649
<i>He wants to</i>
<i>know who we are.</i>

147
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:55,316
He does?

148
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:57,483
<i>Do you really not know</i>
<i>who we are?</i>

149
00:15:57,516 --> 00:15:58,983
Really!?

150
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:06,183
Come on, let's play!
Come on, let's play!
Come on, let's play!
Come on, let's play!

151
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:11,616
Oh brother... I guess
you'll have to deal with
them. If you don't, we
won't be able to move on.

152
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:17,183
Yeah, but I'm just not
comfortable fighting with
kids, even if they're
Zanpakuto.

153
00:16:17,216 --> 00:16:20,516
Well, good luck. What
else can I say? Do
your best.

154
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:25,749
So now then... How
about you two tell me
who you are?

155
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:26,883
Who could we be?

156
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,149
Yeah, who?

157
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:31,149
I'm guessing
Sogyonokotowari, right?

158
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:32,783
That's correct!

159
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:35,583
Aw, he figured
it out right away.

160
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:37,249
How boring!

161
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:41,516
Sorry, I couldn't help
myself. I spoiled your
game, huh?

162
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,816
It's okay. Let's
begin the next game!

163
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:45,749
Yeah, let's do it!

164
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:46,983
What do you want to play?

165
00:16:47,016 --> 00:16:48,616
How about throwing fans?

166
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:49,716
That sounds great!

167
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:50,983
All right!

168
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:54,083
One..!

169
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:55,449
Two...!

170
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:56,749
Three!

171
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,116
Ready... go!

172
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:21,183
Well, now. What kind of
game can I expect to play
with you, Miss?

173
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:27,216
Well, unfortunately...
Game-time for you is
over, I'm afraid.

174
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:31,916
Oh, don't say that. We've
known each other for a long
time.

175
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:35,949
I'm sure there must be
some way we can reconcile
our differences.

176
00:17:36,883 --> 00:17:40,983
I refuse. Your arrogance
is unbearable.

177
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:45,049
To be perfectly frank,
we've run out of patience
with you.

178
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:47,149
Did you say 'we' ?

179
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:53,716
That would explain the
other Spiritual Pressure
I've been sensing.

180
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:56,349
It's nice to know I
haven't just been
imagining it.

181
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:18,549
Ah, you finally decided
to show up.

182
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,616
Oh...

183
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:24,616
That saves me time,
looking for you.

184
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:31,549
I'm glad you could come,
Soul Reaper. Now I'll
get my revenge from our
last encounter!

185
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,483
The Head Captain must be
down this way.

186
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,083
He's not alone.

187
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:53,416
Hey, wait!

188
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:34,649
The Head Captain's
Spiritual Pressure.

189
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:35,916
He's here!

190
00:19:52,783 --> 00:19:53,683
Wha...?!

191
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:57,116
What?!

192
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:06,549
Die! Soul Reaper.

193
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,749
You bastard!

194
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,283
I won't let you go!
It's time for me to reap
your life!

195
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,149
Bankai!

196
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,616
No!

197
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,383
Getsuga tensho!

198
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:02,983
Damn it!

199
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:16,849
Shuhei. I'm sorry.

200
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,649
That was intense.

201
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:02,349
Well...

202
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:05,349
I guess it's up to me.

203
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:07,949
Let's do this!

204
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,217
Well, I never would have
imagined that my swords
could be so beautiful.

205
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,884
<i>And I never expected mine</i>
<i>to be children.</i>

206
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:58,984
I wonder if there's some
way I could get on their
good side and not have to
fight them.

207
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:01,150
<i>Yeah, I want to play with</i>
<i>them for a while.</i>

208
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:02,817
<i>Please fight them.</i>
