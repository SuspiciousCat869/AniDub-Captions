00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:03,443
Oh I forgot I fell asleep
yesterday after that.

Since Ichigo's not here

If that's the case,
why'd you save me?

<i>What an obnoxious brat!</i>

86
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,843
I have to admit, I find
it hard to believe
Ichigo could be involved
in this incident at all.

87
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:35,210
Yeah, I agree with you.

88
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:39,776
But if he's not, then how in
the world do you explain the
evidence that they found?

89
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,643
What are you here
to report then?

90
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:50,510
We found this near the area
where we were supposed to
rendezvous with Captain
Kurotsuchi's group.

91
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,210
I'm not sure, but perhaps it's
connected to this incident.

92
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,276
This is... !

93
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,076
I believe this warrants
further investigation.

94
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:00,776
Hmm...

95
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,610
[Shunsui]
A Substitute Soul
Reaper Combat Pass.

96
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,343
Yes, the exact same
one I gave to Ichigo.

97
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:13,576
No one else could possibly have
had possession of that pass.

98
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,910
Yeah I believe you.
But here's what I question.

99

<i>from his cell!</i>

00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:37,343
So why exactly am I running?!

106
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,476
We're heading to Hakuto Gate,

107
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,310
<i>...to get us out</i>
<i>of the Seireitei!</i>

108
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,010
Doing this makes us
look more suspect.
You really sure this
is a good idea?

109
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:52,410
'Course not.
Not normally.

110
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,910
Don't you think something's
gone wrong around here?

111
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,976
Yeah, I'm not even sure why I
was arrested to begin with.

112
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:00,710
I'm not sure either.

113
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:03,376
But I found out something.

114
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:08,510
It appears that a time gap has
formed between the Soul Society
and the World of the Living.

115
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:14,110
Ikkaku! Renji!

116
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:15,010
Damn!

117
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,676
Why'd you try to escape?

118
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:21,376
We're gonna have to
return you to your cell.

119
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:23,310
You guys too?

120
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,076
Sorry but our person in
charge of the Precipice
World is out.

121
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,143
Well! That can't be helped.

122
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:36,076
I mean we've been
in a constant state
of emergency.

123
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,743
Ah, here we go!

124
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:42,910
We did indeed record a
Spiritual Pressure in
the Precipice World
during that morning.

125
00:08:43,343 --> 00:08:46,443
Would you like me to
compare it to Ichigo's
Spiritual Pressure?

126
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,410
Nope. No need to.

127
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:52,343
I'm sure that Spiritual
Pressure had to be him.

128
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:57,010
Hmmm.

129
00:08:58,776 --> 00:09:00,810
<i>[Byakuya]</i>

Oh hello there Captain,
thank you for all
your hard work.

131
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:09,443
So this is what
you're doing while
we're on full alert?

132
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:11,676
Just trying to stay calm.

133
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,143
And what're you up to, Captain?

134
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:16,776
I'm sure my squad's
doing fine without me.

135
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,443
That's good to hear,
forgive me if I
happened to offend you.

136
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:23,876
Well, I guess I'd best
go deploy my men too.

137
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:35,610
Slow down, Isane.

138
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:38,043
Sorry, but it's urgent,
Captain Unohana.

<i>[Retsu]</i>
<i>The...Senkaimon?</i>

140
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:48,910
When we came through,
there was a slight
variance in the
Spiritual Pressure--

141
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,010
That's close enough.

142
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,043
Um? Are you sensing
something, Captain Unohana?

143
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,343
No.

144
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,376
I believe I need a little
more time before I'm ready.
Let's go back.

145
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:04,276
Sure.

146
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:08,976
We have no intention
of killing you as long
as you cooperate.

147
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:11,810
But, I don't expect that you
will give up so easily.

148
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,376
Explain something, Renji.
Why's Ichigo being jailed
as a suspect?

149
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,276
His Combat Pass.

150
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:21,576
My Combat Pass?

151
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:22,610
Yeah.

152
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,010
We found it.
During one of our
investigations.

153
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,143
That's right!

154
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,610
Damn! My Combat Pass!

155
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,776
I lost my pass earlier
when the Cleaner attacked
us in the Precipice World.

Yeah? Well guess what.

157
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,176
Your Combat Pass was found
there in the Precipice
World several days ago,

158
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,843
and that was about the
very same time that
Captain Kurotsuchi and
the others went missing.

159
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:53,710
You said
"several days ago"?!

160
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:57,343
But we passed through the
Precipice World yesterday,
right at about noon.

161
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,943
And yet here you are
suspecting me of wiping
out Mayuri and the others.

162
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,676
Guys! I'm not a magician.

163
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,976
Now I see.
I think I got it.

164
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:07,110
Got what?

165
00:11:08,776 --> 00:11:11,843
I still haven't figured out
how your Combat Pass could
be used as evidence here,

166
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,810
even before we left the
World of the Living.

167
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:18,476
<i>But one thing is clear,</i>
<i>whoever's responsible for</i>
<i>this is trying to frame you.</i>

168
00:11:19,376 --> 00:11:22,143
There's someone masterminding
this whole incident.

169
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:24,243
But it's gonna be
complicated to prove.

170
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,210
So you're saying one guy's
manipulating everyone?

171
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:30,743
Hey Ichigo, I don't
really want to do this,

172
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:34,676
But regardless of what I
believe, it is still our
duty to bring you in.

173
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:39,876
He's right. But I'd
rather fight you, so I'm
hoping you do resist.

174
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,910
So by all means,
try to escape!!

175
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:45,676
You haven't lost your Spirit
Energy yet, have you?

176
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,210
Before your power is gone,
let's do this!

177
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:50,476
One last fight!

178
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,510
Extend!
Hozukimaru!

179
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,110
Hah!!

180
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:02,176
Now Roar! Zabimaru!

181
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:09,176
Hyaaaaa!

182
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,572
Why're you doing
this, Renji?!!

183
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:25,705
Are you saying you really
think Ichigo had something
to do with this incident!?

184
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:27,472
No, I don't think that!

185
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:29,705
Then stop fighting with us!

186
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:34,472
I can't help myself!
I'm just following my
orders, so give up!

187
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:42,105
<i>When did he become</i>
<i>this powerful!?</i>

188
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:46,039
To stop us, you'll have
to beat us, Rukia!

189
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:50,239
Leave her alone, Renji!

190
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:54,805
Ikkaku! Enough!
I have no reason
to fight you!

191
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:00,105
I have no reason to fight
you either. But who needs a
reason for a good fight!?

192
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:02,572
Ichigo!

193
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,172
Pay attention!

194
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:05,672
Huh!

195
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:08,105
<i>Keep your guard up</i>
<i>or you'll just make</i>
<i>this easier for me.</i>

196
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,139
I'm not gonna warn you again!

197
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,205
Damn... He's not bluffing!

198
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,505
Renji! What the hell?!

199
00:13:18,372 --> 00:13:19,639
What's happened to you?!

200
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:23,839
<i>The way you're acting,</i>
<i>you both must be under</i>
<i>someone's control!</i>

201
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:24,472
Heh!

202
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:26,305
I've had it!

203
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:28,405
Bankai!

204
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:38,705
So you're finally
going to fight!

205
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,305
[stumbles]

Yoruichi!

210
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:55,339
Ichigo, Rukia.
Let's go!

211
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:06,005
You really saved us.

212
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:08,339
We can't stay
here very long.

213
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:12,739
Gotcha. There was
definitely something
wrong with those guys.

214
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:17,705
You're right. I could see
in Renji's eyes he was
serious about killing us.

215
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:20,372
Well y'know that really
can't be helped.

216
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:24,305
Those two you were
fighting weren't the real
Renji or the real Ikkaku.

217
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,605
Uh-huh.

218
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:27,805
Uh?

219
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,205
Wait, what exactly
d'ya mean by
not real?!

220
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:35,139
You've got to be kidding.
You didn't figure that out
while you were fighting them?

221
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:39,039
But, their Spiritual Pressures
felt the same as they
always have.

222
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,139
Yeah that's true, but
they seemed to be even
more powerful than usual.

223
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:48,139
Is that so? Well, after all,
they are very well-made.

224
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:51,005
"Well-made"?

225
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:55,172
<i>[Yoruichi]</i>
<i>As you know, all Soul Reapers</i>
<i>require a physical vessel</i>

226
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:58,272
<i>in order for their soul</i>
<i>to function in the</i>
<i>World of the Living.</i>

227
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:00,405
<i>In other words, a Gigai.</i>

228
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:06,205
<i>At the same time, mod-souls</i>
<i>require a vessel in order</i>
<i>for them to function in the</i>
<i>Soul Society.</i>

229
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:10,672
These vessels are the Soul
Society's version of a Gigai,
so to speak.

230
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:12,705
Is that easier
to understand?

231
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:18,672
[writing on wall]

232
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:20,905
A Reigai.

233
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:22,339
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>"Rei... gai"?</i>

234
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:26,372
The Renji and Ikkaku
that you encountered
earlier are imitations

235
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:31,339
created by placing nearly
perfect souls inside a
nearly perfect Reigai.

236
00:15:33,105 --> 00:15:34,005
They're fakes.

237
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:38,839
<i>But they've been created so</i>
<i>that their memories,</i>
<i>personalities, and thoughts,</i>

238
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:42,339
<i>almost everything, is</i>
<i>a near perfect copy of</i>
<i>the real person.</i>

239
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:45,072
<i>And because they're</i>
<i>such accurate copies,</i>

240
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:50,339
<i>I have no idea how many</i>
<i>Reigai have currently</i>
<i>infiltrated the Thirteen</i>
<i>Court Guard Squads.</i>

241
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:52,305
Wait, I don't
understand.

242
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:56,139
Wouldn't these so-called
Reigai be unnecessary
in the Soul Society,

243
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,605
where the soul itself
becomes the body?

244
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:01,772
That is definitely true
for all Soul Reapers.

245
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:04,172
But for some souls,
they are needed.

246
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,405
For who?

247
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:09,072
Reigai are indispensable
when used for experiments.

248
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,105
Especially when it comes
to the development of
Soul Candies.

249
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:17,039
Then that implicates
the Department of...

250
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:18,739
Research and
Development.

251

Where did he go?!

254
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:32,672
Probably heading
to Squad Twelve.

255
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:35,172
I'll do something to
throw off their security.

256
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:38,305
You should go catch
up with him to gather
more information.

257
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:44,239
Ichigo stop!

258
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,505
Where you going?!

No!!

261
00:16:49,872 --> 00:16:53,672
You're never going to
succeed by storming into
the main compound without
having a real plan!

262
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:58,805
Instead we should sneak into
Squad Twelve to get as much
information as we can!

263
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:00,405
Okay fine.

idea to sneak in quietly?

I think that Bakudo is
kinda hard to miss!

275

This is not exactly
the time for debate!

No-no! Look, I'll gift-wrap her
and give her to ya if you'll
just take her out of here!

306
00:19:42,772 --> 00:19:43,905
So!

307
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:47,205
Why don't you just
tell us where she is?

308
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:51,905
She's uhh, Upstairs.
I'll bring her down here!

309
00:19:51,939 --> 00:19:54,172
It'll be a relief!
Stay right there!

310
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:07,039
Hey! There're some people
from the Soul Society
here to pick you up!

311
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:08,739
Huh?

312
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:10,172
Whaddya think you're doing?!

313
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:14,705
What!?!

314
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:16,805
What the hell?
Hey wait!

315
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:18,805
<i>[Izuru]</i>
<i>She's making a run for it!</i>

316
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:23,239
This is bad!

317
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:29,772
Bad! Bad! Bad! This is Bad!
So Bad! Bad! Bad!

318
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:41,872
What's with those guys?
This is really bad, isn't it?!

319
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:46,872
Hado Number Fifty Eight!
Tenran!

320
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:51,339
Damn!

321
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:19,505
<i>[Kon as Ichigo]</i>
<i>Hey! You alright?!</i>

322
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:22,472
Hyagh!

323
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:33,105
You struggled
for nothing.

324
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:37,139
So you really thought you
could escape from me.

325
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:45,005
Won't you please
forgive us, sir.

326
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:49,205
Of course. You just be
sure you get rid of him.

327
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:51,672
He is, after all,

328
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:56,172
<i>a mere Mod-Soul.</i>
<i>He is of no use to us.</i>

329
00:21:56,772 --> 00:21:59,239
Now then I guess I'll be going.

330
00:21:59,272 --> 00:21:59,905
[Uryu]
Hold on a minute.

331
00:21:59,939 --> 00:22:00,772
Huh??

332
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:05,305
Forcing a girl down
to the ground?

333
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:08,039
I wouldn't call that
move "good manners".

334
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,233
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>How do you plan to throw</i>
<i>them off, Yoruichi?</i>

335
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:49,799
<i>[Yoruichi]</i>
<i>Oh, you wanna know how?</i>

336
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,766
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Well sure, I hope it's</i>
<i>not a risky plan.</i>

337
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,533
<i>[Yoruichi]</i>
<i>I suppose you could call</i>
<i>it a pretty risky game.</i>

338
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,066
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Do you mean... ?!</i>

339
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:58,233
<i>[Yoruichi]</i>
<i>My shirt goes off!</i>
<i>And my pants go off too!!</i>

340
00:23:58,266 --> 00:23:59,966
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>No please, not that!!</i>
