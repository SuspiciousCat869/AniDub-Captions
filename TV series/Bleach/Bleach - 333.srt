00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:30,306
(Renji)
Where are they?
Did we get them!?

6
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,179
(all)
[gasping]

7
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:34,681
Looks like
you did it.

8
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:35,650
Mhm.

9
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:39,123
Way to go,
Nozomi! That
was awesome!

10
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:41,126
I guess...

11
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,428
[gasp]
[gasp]

[gasp]
Brother!

15
00:02:55,586 --> 00:03:01,864
Did you think... that
I'd be defeated so
easily by a technique
like that?!

16
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:07,141

[screams]

18
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,743
Time to finish
you off.

19
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:28,379
[gasp]

20
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:31,318
What?!
Damn you!

21
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:34,190
[dying shout]

22
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,410
(Ichigo)
Head Captain!

23
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:56,764
Why are
you here?

24
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,840
Hm.

25
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,410
[gasp]

26
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,417
Is she the one
you mentioned
to me in your
report?

27
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,688
(Rukia)
Yes. She's
Nozomi Kujo.

28
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,190
[gasp]

29
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:17,501
The name does
not matter. She
is nothing more
than a Mod Soul.

30
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,339
[sad sigh]

31
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,609
Wait a minute!
Where are your
manners?!

32
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:25,249
You can't just waltz
in here and dismiss
this girl like she
was nothing!

33
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:29,423
With all due
respect, Sir...!
This girl can help
us defeat Kageroza!

34
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:32,930
Her Zanpakto
can absorb an
enemy's Spirit
Energy!

35
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:36,737
Trust me, the
last thing we
need is help
from a Mod Soul.

36
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:42,314
Look here, you old
geezer! She may be
a Mod Soul, but she's
still a young girl!

37
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:43,783
And there's
no reason to
insult her--!

38
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:47,590
Keep quiet,
big mouth!

39
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:50,696
Hm..?

40
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:52,766
[frightened whimper]

41
00:04:58,777 --> 00:05:00,881
Wait! You've
gotta hear me
out!

42
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:04,721
Yes, Nozomi is a
Mod Soul, but what
difference does
that make?!

43
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:06,858
You will find
out soon enough...

44
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:10,498
Let's talk now!
She's on our
side! She's one
of us!

45
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:12,669
(Genryusai Yamamoto)
End of discussion!

46
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:18,513
There's more
of them..!?

47
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:22,754
Uryu! Chad! Do
what you can for
the others. Take
them to Orihime!

48
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:23,923
All right.

49
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:24,925
[grunt]

50
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:28,631
OK, let's take
care of business.

51
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:31,002
[painful groans]
Renji!

52
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:34,776
Don't try to
act so tough!
You need to stay
back here with Rukia.

53
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:37,414
Shut up..!
I can still
fight...

54
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:42,423
Enough! In your
condition you won't
help. You will only
get in the way.

55
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:44,927
[grunt]
...Yes, Sir.

56
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,396
[gasp]

57
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:58,018
I see. You
two again.

58
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:00,356
Master Genryusai...

59
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:05,798
Oh brother... This
kinda sucks for us.
We have to fight
Old Man Yama.

60
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,938
Too bad.
There's no
way around
it.

61
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:11,442
You got
that right.

62
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:16,318
All waves rise
now and become
my shield!

63
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:21,795
Lightning strike
now and become my
blade!

64
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:23,765
Sogyonokotowani!

65
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:30,678
Flower wind rage...
and Flower god roar!

66
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:34,618
Heavenly wind
rage! And Heavenly
deamon sneer!

67
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:37,389
Katenkyokotsu!

68
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:43,868
Impressive. I must say
you both look very
convincing, considering
you're imposters.

69
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,004
Why thank you.

70
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,009
Your words of
praise do us
honor.

71
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:51,849
Nevertheless, the
two of you are
still brats,..

72
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:55,991
...and you need
to be taught a
painful lesson.

73
00:06:56,024 --> 00:07:00,766
All things in
the universe
turn to ashes!

74
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,940
Ryujinjakka!

75
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,747
Ichigo Kurosaki!

76
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,484
Yeah?

77
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:12,720
You need to
stay back
as well!

78
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:14,324
I'm fighting
with you!

79
00:07:14,357 --> 00:07:19,566
That is an order!
I cannot guarantee
you will be safe
in the cross fire!

80
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:35,696
Oh!

81
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:37,966
What the hell!?
Whaaaa?!

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,371
I will put
an end to
this myself!

83
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:44,144
The young lady
says she is
going to take
us on.

84
00:07:44,378 --> 00:07:47,851
That's fine, but
we better make
sure we capture her
without hurting her.

85
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,926
You're right I
presume you are
aware of what her
Zanpakto can do.

86
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,362
Very much so.

87
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:56,667
And we both have
to be careful
when we cross
swords with her...

88
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,406
(Shunsui Reigai)
...or she'll suck
away our Spirit
Energy.

89
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,910
Hiyaaahh!

back!

[attack grunts]
No I won't!

94
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:17,873
You're a
feisty one!

95
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:19,742
[battle grunts]

96
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:23,784
Those damned

they think they
are doing!?

00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:49,630
Seems as if
the fight has
distracted you.
You were wide open.

103
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,501
That's not
like you at
all.

104

[battle grunts]

106
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,628
What's wrong, Ichigo?
Your Spirit Energy
seems to be fading
fast,,,

107
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:09,066
Shut the
hell up!
Hiya!

108
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:11,837
Come on,
Ichigo...

109
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:16,012
He's not
doing so
well!

110
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:18,917
[panting breaths]

111
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,854
He's in
trouble.

112
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:23,057
What can
we do?

113
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:25,997
[grunt]

114
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:29,202
Where is
he!?

115
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,037
[gasp]

116
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,072
Hiya!

117
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:38,920
You're in
my shadow?

118
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:43,996
Sorry... Did
I surprise you?
It's called,
"Kageoni."

119
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,864
[leaping grunt]

120
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:49,873
Well I'll be
damned! You
figured it out
already!

121
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:54,148
(Shunsui)
You're right. I can't
use Kageoni unless
there's a shadow.

122
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:55,817
(Shunsui)
However...

123
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:02,697
Katenkyokotsu is
very versitile. It
knows a lot of other
fun games. For example...

124
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:04,734
[gasp]

125
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:09,576
...This one! Where
the one who's higher
up is stronger, known
as Takaoni!

[gasp]

00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:15,921
I know how
your Zanpakto
works...

129
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:19,995
If our swords
touch, my Spirit
Energy will be
absorbed/

130
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:20,696

did it a little.

[groan]

134
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:33,085
Heh. Well that's
a relief!

135
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:36,057
If I had injured
you I'd be in big
trouble with my
boss.

136
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:39,130

138
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:44,874
(Thinking)
What should I do?
Bankai, then
Getsugatensho?

139
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:48,947
I bet you're
trying to decide
whether or not
to use Bankai.

140
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,617
[gasp]

141
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,090
I sense even if
you did use Bankai,
you couldn't maintain
it for long.

142
00:10:54,123 --> 00:10:59,232
And I'm guessing you aren't
able to unleash Getsugatensho
more than two or three more
times at the most.

143
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:00,669
We'll see!

I've gotta
make a move!

[fighting grunts]

150
00:11:16,163 --> 00:11:17,934
Bankai!

151
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:20,305
Hm?

152
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:24,078
Getsugatensho!

153
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:34,798
If you're going to
attack someone, you
need to understand
you're opponent's power.

154
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:38,137
Otherwise, you're
just going to waste
a perfectly good
offensive.

155
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,573
Huh?

156
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,309
[heavy breating]

157
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:44,682
Looks like your
spirit energy has
dropped again.

158
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:45,684
[grunt]

159
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:48,089
Oh no! This
is bad! Real
bad!

160
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:49,658
Will you
calm down!?

161
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:53,231
How can I stay
calm!? Both Nozomi
and Ichigo are
in big trouble!

162
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:58,040
The worst part
is, I can't do
a darn thing to
help out...

163
00:11:58,073 --> 00:11:59,943
I'll go
help him.

164
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:01,847
I'll go,,,
with you...

165
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:05,854
You can't do this!
Neither one of you
can do anything in
your condition!

166
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:07,624
You need to
stand down!

167
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:09,060
Shut your mouth.
[gasp in pain]

168
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:14,303
[choking] Your
attack technique is
just as effective
as ever, Rukia.

169
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:16,974
But you still
can't go! You
heard the old
geezer!

170
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:19,145
In your
condition
you'll just
get in the way!

171
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:22,151
Even so, sometimes
you have to put
yourself out there.

172
00:12:22,184 --> 00:12:26,658
Rukia's right
about that.
If we could get
a single hit...

173
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:27,594
[gasp]
[gasp]

174
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:28,161
What's the
matter!?

175
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:30,599
That spiritual
pressure...

176
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,144
[gasp]

177
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:40,283
(Retsu Reigai)
This can't be..!

178
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:43,756
(Retsu Unohana)
Why the surprised
look? You should
already know...

179
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:45,760
[gasp]

180
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:49,600
(Retsu Unohana)
A Bakudo like
that isn't strong
enough...

181
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:52,005
(Retsu Unohana)
It would do nothing
more than slow him
down for a moment.

182
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,376
What are you
talking about?

183
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:58,784
I have a
feeling you
made a critcal
error...

184
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:02,991
You misjudged the
power of Genryusai
Yamamoto. After
all...

185
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:08,936
...it isn't by accident
that he's been the Head
Captain of the Thirteen Court
Guard Squads for a millenium.

186
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,045
Everyone get down!
[screaming]

187
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:15,213
[angry grunt]

188
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:19,822
Ichigo! Nozomi!

189
00:13:19,855 --> 00:13:20,891
[gasp]
[gasp]

190
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,920
(Kon)
Ichigo! Nozomi!

191
00:13:37,822 --> 00:13:40,827
[nervous gasps]

192
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:45,669
[gasp]
[grunt]
[gasp]

193
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:48,440
[grunting]

194
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:55,020
Hey you old
Geezer! What
the hell!?

195
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:57,324
You almost
turned us
into ashes!

196
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,668
Where's Ichigo?

197
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:05,973
Did he get
caught up in
that blast?!

198
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:08,778
Look! Over there!

199
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:15,791
[gasp] That was
close. Too close
as far as I'm
concerned.

200
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,393
[gasp]

201
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:25,074
Say something,
damn it!

202
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:26,176
Kon, stop it.

203
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:28,113
Yeah but
Rukia!!!

204
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:32,287
The existance of Mod
Souls is a bitter
legacy in the Soul
Society's past.

205
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,795
His intention
may have been to
eliminate Nozomi
along with Kageroza.

206
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:39,133
You mean he's
just gonna wipe
out everybody!?

207
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,070
(Ichigo)
It can't
be..!

208
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:44,442
(Nozomi)
While I'm alive, both
worlds will continue
to be targeted.

209
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:47,982
Perhaps eliminating
me <i>is</i> the way to
stop Kageroza.

210
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:49,251
Don't be
ridiculous!

211
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:52,224
It's true. I
understand it...

212
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:54,193
...but I'm
not gonna die.

213
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:59,102
Yeah, you
got that right!

214
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:02,877
By the way,
you're holding
me too tight. You
can let go now.

215
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:04,146
Oh! Sorry!

216
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:24,783
That was
close...

217
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:26,319
He had us
there...

218
00:15:29,926 --> 00:15:32,230
You may be
nothing but
imposters...

219
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:36,370
But from what I've
observed, you use
the powers of my
students well.

220
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:40,244
I didn't think
you'd still be
standing.

221
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:42,448
[grunt]

222
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,121
(Kageroza)
That will be
enough!

223
00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:52,801
(Kageroza)
Thank you for
your hard work
everyone...

224
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,539
(Kageroza)
Now please,
step back!

225
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:03,052
I will
take care
of the
rest...

226
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:06,057

Hey it's
him! Look!

229
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:13,037
(Genryusai)
Kageroza Inaba!

230
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,115
(Kageroza)
You're everything I
expected, Head
Captain Yamamoto,

231
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:23,957
(Genryusai)
Even the power of the
captains working together
could not hold you down.

232
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:28,432
Despite all that,
everything is
going as planned.

233
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,276
I will take
Nozomi now,
if you don't
mind.

234
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,983
I'm afraid I
still need her
to fulfill my
plans...

235
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,197
[grunt]

[panting]

238
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:02,093
Old man! Listen,
you can't just
undisciminately
attack that bastard!

239
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:06,534
Silence! Who
do you think you
are talking to,
boy?!

240
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:11,844
(Genryusai)
I am no idiot! Do you
not think I know what
his abilities are?

241
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:15,317
Well, if you know,
then all the more
reason for you to
be careful!

242
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,527
Yes, indeed. It
would certaily be a
problem if he were
to copy my techniques.

243
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,530
Then what are
you going to
do?

244
00:17:23,832 --> 00:17:28,007
I suppose I will
have to attack him in
a way that will not
allow him to do that.

245
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,447
Ok...
but how?!

246
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,152
I'll be
your decoy.

247
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:35,621
Hm?
[gasp]

248
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,892
Are you out
of your mind!?

249
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:41,432
It's ok. Really,
it's the least
I can do.

250
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:43,268
It's too
dangerous!

251
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:46,507
I don't care.
Please understand.

252
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,445
Nozomi...

253
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:54,021
Help me out
here, Old
Man!

254
00:17:54,054 --> 00:17:57,027
You have
one chance...
[gasp]

255

00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,232
(Thinking)
What's she
up to?

258
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,905
(Thinking)
I doubt she'd allow
herself to be
captured so easily.

259
00:18:24,076 --> 00:18:27,248
Hiya!

260
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:32,491
So you are trying
to cross swords so that
you can absorb my
Spirit Energy.

261
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:35,396
Sorry, my dear,
but I won't
fall for that.

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,469

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,616
When did you
charge that?!

00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:57,069
Ha! But it's
still not enough!

267
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,484
Are you ready
to give up?
Hm?

00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:31,531
I'll stop you...

00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,527
They did it.

00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:57,278
Did I
get him?
Well...

277
00:19:58,313 --> 00:19:59,649
Ichigo!

278
00:20:02,154 --> 00:20:04,993

280
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:19,018

He nearly...
destroyed me...

Ichigo!

286
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:32,342
This is proof of
my power. My
judgement paid off!

287
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:37,084
(Kageroza)
Ryujinjakka is certainly
a frightening power...

288
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:43,429
(Kageroza)
But at the very moment of
his attack, I copied
Nozomi's Zanpakto power...

289
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:48,138
(Kageroza)
In that instant I
was able to absorb
all of your attacks.

290
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:05,202
Now my Raiku is
even stronger than
before!

291
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:08,775
It has the powers
of both Head Captain
Yamamoto's Ryujinjakka--

292
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,215
--and the Substitute
Soul Reaper's
Getsugatensho!

293
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:16,657
(Kageroza)
As strong as
you are, Head
Captain...

294
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:22,066
You won't be able
to remain unscathed
after an attack of
such immense power!

295
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:28,244
[evil laughter]

296
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:33,453
The time has
come! This ends
right now!

297
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:42,637
Get out, Head
Captain!
Oh mo!

298
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:44,073
[gasp]

299
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:55,728
Out of my

00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:02,273
[grunt]
No! What are
you doing!?

301
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,682
Nozomi!

302
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:49,201
(Rukia)
That Kageroza
really scares me..

303
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:50,903
(Rukia)
I never know
what to expect
from him.
