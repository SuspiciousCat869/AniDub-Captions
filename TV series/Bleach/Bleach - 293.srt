1
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:09,965
Rrraaggh!

2
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:15,645
<i>Can't be!</i>

3
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:11,348
You're mine!

4
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:15,781
Hyaaahh!

5
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:26,814
Getsuga... tensho!

6
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,348
Yaahh!

7
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:40,248
<i>What's wrong?</i>

8
00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:43,548
You seem to
have missed me.

9
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,681
<i>Is his Zanpakuto that strong?!</i>

10
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:51,348
Just so you know...

11
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:57,381
I haven't been using my
Kyokasuigetsu's powers
in our fight so far.

12
00:02:57,414 --> 00:03:00,614
What you're seeing
is just my basic
strength.

13
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,214
What?!

14
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:17,914
Concentrate, Ichigo!
Don't let him get
into your head!

15
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:19,914
Captain Komamura?

16
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:21,614
Keep your mind clear.

17
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:25,181
I know why the captains
who went to Hueco Mundo
sent you here first.

18
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:27,848
You haven't fallen victim
to Aizen's Shikai.

19
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,314
Ichigo, we will all
fight to protect you.

20
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:41,014
You're gonna fight
to protect me?

21
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:42,948
What are you saying?

22
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:47,214
<i>It's just crazy! Look at you,</i>
<i>You're all in terrible shape!</i>

23
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:49,681
That's a matter of perspective.

24
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:52,848
<i>We think letting you fight</i>
<i>alone would be even crazier.</i>

25
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:58,681
Besides, we allowed that,
we wouldn't be able to
settle our own personal
grudges with Sosuke.

26
00:03:58,714 --> 00:04:01,681
<i>It would be selfish of you to</i>
<i>take him on by yourself.</i>

27
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:07,981
This... is a battle...
for all of us.

28
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,514
<i>That's right.</i>

29
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:13,248
<i>I have to believe in them.</i>

30
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:17,481
<i>They're committed to</i>
<i>this battle. They'll be</i>
<i>there if I need them!</i>

31
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:22,681
<i>Focus on their fighting! Wait</i>
<i>until they give me an opening!</i>

32
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:41,281
Good thing you
moved when you did.
I almost had you.

33
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,381
You seem quite confident,
Captain Kyoraku.

34
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:50,281
If that's how it appears,
I must be doing pretty
well. Thank you.

35
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:54,281
For someone who's launching
sneak attacks...you are.

36
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:55,314
Aizen...

37
00:04:56,814 --> 00:05:00,081
Swinging a sword out of
hatred is nothing more
than mindless violence.

38
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:02,781
There is no honor
in such behavior.

39
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:04,948
<i>Aizen...</i>

40
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:09,148
Your words and actions
prove that you were never
worthy of being a captain.

41
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:12,681
Hm. How interesting.

42
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:17,948
You hate me more than any
other Captain in the
Thirteen Court Guard Squads.

43
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:20,614
I never expected you to
make such a statement.

44
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:27,514
Or perhaps, when Momo recovered
from her injuries and came to
the World of the Living,

45
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:35,048
<i>...all your anger evaporated</i>
<i>and disappeared?</i>

46
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:43,748
Bankai...

47
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,281
Daiguren Hyorinmaru!

48
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:55,314
I guess what you said
earlier was right.

49
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:59,381
This sword IS
filled with hatred.
Hatred of you!

50
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:04,381
I realize now I didn't
come here to fight you.

51
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:07,381
I came here to destroy
you and end your terror!

52
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:21,814
[ramping up yell]
Yaaaa-aaaaaa!

53
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:26,148
Heh hm hm.

54
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:32,148
Such Spirit Energy!

55
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:35,848
It's strong!
And it's not
just Captain
Hitsugaya.

56
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:46,948
<i>[Izuru]</i>
<i>Captain Komamura,</i>
<i>Captain Kyoraku,</i>
<i>everybody here,</i>

57
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:51,381
<i>They're all raising their</i>
<i>Spirit Energies to the limit.</i>

58
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:53,714
This might be too much.

59
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:58,581
Being exposed to this
much Spirit Energy
could hurt Rangiku
and Momo even more!

60
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:02,514
[shallow breaths]

61
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:07,314
You're right.
But even with all
this power,

62
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:10,914
<i>You think it will be</i>
<i>enough to stop Aizen?</i>

63
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:17,248
<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>If my sword is</i>
<i>filled with hatred,</i>

64
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:24,448
I'm also unfit to be a Captain.
You want to hear that, right?

65
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:26,848
Hm!

66
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:35,648
It's true. As long as I end
up killing you, I don't
care if I lose my rank as
Captain in the process!

67
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:39,981
I'll do everything
I can to crush you.

68
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,681
You won't even have a chance
to use your Kyokasuigetsu.

69
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:55,048
Oh? You think you can stop me
from using my power? Well...

70
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:56,481
I will!

71
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:58,414
Are you ready, Aizen?

72
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:07,948
You don't look like you
want to fight me. Too bad.
Even if you don't,

73
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:09,748
I'll show no mercy!

74
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:19,514
<i>Attacking before Captain Aizen</i>
<i>can use Kyokasuigetsu?</i>

75
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:21,181
<i>How naive...</i>

76
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:27,381
<i>You have completely</i>
<i>misunderstood Captain</i>
<i>Aizen's abilities, and</i>
<i>the power he possesses.</i>

77
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,548
Hyoryusenbi!

78
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:39,881
Hyoryusenbi...Zekku!

79
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:46,948
Tenken!

80
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:48,114
Tengumaru!

81
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:53,648
I'm sorry Captain Hitsugaya!

82
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:55,414
But I'm stepping in!

83
00:08:56,548 --> 00:09:01,281
This might not be what you
wanted, but we can discuss that
after we've wrapped this up!

84
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:06,148
Do what you like. I never
expected to fight him by myself.

85
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,948
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>That's a good</i>
<i>attitude to have.</i>

86
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:09,914
Huh?!

87
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:14,748
What the?!

88
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:18,848
How'd he get there?!
It's like he's moving
too fast to track him.

89
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:24,648
A group offensive, distractions,
sneak attacks, decoys...

90
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:29,481
To battle me you'll need to
use all of those fighting
strategies and more.

91
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:32,948
Your chance of capturing me is
very slim...

92
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:34,748
How interesting!

93
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:41,648
With so many of us attacking,
you think you can stay calm?!

94
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:50,548
Nice move, Rose!
Keep him tethered
like that, so he
can't get away!

95
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:52,681
Don't worry.
I've got him!

96
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:55,614
Eeyyahhh!!!

97
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:07,814
Now!

98
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:10,448
Yaaaagh!

99
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:29,148
Aizen!

100
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:31,114
He's not
even fazed!

101
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:32,681
Quite impressive!

102
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:35,714
And he didn't even get
a single scratch...

103
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:43,548
You really thought because
you had me outnumbered,
you could crush me?!

104
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:47,048
Think again.

105
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,548
You see, my understanding of
what the word power means,

106
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:55,114
is undoubtedly radically
different than what that
word means to you.

107
00:10:56,714 --> 00:11:00,114
I'll teach you.
Here's what power is.

108
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:01,281
Huh?!

109
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:04,848
I'll give you an example.

110
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,381
Kokujo Tenken Myo-oh!

111

[gurgle]

112
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:26,681
Yahhh!

113
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:29,614
Hm.

<i>Now you see, Others don't fear</i>
<i>Captain Aizen just because he</i>
<i>can use his Kyokasuigetsu to</i>
<i>destroy them.</i>

118
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:55,781
<i>Yes, Kyokasuigetsu's</i>
<i>power is terrifying,</i>

119
00:11:56,214 --> 00:12:00,614
<i>but fearing it alone</i>
<i>wouldn't have been enough</i>
<i>to subjugate all those who</i>
<i>would rather die than obey.</i>

120
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:06,381
<i>There was only one reason why</i>

<i>different personalities and</i>
<i>uniquely individual motives.</i>

122
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:15,881
<i>It's because Captain Aizen...</i>
<i>is strength itself.</i>

123
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:22,948
His power, speed, and precision
all exceed that of a normal Soul
Reaper. He has no equal.

124
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:31,881
<i>You can attempt to safeguard</i>
<i>against his Kyokasuigetsu</i>

Even if you put your heads
together, he will outthink you.

126
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:41,948
Take all the precautions you'd
like against unfortunate
happenings like the sky falling
or the earth splitting,

127
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:45,281
but I can assure you,
there's really no use in trying.

128
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:48,214
Create all the elaborate plans
you want,

129

Have you forgotten that I
rule over the Arrancars?

133
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:21,581
Mock Arrancars like you
should never try to attack me.

134
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:35,448
It can't be!

135
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:49,548
Is it your turn now?
Very interesting.

136

Hmph.

143
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:22,714
I never expected to hear
a traitor talk about how
Soul Reapers's should act.
How ironic...

144
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:25,814
At one time-I was a teacher to
them.

145

Central Forty-Six must've been
stupid if they were letting
someone like you teach.

146
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:33,814
That surely helps explain
why a two-faced traitor
like you could fool them.

147
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,981
It's not good to talk
ill of the dead.

148
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:41,881
Let's face the facts.
You were fooled as well,
weren't you?

149
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:47,448
Really? Do you think
I was fooled by you?
Of all people, Me?!

150
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:59,448
Cloning, huh? This is quite
an impressive performance.

151
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:02,914
I feel so honored
by you praising me.

152
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:07,781
Never before has the
Stealth Force been praised
for our slick flashiness,

153
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:10,048
So to thank you,

154
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:15,014
I'm going to finish you off
with this performance!

155
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,214
Nigeki Kessatsu.

156
00:15:43,214 --> 00:15:45,181
"Nigeki Kessatsu", huh?

157
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:47,048
[gasp]

158
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:48,981
<i>What an amusing</i>
<i>technique.</i>

159
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:55,014
But it's not good enough.

160
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,448
What?!

161
00:15:57,481 --> 00:16:00,514
A Soul Reaper battle
involves Spirit Energy.

162
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:06,481
I can easily overwhelm your
silly power by accessing my
own Spirit Energy.

163
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:12,614
[gasp]

164
00:16:13,248 --> 00:16:16,214
(CT Shocked Suddenly Being
Run-Through Grunt Noticing
react)

165
00:16:16,248 --> 00:16:17,981
<i>[Shunsui]</i>
<i>How careless</i>
<i>of you.</i>

166
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:26,148
Your form made a shadow on the
ice.

167
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:30,148
<i>Kyoraku...You bastard...</i>

168
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:31,581
Hm.

169
00:16:31,948 --> 00:16:34,214
It's all over, Aizen.

170
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:36,081
Gh!

171
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:37,314
Tch.

172
00:16:41,214 --> 00:16:47,614
You really are naive...
You recklessly charge in when
you see a chance at victory.
You act on impulse.

173
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:50,448
That is your biggest
deficiency, Captain Hitsugaya.

174
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:56,981
<i>No...</i>

175
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,881
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>It's the other way around!</i>

176
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,086
They did it...

177
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,519
They sure did!

178
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:21,186
<i>The Captains,</i>
<i>they finally did it!</i>

179
00:18:21,886 --> 00:18:23,453
<i>They defeated Aizen!</i>

180
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:27,653
Hey, Izuru!
Now we've got something
to celebrate!

181
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,953
We won! so you might try
putting a smile on your face!

182
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,586
Uh, right...

183
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:38,586
Oh wow! I'm surprised
you're able to sit up!
I'm amazed!

184
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:39,619
Momo...?

185
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:41,286
Hey wait...

186
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,353
Where exactly are
you going, Momo?

187
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:46,953
<i>Hey! Wait a second!</i>

188
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:48,586
<i>Yeah-Slow down!</i>

189
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:52,353
How 'bout that.

190
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:56,286
We finally turned
this thing around.

191
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,286
Didn't we, Gin?

192
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:06,419
Hey guys...

193
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:08,753
Hold on...

194
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,886
What the hell are you guys
doing?!

195
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:24,319
Momo...!??

196
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:27,386
But how..??!

197
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,919
When did you do it?

198
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:47,886
A good question.
So when did I do it?

199
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,653
<i>My Kyokasuigetsu's power</i>
<i>is complete hypnosis,</i>

200
00:19:51,686 --> 00:19:55,119
so I have the ability to
alter your perception of
what's real.

201
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,453
It's so overpowering it can
control all five of your senses
and lead people to hallucinate
all sorts of strange things.

202
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:04,219
Shut up, I know that!!

203
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,953
I'm asking you when you
used your Kyokasuigetsu!

204
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:10,153
So here's a
question for you.

205
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:13,019
Now consider this.

206
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:17,386
At what time did you think that
I wasn't using my Kyokasuigetsu?

207
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:18,853
[gasp]

208
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:32,419
Shiro...Why...?

209
00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:39,019
Why?

210
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:51,719
[anguished scream]
Auuugggghh!!

211
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:54,486
Captain! Control yourself!!

212
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:03,386
You've left yourself...
wide open...

213
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:56,386
Damn it...

214
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:07,419
Heh heh heh.

215
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:49,887
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Aizen and Gin are</i>

<i>The rest is up to me!</i>

216
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:52,721
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>Do you really believe that we</i>
<i>are the only one's left?</i>

217
00:23:52,754 --> 00:23:53,987
