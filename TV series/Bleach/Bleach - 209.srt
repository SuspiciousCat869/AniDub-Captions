[theme song]

2
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,137
NARRATOR: 110 years
ago, the 13 court guard

3
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,337
squads were led by a different
command than they are today.

4
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,570
However, they were still
a very familiar group.

5
00:01:58,604 --> 00:02:01,004
The captain of Squad
5 was Shinji Hirako,

6
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,970
who currently
resides in the world

7
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:05,137
of the living as a Vizard.

8
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,037
Other members of
the Vizards also

9
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,337
held positions as
captains and lieutenants

10
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,604
in the 13 court guard squads.

11
00:02:12,637 --> 00:02:16,070
At the time, Kisuke Urahara
was made captain of Squad 12

12
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:18,837
based on the recommendation
of Squad 2 Captain Yoruichi

13
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,504
Shihouin.

14
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:24,770
-I'm in the process of creating
an organization unlike anything

15
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:26,570
ever seen in the Soul Society.

16
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,504
It'll be under the
control of Squad 12.

17
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:32,304
It's the Department of
Research and Development.

18
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:35,137
I would like you to assume
the seat of deputy department

19
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,670
head, Mayuri Kurotsuchi.

20
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:44,870
NARRATOR: Meanwhile, at
the Kuchiki Clan residence,

21
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:48,237
a young Byakuya practiced
his swordsmanship.

22
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,204
At Squad 13's
barracks, Kaien Shiba

23
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,504
was persuaded by Jushiro
Ukitake to accept a promotion

24
00:02:54,537 --> 00:02:56,770
to lieutenant.

25
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:58,970
With so much change,
the soul reapers

26
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,537
spent their days thinking
of the future for the Soul

27
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,370
Society and the 13
court guard squads.

28
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:09,004
But glimpses of a
growing nightmare

29
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:11,370
were already starting to show.

30
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:12,970
-Nice.

31
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:15,504
Your skill is even
better than I was told.

32
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:17,804
And how did you
find our third seat?

33
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:18,870
-Terrible.

34
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:22,470
No competition at all.

35
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:25,337
-Interesting.

36
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,504
Glad to hear it.

37
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:31,170
NARRATOR: After swinging
back to the past

38
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:33,970
and giving a glimpse
of a moment in time,

39
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:36,370
the pendulum swings
several years forward.

40
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:41,204
A new incident
occurred nine years

41
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:43,237
after Kisuke Urahara
became captain.

-Eh?

48
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:40,004
-Wha?

49
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:40,970
-Oh.

50
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:41,470
-Huh?

51
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:48,770
-Huh?

52
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:50,804
Oh, good morning, Kisuke.

53
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:52,004
-Hey.

54
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:54,504
And a good morning to
you, too, Captain Hirako.

55
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:57,104
-I told you before,
just call me Shinji.

56
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:58,770
You're such a pain sometimes.

57
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:00,737
-[laughing]

58
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,004
-Good morning, Mayuri.

59
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:09,704
-How many times have I told you
to address me by my last name?

60
00:05:09,737 --> 00:05:12,270
Kurotsuchi isn't hard.

61
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:15,670
-[groan] You are a pain.

62
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:19,437
Oh, by the way, have you heard
the latest news yet, Kisuke?

63
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,404
-No, I haven't.

64
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:22,137
What happened?

65
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,604
--[screams] Hey, what's the
big idea kicking me like that,

66
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:27,704
Hiyori?

67
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:30,970
-You said good morning
to everyone but me.

68
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:32,170
What?

69
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:34,504
I'm not good enough to say
good morning to anymore?

70
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:36,570
-If I said good
morning, you'd kick me

71
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:37,770
for saying good morning.

72
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,137
-[growling]

73
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,470
-Is this the mouth you
say good morning with?

74
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:46,404
-[laughing]

75
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:48,970
-By the way, I was
wondering, have you

76
00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:50,804
heard the latest news yet?

77
00:05:50,837 --> 00:05:52,637
-No, I still haven't.

78
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,370
-You don't know about
the violent deaths

79
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:55,704
in Rukon District?

80
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:56,504
-Hold it.

81
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:58,637
I was just about to tell him.

82
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,770
Way to bring it all
back full circle.

83
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:02,437
-Violent deaths?

84
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,470
-Yeah.

85
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:05,237
In the past month
or so, there's been

86
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,704
a series of residents
disappearing in the Rukon

87
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:08,937
District.

88
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,870
The reason is unknown.

89
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,170
-Disappearing?

90
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:15,370
As in, they went somewhere
and then never came back?

91
00:06:15,404 --> 00:06:17,604
-You dumbass, that's
not disappearing.

92
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:19,270
That's called running away.

93
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:22,737
And if they just ran away, then
nobody would care about them.

94
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,704
No one would go looking.

95
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,037
Not this.

96
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,337
This is different.

97
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,404
They literally disappear.

98
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:34,204
Gone without a trace, leaving
only their clothes behind.

99
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:36,904
If they died and became reishi,
the clothes they were wearing

100
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,770
would disappear as well.

101
00:06:38,804 --> 00:06:40,004
They didn't die.

102
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:42,537
They vanished alive, unable
to retain human form.

103
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,237
That's the only
explanation I can think of.

104
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,770
-Alive but unable to
retain human form, huh?

105
00:06:49,804 --> 00:06:51,504
-I wasn't there, mind you.

106
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,904
I'm just telling
you exactly what

107
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:55,004
I heard from Captain Unohana.

108
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,037
Now you know what I know.

109
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,004
Well, at any rate, Squad 9 has
already arrived on the scene

110
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:02,637
to investigate.

111
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:14,737
-Hey.

112
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,570
Hey!

113
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:18,670
Are you listening to me, Kensei?

114
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:22,737
What do you mean by unknown?

115
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,370
-Quiet already!

116
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:26,237
Unknown means unknown!

117
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,370
Quit babbling!

118
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:28,704
-What's wrong with you?

119
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:31,104
A captain doesn't just go
investigate something unknown

120
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:33,137
without knowing
what it is first!

121
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,470
-We can't know!

122
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,970
It's unknown!

123
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:38,870
-Yeah, but an advance
party was sent out first.

124
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:40,170
10 people!

125
00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:42,504
You could have just waited
for them to report, but no!

126
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:43,337
I'm Kensei!

127
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,004
I can't wait!

128
00:07:44,037 --> 00:07:44,904
-Lieutenant, please.

129
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:46,437
You're doing it again.

130
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,670
-I'm Kensei, I'm--

131
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:50,137
-Captain, please
try to calm down.

132
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,170
-She acts like this
just to annoy you.

133
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:53,537
-In the first
place, I don't ever

134
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,870
remember asking
you to come along.

135
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:58,570
You can leave this
investigation anytime.

136
00:07:58,604 --> 00:08:00,537
As a matter of fact,
I wish you would.

137
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,137
-Ooh, don't you know that
it's against the rules

138
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,904
for a lieutenant to
leave her captain's side?

139
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:09,204
Shame on you for not
knowing that, Kensei.

I can't believe you
don't know the rules,

145
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:18,337
and you're the captain!

146
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,404
Maybe I should be the captain,
because I know the rules

147
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:21,070
and you don't.

-Didn't you hear me?

167
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:31,541
You have to get out of here!

168
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:35,308
Run and don't stop!

169

[screaming]

170
00:09:43,574 --> 00:09:45,508
-It's a Hollow.

171
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,408
-Enormous.

00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,408
-It's a child.

175
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:54,041
-Let's go.

-Damn it.

179
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,608
-Four strikes and it
still won't let go.

180
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:13,574
-Move!

181

-Hey, hurry up and
get out of here.

186
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:50,674
You don't want to die, do you?

-[roar]

00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,908
-Men, back off!

-Yes, sir!

190
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,508
-Now, blast away.

191
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:16,374

00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:01,141
-Yes, sir.

-[crying]

196
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:15,841
-Hey, what are you
crying for, kid?

197
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:17,241
At least you're alive.

198
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:18,074
You should be happy.

199
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,108
Laugh, or else!

200
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,574
-That's a bit much,
don't you think?

201
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:27,608
-No, I don't.

202
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:29,208
Come on, stand up.

203
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:35,274
What's your name anyway, huh?

204
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:39,908
-Shu-- Shuhei.

205
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:41,408
Shuhei Hisagi.

206
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:42,974
-Shuhei Hisagi.

207
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:45,274
A mighty strong sounding name.

208
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:47,241
Stop crying!

209
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:50,341
-[crying]

210
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:52,574
-What are you crying
about now, kid?

211
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,741
I said stop crying.

212
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,574
You've got to be kidding me.

213
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:58,074
-[crying]

214
00:12:58,108 --> 00:12:58,574
-Kensei!

215
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:02,874
-Mashiro.

216
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,874
Where the hell did you
go during the battle?

217
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:07,208
-Listen, while I was
hiding in the bushes,

218
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:09,041
look what I found on the ground.

219
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:09,608
See?

220
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:11,908
A squad uniform.

221
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:12,374
-Hmm.

222
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:18,274
-But wait.

223
00:13:18,308 --> 00:13:20,541
There were a whole
bunch of them there.

224
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:22,374
10 of them.

225
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:24,041
-10 uniforms?

226
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,874
-Captain, they must be--

227
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:30,374
-What?

228
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:31,441
What?

229
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:33,341
Does 10 of them mean
something important?

230
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,208
Well?

231
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:37,541
-You're such an idiot.

232
00:13:37,574 --> 00:13:41,974
10 was the number of men
in the advance party.

233
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:43,074
-Wait, I don't understand.

234
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:45,541
These were taken
off way over there.

235
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,974
-How could they
have been removed

236
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:49,174
with the sash still tied?

237
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,308
How could they have taken off
their socks with their sandals

238
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:53,841
still on?

239
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,741
-Huh?

240
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:57,008
Hmm.

241
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:57,508
-Shinobu!

242
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,041
-Yes, sir.

243
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:00,841
-Contact Central 46.

244
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,141
Souls have vanished, and we
have our first Soul Reaper

245
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:04,108
casualties.

246
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:05,341
-Yes, sir.

247
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:06,074
-Izaemon.

248
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:07,208
-Sir.

249
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,041
-There's a possibility
of an unknown pathogen

250
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:11,174
that disintegrates souls.

251
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,774
Request that Squad 12
send lab personnel.

252
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:15,274
-Yes, sir.

253
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:15,774
-Heizo.

254
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:17,108
-Sir.

255
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:20,174
-Have the rest of the squad
standing by and send for tents.

256
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,574
We'll set up camp here tonight.

257
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:23,908
-Right.

258
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:26,841
-If this is the work of an
enemy targeting Soul Reapers,

259
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:30,341
then they will eventually
target the Seireitei as well.

260
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:32,908
We'll crush them here
before they get anywhere

261
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,408
near the Seireitei.

262
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,308
-Sir.

263
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:38,374
-Go!

264
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:40,608
-Captain, what about me?

265
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:42,074
-You and I will check the area.

266
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:43,574
Let's go.

267
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:44,974
Hey, kid.

268
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:47,508
You should go on home now, and
quickly, before it gets dark.

269
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,608
-Uh.

270
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:50,541
-Understand, kid?

271
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,074
-You weren't serious about
camping out, were you?

272
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:08,541
I'm not really a tent person.

273
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,474
-Sorry.

274
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,941
We're all out of
four star hotels.

275
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:14,174
-Kensei, you're such a jerk.

276
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,008
-Hmm.

277
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:35,874
Hmm.

278
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:36,574
Nice.

279
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:37,108
Very nice.

280
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,741
Hey, I'm still waiting
for container number 22!

281
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:48,074
I can't believe
how slow you are.

282
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:48,574
Move!

283
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:50,374
Hurry it up!

284
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:54,541
Damn it, at this rate, it'll be
dark before you bring it over.

285
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:57,008
-Shut your hole!

286
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,341
I was being nice
and helping you,

287
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:01,374
so that's no way to
talk to me, you jerk!

288
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:04,941
You better change your attitude!

289
00:16:04,974 --> 00:16:08,141
-What are you so angry
about all of a sudden?

290
00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:10,108
Honestly, that side of you.

291
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:11,441
It's quite a turn-off.

292
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:13,941
-Would you shut up already?

293
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,474
In the first place,
why do I have

294
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,441
to assist someone
as rude as you?

295
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:19,341
After all, I'm a lieutenant.

296
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:21,274
What in the hell is your rank?

297
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:22,708
Tell me that?

298
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:23,908
-Absurd.

299
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,141
Ranks are for commoners.

300
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:27,274
I have no need for
such silly labels.

301
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:29,674
-And yet you have a rank.

302
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,641
I'll tell you what it is.

303
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:34,074
You're a third, and
I'm a lieutenant.

304
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:35,308
I outrank you!

305
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:38,108
Which means you're not
allowed to order me around!

306
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:40,941
-You're misreading the
situation completely.

307
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:43,441
Here at the Department of
Research and Development,

308
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:45,041
I am the deputy head.

309
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:49,108
You're the laboratory chief,
which means I outrank you.

310
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,341
If you insist on quoting
squad rules to me,

311
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:53,374
then as long as you're
here, you must obey my

312
00:16:53,408 --> 00:16:55,874
every command and not
the other way around.

313
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:57,341
-Kisuke!

314
00:16:57,374 --> 00:16:59,441
-Yes?

315
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:01,208
What is it this time?

316
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:03,741
I was trying to get some sleep.

317
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,308
I thought I asked you
to be quiet, didn't I?

318
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:07,908
-Do something about this guy!

319
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:10,541
You obviously haven't
trained him well.

320
00:17:10,574 --> 00:17:11,341
Huh?

321
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:13,841
What is that thing on your back?

322
00:17:13,874 --> 00:17:16,441
-Oh, you mean this thing?

323
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:19,608
It's my prototype
for a new gigai.

324
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:22,708
Do you remember what Captain
Hirako said this morning?

325
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,074
About the incidents
in the Rukon District

326
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:26,674
where he believes
people vanished

327
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,541
without being able to
retain their human form?

328
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:32,141
Supposing that what
he says is true,

329
00:17:32,174 --> 00:17:33,708
I thought that if
we were to place

330
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:35,841
a soul on the verge
of disintegration

331
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:39,008
into a human mold, the
soul would not vanish.

332
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,841
I'm trying to see if I
could apply gigai technology

333
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:44,608
to making that mold
into a reality.

334
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,383
-You're what?

335
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:53,809
IZAEMON (OFFSCREEN): Excuse me.

336
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:56,403
I'm Izaemon Todo,
Sixth Seat of Squad 9.

337
00:17:56,403 --> 00:18:00,070
Is Kisuke Urahara,
Captain of Squad 12 here?

338
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:01,470
-Hm.

339
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:03,803
IZAEMON (OFFSCREEN): I've come
to convey a request from Kensei

340
00:18:03,837 --> 00:18:05,037
Muguruma, Captain of Squad 9.

341
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:15,237
-Interesting.

342
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,670
I understand.

343
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,970
I'll select personnel
immediately and send them

344
00:18:19,003 --> 00:18:19,837
tonight.

345
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,703
In the meantime,
I would like you

346
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:23,870
to go back and
help your captain.

347
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:24,937
-Yes sir.

348
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,803
Thank you very much.

349
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:31,470
-Now then, time to
select personnel.

350
00:18:31,503 --> 00:18:32,737
Go on, go.

351
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,970
-Why the hell do I
have to go there?

352
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:37,603
Can't you send someone
lower in rank than me?

353
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:39,637
-All you do is complain.

354
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,270
You find everything
disagreeable.

355
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,437
Why don't you just quit
being a lieutenant already?

356
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,770
-Why don't I just
quit letting you live,

357
00:18:46,803 --> 00:18:49,037
Akon, you disrespectful
little worm?

358
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,137
-It's ready, Deputy Head.

359
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:51,837
-Good work.

360
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,537
Thanks.

361
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,137
-Ugh, I hate all of you!

362
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,137
-I'm sorry, Hiyori, but
you're the only person

363
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,070
that I can confidently entrust
with a task as important

364
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:00,770
as this one.

365
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,337
Take anything you thank
you're going to need,

366
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,870
even if you have
to take something

367
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,137
from the Captain's office.

368
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,937
Remember, get a sample
from the site of the souls

369
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,770
that vanished.

370
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:16,737
It'll prove to be very valuable.

371
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,870
I'm counting on you, Hiyori.

372
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:21,637
Don't let me down.

373
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,070
-Aw, damn it.

374
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:30,037
OK, but I'm gonna need a
pretty big expense account!

375
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,303
Remember that!

376
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,570
-Huh?

377
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:34,637
I must say, when all
is said and done,

378
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,270
that I got off pretty cheap.

379
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,137
-What took you so long, Izaemon?

380
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,370
-I'm sorry.

381
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:56,103
I had to go to the Squad
12 barracks for assistance.

382
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:57,903
Please forgive me.

383
00:19:57,937 --> 00:19:59,203
I'll relieve you now.

384
00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:01,137
You can go inside and rest.

385
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,303
-You really shouldn't be so lax.

386
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:06,603
Now that you're back, the
three of us will keep watch.

387
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:09,803
-We'll take turns, one man
at a time, every two hours.

388
00:20:09,837 --> 00:20:13,537
Heizo is resting inside with
the captain and the others.

389
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,470
You take watch over there.

390
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:16,503
-Right.

391
00:20:16,537 --> 00:20:17,003
Understood.

392
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:27,937
MASHIRO (OFFSCREEN): [snoring]

393
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,903
-Huh?

394
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:34,903
MASHIRO (OFFSCREEN): [snoring]

395
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:37,203
-How can she fall
asleep so nonchalantly

396
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,437
under a condition like this one?

397
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,270
Hey, your collar fell open.

398
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:47,903
-Kensei, you're such
a pervert. [laughing]

399
00:20:47,937 --> 00:20:50,170
-Ugh, you're even
annoying while asleep.

400
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:51,537
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): [groan]

401
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,703
-Huh?

402
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:54,270
What happened?

403
00:21:08,303 --> 00:21:10,137
-Izaemon?

404
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:14,503
What in the world?

405
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:18,370
-[groan]

406
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,470
-Izaemon!

407
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:20,403
-Damn.

408
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:22,670
Keep your guard up, Heizo.

409
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:24,803
The enemy is still nearby.

410
00:21:24,837 --> 00:21:25,870
Mashiro!

411
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:26,970
Wake up, Mashiro!

412
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:28,470
-[groan]

413
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,537
-Heizo!

414
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,037
Huh?

415
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,503
What-- what is this?

416
00:21:50,537 --> 00:21:52,503
[groan]

417
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:03,937
You?

418
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,937
Not you.

419
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:20,961
[theme song]

420
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:48,172
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Captain Hirako,

421
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:49,972
why was Squad 9
sent to investigate?

422
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,772
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Kensei and Mashiro

423
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,239
are constantly fighting.

424
00:23:53,272 --> 00:23:54,539
It's so noisy.

425
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:57,005
The Head Captain hasn't been
getting much sleep lately.

426
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,039
It's part of his
solution to the problem.

427
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:00,405
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): Really?

428
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,472
Look who's talking.
