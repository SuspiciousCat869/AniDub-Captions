I should say so,
but, a giraffe??

15
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:40,891
A cat.

16
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:44,291
Oh! Lady Yoruichi!

Here!

And I will pass out
my Squad's New Year's
cards as well!

Yes, everything is, Rangiku.

29

I realize it's New Year's,
but you mustn't neglect your
duties as a Soul Reaper--

30
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:16,791
Lieutenant! Hey!

31
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,025
Why'd you send out these
cards for New Years??!

32
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:21,958
They are disgraceful
and so inappropriate!

33
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:25,491
Please retrieve each and
every one of these hideous
cards immediately,

34

and replace them with
something beautiful
and more tasteful.

Not like that one.

38

Rangiku, look.
the thing is,

39
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:42,591
[Nanao]
Just a minute.

40
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,225
Ut!

41
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,791
New Year's card designs are
chosen by whoever sends them.

42
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:49,225
Hey, I was talking
to my subordinate--

43
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:50,891
She's totally right.

44
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:54,558
I mean Squad 7's card has
Captain Komamura's photo on it.

45
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:56,358
<i>And it's not even</i>
<i>the Year of the Dog.</i>

<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>He doesn't even believe</i>
<i>in the Chinese Zodiac!</i>

<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>It's the year of the cat, see?</i>

<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>No! It's definitely not!</i>

00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:07,425
<i>Oh no! This is...</i>
<i>Lady Yoruichi's card!</i>

50
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:11,691
What's the
matter, Captain?

51
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:15,825
Yoruichi, there's a New Year's
card for you as well.

52
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:16,825
[Yoruichi]
Okay!

53
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,291
Let's take a look then.

54
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,458
Oh!

55
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:23,991
I forgot to send a
card to Soi Fon.

56
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:26,925
[Nemu]
I'll tell you what
I would prefer.

57
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,691
<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>Are you crazy?!</i>
<i>You can't hand out</i>
<i>pictures like that!</i>

58
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:33,925
I know I would prefer if
I wasn't quite so tall...

59
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,758
<i>[Isane]</i>
<i>Nobody asked you about your</i>
<i>hang-up about being so tall!</i>

60
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:39,825
Captain, this is a
really weird dynamic.

61
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:43,225
Can you explain why
these ladies keep changing
the subject on us?

62
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,491
No, I've got no clue.

63
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:48,991
However you must
agree that they are
mixing too much play
with their work.

64
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:51,125
I think that is fairly obvious!

65
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,791
<i>[Nanao]</i>
<i>I don't appreciate</i>
<i>what you just said!</i>

Hm!?
Huh?
Hunh?

67
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:59,291
Comments like yours that tend to
trivialize women are absolutely
unacceptable here, Captain!

68
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:02,158
<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>Tell that to the guys</i>
<i>who said it and not me!</i>

69
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:04,691
Let's review the facts.

70
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:08,791
This started because you
made some narrow-minded
comments over a small thing
like New Year's cards!

71
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:12,058
Hah! Majoring in
minor things,
Look who's talking?!

72
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:15,658
Don't go there, Ikkaku.
You can't win a battle
of wits with women.

73
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:19,291
What was that?!
Are you saying women
just enjoy arguing?

74
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:21,791
Hey I never even said
anything to you!

75
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:26,858
Yes you did! You said I
was hung-up about being
tall, so see; you're the
ones who want to argue!

76
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:29,991
<i>[Shuhei]</i>
<i>Well then that's it!</i>
<i>We'll have to settle this</i>
<i>thing once and for all!</i>

00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,058
Hm!?
Huh?
Hunh?

<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>Izuru! Shuhei!</i>

79
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,158
As a man, I have my share
of pride to uphold here.

80
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,225
What now... ?

81
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,025
Then it's on.

82
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,225
It's so on!!

83
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,225
[all growling]

84
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:47,991
Now, now, everybody.
Calm down.

85
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,291
This will be a match to
the finish, the women
versus the men in:

86
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:59,858
The First Annual
Men vs Women:
New Years Whacky
Karuta Card Tournament!

87
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:06,191
And this way, no one from our
squads will get unnecessarily
killed or disemboweled!

88
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,158
Why karuta?
And why am I
in this too?

89
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:11,158
All right then, let's begin!

90
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,925
Wait-Hold on!
Aren't you going to
explain the rules?

91
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,725
It's regular karuta.
Verses in a 5-7-5
syllable format!

92
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:20,591
Okay, here's the first card!

93
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:26,091
<i>It's early morning,</i>
<i>The Third Seat Madarame</i>
<i>The year's first sunrise!</i>

94
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:26,691
Here!

95
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:27,958
Hrg.

96
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:33,025
<i>The New Year has come</i>
<i>And Third Seat Madarame</i>
<i>Stacks up large rice cakes.</i>

97
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:33,791
<i>[Nanao]</i>
<i>Found it!</i>

98

99
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:40,058
<i>He hit the jackpot</i>
<i>The Third Seat Madarame</i>
<i>Pachinko ball face.</i>

100
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:42,291
Hold on!

101
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:46,625
What's with these cards?!
Knock it off!! I've got the
feeling you're picking on me!

102
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:49,958
And that third card, very funny!
What's with the pachinko balls?!

103
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:51,858
They've got nothing
at all to do with
New Year's at all!

104
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:54,791
You are ejected for arguing
with the game judge!

105
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:59,825
A red card!!?!
What kinda rule is that?!
I've never even heard
of that one!

106
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:01,091
I just made it now.

107
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:09,358
<i>Year of the Rabbit</i>
<i>Of course, even doggies, too,</i>
<i>wear cute rabbit ears.</i>

108
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:10,625
Hmm.

109
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:12,891
It's there!

110
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:14,858
Haaa!

111
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:16,358
[Isane]
Hee-e!

112
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,225
I got it!

113
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:28,425
Not fair! She's taller!
And has a longer reach
than I do!

114
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,425
Stop whining.

115
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:35,091
<i>Greeting the New Year</i>
<i>saying prayers for long life</i>
<i>for the Head Captain.</i>

116
00:07:36,558 --> 00:07:37,658
[Rangiku]
Hunnh.

117
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,025
It starts with
"Greeting the New Year,"

118
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:43,758
so to match it I
need a "Gree".

119
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:46,425
gree... gree... ?

120
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,191
Where is it? Let's see...

121
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:50,325
"Gree"...

122
00:07:50,358 --> 00:07:51,758
Augh!
Whoa!
Eeww!

123
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,991
Outrageous... Disgraceful...

124
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:00,391
[Izuru]
That's not fair!

125
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:06,725
Using your "secret weapons"
to make Shuhei bleed...
So you'd do that to win?!

126
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:09,491
Hey it's not my fault
that he got a nosebleed!

127
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:15,825
Festive New Year's broth
with freshly pounded rice cakes
Gegetsuburi.

128
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:16,691
Ah!

129
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,591
Since it's come to this!
Raise your head! Wabisuke!

130
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:22,025
Ah!

<i>Got it!</i>

That wasn't right!

133

That move was
going too far!

134
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:30,025
Well Judge!
Wasn't that move illegal?!

135
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:32,191
Well, uh...

136
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,791
<i>[Yachiru]</i>

Did you hear us!??
And that wasn't even
close to the right form!

All right. Now let's
get back to the game.

00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:26,658
Now we're even.

150
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:31,191
Why... is... this happening...?

Huh?! It's gone!

156
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:55,825
[Isane]
Got it!

157
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:56,958
What?!

158
00:09:57,491 --> 00:10:00,425
So then that other
one was a decoy??

159
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,225
You are an idiot.

160
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:03,625
It's time to
step things up!

Uh Captain, I've
been thinking...

176
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:27,825
Wasn't there something you
came here to see me about?

177

The first-of-the-New Year
shrine visit.

183
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:31,751
[sigh] I wonder how
everyone else is spending
their New Year's?

184

[Ichigo]
Hey! Slow down, Wait up!

185
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:47,784
Your New Year's gift money's
not gonna disappear and the

<i>[giggles] Oh C'mon, keep up!</i>

Hold on! How come I'm the one
stuck carrying all this?!

188
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:11,518
Because you're a guy!
I'd say you're probably
strong enough to carry those
game consoles all day long.

189
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:16,251
Besides, I have to save up my
energy so I'll be ready to play
them as soon as we get home!

190

That's great, you're wearing
me out, so you can beat me!!

Uh-huh!

Well I get to
pick the game!!

No!

194
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:23,018
I wanna do the one
that's racing through
the candy first!

Quit whining!

No!

Ah?

00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:40,918
<i>There's a surprise!</i>
<i>So that's how Uryu spends</i>
<i>time with his family.</i>

199
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:45,418
<i>That's nice. I guess</i>
<i>everyone spends time with</i>
<i>their families on New Years.</i>

200
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:49,684
<i>I bet that same kind of</i>
<i>family bonding is probably</i>
<i>going on at Tatsuki's too.</i>

201
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:53,084
<i>It wouldn't be right for me</i>
<i>to bother them or intrude.</i>

<i>Ah! I've gotta stop</i>
<i>being so down!</i>

Hey! It's a New Year!
Time for a new start!

204
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:01,818
Happy New Year!

[yawn]

206
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:09,018
What was that big
yawn about Renji?

207
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:10,951
You already bored
with the New Year?

208
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,451
It's not that, I
just feel worn out.

209
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:18,484
Last night Tetsuzaemon and
the guys took me out to a party
and kept me out really late.

210
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:21,884
I bet Ichigo would get a
big kick out of seeing
you so wiped out.

211
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:27,918
I bet he would. Let's hurry
up and finish this New Year's
greetings tour, so I can get
back home and sleep...

212
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:30,918
Hey. Orihime.

213
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:35,251
Oh, hey you two,
great to see you!

214
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:38,851
Happy New Year,
All the best!

215
00:14:39,518 --> 00:14:40,984
Thanks. Happy
New Year.

216
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,451
Yeah, Happy
New Year.

217
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:45,518
So what'cha doing,
just walking around?

218
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,951
I thought I might make a New
Year's shrine visit.

219
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:49,451
A shrine visit?

220
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:54,051
Yup. But it was too
crowded, so I figured I'd
maybe do it another day.

221
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:56,484
So are you two on
your way to a shrine?

222
00:14:56,851 --> 00:15:01,151
Not us. We came here to the
World of the Living to share
our New Year's greetings.

223
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:05,184
That sounds great, I've
been meeting up with a
lot of people today.

224
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:08,918
So tell me-Which of our friends
have you already visited?

225
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:13,218
Hm! Let's see, there was
Ichigo, Uryu, and some
of my school friends,

226
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:17,851
But I really shouldn't say
"I met up with them" because
we didn't really talk, I only
saw them from a distance.

227
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,184
Ah! So Ichigo's in the area?

228
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:23,618
C'mon, let's hurry and
get these New Year's
greetings over with.

229
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:25,718
You wanna tag
along with us?

230
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,884
No thanks, I
think I'll pass.

231
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:29,051
Huh?

232
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:32,351
Everybody's spending time
with their families today.

233
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:36,184
I don't think it would be right
to interrupt their special
holiday time together.

234
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:39,151
So that's what you do
for New Year's in the
World of the Living?

235
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:42,884
Oh, we do all kinds of
things! Some people
spend it alone, like me.

236
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,251
[chuckle]

237
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:48,051
Oh, I see.

238
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:50,584
[yawn]

239
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:53,784
Okay, well let's
get going. C'mon!
You're coming with us.

240
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:55,551
Hunh!? Wait! But I!

241
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:58,051
[yawn]
Huh?

242
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:00,584
<i>[group of kids]</i>
<i>Yoisho!</i>

<i>Again!</i>

244

<i>-Yoisho!</i>
<i>-Again!</i>

245
00:16:05,384 --> 00:16:07,251
I should've known
we'd come here.

246
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:11,651
Hey there, what's up guys.
A most Happy New Year to
all of you!

247
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:14,618
Thanks and a Happy New
Year to all of you, too!

248
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:16,484
What are you pounding
with that big hammer?

249
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:19,218
We're pounding out
some mochi together.

250
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:23,251
We're just doing
something kinda festive
to celebrate New Year's.

251
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,851
You wanna try
pounding some out?

252
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:28,918
Oh! I'd love to
try doing that!

253
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:30,484
[sigh]

254
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,284
Here I go!

255
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:35,618
And why am I
doing this?!!

256
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:37,784
Hammer it, Ururu!

257
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:40,418
Yosho!
Yaaiaaiaiaiaa!

258
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,684
Oh! Almost!

259
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:46,718
Whaddya mean "almost"?!
It sounds like you actually
wanted me to get hit!

260
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:48,751
Aren't you supposed to be
aiming for the mochi?!

261
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,051
This time...

262
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:56,118
Hey! I'm not mochi! Stop it!

263
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:57,618
Yoisho!

264
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:58,118
Yes!

265
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,451
<i>Auughhh!!!!</i>

266
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:02,651
Nice shot!

267
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:08,818
C'mon! Don't wimp out!
When you hit it back,
give it a little more heat!

268
00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:14,418
D'aagh!

269
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:18,951
That one had
some real heat.

270
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:20,451
You suck, Renji.

271
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:21,884
Just shut up!

272
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:24,684
I'm too sleep-deprived
to play this game well!

273
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:27,151
[Ururu]
Okay, face-painting time!

274
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:29,551
<i>[Renji]</i>
<i>W-Whoa! That's a big brush!</i>

275
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,218
[Rukia]
So, how'd you do with
Ururu's face painting?

276
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:38,318
I got pretty inked up,
just like you!

277
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:42,551
Although, we got off pretty
easy compared to Renji.

278
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:44,484
Go on, laugh.

279
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:46,051
You don't look so bad.

280
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:47,818
Well I sure don't look good!

281
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,818
Now that you've all had
a chance to wash up,

282
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:53,984
You'll wanna change.
So I brought you these clothes.

283
00:17:54,018 --> 00:17:55,384
Those are...

284
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:57,518
Wow! Cute kimonos!

285
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:02,018
Today I had the perfect
New Year's experience.

286
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:04,984
The only thing left is a
New Year's shrine visit.

287
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:09,351
A visit to a shrine?
Well we could stop at
one on the way home.

288
00:18:09,618 --> 00:18:11,284
Yeah well, you
can count me out.

289
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:13,084
<i>[Tessai]</i>
<i>stop what you're doing!!!</i>

290
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,018
What did I do?!

291
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:21,751
Now you listen to this, Renji!
Red sea bream is not just a
fish, it is very special!

292
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:24,751
It holds legendary place
in our New Year's feast.

293
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:28,618
Long ago, tales were
told of the custom of
"staring at the sea bream"

294
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:31,584
and refraining from
eating sea bream on
New Year's day!

295
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:33,318
[sigh]

296
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:35,418
Okay okay, I hear
what you're sayin'.

297
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:37,384
[steamed]
Rrrr!

298
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:39,118
<i>[Tessai]</i>
<i>I said "stop that!"</i>

299
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:45,518
<i>[Renji] [getting beat up]</i>
<i>Ow! Damn it! What'd you hit me</i>
<i>for?! That hurt! Oww! Geez</i>
<i>Kid! Watch where you hit me!</i>

300
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:50,584
Oh man! This whole New Year's
thing really sucks.

301
00:18:51,518 --> 00:18:55,351
I would've stayed in bed
if I'd known New Year's
was gonna be like this.

302
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,684
You really mean that?

303
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:57,584
What?!

304
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:01,151
I haven't enjoyed my New Year's
this much in a long time!

305
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:04,251
Well I'm certainly glad
you had a good time...

306
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:07,751
But how come I always
end up getting the short
end of the stick?

307
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:13,051
I mean isn't New Year's...
meant to be a time when we
all get to mellow out?

308
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:15,784
I can see how that
might sound good.

309
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:19,751
But New Year's is no fun
if you're all by yourself.

310
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,184
Huh?

311
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:24,384
Orihime...

312
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,851
<i>[Tessai]</i>
<i>The ozoni is ready now!</i>

313
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:34,884
Wow it's ready!
C'mon, let's go eat!

314
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:36,284
Sure.

315
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:38,251
You too, Renji! Come on!

316
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:44,751
<i>[Renji]</i>
<i>What?</i>

317
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:51,018
<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>Well! See you around</i>
<i>Rukia, Orihime.</i>

318
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:54,918
Great seeing you
and Happy New Year.

319
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:58,118
And as for the kimono,
just give it back
next time.

320
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:01,584
Thank you very much for all
the fun, and Happy New Year.

321
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:10,284
And thank you Rukia.

322
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:13,218
Well I guess I'll be
heading home now.

323
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:14,351
[Rukia]
Wait Orihime.

324
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:15,318
Hm?

325
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,384
Didn't you want to
go visit the shrine?

326
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:22,551
Well, I feel like it's
too late for that.

327
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:28,051
By now there's probably no one
there, so I don't think it
would be all that much fun.

328
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:30,251
Come on, you
never know.

329
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:35,318
No, the vendors are
probably all gone, so
it'll be empty and boring.

330
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:36,818
Let's go anyway.

331
00:20:36,851 --> 00:20:38,184
Uh! Okay!

332
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,784
It's just like I said,
there's no one's here.

333
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:52,718
But we came all this way,
So let's say our prayers
before we leave.

334
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:55,084
Even though it's
just the two of us.

335
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:58,251
[Ichigo]
Wait. You'd better
include us, too.

336
00:20:58,284 --> 00:20:59,084
Huh?

337
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:12,384
You're all here!

338
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:18,451
Hey there you two!
Happy New Year, Orihime.

339
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:19,784
Hi Ichigo!

340
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:25,284
I thought I'd see you
earlier today. I mean
you could've at least
called one of us.

341
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:25,918
Um-hm.

342
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,151
Hi Uryu!
And hi Chad!

343
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:32,984
Well Happy New Year Orihime.
Good to see you.

344
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,951
Yeah, Happy New Year.

345
00:21:35,818 --> 00:21:37,451
You guys made it just in time.

346
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:40,884
Never thought I'd have
to work so hard at the
start of a New Year.

347
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:42,751
Thanks you guys.

348
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:47,684
Ngeh, Alright, we're
done here, let's end
this, so I can go home
and get some sleep.

349
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:49,651
Can't admit
it, can you?

350
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:50,618
Shut up!

351
00:22:04,118 --> 00:22:07,951
[Orihime]
I pray that we can all share
another wonderful year together.

352
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:47,374

355
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:54,407

<i>Go where?</i>

359
00:23:57,674 --> 00:23:58,441
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>The castle.</i>

360
00:23:58,474 --> 00:23:59,541
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>And do what?</i>

361
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:01,007
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>Play Monsters.</i>
