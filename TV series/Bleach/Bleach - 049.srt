00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:41,686
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
So tomorrow, I die.

3
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,420
It seems strange,
but even when I

4
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:48,686
heard that my execution was
set for tomorrow, I wasn't sad.

5
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:56,520
It must because of the
dream I had last night, that

6
00:01:56,553 --> 00:02:00,086
dream about the night
I can never forget.

7
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:06,620
MAN: Please, wait in
here for a moment.

8
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:08,386
The lieutenant will
be here shortly.

9
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,720
Make yourself comfortable.

10
00:02:09,753 --> 00:02:10,986
-I, um--

11
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,320
-Yes, what is it?

12
00:02:13,353 --> 00:02:16,153
-I'm just an ordinary
new member in the squad.

13
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:18,753
Please try to treat be the
same as everyone else here.

14
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:19,253
-Oh, yes.

15
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:20,353
Of course.

16
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:24,586
I'll try to keep it in
mind. [laugh] [sigh]

17
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,253
MAN: Did you hear
about this new girl?

18
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:28,853
MAN 2: Yeah, she's supposed
to be from the Kuchiki clan.

19
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:31,386
MAN 3: Great, just what we
need-- another captain's pet

20
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,453
getting treated better
than the rest of us.

21
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,020
-I heard she didn't even
have to pass the graduation

22
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:37,920
exam to get into the squad.

23
00:02:37,953 --> 00:02:38,986
MAN: What a joke.

24
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,753
And here we've got to
bust out butts just

25
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,986
to stay out of trouble.

26
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,353
MAN 2: It's not fair,
but that's life.

27
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:45,320
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): It's the
same here as everywhere else.

28
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:46,520
KAIEN: Hey!

29
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:49,020
What are you lazy bums
doing hanging around here?

30
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:51,420
Get back to your
posts, all of you.

31
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:56,953
-Hello, I'm Lieutenant
Kaien Shiba.

32
00:02:56,986 --> 00:02:57,686
Welcome aboard.

33
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:02,253
-I see.

34
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:03,953
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:06,320
-What did you just say?

36
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,853
What kind of greeting
is that supposed to be?

37
00:03:09,886 --> 00:03:12,153
I am your commanding officer.

38
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:13,853
You are supposed
to state your name

39
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:15,353
and say, pleased
to meet you sir.

40
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:17,653
What's your name, damn it?

41
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:22,286
-Uh, it's Rukia Kuchiki, sir.

42
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,353
-And?

43
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,620
-And-- and I'm pleased
to meet your, sir!

44
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:27,320
-All right.

45
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:29,686
You're OK, Rukia.

46
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,186
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
A normal greeting.

47
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,753
A normal scolding.

48
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:36,653
A normal relationship between
officer and subordinate.

49
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:39,853
-Welcome to Squad 13, the
best squad of them all.

50
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,553
Unfortunately, our captain
isn't in the best of health.

51
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:44,686
So I pretty much run
things around here.

52
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,653
In fact, it's not a
problem if now and then you

53
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:50,920
forgot and accidentally
addressed me as Captain Kaien.

54
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:54,786
-OK, I'll try to remember.

55
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,386
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): After
such a long, strange road,

56
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,853
that sense of normalcy
was exactly what I wanted.

57
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:03,720
RUKIA: Lord Byakuya,
my entrance to Squad

58
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:04,920
13 today was successful.

59
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,086
-What seat where you named?

60
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,920
-Uh, well, my deepest
apologies, brother.

61
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:18,386
But with my abilities, I wasn't
able to qualify for an officer

62
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,120
seed upon entry.

63
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:22,486
-I see.

64
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,120
You may go.

65
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,953
-Ah, not the long face again.

66
00:04:30,986 --> 00:04:31,986
Now what?

67
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,020
-[gasp]

68
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:34,786
-And why is it you
practically jump out

69
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,186
of your skin every
time you see me?

70
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,553
You're hurting my feelings.

71
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:40,820
Anyway, I brought this for you.

72
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:42,286
So drink up.

73
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,786
-Oh.

74
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:50,786
KAIEN: Knowing you, you
probably won't tell me anything.

75
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,553
But I have to ask.

76
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:54,453
What's got you so depressed?

77
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:56,220
-Oh.

78
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:57,753
-Just remember this.

79
00:04:57,786 --> 00:05:00,286
As long as you're a part
of this squad, Rukia,

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,953
I will stand by you even
if it costs me my life.

81
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:05,886
-Lieutenant--

82
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,653
-Ah, yeah!

83
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:07,653
-Smells like love.

84
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:09,486
-Oh, you're so cool, Lieutenant.

85
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,420
I just love a man in uniform.

86
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:12,386
-Did you hear that?

87
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,853
I'll stand by you? [laugh]

88
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:16,086
-You've got him wrapped
around your little finger--

89
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,753
-Kiyone, Sentaro,
shut up, you two!

90
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:19,520
How dare you show up
for duty drunk again?

91
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,286
-(SLURRING) Don't let
it get to you, Rukia.

92
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,386
I'm from the slums too,
so I know what it's like.

93
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,286
All of these snobs
telling me I'm

94
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,986
low class really gets annoying.

95
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,620
Whenever they try, just do like
I do and flick a booger at 'em.

96
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:31,820
Works every time.

97
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:34,220
-Now that's class! [laughs]

98
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:35,653
SENTARO: Right!

99
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:36,720
-All right!

100
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,586
That's enough out of
you two loudmouths.

101
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,486
Sober up and get
back t your post!

102
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,453
[sputtering]

103
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:44,653
-We were just having fun.

104
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:45,886
You're such a killjoy!

105
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,386
[laughs]

106
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,153
[arguing]

107
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:51,586
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Kaien always had

108
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,053
a way of making me feel at ease.

109
00:05:58,186 --> 00:05:59,120
-Die, Hollow!

110
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,253
-Well done, Lieutenant!

111
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:07,020
-Excellent!

112
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:08,020
-Make quick work of that.

113
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:10,186
-Just like you always do.

114
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,886
KAIEN: All right.

115
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,953
Mission accomplished!

116
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:17,320
[chattering]

117
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:21,186
-I hurt myself.

118
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,553
Huh?

119
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:24,786
Ms. Miyako.

120
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,520
-Are you all right?

121
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,986
-(NERVOUSLY) Oh, yes.

122
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,953
Yes, it was nothing.

123
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:29,820
Thank you.

124
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:30,620
-Oh, good.

125
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:31,920
I was worried for a second.

126
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:32,420
KAIEN: Hey!

127
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:33,686
Who's that?

128
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,453
Is that you, Miyako?

129
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:38,720
I wasn't expecting you.

130
00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:39,953
How long have you been here.

131
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:42,086
-Oh, I've been here a
little while-- long enough

132
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,953
to see you take
care of the Hollow.

133
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,653
I just came in
case you messed it

134
00:06:45,686 --> 00:06:47,586
up and needed me to save you.

135
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,486
-[laugh] Well, at least it's
nice to know you have my back.

136
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,820
-[giggle]

137
00:06:52,853 --> 00:06:54,653
-Rukia, go alert the squad.

138
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:56,786
Have Sentaro and Kiyone help.

139
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,220
Tell them that
we're pulling out.

140
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:00,220
-Yes, sir.

141
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,986
And thank you for
helping me, Ms. Miyako.

142
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,686
-[laugh] You take
care of yourself now.

143
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,620
-Yes, I will.

144
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:15,186
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Miyako
was Captain Kaien's wife.

145
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,886
She had risen
quickly to the rank

146
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,786
of third seed
officer in the squad.

147
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,486
Not only was she
a strong warrior,

148
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,953
she was intelligent,
kind, and beautiful.

149
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:30,120
She was my idol.

150
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:32,786
I admired her so much.

151
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,220
I hoped some day I
could be like her.

152
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:40,220
Then one day, Miyako
received orders

153
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,786
to lead a
reconnaissance mission.

154
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,753
-Unfortunately, this Hollow
is an unknown entity.

155
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:47,720
And none of the Soul
Reapers it's attacked

156
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:51,253
have survived to report back.

157
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:52,920
Don't be reckless.

158
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:55,386
-You'd have to admit, that's
some pretty unusual advice

159
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,120
coming from someone
like you, Lieutenant.

160
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:58,220
[laughs]

161
00:07:58,253 --> 00:07:59,353
KAIEN: Quit joking around.

162
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:04,886
-It's all right.

163
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,220
I take my mission as a
Soul Reaper very seriously.

164
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,753
And this Hollow's horrible
crimes cannot be allowed

165
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:12,153
to continue.

166
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:15,420
I'll do whatever I can to
put a stop to such evil.

167
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,920
-Ms. Miyako.

168
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:18,620
-Oh, don't worry about me.

169
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:20,520
This is just a recon mission.

170
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:23,120
We'll gather all the information
and leave all the heavy stuff

171
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,553
to you and the Lieutenant.

172
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:26,320
Recon team, let's move out.

173
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:27,053
-[together] Right.

174
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:38,086
[coughing]

175
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,420
-Do you need anything, Captain.

176
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:40,420
-No, thanks.

177
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,886
I'll be fine.

178
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,720
RUKIA: Excuse me.

179
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,020
-Rukia, is there any report yet
from the reconnaissance team?

180
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:52,253
I'm afraid not, sir.

181
00:08:52,286 --> 00:08:53,720
They still haven't returned.

182
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:56,320
[footsteps]

183
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:58,553
-Sir, the recon team--
there's bad news!

184
00:08:58,586 --> 00:08:59,486
[gasping]

185
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,853
-[gasps] Miyako!

186
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:09,853
-She's unconscious now, but
her life isn't in any danger.

187
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,620
-And the others?

188
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:13,686
-The others are all dead, sir.

189
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,286
-All four of them?

190
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:18,486
RUKIA: Kaien.

191
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:37,586
-We've had our share
of bad luck lately.

192
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,553
-Yeah, I can't believe
the whole reconnaissance

193
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:41,186
team got wiped out like that.

194
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,420
-Except for Ms. Miyako that is.

195
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:44,320
MAN: How is she?

196
00:09:44,353 --> 00:09:45,520
Is she gonna be all right?

197
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:47,453
MAN 2: Yeah, they said
her life's not in danger.

198
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,753
MAN: Well, that's good.

199
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:51,286
She's one person the squad
really couldn't do without.

200
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,053
MAN 2: Yeah.

201
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:54,286
-Huh?

202
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,853
Ms. Miyako, should you
be out of bed so soon?

203
00:09:56,886 --> 00:10:01,320
[shouting]

204
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:02,253
MAN: Miyako!

205
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:04,720
[shout]

206
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,420
-What's going on?

207
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,820
-[laugh]

208
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:19,620
-Ms. Miyako?

209
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:20,886
SENTARO: What happened here?

210
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,386
-This is horrible!

211
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,653
-Stop it, Miyako!

212
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:34,620
[gasping]

213
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:43,820
[splattering]

214
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:46,853
[shouting]

215
00:10:46,886 --> 00:10:47,753
-Kaien, hurry.

216
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,120
I can't believe she did this.

217
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:58,620
RUKIA: Oh, Kaien.

218
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:00,753
KAIEN: Let me go
after her, Captain.

219
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,453
She couldn't have
gotten very far, sir.

220
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:04,253
-No, don't.

221
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:06,086
Think about it, Kaien.

222
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,786
Following her is exactly what
the enemy wants you to do.

223
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,486
KAIEN: That may be.

224
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,686
But it's still the only option.

225
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,253
This monster that's
controlling Miyako

226
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:20,986
used her to kill her own
men, men who trusted her.

227
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,053
Miyako's honor has been defiled.

228
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:24,220
You must let me go, Captain.

229
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:31,820
UKITAKE: Very well.

230
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:32,886
I shall go with you.

231
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,386
-What?

232
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:33,820
-Huh?

233
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:34,386
-What?

234
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,020
You, Captain?

235
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:38,320
-Mm.

236
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:39,753
You come too, Rukia.

237
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:40,886
-Yes, sir.

238
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,420
-You two-- seal off this
area and call the squad

239
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,586
to battle stations.

240
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,386
-[together] Understood, sir.

241
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,153
SENTARO: Let's go!

242
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:52,753
HOLLOW: I smell more
prey approaching--

243
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:54,753
more foolish meat.

244
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,367
RUKIA: What is that?

245
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:21,001
UKITAKE: Kaien.

246
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:26,934
-Huh?

247
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,634
-I'll go first, sir.

248
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:48,201
I'll scout out what
its abilities are.

249
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,601
Huh?

250
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:52,967
KAIEN: Captain, I beg of you.

251
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,301
Permission to go fight it alone.

252
00:13:01,334 --> 00:13:01,801
-Go.

253
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:09,967
-[laughs] So you're
the first, eh?

254
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:11,101
You're nothing but a boy.

255
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:19,367
KAIEN: Tell me, how
many Soul Reapers

256
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:22,167
have you devoured so far?

257
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,001
-How many?

258
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:25,734
[laughs] Sorry, boy.

259
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:29,167
I don't keep track of
such trivial things.

260
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:32,801
-Have you ever, even once,
had any regrets about it?

261
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:35,267
-That's such a stupid question.

262
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:38,634
I have a heart, you
know, just like you.

263
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,967
There isn't a single night
that I don't have regrets

264
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:43,101
after eating a Soul Reaper.

265
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:47,667
Even now I'm having regrets
about that woman Soul Reaper.

266
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,234
I regret not eating
the rest of her!

267
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:51,701
[laughs]

268
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:55,101
-So you controlled her and
made her kill her comrades?

269
00:13:55,134 --> 00:14:00,201
-Controlled her? [laughs] Oh,
not the way you're imagining.

270
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:04,401
I was actually inside her body,
then I ate my way out of her

271
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:06,934
and returned to the
form you see now.

272
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,334
Too bad you didn't
get to see that part.

273
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:13,867
[laughs]

274
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:16,301
Want to see what it's
like for yourself?

275
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:17,167
Come on, boy.

276
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:19,434
I'll eat you too!

277
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:24,401
[shout]

278
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:27,734
You're fast, but
not fast enough.

279
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,967
-Rankle the seas and
the skies, Nejibana!

280
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,601
What the hell?

281
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:38,034
-You fell for it, boy.

282
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:40,734
Once every night, the first
one to touch tentacles

283
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:44,334
will see his
Zanpakuto destroyed!

284
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,534
-[shout] Impossible.

285
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:48,234
I've never heard
of such a power.

286
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:52,567
-Kaien, get away!

287
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,501
Captain, Kaien
has been disarmed.

288
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:56,634
We have to help him.

289
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,801
-But if we were to
step in now, what

290
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:01,934
would become of Kaien's pride.

291
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,201
Even if by going to
his aid you are somehow

292
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:08,101
successful in saving his
life, the cost of such an act

293
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:12,067
would certainly be the
death of his pride forever.

294
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:14,134
-That doesn't make any
sense at all, Captain.

295
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,567
What good is pride to
a man if he's dead.

296
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:21,434
-Listen now, and
remember these words.

297
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,201
There are two kinds of battles.

298
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:25,101
And those of us who have
chosen to be warriors

299
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:27,867
and to fight those
battles must always

300
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:31,767
be aware of the difference
between the two.

301
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:34,534
There are battles that are
fought to protect lives,

302
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,801
and there are battles that
are fought to defend honor.

303
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:42,667
Right now, Kaien is fighting
with all his heart and soul

304
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:45,534
to defend honor-- that
of his men who died,

305
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:50,734
and his own honor, and above
all, his beloved wife's honor.

306
00:15:56,401 --> 00:16:00,434
[growling]

307
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:05,234
-[laughs] What's the
matter Soul Reaper?

308
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:10,201
Too full of yourself to ask
your friends to help you?

309
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:11,601
-Shut up.

310
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:14,967
I don't need a sword or anything
else to handle scum like you.

311
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:16,767
We'll see about that.

312
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:19,101
Because now I'm
going to do unto you

313
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:22,734
just as I did unto your
beloved and delicious wife.

314
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:26,334
I'm going to play you like
a puppet from the inside.

315
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,467
And against your will,
you'll slay your comrades

316
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:31,101
with your own hand.

317
00:16:31,134 --> 00:16:36,001
[laughs]

318
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:55,001
-Lieutenant Kaien?

319
00:16:55,034 --> 00:16:58,434
HOLLOW: Yes, what is it, girl?

320
00:16:58,467 --> 00:16:59,901
What do you want?

321
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:00,867
-[gasp]

322
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:02,934
-[slurps]

323
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:05,567
-Lieutenant Kaien?

324
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:07,267
HOLLOW: What is with you, girl?

325
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,834
Why do you keep repeating
my name again and again?

326
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:13,201
Are you that worried about me?

327
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:16,167
Or maybe you're in love with me!

328
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,567
-[gasp]

329
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:21,301
HOLLOW: [laughs] I guess if
you really love me that much,

330
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:23,601
then maybe I should
eat you first!

331
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:29,034
-Captain.

332
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,201
UKITAKE: Rukia, get out of here.

333
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:31,834
-Huh?

334
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:32,667
-Get out of here!

335
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:33,801
Run away, now!

336
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:41,534
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Why, why did
this have to happen? [cries]

337
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:42,034
Kaien!

338
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:48,801
HOLLOW: Why I you
attacking me, Soul Reaper?

339
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,434
I think I know what
you're waiting for.

340
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:54,067
You're trying to think of a
way to rip me out of this body

341
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:56,301
so you can still
save your friend.

342
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:57,601
Isn't that right?

343
00:17:57,634 --> 00:18:00,401
But this is different
from human possession.

344
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:03,467
We are both spirit beings, and
now our spirits are united.

345
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:06,134
It can never be undone.

346
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,501
[shout]

347
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:09,301
UKITAKE: I see.

348
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:11,201
Then you leave me no choice.

349
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:15,401
I'll kill his body
and you inside it.

350
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:17,101
HOLLOW: Are you insane?

351
00:18:17,134 --> 00:18:20,401
What kind of a Soul Reaper
would slay one of his own men?

352
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,434
UKITAKE: Kaien no longer exists.

353
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:26,734
I won't let his body become
food for a monster like you.

354
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:27,701
Now die!

355
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:33,634
Coward!

356
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:38,067
[coughing]

357
00:18:41,034 --> 00:18:45,434
Now, of all times.

358
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:46,634
Rukia!

359
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,067
You were supposed to get
away from here, you idiot!

360
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,301
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): I don't
know what made me go back.

361
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:55,267
I didn't have a plan.

362
00:18:55,301 --> 00:19:00,201
HOLLOW: [laughing]

363
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:04,134
-Rukia!

364
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,601
HOLLOW: [growls]

365
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:24,767
KAIEN: My Captain--

366
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:26,301
RUKIA: [gasp]

367
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:28,967
KAIEN: --thank you
for understanding

368
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:33,467
and for letting me
fight to the end.

369
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:37,034
RUKIA: But Kaien,
does that mean you--

370
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:41,534
KAIEN: Rukia, I apologize to
you for getting you involved

371
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:44,434
in all of this in
the first place.

372
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:47,201
I know this was painful.

373
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:51,334
But thanks to you, I'm saved.

374
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:54,901
Now I can still
leave my heart here.

375
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,734
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
No, I haven't done

376
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,701
anything deserving
of anyone's thanks.

377
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,301
I ran away because I
was afraid to fight.

378
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:08,034
[crying]

379
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:10,034
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Then I ran back.

380
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:12,101
But it was only
because I couldn't

381
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:13,967
stand to see you suffer.

382
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:21,267
The only one I saved was myself.

383
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:24,467
I'm not worth
shedding blood over.

384
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:25,701
Not ever.

385
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:31,534
UKITAKE: Byakuya!

386
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:37,434
The execution-- it's been moved!

387
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:38,634
-Yes, to tomorrow.

388
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:41,001
-Well, what are you
going to do about it.

389
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:43,201
-Why should I do
anything about it?

390
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:43,767
-Huh?

391
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:45,267
Are you serious?

392
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:47,401
-The date has been set.

393
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:49,234
If that is the
decision and the order,

394
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,934
then there is nothing
to do but to head it.

395
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:54,967
Don't bother me again
with such petty matters.

396
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,234
Excuse me.

397
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:57,834
-Well, wait just a minute!

398
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,467
This is not some stranger.

399
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:02,067
Your sister's life
is at stake here.

400
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:05,901
If someone doesn't do
something, she's likely to die!

401
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:08,567
[coughs]

402
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,301
-You should be careful.

403
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,134
You'll only shorten
your life, Ukitake.

404
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,667
Having already lost
your lieutenant,

405
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:16,767
I wouldn't think losing
one more would matter.

406
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:26,634
In any case, Rukia is
a member of my house.

407
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:31,967
As such, whether she lives or
dies is none of your business.

408
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:37,301
I trust you'll refrain from
taking any reckless action.

409
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:46,165
[music - "happy people"]

410
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:47,593
SENTARO: I'm so devoted
to Captain Ukitake,

411
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:49,327
I'd follow him anywhere!

412
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,493
KIYONE: Give it up, Sentaro!

413
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:51,927
I'm way more devoted to
the captain than you!

414
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
SENTARO: Oh yeah?

415
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:54,260
Well-- well I stalk
the captain 24/7.

416
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:55,760
KIYONE: Well, I
check his schedule

417
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:58,093
and get where he's going
even before he does.

418
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,060
SENTARO: Wait a minute.

419
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:00,627
Is that even legal?
