1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,766
Shunko!

2
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:22,266
If you still won't leave,
I will have to kill you
right now.

3
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:28,918
What's the matter?
You're not done
already, are you?

4
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,451
You'd better make your
next move quickly.

5
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:36,985
I plan to crush your
compatriots, one at a time.

6
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:39,085
Until none of them
are left standing.

7
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:45,851
The number of methods you
contrived to defeat me,

8
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:50,018
are proof of your imagination
and strength of will.

9
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:57,985
At the same time, they
represent the desperation
you're feeling as you try to
overcome my superior power.

10
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:02,485
As you're about to find out,
there's no way you can stop me.

11
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,185
But feel free to mount
your next attack.

12
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:15,751
It's meaningless to argue
over whether or not the
armor is adequate.

13
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:24,151
If a single swing was enough to
make one piece disappear, then
three more swings should be
enough to destroy it completely.

14
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:31,485
Don't lose your balance!

15
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,485

18
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,318
Egh!

19
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,118
Psyched you out, didn't I?
I was just messing with you.

20
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:04,851
Maybe somewhere deep inside of
you, you've given up any hope of
being able to win this fight.

21
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:05,751
Huh?

22
00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:08,051
My, my,

23
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:10,518
Truly pathetic.

<i>You're weak inside.</i>

I couldn't possibly let
Captain Aizen waste his time,
fighting a coward like you.

27
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:27,551
What're you doing?!

28
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:31,685

That was so fast!

30
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:39,285
Kamishininoyari, Butorenjin!

31
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:52,718
You leave me no choice.

32
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,018
I'm in his range!

33
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:59,885
<i>His Zanpakuto's greatest</i>
<i>strength is that it can</i>
<i>attack at any time,</i>

34
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,951
<i>no matter what the</i>
<i>distance is between</i>
<i>it and its opponent.</i>

35
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:09,818
<i>It also acts as a defensive</i>
<i>tool, preventing any</i>
<i>opponent from being able to</i>
<i>mount an attack.</i>

36
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:13,818
<i>If I could only</i>
<i>get closer to him.</i>

37
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:16,351
<i>I must find a way</i>
<i>to break through!</i>

38
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:19,118
You may be hoping to
come up with a plan,

39
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,718
But it's useless!

40
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:28,351
Well! Not too bad.

41
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,685
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>You were so close!</i>

[gasp]

43
00:05:56,451 --> 00:06:00,051
But I'm still here,
And I'm guessing you
took your best shot.

44
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,418
So you thought you might
be able to stop me

45
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:05,885
by unleashing a
Hollowfied Getsugatensho

46
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:08,685
after getting inside
my Shinso's range.

47
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:11,651
But there's something basic you
don't seem to understand yet.

48
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:13,851
What's that?!

49
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:17,285
Earlier on you blocked my
attack with your Zanpakuto,

50
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:21,085
But you honestly think I can't
do the same to stop your attack?

51
00:06:21,985 --> 00:06:23,651
How naiÃ¯ve.

52
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:30,318
Hnh.

53
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:33,051
Yaaaaah!

54
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:34,418
Hah!

55
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:38,751
Not even gonna try
dodging our attacks, huh?

56
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:40,551
He underestimates us!

57
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,585
Huaaaa!

58
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:47,751
My turn.

59
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:57,651
Too bad, You failed to
strike a decisive blow.

60
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:03,685
But then again, if any
of your attacks were
to get through to me,

61
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:07,551
I think it's doubtful they
would have enough power to
seriously wound me.

62
00:07:21,418 --> 00:07:22,718
Captain Ichimaru...

more intimidating.

Just who the hell do you
think you're talking to?!

84
00:09:09,185 --> 00:09:12,251
You saw what happened
when I punched him with
your half-assed glove.

85
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,951
That gear of yours is
completely worthless.

86
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:19,218
I know, I'm sorry.

87
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:25,351
What the hell are
you looking at?

88
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:31,185
Just at you. Acting like
you're concerned must be
a part of your strategy.

89
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:35,285
Didn't you say you weren't
going to be on guard?

90
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:38,851
I'm not on guard. I'm observing.

91
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:44,885
In the Soul Society, you
were the only one whose
intellect exceeded my own.

92
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:50,085
Even if our strengths are
no longer equal, I still
find you interesting.

93
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:54,885
You're putting me
on a pedestal.

94

Nowadays, I'm just a
small-time candy shop owner.

Hado Number Thirty-Two, Oukasen!

00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:09,918
You should know that a
Kido at the thirties level
will have no affect on me.

97
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:13,118
The fact that you used it
can only mean one thing;

98
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:17,451
You're predicable.

99
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:23,518
You appear to enjoy
using the same attacks.

100
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:30,518
Don't you see it?

101
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:33,151
No matter how many
punches you throw at me,

102
00:10:33,185 --> 00:10:35,551
you can't defeat me
with your blows.

I don't know.

115
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,318
Since he's taken that form,
Aizen's Spiritual Pressure has
become completely unreadable.

116
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:52,518
I know he's freakishly powerful,
but when we attack or slash at
him, it feels like there's
nothing there. It's creepy.

117
00:11:54,051 --> 00:12:00,385
The only one who can perceive
Aizen's power right now,
is someone who's at the
same level as he is.

118
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,118
That was quite a
fine sword attack.

119
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:13,318
Now, I can counter
that attack as well.

120
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:20,251
What's going on?
What is that in there?

121

I think it's time,
time that you finally
understand my power.

You're easily distracted.

You turned your
back on me!

124
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:41,451
Well, it looks like your
Getsugatensho has
reached its limit and
lost its effectiveness.

125
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:46,418
It doesn't work. It wasn't able
to stop me or Captain Aizen.

126
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:49,285
He took a direct hit,
but was unaffected by it.

127
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:54,418

you're no longer a warrior.
Or a Soul Reaper.
Or a Hollow.

real Karakura Town
in the Soul Society.

154
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:35,385
There won't be any need to
destroy the Tenkaiketchu.

155
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:41,685
To successfully take down the
palace, it would certainly be
to our advantage to create the
Ouken in the Soul Society.

156
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:43,052
Right.

157
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:46,185
Hey, Hold on!

158
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:49,218
[gasp]

159
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:51,518
Captain Aizen?

160
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:58,485
Ah!, It seems I'm at the
end of the Chrysalis stage.

161
00:15:58,518 --> 00:16:00,218
And perfect
timing too.

162
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:06,852
I will now have the pleasure
of seeing the end of the Soul
Society with my own eyes.

163
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:15,618
Unlock.

164
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:23,918
I've decided to
leave you here.

165
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,618
When everything has ended,
You will be devoured.

166
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:46,518
<i>What's happening?</i>
<i>what's this mean?</i>

167
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:47,918
Ichigo!!

168
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:54,518
So why are you just
standing there?
Open the Senkaimon!

169
00:16:55,418 --> 00:16:56,418
Dad!

170
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:03,785
[Aizen]
The Precipice World.

171
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:08,252
This place holds
so many memories.

172
00:17:08,552 --> 00:17:10,085
That it does.

173
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:19,385
It's the Cleaner.

174
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:23,418
That's not good.
We'd better get going,
Captain Aizen.

175
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:29,518
Seriously Captain,
we really should leave now.

176
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:34,185
That thing exists on the side of
Reason, immune to Spirit Energy.

177
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:37,452
It's not something you can
just stop by using force.

178
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:40,385
Captain Aizen!

179
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:45,285
[deep otherworldly exhale]

180
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:51,352
<i>What are you so</i>
<i>afraid of, Gin?</i>

181
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:58,352
Reason exists primarily
for those who count on
it to survive.

182
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:01,085
<i>Well, Shall we go?</i>

183
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,718
Toward the end
of all reason.

184
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:09,885
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Dad?</i>

185
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:15,618
Let's go. We've gotta go
protect Karakura Town.

186
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:23,518
Didn't you hear me?!

187
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:26,852
I said we are going to
protect Karakura Town!

188
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:30,718
There's no way.

189
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:33,318
There's just no way
that's going to work.

190
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:36,118
We don't know for sure
that it's hopeless!!

191
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:38,852
I know it! And don't act
like you don't know it!

192
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,818
We can't beat that level of
Spirit Energy, there's no way!!

193
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:49,685
I see, So you're really
able to comprehend Aizen's
Spirit Energy, huh?

194
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:51,452
Huh?

195
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:55,018
Let's go.

196
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:01,452
Are you coming?

197
00:19:05,052 --> 00:19:06,885
If not that, then what?

198
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:11,252
Ya gonna cry?

199
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:18,618
Or are you just staying here
because you think you can't
protect anything at all?!

200
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:20,785
(Short CM Realization Grunt)

201
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:25,652
Think this through, Think of
what Aizen heading for the
Soul Society really means.

202
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:30,885
<i>If you don't go, That means</i>
<i>all the people you care</i>
<i>about and want to protect,</i>

203
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:33,418
<i>and everyone else who</i>
<i>lives in Karakura Town,</i>

204
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:36,418
<i>They're all going to die at</i>
<i>that bastard Aizen's hands!</i>

205
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:50,385
You're right.

206
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:54,285
Open the Senkaimon.

207
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:12,118
Karakura Town's that way,
We're turned around.

208
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:15,152
Why are you making it sound
like this is my fault?

209
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:19,985
It was your playing
around that threw us
off from our original
destination, Captain.

210
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:24,485
You're right. Sorry for that.

211
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:26,818
Well, let's start walking.

212
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:35,552
<i>Wait Ichigo- Stop!</i>

213
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,285
What?! Aren't we
in a hurry here?!

214
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:42,952
Something's wrong.
There's no sign of
the Cleaner.

215
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:44,252
"The Cleaner"?!

216
00:20:44,552 --> 00:20:47,252
Y'mean that Spirit Energy
train-like thing?

217
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:52,385
Yeah. Usually a Soul Reaper
can't do anything at all
about the Cleaner.

218
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:56,985
But from the traces
of Spiritual Pressure,
I'd say Aizen did something.

219
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,285
So is it bad if the
Cleaner's not here?

220
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:04,285
If we leave
things like this,
it's not good.

221
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:06,685
But right now, it's good for us.

222
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:07,652
Huh?

223
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:11,818
[Isshin]
As its name suggests, the
Precipice World is on the edge.

224
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:17,352
<i>It's a place isolated</i>
<i>temporally and spatially from</i>
<i>both the World of the Living</i>
<i>and the Soul Society.</i>

225
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:21,385
<i>The Cleaner existed to</i>
<i>limit those who've entered</i>
<i>from staying here too long.</i>

226
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:25,985
But right now
it's not here.

227
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,185
<i>So I'll be able to teach</i>
<i>you in this place.</i>

228
00:21:29,818 --> 00:21:32,485
To teach me? Teach me what?

229
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,418
You must learn the
Final Getsugatensho!

230
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:39,785
[gasp]

231
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:43,152
The Final Getsugatensho?!

232
00:21:53,985 --> 00:21:54,985
Nnghh...

233
00:21:56,852 --> 00:22:00,218
What happened?
Why was I just
lying here?

234
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,030
[Ichigo]
What do you mean by the
Final Getsugatensho?

235
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:48,763
<i>[Isshin]</i>
<i>Uhhh...</i>

236
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:51,263
[Ichigo]
Hey, answer me!

237
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,897
<i>[Isshin]</i>
<i>I got a little carried</i>
<i>away when I said that.</i>
<i>Let me think of what it is!</i>

238
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,763
[Ichigo]
Dad, you jerk!

239
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:56,597
<i>[Isshin]</i>
<i>Wait! I lied!</i>
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>I'll teach you!</i>

240
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,730
There you go again
with your ranting.
<i>Don't hit your dad!</i>

241
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:00,897
You are too much!
<i>Stop, you'll kill me!</i>
<i>Oww! Stop! Uhhh!</i>
