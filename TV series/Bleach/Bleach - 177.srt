Did he repair it with
Reishi from the mist?

339
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:35,262
You couldn't beat
me so your thugs

340
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:37,595
are going after all
of my friends now.

341
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:39,095
-So what of it?

342
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:41,695
-You jerk!

343
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:45,029
In the heat of battle, those
warriors who lose their temper

344
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,029
die.

345
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:48,529
-Shut up!

346
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:50,495
[clang]

347
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:51,995
-Aha!

348
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:53,495
[grunting]

349
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:02,662
-Nice move.

350
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:23,595
-We already have all your
little tricks figured out!

351
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:27,729
[shattering]

352
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:34,595
-I told you when we
fought before, I never

353
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:36,429
fall for the same move twice.

354
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,195
That Zanpakuto uses the light
reflected from its mirror

355
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:40,629
to press the attack.

356
00:21:40,662 --> 00:21:43,695
So once the mirror is
broken, the fight is over.

357
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:45,462
-Don't be so sure, kid.

358
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:45,962
-What?

359
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:52,262
[blast]

360
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:54,695
-Aaaugh!

361
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:58,062
-As I told you before,
depending on the spirit

362
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:00,295
energy of its
wielder, this katana

363
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:03,362
can become infinitely powerful.

364
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:05,329
[grunting]

365
00:22:05,362 --> 00:22:06,795
[yelling]

366
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:15,129
[music playing]

367
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:48,970
-Lady Kuchiki, are you hurt?

368
00:23:49,003 --> 00:23:50,203
-I'm fine, Kenryu.

369
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:52,070
But I'm afraid your
house has been ruined.

370
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:54,070
-Fortunately, we have
homeowners' insurance

371
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:55,370
for incidents like these.

372
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:57,303
No matter what
happens, we're covered.

373
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,870
-Where did you buy such a thing?

374
00:23:58,903 --> 00:23:59,936
-At Urahara's shop.

375
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,070
-I'm not sure that was wise.
