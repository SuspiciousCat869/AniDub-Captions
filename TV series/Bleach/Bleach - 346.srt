1
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,777
What's going on
here, dammit!

2
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:02,122
I'm not understanding
any of this!

3
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:06,130
Damn it!

4
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:08,802
Isn't there anything
I can do to stop it?!

5
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:15,482
Here's some advice. Act now
while you can. That is if you
want to protect your family.

6
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,263
[dialing]

7
00:02:22,898 --> 00:02:25,370
[recorded female voice]
You have reached X-cution.

8
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:30,246
This card number is
currently unregistered.
Are you a new member?

9
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,585
If so, please say your name now.

10
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,391
Ichigo... Kurosaki.

11
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:40,467
Thank you, Mister Ichigo
Kurosaki. We have been
expecting your call.

12
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:41,938
Welcome to Xcution.

13
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:54,931
Please redial this number
followed by the digits
"zero-zero-eight-zero-zero."
Mister Ichigo Kurosaki.

14
00:02:56,334 --> 00:02:56,784
Huh?

15
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:01,760
Next, please hang up
your phone before the
second ring tone ends.

16
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:05,368
Your call will be transferred
on your third try.

17
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:14,420
[ring]

18
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:20,332
Okay well that was a
real pain in the ass.

19
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:26,278
Aw, don't say that, if I didn't
make it complicated, it'd be a
real pain in the ass for me.

20
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,551
We need to talk.

21
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,290
Well that's obvious.

22
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:35,798
If you didn't want to talk,
you wouldn't have called.

23
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:46,988
Ichigo!

24
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:49,627
Hm?

25
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:53,401
There you are!
Do you know
anything about Chad?

26
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,708
Could you be a little
more specific, Orihime?

27
00:03:57,577 --> 00:03:58,579
What about him?

28
00:03:58,813 --> 00:03:59,614
What's up?

29
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:00,716
How's he doing?

30
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,489
"Doing"? Did he catch
the flu or something?

31
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:09,334
Oh! So then, you
don't know either?

32
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:11,973
I figured he should know
about what happened to Uryu,

33
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:14,712
so I went by his first
period class to tell him.

34
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:18,353
And guess what? he hasn't
been coming to school lately.

35
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,399
Since you're close, I
thought you'd probably know
something about where he is.

36
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:28,007
I'm surprised.
Guess you haven't
heard from him either.

37
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:33,485
I'll bet he's just sick.
Think I'll go drop by his
home with a get-well gift today.

38
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:36,424
[chuckle] Say!

39
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,499
How 'bout you join me
and we could both go
check in on him?!

40
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:41,134
Sorry.

41
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:41,802
Uh?

42
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:44,909
I've got stuff
to do today, so.

43
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,552
Heeh! Oh that's okay!
I know this was kinda sudden!

44
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:53,594
I can go see him and I'll let
you know tomorrow how he's
doing, alright?!

45
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:55,765
Sounds good!

46
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:57,735
Thanks.

47
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:03,715
Oh...

48
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,898
Has something
happened to Chad too?

49
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:21,418
What the hell is
going on here?

50
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:27,732
[Kugo]
Tonight's not good.

51
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:32,107
How about tomorrow?
Let's say, 8 p.m.?

52
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:38,420
Show up in front of the rundown
apartment building that's at
Seven-One Seventh Street
in the Chobara District.

53
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,092
I'll hear what you want
to talk about to then.

54
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,802
Relax.

55
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:49,844
I think I'll be
able to help you.

56
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,125
[Orihime]
Chad!

57
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:00,132
Hey, Chad!
You home?!

58
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:07,681
[sigh] From the look of
things I'd say he's not home.

59
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:14,228
[Ryuken]
Assuming the attacker was human
and targeting individuals with
unique abilities,

60
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:18,771
It's logical that the
next person in line
could be Sado or you.

61
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:19,740
[gasp]

62
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,010
No! Don't! I mustn't
think like that!

63
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:31,865
I pray that Chad will be
back at school tomorrow
feeling all better!

64
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:43,923
Seventh Street.

65
00:06:44,758 --> 00:06:46,629
Number
Seven-One.

66
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,779
Rundown apartments.

67
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:56,817
This is it.

68
00:06:58,253 --> 00:06:58,988
Hey.

69
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,924
Hnh?

70
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:02,028
Five minutes early.

71
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,203
So very punctual.

72
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:13,151
Not five minutes.
More like three.

73
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:18,729
So, what did you
want to talk about?

74
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:21,068
Some of my friends
were attacked.

75
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:22,570
Yeah, so?

76
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:24,007
So I want your help.

77
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,648
To figure out who did it?

78
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:34,161
I get this distinct feeling
that you don't trust me.

79
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,936
Look buddy, you know all
about me and about my dad.

80
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:40,909
I don't think you're
an ordinary human.

81
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,712
Oh really?

82
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,318
Your assumption's right,
I don't trust you.

83
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:48,859
Yet, you're the
only guy I can--

84
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,565
You can ask about this?

85
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,034
Right?

86
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:56,608
Fine.

87
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,178
Follow me.

88
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:07,698
[Kugo]
You know, I wish we
could've taken care of what
I was asking about first.

89
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,713
You mean about
my father?

90
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:17,885
You sound so serious.

91
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:24,734
I don't need you
to check on him.

92
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:29,310
That was just an
excuse that I used to
get your attention.

93
00:08:30,278 --> 00:08:31,347
An excuse?

94
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,618
We're here.

95
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:35,957
We'll use that
card you have.

96
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:06,387
This is big.

97
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:11,932
We knocked out five rooms
on each side and three
stories above and below.

98
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:14,771
One of our members
is kind of wealthy.

99
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:20,917
Now then, before we go on,
Let me explain to you what
our objective is here.

100
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:22,855
Your objective?

101
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:27,029
That's right.
Our objective in
contacting you.

102
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:29,935
Here's the deal.

103
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:33,209
We want to restore your
Soul Reaper powers to you.

104
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,756
[Riruka]
God, you are unbelievable!

105
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,199
What kind of person would
allow himself to sleep in
a place like that!

106
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:47,973
You're a grown man!
What are you, stupid?

107
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:52,149
I mean really! Do you know
what it's like having to
go out looking for you?!

108
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,322
I never imagined you'd
be in a place like that!

109
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:58,495
Come to think of it,
why did he send me to
find you, anyway?!

110
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:01,201
Ginjo should have
had to go find you
himself, right?!

111
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,439
Anyways, what
was I saying?

112
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:07,180
Y'know! Why don't you
say something to me!

113
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,086
You realize it's all your
fault I'm so upset, right?!

114
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,292
C'mon-Speak up!
You do think, don't you?!

115
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:16,299
Damn... you!

116
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,201
[thud]

117
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:20,876
Owwwwwwww!

118
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:23,748
[gasp]

119
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:25,150
What's wrong?

120
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:28,157
You're looking at me
like you didn't hear me.

121
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:32,065
Your ears aren't playing
tricks on you, Ichigo.

122
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:36,040
We want to restore all of
your Soul Reaper powers.

123
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:38,279
How...
Could you do that?

124
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:40,516
Could something like
that even be possible?

125
00:10:40,984 --> 00:10:43,289
Wait, are you saying this
just to jerk me around?!

126
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:45,159
What's your angle here?

127
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:46,194
Huh??!

128
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,333
Who the hell are you people?!

129
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:50,771
[gasp]

130
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,111
Just calm down.

131
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,482
I can't answer all
of your questions,

132
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:59,322
if you ask them
all at once.

133
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:04,232
Sit down.

134
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:07,272
We have a long
night ahead of us.

135
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:09,944
I'll explain everything.

136
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:21,802
[Kugo]
Want something to drink?

137
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,278
Oh, so what's with that look?

138
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,917
I wouldn't serve
a minor alcohol.

139
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:31,923
Oh wait, you're
not a drinker.

140
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:35,096
I guess you're a lot more
straight-laced than you look.

141
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:37,100
Go ahead, have something.

142
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:41,009
There's no menu, but we've
got pretty much anything
that you would want.

143
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,215
No thanks.

144
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,819
Hm.

145
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:50,495
Okay, well then just go
ahead and bring him some
orange juice or something.

146
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,066
Right.

147
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:02,253
First of all, we are humans.

148
00:12:06,128 --> 00:12:10,103
But like you suggested earlier,
we're not "ordinary" humans.

149
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:16,249
You see we are different
from most people in that
we've been born with this
certain special ability.

150
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:20,023
What ability?
Explain yourself.

151
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:23,264
I think showing you
would be faster.

152
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:32,884
Hm?

153
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:49,634
Ahh!

154
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:53,475
[awestruck gasp]

155
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:58,184
What I just did, was to
draw out the "soul" of the
liquor out of that glass.

156
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,425
That was my skill that
"helped" me to drink it.

157
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:04,431
Our special ability...

158
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:09,542
is to draw out the "soul"
in any object, and to put
that object to use.

159
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:14,552
You seem confused by
what you've seen.

160
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:19,663
Were you under the false
assumption that only
living things have souls?

161
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:24,573
Every object in this world
has a soul, not just
animals and plants.

162
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:30,552
Sure Its soul might be small.
But a telephone pole,
a chair, even a pen.

163
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:36,498
Anything you can think of, no
matter how lifeless it may seem,
possesses some kind of a soul.

164
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:42,043
You've felt that feeling of
mastery that happens when
you're using a tool that
you're well acquainted with.

165
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:45,049
It leads to
maximizing your
ability.

166
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:50,794
The fact you can "become one"
with the object shows you
understand the tool's soul.

167
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:55,772
And that object's soul is
specifically endowed with
the power to help its user.

168
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:59,679
We have the ability
to draw that soul out.

169
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:05,191
Plus we can give it a boost
with our own soul, amplifying
it into an even greater power.

170
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:12,540
I can draw the soul out of
asphalt and increase its
rebounding force to jump higher
than you could ever imagine.

171
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:17,818
As you just saw, I can make
a liquid's soul move and
leap right into my mouth.

172
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:23,329
Or I can will it to support
my weight, so that I can
literally walk on water.

173
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:28,139
And if it's an object I'm
particularly familiar and
compatible with,

174
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:31,378
I can change that object's
physical form to suit me.

175
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:35,086
In my case, it's this
necklace I wear.

176
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:38,494
What's
happening
to it?

177
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:51,120
[gasp]

178
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,193
Like this for example.

179
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:02,443
The term we've given
to this unique ability
is "Fullbring."

180
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,682
Full bring?

181
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:11,663
Hey I'm back!

182
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,235
Riruka.

183
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:16,840
You're back earlier
than I expected.

184
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,444
So did you locate him?

185
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:19,546
I sure did!

186
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,218
Hey, isn't that your
sword glowing over there?

187
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:24,389
What's that doing out?
Are you stupid?!

188
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,427
It's so damn
dark in here!

189
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:28,865
You really need to put
in some more lights!

190
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,669
I can't see a damn thing!

191
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:33,842
I have no plans to add lights.
Get some glasses.

192
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,414
Hmph! I hate
wearing glasses!

193
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:38,853
But I hate contacts
even more!

194
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:42,259
Contacts make my
eyes dry out as soon
as I put them in!

195
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:44,765
It's 'cause my eyes
are so ginormous!

196
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:46,435
Nobody actaully
asked you.

197
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:48,573
Who is that girl?

198
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,849
That's Riruka Dokugamine.
She's one of us.

199
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,855
Say what?! So there's
someone here?!

200
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,827
I'll be sure to introduce
you to him later.

201
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:00,866
Now bring your guy here.

202
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,339
Hrrgh!
Don't you boss me around!

203
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:08,348
Hey you, you can
come on in here now!

204
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:16,498
[gasp]

205
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:18,736
Chad!

206
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:21,742
Ichigo.

207
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:25,616
Chad! Just what in the hell
are you doing here?!

208
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,289
Why haven't you been
going to school?!

209
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:30,494
[Ichigo]
Chad, what's going
on with you!?

210
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:31,930
Say something!

211
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:33,467
Calm down, Ichigo.

212
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,239
You stay out of this!
I'm talking to my friend dammit!

213
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:39,947
What've you got to say!?
Give me an answer Chad!

214
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:43,821
Just calm down.

215
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:46,727
Don't make me
ask you again.

216
00:16:47,229 --> 00:16:49,566
If you'll listen to me,
you'll understand.

217
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,305
Now take a breath
and sit down.

218
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:55,412
You too, Chad.

219
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,656
What? Are you saying these
two guys know each other?!

220
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:03,295
Well it would've been nice
to have been told that!

221
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:05,834
[Riruka]
Hey Ginjo, what's
the big deal, huh?

222
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:09,008
Am I the only one
around here who's being
kept out of the loop?!

223
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:12,381
Let's get Chad some
water or something.

224
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:13,951
You're
ignoring me?!

225
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:15,855
Wait a minute!

226
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:19,830
You were calling this guy
"Ichigo"! That's Kurosaki?!

227
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:22,435
Turn up the lights!
I wanna get a good look at him!

228
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:23,671
Maybe later.

229
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:24,472
"Later"?!

230
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,782
Okay. Now that everyone's
here, let's get started.

231
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,421
Not yet! Wait a sec!

232
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:33,558
Let's see this Ichigo!!

233
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:44,748
He's so hot!

234
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:47,087
Augh!

235
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:53,433
Hey there!
Uh, are you okay?

236
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:55,604
No.

237
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:58,510
I'm not. It's all
because of you.

238
00:17:58,978 --> 00:17:59,980
She's fine.

239
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:03,020
Alright then, let's
get back to our talk.

240
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:04,423
Uh, right.

241
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:07,596
Before you
return to your
talk Mr. Ginjo,

242
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,068
perhaps you wouldn't
mind putting that
sword away.

243
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,539
Yes, you're right.

244
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,569
Very well then.
You can pay for the
floor tiles later.

245
00:18:27,036 --> 00:18:28,340
I'll do that.

246
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:34,085
Now that you've seen
it with your own eyes,
you comprehend our
skill, right?

247
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:35,755
Yeah, I get it.

248
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:39,496
Very well. Then we
can move on in our
discussion.

249
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:44,373
[Kugo]
Do you know the reason why a
Hollow has a hole in its chest?

250
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:46,878
What are you getting at?

251
00:18:48,515 --> 00:18:52,656
The pain of not being saved
by a Soul Reaper tears its
heart out, leaving a hole.

252
00:18:53,992 --> 00:18:57,366
But do you know where that heart
goes when it's been torn out?

253
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,846
When that heart is lost
it becomes its own mask.

254
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:06,452
But it is not simply a mask.

255
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:10,593
Each Hollow's
individualistic appearance
and its very unique powers,

256
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:14,068
are all embodied and
created from the heart
that was torn out.

257
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:19,546
We've all shared a sad
event before we were born.

258
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:22,853
All of our mothers were
attacked by a Hollow.

259
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:23,922
[gasp]

260
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,431
The end result of our mothers
being attacked by Hollows,

261
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:31,637
was that the remnants of
those Hollow's powers
were left behind.

262
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:38,084
So when we were born,
the power inside of us was more
like that of a Hollow, rather
than that of a Soul Reaper.

263
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:42,962
Therefore we found
our power loathsome.

264
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:46,903
Since you yourself
once possessed Hollow
powers, Ichigo,

265
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,644
I'm quite sure you
understand how we feel,
having this burden.

266
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:51,779
Mm.

267
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:02,869
So naturally, you
can understand that

268
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:05,910
we would like to rid ourselves
of this power that we have.

269
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:13,191
It's taken us many
years to find others
with powers like ours

270
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:15,596
but now we have finally
gathered together.

271
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:19,772
Finding each other has led
us to an interesting discovery.

272
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:24,748
We've discovered that if
we find someone who is our
exact polar opposite.

273
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:28,656
By that I mean someone
who possesses both Soul
Reaper and human powers,

274
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,097
it's possible for us to
exchange powers with them.

275
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:35,571
So you mean?

276
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,107
That's right.

277
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:40,147
There was this one
other person like you.

278
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,822
Who was born of a Soul
Reaper and a human being.

279
00:20:44,556 --> 00:20:45,024
[Gasp]

280
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:49,700
A number of our former
members yielded their powers
to that specific person.

281
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:55,245
And as a result of that
exchange, all of them
were able to return to
being ordinary humans.

282
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:57,283
You understand?

283
00:20:57,517 --> 00:21:00,088
We want to become
ordinary humans again,

284
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:03,162
so we will help you
regain your Soul
Reaper powers.

285
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:04,698
Sound good?

286
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:13,216
That's not what I came
here to discuss with you.

287
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:14,952
What's that?

288
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,932
Listen. I only came here for
one reason, to find out why bad
stuff's happening to my friends.

289
00:21:22,268 --> 00:21:24,907
As for me getting back
my Soul Reaper powers,

290
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:27,612
That's beside the point.

291
00:21:36,698 --> 00:21:40,039
So you're saying you don't
want your Soul Reaper powers?

292
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:50,276
[Ichigo]
Ah damn, I left something
at Ginjo's place.
I better call him.

293
00:23:50,276 --> 00:23:52,275
[recorded female voice]
You have reached Xcution.

294
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:53,777
[Ichigo]
Yeah hi, I left something at--

295
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,011
[recorded female voice]
Mr. Ichigo Kurosaki?

296
00:23:55,045 --> 00:23:57,013
[Ichigo]
Yeah, I left something--

297
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:59,015
[recorded female voice]
Please redial this number
followed by
Zero-Zero--

298
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:00,884
[Ichigo]
Aww I gotta do this again?!
