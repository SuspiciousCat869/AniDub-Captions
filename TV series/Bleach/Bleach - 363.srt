1
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:01,225
So...

2
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,661
Is this Karakura
Town?

3
00:02:03,694 --> 00:02:05,629
Pretty cool, huh?

4
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,598
Heh.

5
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:10,601
I figured why not choose an environment
that you're used to fighting in.

6
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:14,939
Aren't you happy? Now you
can fight me one-on-one.

7
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,947
Sorry guys. Make that
two-against-one.

8
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:26,450
Uryu, you really
ready to fight?

9
00:02:26,484 --> 00:02:31,021
Rukia treated me. I'm not fully
recovered, but I'll be fine.

10
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:36,627
Listen, I- I think I might
owe you an apology, Ichigo.

11
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,628
Huh?

12
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:41,765
Remember right after we returned from
saving Rukia in the Soul Society?

13
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:45,102
That was when you first told
us about the Combat Pass.

14
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:49,907
It's also when I started thinking
that another Substitute Soul Reaper

15
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,879
must have existed before you. And
that he had probably gone missing.

16
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,649
If that other Soul Reaper was alive,
they should have told you that he was,

17
00:02:58,682 --> 00:03:01,685
and if he was dead, they should
have told you why he died.

18
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:05,489
But the fact is, they told you nothing.
Which probably means even

19
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:07,725
the Soul Society didn't
know what happened to him.

20
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:10,794
I should've told you this
when I thought of it.

21
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:14,632
You're right.

22
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,168
You should've!

23
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:18,469
Ahh!

24
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:21,472
C'mon! What the hell?!

25
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,873
That's ancient history.

26
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,911
You need to stop dwelling on all the stuff
that happened way back in the past.

27
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:28,646
It's idiotic!

28
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:31,916
(Sigh) Yeah, like you don't
dwell on things forever.

29
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,717
You say something?

30
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:34,752
Forget it...

31
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:37,855
Then let's do this! And
don't get in my way!

32
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:41,025
I'm just concerned. What
if there is a reason that

33
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:44,461
the Soul Society withheld
this information from us.

34
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:47,565
(Chuckle)

35
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:52,136
That's...

36
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:55,839
...Impossible!

37
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:07,017
Aw man...

38
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:09,853
Looks like nobody else
is out yet.

39
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:14,091
They must all be taking
their sweet time.

40
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:17,161
How boring. Guess I'm
gonna head back home.

41
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:18,729
Oh no you're not!

42
00:04:20,197 --> 00:04:23,033
We made a promise that we would come
together and we would leave together!

43
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:27,204
If you leave early, the Head Captain will
be angry with you again, you got it?

44
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,775
Hey! Don't pull my ear!
That hurts!

45
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,050
I don't know how he pulled
this off, but he's found

46
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,087
a way to use his power to
trap me in this place.

47
00:04:57,768 --> 00:05:01,171
(Chuckle) What are
you swinging at?

48
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:05,743
Is that your best attempt to locate me?
I'd say you're just unwilling to power up

49
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:08,212
to your full strength
unless I say something

50
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:11,181
drastic like "Too bad your
friend's about to die."

51
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:13,017
(Sigh)

52
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,021
Looks like I'm the one who got
stuck with the annoying guy.

53
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:19,623
Hm?

54
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:24,028
All right!

55
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,133
Show yourself! Where
are you?!

56
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:38,976
Oh no! Stop!
Hey! Don't!

57
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:41,612
Don't think you can-

58
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:44,782
Tempt me with these
plushie dolls of yours!

59
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:50,554
This is way too easy. Maybe
I should just shoot her.

60
00:05:58,128 --> 00:05:59,897
You know...

61
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,535
I'm not sure this is the best time
for you to be gazing at the moon.

62
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:12,176
I was thinking to myself that it's
a good thing I'm fighting you.

63
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,044
Why's that?

64
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:17,214
Because Ichigo
Kurosaki's too soft.

65
00:06:18,015 --> 00:06:21,752
Right now he is fueled with anger
for you people. But knowing him

66
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:24,822
as well as I do, it's doubtful
that he would have the will to

67
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:26,724
kill you when the
time comes.

68
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:33,497
Oh? So I get the feeling you're implying
you're the right man for the job?

69
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,237
I truly despise the way
that you fight.

70
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:44,742
You toy with your opponent's heart by
robbing the bonds they share, and use them

71
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:46,543
to do your dirty work.

72
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:49,213
It's too despicable
to allow.

73
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:52,516
You and your
cowardice.

74
00:06:52,549 --> 00:06:55,552
Your punishment is death.
I shall cut you down

75
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:58,489
before you even have the
chance to touch me.

76
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:01,759
Ahh!

77
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:13,737
Hey you! Quit runnin'
ya bastard!

78
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:16,774
What was that?! No matter
how I figure it, that

79
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:19,843
single punch of his
shouldn't have been able to

80
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:22,179
knock down a tree
that large?

81
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:26,917
It didn't even look like it had
enough force to break a wooden sword!

82
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,187
But he's smashing everything
with just one punch!

83
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,589
How's a kid like
him doing that?

84
00:07:32,623 --> 00:07:33,891
(Jumping Grunt)

85
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:36,193
Ahh!

86
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:41,665
(Painful Scream)

87
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,471
(Painful Sigh)

88
00:07:47,504 --> 00:07:52,176
Ha! I busted your shoulder, didn't I?
Too bad for you, huh?

89
00:07:53,644 --> 00:07:54,912
Huh?

90
00:07:57,581 --> 00:07:59,483
(Painful Moan)

91
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:03,554
(Gasp)

92
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:07,591
Ahh!

93
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:09,893
(Painful Moan)

94
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:14,565
What the hell was that? That bastard just
popped his shoulder back into place by just

95
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:17,201
flexing his muscles! What
kind of freak is this guy?!

96
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,541
Hey! What's the matter, kid?
Something got you a little worried?

97
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,147
I'm not scared of
you, ya jackass!

98
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:45,562
You gonna attack?

99
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:49,233
Making the first attack against
a woman isn't my style.

100
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,802
So you're a
gentleman?

101
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:54,805
Or maybe you're
just narrow-minded.

102
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:58,475
So have you ever fought a
woman stronger than you?

103
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:03,814
It's never mattered to me if women are
stronger or not. I won't attack first.

104
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:08,986
Oh. So you're not just narrow-minded
about women, you're inflexible as well.

105
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,655
What's with that motorcycle
pipe on your chest?

106
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:13,957
Do you get more powerful
when you rev it up?

107
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:15,492
Oh this?

108
00:09:15,526 --> 00:09:19,129
I'm surprised. A Soul Reaper
that knows about bikes?

109
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:21,164
Yeah, kind of.

110
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:23,634
So you're not going to make
the first attack, huh?

111
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:27,738
Then you better shut up and get ready. But
I'd draw your sword now if I were you.

112
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:32,576
I wouldn't be stubborn, or
it might really cost you.

113
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:34,711
(Engine Revs Up)

114
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:35,979
(Gasp)

115
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:48,158
You're about to find out, the dirtier my
"Dirty Boots" get the stronger they become!

116
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:51,128
And it doesn't just
work on my boots.

117
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,997
Any dirt or mud that happens
to get on the Fullbring

118
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:56,567
surrounding my body makes
me stronger as well!

119
00:09:58,235 --> 00:10:00,203
This is your last
warning...

120
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:02,072
Draw your sword!

121
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:10,948
(Grunt)

122
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:13,216
Pretty darn quick.

123
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,952
See if you can
keep it up!

124
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:19,923
I got him!

125
00:10:20,157 --> 00:10:21,191
You're done!

126
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:24,695
(Gasp)
What?!

127
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:29,766
I hit him hard! How come he
wasn't knocked completely flat!

128
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:37,608
Right, I get it.

129
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:41,111
So where's the
next one? C'mon.

130
00:10:41,612 --> 00:10:42,946
I told you!

131
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:47,451
I'm about to make you regret
that you ever said that to me!

132
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:53,023
(Gasp)

133
00:10:58,895 --> 00:10:59,863
(Painful Moan)

134
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:06,737
I've been training for
over a year to be

135
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,606
prepared to fight someone
the level of Aizen.

136
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:12,609
It doesn't matter if
you're a man or a woman.

137
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:15,145
None of you can stand
up to me!

138
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:33,496
Damn! Guess I figured wrong. I thought
if I defeated her, I'd be able

139
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,198
to get out of this
place.

140
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:39,369
What else have I got to do? I mean
there's gotta be someway out of here.

141
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:43,473
You probably can't leave here,
because I'm still alive.

142
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:49,946
Well now, you've already come to.
You're certainly a tough one.

143
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:55,184
I may be conscious, but I don't think
I'm going anywhere any time soon.

144
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:57,387
Now's your chance
to finish me off.

145
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,489
Can that crap,
all right?

146
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:00,556
Huh?

147
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:06,462
What's that? It looks
like the sky is folding!

148
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:09,399
Damn! That means
Yukio was watching us!

149
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,069
He's thinking that since
I haven't defeated you,

150
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:15,104
he might as well wipe out
this whole dimension

151
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:16,139
with us in it!

152
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:18,808
Go on! Hurry up and
kill me!

153
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:21,544
If one of our Spiritual
Pressures were to disappear,

154
00:12:21,544 --> 00:12:24,480
then this dimension should
open right up instantly!

155
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:26,015
Quick! Kill me!

156
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:27,450
I can't do that.

157
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:28,551
Why not?!

158
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:34,023
A man who lays a hand on a woman is scum.
I'd rather

159
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:37,026
die then go through life
such a pathetic man.

160
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:38,194
(Gasp)

161
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:43,966
You're coming with me.
We'll force our way out.

162
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,170
That sounds like the
logic of a child.

163
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,772
I thought I was
cynical enough now,

164
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:52,975
that that kind of talk
wouldn't effect me anymore.

165
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:01,951
I just wish that someone like
you had been around to save me.

166
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:04,187
When I needed it
the most...

167
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:09,058
What are you-

168
00:13:13,296 --> 00:13:14,430
Huh?

169
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:16,099
Jackie's gone.

170
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:20,103
How noble, she died
trying to save her enemy.

171
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:23,539
But, I'm not too sure that her opponent
could've actually survived that.

172
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:24,407
(Explosion)

173
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,174
Hm?

174
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:30,780
Oh, hey, good job.

175
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,352
So you finally made it. I was starting
to think you might never find me.

176
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:41,257
You must've located me by leveling up
from all those traps I put in your way.

177
00:13:41,824 --> 00:13:46,395
You don't seem the least bit tired.
I'm surprised you're not.

178
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,231
You sure talk a lot.

179
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,570
You're pretty violent.
What do you think would've

180
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,273
happened if I'd left a
bomb in the next room.

181
00:13:57,306 --> 00:14:00,076
You could've just
blown yourself up.

182
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:01,878
Weren't you just
watching?

183
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:07,216
My Hyorinmaru is a sword that is able
to control ice. I would've frozen any

184
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:08,985
blast before it
reached me.

185
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:12,388
A sword of ice, huh?
That's so cool.

186
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:15,391
I didn't come all this way
to have a chat with you.

187
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:19,095
Well in that way we have
something in common, don't we.

188
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:26,202
So you can reset the broken walls and rooms
I destroyed, huh? That's awfully useful.

189
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:31,073
Didn't you see all I've done? My ability
is this whole dimension that you're in.

190
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:33,843
So in here, I'm
basically God.

191
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,778
Ah, I see...

192
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:40,483
You don't understand. As God of
this dimension I can do anything.

193
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:42,485
For example...

194
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:45,855
How about that?

195
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:51,227
You truly are a
god. How impressive...

196
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,361
Why is it...

197
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:55,364
That you insist on making
fun of my ability?!

198
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:56,933
You jerk!

199
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:03,072
So why did you dodge that?!
'Cause you're afraid?

200
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:07,276
Don't let me dodge it then.
You're holding back.

201
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,180
Of course I am! Shall I show
you what happens if I don't?!

202
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:13,182
Time for your worst
nightmare!

203
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,255
There's no way for you to escape this room!
Because the next room and the next, all the

204
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:23,292
walls, the ceiling, and the floors
are all part of my ability!

205
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:26,062
I've just set all of those
beasts to follow you

206
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:28,364
wherever you go, forever,
until the life's

207
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:29,832
crushed out of you!

208
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:33,135
That's it! Come right at
me so I can kill you!

209
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:38,274
You Captains are elite snobs who were
raised with a silver spoon in a happy home!

210
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:41,811
A coddled spoiled elitist
like you will never beat me!

211
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:44,113
Now I see, you were
abandoned...

212
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,048
You're wrong!

213
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:49,952
I left them! I was the one who
abandoned my stupid parents!

214
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:52,488
I was the one who chose to get out!
Don't you

215
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:55,091
dare talk like you know
anything about me!

216
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:59,161
I transferred all of my
dad's bank accounts over

217
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:02,064
to me and destroyed his
life by bankrupting him!

218
00:16:02,098 --> 00:16:04,100
They left me alone all
the time, so I'm self-

219
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,068
taught. And that's what
they get for always

220
00:16:06,102 --> 00:16:09,238
being so busy, and never
taking their child seriously!

221
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:12,441
It felt great when I'd heard
they'd committed suicide!

222
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:16,345
Sorry to interrupt your sad
story, but you're wide open.

223
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:16,946
(pushed grunt)

224
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,252
Damn it!

225
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:30,059
Uh-oh. You've programmed them to
pursue me until they crush me.

226
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:33,029
Do you want to shut them down
before they destroy us both?

227
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:38,567
Ahhh!

228
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:47,143
(Gasp)

229
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:51,180
(laughter)

230
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:54,850
How's that?! You decided
to save me anyway!

231
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:57,820
Of course, I knew that you would!
You pitied me!

232
00:16:57,853 --> 00:17:00,556
Do not think I
took pity on you...

233
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,526
I have no interest in
your past, but if I were

234
00:17:03,526 --> 00:17:06,362
to kill you now, there's
really no guarantee

235
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:10,833
that as a result, this dimension and the
other dimensions would disappear...

236
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:14,103
Since that's the case, how
about I make you a deal?!

237
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:15,004
(scared gasp)

238
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:18,407
H-hey! Wait a
second! Hold it!

239
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:23,145
The deal is, I won't freeze
your arms and your head...

240
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:27,817
If you shut off your power in the
next five minutes, I won't kill you.

241
00:17:28,784 --> 00:17:32,088
Damn it! No... Never!

242
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:35,825
I'm not scared!
Ya wimp! You are!

243
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:47,870
See?! There's enough power in
my punch to pulverize you ass!

244
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:50,940
That's why your the one
who's scared to death here!

245
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:53,476
Damn you Soul Reaper! Get
down here and fight!

246
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:56,278
You flyin' up in the air
like that is cheating!

247
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:59,281
I'm not flying. I'm
just standing here.

248
00:17:59,315 --> 00:18:01,183
Oh, same difference!

249
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:02,485
(annoyed sigh)

250
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,122
Without knowing exactly
what your power is,

251
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:07,490
it's really not that
satisfying to beat you.

252
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:10,526
So I thought I'd try to
understand your ability first...

253
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,429
But I'm done with that.
So I ask you, do you want

254
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:16,098
me to slap you like a
brat or to destroy you

255
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:18,267
like a man. You choose.

256
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,271
That's an easy choice! I've decided
I want to destroy you like a man!

257
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:24,807
Glad to hear it!
Then let's go!

258
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:26,175
Mm-Ahh!

259
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:30,379
(gasp)

260
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:36,952
Ahh!

261
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:39,088
(painful grunt)

262
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:43,392
Ahh!

263
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:47,530
Damn! The tendons in my
two fingers are torn!

264
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,966
What's even worse is
he smashed Hozukimaru!

265
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,302
Hah! That was a good block!
If I'd hit your

266
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:55,938
head, it would've split
it open and this fight

267
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:57,072
would have been
all done!

268
00:18:58,274 --> 00:19:00,910
You're right there,
I'm damn lucky!

269
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:05,247
That's stupid talk! You're not lucky! I
broke your spear with a single punch!

270
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:07,082
I'm the lucky
one here!

271
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:09,485
But if you wanna push
your luck, why don't you

272
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:11,887
try charging at me again?
You do that and

273
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:13,956
you'll windup with
a busted skull!

274
00:19:14,957 --> 00:19:19,094
It looks like that punch of yours breaks
any weapon that gets close to you...

275
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:23,365
I guess that means I'll have
to do this job by hand!

276
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:28,037
So you're going to take me on with
just your fists?! Bring it on!

277
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,205
You've got it!

278
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,806
Ahh!

279
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:40,483
(fighting grunts)

280
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,353
What the hell is it with this guy?!
This is impossible!

281
00:19:45,955 --> 00:19:49,258
I know I'm really connected with
my punches. He's gotta feel 'em!

282
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:54,063
But how is it my hits aren't having
any affect on him at all? Damn!

283
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:58,300
I may not be breaking bones with each
punch, but he doesn't even look hurt!

284
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:00,236
(punch grunt)

285
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:01,237
Huh?!

286
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,907
What was that just now?
I didn't feel anything!

287
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:07,142
(punching grunt)

288
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:07,877
(punch grunt)

289
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,278
(punch grunt)

290
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:12,948
Oh no! My chances of hitting
the jackpot are going down!

291
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:17,386
My "Jackpot Knuckle" always allowed me to
make one lucky hit! I've never used it this

292
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,357
many times in a row, so I had
no idea this could even happen!

293
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:26,996
The odds of hitting the jackpot
go down when it's used too often!

294
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:28,230
What's wrong?!

295
00:20:28,264 --> 00:20:32,835
Looks like your big punch stopped working.
You worn out already?!

296
00:20:33,302 --> 00:20:35,337
Shut the hell up!

297
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:37,473
I'm not worn out!
Dammit!

298
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:42,077
(quivering in pain)

299
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:45,080
All right! Jackpot!

300
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,486
(powerful grunt)

301
00:20:50,486 --> 00:20:52,288
How'd he?!

302
00:20:56,091 --> 00:21:00,062
I really have to hand it to ya. Your
punches were pretty damn powerful.

303
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:04,433
But luckily, when you did hit a vital
spot, you didn't do much damage...

304
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:09,905
Sorry, kid. I'll admit
you may be a lucky guy...

305
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:14,543
But I'm the luckiest guy in the
Thirteen Court Guard Squads!

306
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:23,352
What's wrong?

307
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:26,355
From this distance you
won't be able to cut me.

308
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:28,324
The fact that you're
waiting where you are,

309
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:30,326
means you understand
coming any closer would

310
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,294
put you well within
my range.

311
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:34,930
I must formulate
another plan...

312
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:38,400
I see you're
quite cautious...

313
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:47,843
Did that move seem
meaningful to you?

314
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:53,215
How about this?

315
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:56,518
I don't believe I should
view either of them

316
00:21:56,518 --> 00:21:59,321
as meaningless acts while
in this situation...

317
00:21:59,822 --> 00:22:01,190
Oh?

318
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:06,128
Scatter Senbonzakura!

319
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:44,838
Rukia, how are
things with you?

320
00:23:44,872 --> 00:23:46,773
Well, several animals
ambushed me, but

321
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:48,909
everything's fine! And
they are all so cute,

322
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:51,144
and soft, and cuddly!
Uh, what I mean to say

323
00:23:51,144 --> 00:23:53,313
is, all of them are
beautiful works of art!

324
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:54,248
Rukia...

325
00:23:54,281 --> 00:23:55,249
Y-Yes...

326
00:23:55,282 --> 00:23:57,551
Bring a pink one
back for me.
