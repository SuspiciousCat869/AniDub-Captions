00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:12,900
[theme music]

2
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:49,466
[beeping]

3
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:52,187
-Hm.

4
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,054
Don't have much left.

5
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:02,287
And this thing isn't any better.

6
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:04,921
I'd say it's almost
time to replenish.

7
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:16,421
-Hey, wake up in there.

8
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:18,454
I brought some breakfast, OK?

9
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:20,154
Come on, open up.

10
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:20,821
Hey!

11
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:21,787
Get up already!

12
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:23,387
Do you want this
food I got or not?

13
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:25,921
Hm?

14
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:28,121
She's not here.

15
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:28,821
Perfect.

16
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,054
So where did she go now?

17
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:30,887
That's just great.

18
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,754
-Ichigo's been acting a little
weird lately, hasn't he?

19
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:39,021
He's been eating like
a horse for one thing.

20
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:41,254
And he spends all of
his time in his room.

21
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,521
-They boy is 15 now.

22
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:45,687
An impressionable lad,
young and in the spring time

23
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:47,387
of his youth, would
barricade himself up

24
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:52,187
in his room for only one reason,
and one reason only. [shout]

25
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:53,554
-Knock it off!

26
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:55,354
Quit analyzing me, you pervert.

27
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,154
-What's the matter, son?

28
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:58,987
It's just because I'm
your father, isn't it?

29
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:01,587
What's wrong with a little
parental understanding?

30
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:03,354
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Understanding, my ass!

31
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:06,187
-Guys, your breakfast
is gonna get cold.

32
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,087
-Quiet morning, huh?

33
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,154
-Now up to bat, Jinta Hanakari!

34
00:03:11,187 --> 00:03:13,421
Here comes the wind
up and the pitch.

35
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:15,854
With a perfect swing,
he lets it fly!

36
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:19,087
Home run!

37
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,054
-Please, Jinta.

38
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,121
You have to get back
to work or we're

39
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:22,887
going to be in trouble
with Tessai again.

40
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:24,421
-Shut up, Ururu!

41
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,221
I'll start when I'm ready.

42
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:27,787
Tessai doesn't scare me.

43
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:30,587
-But you were scared enough
to sweep in the first place.

44
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:31,687
-I don't get scared!

45
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,721
Who do you think you are?

46
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:35,554
You're not the boss of me!

47
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:37,387
I'm in charge, I'm
bigger than you!

48
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,654
-We're the same size.

49
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:41,054
Besides, Jinta, I'm three
years older than you are.

50
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,087
-So, who cares about age?

51
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,587
I'm a higher rank than you.

52
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,054
Who are you?

53
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:50,621
-You just never change,
do you, little one?

54
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:52,887
So is your manager in yet?

55
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:53,387
-Hmph.

56
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:54,654
Come on in.

57
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:01,754
What are you doing, Jinta?

58
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:05,254
It's too early to
open up the shop.

59
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,221
Ms. Kuchiki.

60
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:09,687
Just give me a minute.

61
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:12,587
I'll go and see if the
boss is up and moving yet.

62
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:13,587
-Heh, don't bother.

63
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,721
I'm already awake, for once.

64
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:25,221
[yawn] Good morning,
Tessai, Jinta, Ururu.

65
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:29,887
Welcome back to my
shop, Ms. Kuchiki.

66
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,887
Your timing couldn't
be more perfect.

67
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,521
I just got a new shipment
in the other day.

68
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:38,054
How can I help you
this afternoon?

69
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:39,587
One kekon shiki.

70
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:42,321
Oh, uh, what grade?

71
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:44,887
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): I'll take
the cheapest you've got.

72
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,421
-You got it.

73
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,821
So that makes 60
tablets of Soma Fixer

74
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:51,987
and, uh-- look, I know this
is none of my business.

75
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:55,154
But if you use too much of
this stuff, it can be toxic.

76
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:57,287
If you over synchronize
with your gigai,

77
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:59,954
you're in for a world of hurt
when you finally jump ship.

78
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:01,154
-Yes, I'm aware of that.

79
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:02,287
Believe me.

80
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:03,954
It's just that lately,
my connection with it

81
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,287
has growing pretty weak.

82
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:08,587
[grunt] It's becoming a lot more
difficult to move this body.

83
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,054
-Want me to check
it out for you?

84
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,121
Come on, I'll cut
you a good deal.

85
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:13,654
-No, thank you!

86
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:14,954
-Fine.

87
00:05:14,987 --> 00:05:17,087
-By the way, do you know if
that special order I made

88
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:18,454
has been delivered yet?

89
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:19,154
-Oh.

90
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:20,354
Yeah, it's here.

91
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,454
Hey, Ururu.

92
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,387
Go grab it out of
storage, will you?

93
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:26,487
-Oh, uh, OK!

94
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:29,554
-Just look for the box
labeled "new item," OK?

95
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:31,021
-OK.

96
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:31,987
Let's see.

97
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:34,421
New item.

98
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:34,921
Oh.

99
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:39,754
I'll be.

100
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:41,221
There you are.

101
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:47,987
-So this is the only
one you could get, then?

102
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:48,721
-Oh, please.

103
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:49,954
Give me a break.

104
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:51,987
That's the second most
popular one on the market.

105
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:53,387
Wasn't all that easy to come by.

106
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:54,087
Now, look.

107
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:57,787
Just go easy.

108
00:05:57,821 --> 00:06:01,287
You can't fake it
forever, all right?

109
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:02,487
-Yes, I know that.

110
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:09,854
-Good morning!
[giggle] Hi, everyone.

111
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:10,954
How are you?

112
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:11,454
-Huh?

113
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:11,954
-Oh.

114
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:12,621
Hey.

115
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:13,654
Good morning, Rukia.

116
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:16,221
-Ah, looking lovely
as always, Rukia.

117
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:17,221
-This isn't like you.

118
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:18,487
It's already third period.

119
00:06:18,521 --> 00:06:21,354
-[giggle] Sorry,
something came up.

120
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:24,754
-By the way, Ichigo, um, may
I steal you for a second?

121
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:25,387
-Huh?

122
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:26,654
What do you want?

123
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,421
-If you want to talk, then
let's do it here. [grunt]

124
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,854
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Oh,
Ichigo, what just happened?

125
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:34,354
I better get you to
the nurse's office.

126
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:37,621
-She, uh, just hit
him, didn't she?

127
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:39,321
-I didn't see a thing.

128
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:40,754
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Here.

129
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:42,621
-What's this supposed to be?

130
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:43,621
-Gikongan.

131
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,121
Substitute soul pills.

132
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,621
Tablets that force
souls from the flesh.

133
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:50,187
Just swallow one,
and a substitute soul

134
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:53,121
will enter the body, so
the real one can roam free.

135
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:55,521
If the time comes that
you must face a Hollow

136
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:57,287
and I'm not around,
you can use them

137
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:59,687
to transform into a Soul Reaper.

138
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:02,221
-It's got "Soul Candy"
printed right on here.

139
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:03,454
-Oh.

140
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:05,687
That's only because the
Soul Society Women's League

141
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,721
complained.

142
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:08,454
They didn't like gikongan.

143
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:11,421
They said it wasn't cute enough,
so they decided to change it.

144
00:07:11,454 --> 00:07:12,087
-All right.

145
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:13,154
Why is it a duck?

146
00:07:13,187 --> 00:07:14,254
-Shut up.

147
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:15,987
I didn't even order
that one, all right?

148
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:19,621
I asked for Chappy the Rabbit.

149
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:20,754
-OK.

150
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:23,121
So you wanted one shaped
like a rabbit then, huh?

151
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:23,821
-What's that?

152
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:25,454
What did you just say?

153
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,121
How dare you mock
me, you imbecile!

154
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,854
-It's not that.

155
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:31,954
I just didn't understand
your explanation is all.

156
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:32,921
-Go ahead.

157
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:34,787
Swallow one, and
it'll all be clear.

158
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:54,387
-Huh?

159
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:55,987
I'm out of my body.

160
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:58,121
-Oh, don't be so shocked.

161
00:07:58,154 --> 00:07:59,987
Inside that empty
shelf of a body

162
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,254
there resides a substitute soul.

163
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:07,521
And no one will even notice
that your true soul is gone.

164
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,021
-What?

165
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:11,921
-Hi.

166
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:13,221
Good afternoon.

167
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:14,087
Nice to meet you.

168
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:14,921
I'm Ichigo Kurosaki.

169
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:18,621
Early to bed, early to rise.

170
00:08:18,654 --> 00:08:20,087
That's my motto.

171
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:22,254
-Early to bed, early to what?

172
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:23,754
-It's pretty amazing, isn't it?

173
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:25,454
-Amazing, my ass!

174
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:26,854
What is that thing over there?

175
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:29,187
How can he be me if I'm me?

176
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:30,087
[beeping]

177
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:31,821
-Hm?

178
00:08:31,854 --> 00:08:33,021
Perfect timing.

179
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,354
We just got a mission.

180
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:37,121
Why don't we leave him here
at school while we head out?

181
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:38,121
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Are-- are you deranged?

182
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:38,721
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Let's go!

183
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:39,521
-No way.

184
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:40,854
They'll know he's a fake.

185
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:41,821
Hey, you!

186
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,054
Make sure you attend
my next class.

187
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:45,387
-[laughs] Don't worry.

188
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:46,921
Leave everything to me, Master.

189
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:51,054
Take your time.

190
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:55,354
-Wait a sec.

191
00:08:58,254 --> 00:08:59,721
Oh, man.

192
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:01,387
JINTA (OFFSCREEN):
Take a good look!

193
00:09:01,421 --> 00:09:02,287
What does it say?

194
00:09:02,321 --> 00:09:03,054
Go on.

195
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:03,854
Read it.

196
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:06,287
-Uh, "Defective Goods"?

197
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:07,254
-Yeah, that's right.

198
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:08,287
Defective goods.

199
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:10,354
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

200
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:13,287
You sold a customer faulty
merchandise, you dummy!

201
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:14,054
-Oh.

202
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:14,887
-Moron!

203
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,754
Get your act together, will you?

204
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:18,454
You and your stupid
flabby bangs.

205
00:09:18,487 --> 00:09:19,087
-Hey.

206
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:19,954
Hey.

207
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:21,087
No fighting.

208
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,787
-You know, if we're not
careful, this gikongan

209
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:25,454
could cause some real problems.

210
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:26,654
-You got that right.

211
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:28,087
We can't just sit on this.

212
00:09:28,121 --> 00:09:30,487
We better take care
of it right away.

213
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:32,121
There's no telling
what he might do

214
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,954
if we let him run
loose out there.

215
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:55,954
-All right.

216
00:09:55,987 --> 00:09:57,654
Feeling pretty good.

217
00:09:57,687 --> 00:10:01,121
Been too long since I had
a body to get around in.

218
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:03,121
Looks like I'm finally free.

219
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:05,787
-Hey, what are you doing there?

220
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:07,087
Hm.

221
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:09,521
Aren't you Kurosaki from the
ninth grade, group three?

222
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:11,221
What have you been doing here?

223
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:13,121
And why is that
fence all busted up?

224
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:23,521
Huh?

225
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:24,354
What's with that look?

226
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:30,054
[gasp] Huh?

227
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,121
He-- he leaped to there?

228
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,321
-[laughs] Surprise,
surprise, old man.

229
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:44,021
[school bell]

230
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:44,987
-All right!

231
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:47,287
At last, time for lurch!

232
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:47,921
-Jeez, Orihime.

233
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:48,987
It's just lunch.

234
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,387
It's not a big deal.

235
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:53,321
-How can you say that, Tatsuki?

236
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:55,554
Everyone knows that a healthy,
red-blooded high school

237
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:58,921
girl comes to school for only
one reason-- to eat her lunch.

238
00:10:58,954 --> 00:10:59,821
-Yeah, yeah.

239
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:00,487
I get it.

240
00:11:00,521 --> 00:11:01,821
Have a seat already.

241
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:04,054
-So, Tatsuki, what do
you have for lunch today?

242
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:06,087
I've got bread and
red bean paste.

243
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:07,254
-That sounds good.

244
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:09,521
Unfortunately, my lunch
is a little more ordinary.

245
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:10,554
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): See?

246
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,454
I can make my own red bean buns.

247
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:14,121
TATSUKI (OFFSCREEN):
Interesting choice.

248
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:17,554
-Orihime, why don't
you and I eat together?

249
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:19,221
-Um, yeah.

250
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:20,121
OK.

251
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:22,121
[giggle]

252
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:23,587
-That's so cute!

253
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:27,154
You bite into an entire
loaf of bread and smile

254
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,487
with crumbs all over your mouth.

255
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:33,354
-[gasp]

256
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:34,421
-'Scuze me.

257
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:37,287
This is the ninth grade,
class group, right?

258
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:44,854
-[shouts]

259
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:52,387
-Man, I'm getting a bad feeling.

260
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:06,803
-What-- wait a second!

261
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:08,603
How the hell did you
get up here like that?

262
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:10,336
-What do you mean, how?

263
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:11,836
I jumped up here.

264
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:14,403
You saw it with your
own eyes, didn't you?

265
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:15,736
Well, pretty rad, huh?

266
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:16,936
Can you believe it?

267
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:17,803
MALE STUDENT (OFFSCREEN):
I bet he crawled over

268
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:19,136
from the classroom next door.

269
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:19,936
MALE STUDENT 2
(OFFSCREEN): No way.

270
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:21,136
He jumped up from the yard!

271
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:22,136
MALE STUDENT (OFFSCREEN):
Did you see him do it?

272
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:23,503
MALE STUDENT 2
(OFFSCREEN): Well, no.

273
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:24,503
I didn't see it.

274
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,236
ICHIGO IMPOSTOR
(VOICE): Oh, righteous!

275
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,069
Their eyes are all over me.

276
00:12:28,103 --> 00:12:29,469
They can't get enough.

277
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,569
They totally think I'm amazing.

278
00:12:31,603 --> 00:12:34,603
Man, this rocks!

279
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:38,169
Jeez, the girls in this
class are a bunch of hotties.

280
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:41,503
I don't think there's a
bad-looking one in the bunch.

281
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:46,303
And I've been cooped
up for so long.

282
00:12:46,336 --> 00:12:48,069
Huh?

283
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:50,236
Whoa!

284
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,036
Super size!

285
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:55,803
-Hey there, pretty lady.

286
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:57,436
I don't believe that we've met.

287
00:12:57,469 --> 00:13:00,169
Would you please do me the
honor of telling me your name?

288
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:05,869
[gasping]

289
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:08,269
-Ichigo, what the heck do
you think you're doing,

290
00:13:08,303 --> 00:13:09,569
you stupid moron!

291
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:12,503
This better not be
your idea of a joke!

292
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:13,903
-Hey, you're pretty
cute yourself,

293
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:16,536
now that I get a
closer look at you?

294
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:17,003
-Huh?

295
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,803
-Why are we in such a
rush to get back to class?

296
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:23,769
-I'm worried.

297
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,769
I want to make
sure he's doing OK.

298
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:27,336
-There's nothing to worry about.

299
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:28,403
He's fine.

300
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:29,703
-I'm not so sure about that.

301
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:32,169
I'm getting kind of a
bad vibe all of a sudden.

302
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:32,669
-Huh?

303
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:33,169
-Huh?

304
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:36,436
[screaming]

305
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:37,969
-So you were right.

306
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:40,336
Like you were saying,
we better hurry.

307
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:43,303
-Told you.

308
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:46,936
-You son of a-- die!

309
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:48,436
-Watch it!

310
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:49,436
What?

311
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:51,069
All I did was kiss your cheek.

312
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:52,836
Why is that such a big deal?

313
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:55,203
I mean, you're not in
grade school anymore.

314
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:58,036
-Shut up!

315
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:59,036
-Help her, Jisuru.

316
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:00,736
-You-- you've got
to be kidding me.

317
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:03,703
I'm not messing with that!

318
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:04,836
-Stop right there.

319
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:06,603
-Huh?

320
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:07,469
-It's over.

321
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,269
Ichigo, look out!

322
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:13,769
-Right!

323
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:17,336
Stop.

324
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:18,469
There's no place to run.

325
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:24,636
-Huh?

326
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:31,069
[laughs]

327
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,069
-Die, you!

328
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:34,236
I mean, me.

329
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:37,169
Why the hell are you doing this?

330
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,069

-Ichigo?

333
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,636
-Why is he kicking
the air like that?

334
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:49,469
-Who cares?

335
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,003
-Wha-- What's going on?

336
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:13,769
-Don't know.

337
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:14,969
Maybe it's a poltergeist.

338
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:26,836
-So long.

339
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:41,603
-What the hell does
he think he's doing?

340
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:43,636
Is he crazy, or what?

341
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,703
-Is it even possible?

342
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,136
No, he couldn't be one.

343
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:50,236
He must be a-- a Mod Soul.

Ichigo!

00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:00,336
-That was Rukia, wasn't it?

00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:01,469
-I don't know.

347
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,036
I didn't see a thing.

348

-Who cares about her?

349
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:07,803
Ichigo, you are dead!

350
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,503
-Demonic.

351
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:10,469
-Tatsuki.

352
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:11,903
-Huh?

353
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:14,169
Orihime?

354
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:15,869
-You must have been scared.

355
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:16,536
Poor Orihime.

356
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:17,303
It's all right.

357
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:18,703
Don't let it get to you.

358
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:21,803
Just pretend like you had run
in with some mangy, stray dog.

359
00:16:21,836 --> 00:16:23,603
-That's all right.

360
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:24,569
I'm fine.

361
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:26,503
And that wasn't Ichigo anyway.

362
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:27,003
Huh?

363
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:32,536
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Oh, crap!

364
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:33,936
Great.

365
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:35,603
We lost him-- or me, or whatever
the hell you want to call it.

366
00:16:35,636 --> 00:16:37,203
-We're at a dead end here.

367
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:38,603
-What?

368
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:39,803
Look!

369
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:41,669
We don't have time for
your Soul Reaper nonsense!

370
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:44,469
I have to capture
him-- I mean, me!

371
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,503
I mean-- I'm not sure
I know what I mean.

372
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:47,803
But you saw it, too!

373
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:50,436
I mean, the riot
he caused in class.

374
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,836
I mean, that jerk used my body
to take advantage of Orihime

375
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:57,136
and Tatsuki, and then
he-- ki-- ki-- ki--

376
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:58,036
-He kissed them.

377
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:59,403
Yes, I know.

378
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,269
-This sucks!

379
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:00,936
Don't say that!

380
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:02,269
My life is over!

381
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:03,136
-Please.

382
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:04,336
Get over it already.

383
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,569
A kiss is nothing more
than a form of greeting.

384
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:08,169
I fail to see the problem.

385
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,903
I mean, in this book
I was just reading,

386
00:17:09,936 --> 00:17:11,536
it said there are
far worse things that

387
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,836
can happen to a girl.

388
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:13,703
-Will you shut up?

389
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:14,636
This is a catastrophe.

390
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:16,103
He came on to my classmates!

391
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,403
What the hell kind of
books are you reading!

392
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:22,536
[shout] I put years
into crafting my image!

393
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,603
RUKIA (VOICE): Image?

394
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:25,503
So he looks and acts
that way on purpose?

395
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:30,903
-Forget it.

396
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:32,903
It doesn't matter.

397
00:17:32,936 --> 00:17:35,003
Wait, you called him
a Mod Soul, right?

398
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:39,069
So what is that?

399
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:41,636
Just what the hell is he?

400
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:46,403
-A while back, the Soul
Society initiated a new project

401
00:17:46,436 --> 00:17:48,836
they called Spearhead.

402
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,703
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Spearhead?

403
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,169
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Yes.

404
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:55,703
They took souls that had
been modified for combat

405
00:17:55,736 --> 00:17:59,503
and placed them into the dead,
after their own souls had

406
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,103
parted.

407
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:05,736
They were to be used as
soldiers against the Hollows.

408
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:07,436
It was a reprehensible plan.

409
00:18:15,503 --> 00:18:18,236
All of the souls that
were selected to take part

410
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:20,836
in the Spearhead project
were then altered.

411
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,869
Once inside a body, one
aspect of their host

412
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:27,169
is made superhuman-- an
artificial soul built

413
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:30,436
for battle, a Mod Soul.

414
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:32,369
Do you understand this so far?

415
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,936
-Yeah, but your sucky
little drawings make

416
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:36,803
it seem like it's no big deal.

417
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:37,936
[groaning]

418
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:39,203
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): But
the Spearhead project

419
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:44,436
was rejected because it
would force corpses to fight.

420
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:46,936
In the end, all of the mod or
modified souls that were still

421
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:50,303
in the incubation stages
were ordered to be destroyed.

422
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:53,336
However, it seems some
are still out there.

423
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,536
-So, wait a minute.

424
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,903
You're telling me that
the guy inside my body

425
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:01,536
was created by the Soul Society?

426
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,303
And now they've
decided they want

427
00:19:03,336 --> 00:19:07,003
him wiped out for being
what they made him?

428
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:08,769
-That's exactly what I'm saying.

429
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:12,403
-And-- and you're telling me
you can honestly accept that?

430
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:16,003
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Whether I
accept it or not is irrelevant.

431
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:20,103
The Mod Souls must be destroyed.

432
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:23,036
The Soul Society commanded it.

433
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:26,503
And lest you forget, the
laws of the Soul Society

434
00:19:26,536 --> 00:19:28,336
are not arbitrary.

435
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:30,269
They have been put in
place for the protection

436
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:34,436
and well-being of
all human souls.

437
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:35,536
Now, let's go!

438
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:39,103
You want to get your
body back, don't you?

439
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,403
ICHIGO (VOICE): I wonder
what he must be feeling,

440
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:43,669
walking around inside my body.

441
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:47,836
They're created at random,
destroyed at random.

442
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:51,936
Yet somehow he survived
found his way to a body.

443
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:56,103
But still, he has
to keep running.

444
00:19:56,136 --> 00:20:00,969
I can't imagine what that
must be like for him.

445
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:01,469
-Yeah!

446
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:02,903
All right!
