1
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:09,088
Mmh...

2
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:10,788
Ah!

3
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:12,622
How are you feeling?

4
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:16,222
Where am I?

5
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:19,488
A candy store called
Urahara's Shop.

6
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,722
You can relax.
You'll be safe here.

7
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:29,688
Hngh.

8
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:31,622
Ah! You still
need rest.

9
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:38,222
Hey! You looked like you
were having a nightmare.
Are you okay Nozomi?

10
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:43,422
Hel-lo? Are you even listening?!

11
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:46,988
What are you?

12
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:51,388
Oh! That's right!
You've never seen me
like this before, have you?

13
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:54,188
It's me, Kon!
But back to you.

14
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:59,088
So, why were those guys after
you, anyway? What did you do?

15
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:04,222
Oh, yeah. Before we
get to that, you were
a Soul Reaper, right?
You should've said so!

16
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:07,588
Not to brag, but I do know
a thing or two about that!

17
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:08,855
How lame.

18
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,455
Yeah, that's
right, lame.

19
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,122
Wait, what?!

20
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:15,988
Hey, I'm not in this form
by choice, you know!

21
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:20,822
I'm a Mod Soul; when I can't
use Ichigo's body, there's
nothing I can do about it!

22
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:23,222
A Mod Soul?

23
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:28,222
Yeah. That's right.

24
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:33,588
What? What're
you staring at?!

25
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:39,122
Look, just answer my
questions and tell me
what happened, okay?!

26
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:42,888
Then my loyal servants
just might be able to
help you out!

27
00:03:43,688 --> 00:03:44,522
[shattering crash]

28
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:45,855
<i>[Kon]</i>
<i>Yeaaghh!</i>

29
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:50,722
Ngh... egh.. hrg...

30
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:52,055
Watch it,
pervert.

31
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:54,788
You jerk!
Why did you do that?!

32
00:03:57,288 --> 00:03:58,755
That's enough, Kon.

33
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:02,522
But what was that for?!
All I did was ask her
some questions!

34
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:06,922
If she doesn't want to talk
about it, then there's no use
trying to force her to, okay?

35
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:09,755
[sigh]
Yeah, I guess so.

36
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:12,655
Hey, Ichigo.

37
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:15,688
How much longer are you going
to keep everyone waiting?

38
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:17,588
Come on, already!

39
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:20,022
Yeah, okay. One sec.

40
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:24,155
All right! Let's go!
Strategy meeting,
here we come!

41
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:27,655
No. You stay here with
Nozomi and the others.

42
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:29,522
What?!

43
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:31,622
They're still
looking for her.

44
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:34,155
We must take steps
to keep her safe.

45
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:34,655
Yeah but...

46
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:36,522
It's a vital assignment.

47
00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:38,088
<i>We need you.</i>

48
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:39,155
Awwh.

49
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:44,322
Well, I guess I can handle
all the important jobs,
just like usual.

50
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:47,955
Let's go, Ichigo.
[proud chuckling]

51
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:48,922
Yeah.

52
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:51,788
Be careful, guys!

53
00:04:55,388 --> 00:04:56,255
Hmm?
Hmm?
Hmm?

54
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:05,522
Is something wrong?

55
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:26,422
[Inaba]
Thank you,
everyone.

56
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:28,788
I appreciate you
all gathering here.

57
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:31,588
I know you have very
busy schedules.

58
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:36,755
Enough formalities.

59
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:39,422
What's the plan?
What are we going
to do now?!

60
00:05:39,988 --> 00:05:44,455
I've already sealed off the
Precipice World and rendered
communications impossible.

61
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:51,222
Now we must strengthen and
unify ourselves before
they can formulate a
strategy and return here.

62
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:57,588
<i>Also, there are still a few</i>
<i>captains who haven't yet</i>
<i>been replaced with a Reigai.</i>

63
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:00,855
And what about
the Head Captain?

64
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:04,955
I have a plan in mind for him,
don't you worry about that.

65
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:08,555
Of course, I will
need everyone's
help to achieve it.

66
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,588
To tell you the truth,
I don't care about that.

67
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:17,422
Whatever you ask of us,
I'll do it.

68
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:18,955
So how
about it?

69
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:21,888
Hurry up and let
me fight myself!

70
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:25,555
Eugh.
It's so revolting!

71
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:28,888
Barbarians are
just so eager to
turn to violence.

72
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:29,822
What?!

73
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:33,822
Not that I care whom a barbarian
chooses to fight, of course.

74
00:06:34,122 --> 00:06:37,622
But don't go carving them
up too much, all right?

75
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:41,188
They're important you know.
They are my test subjects,
after all.

76
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:45,588
What are your thoughts,
Captain Kuchiki?

77
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:49,488
Only one can lead
the Kuchiki clan.

78
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:51,822
And that will be me.

79
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:54,788
Of course it will.

80
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:01,522
<i>All your wishes will</i>
<i>soon be granted.</i>

81
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,255
<i>Just as soon as we</i>
<i>capture that girl.</i>

82
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,488
And then, with our own hands,

83
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:15,688
we will be able to reshape
the world into what it
should rightfully be.

84
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:21,655
But so much trouble
for just one girl.

85
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:23,188
[gasp]

86
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:24,588
Heh...

87
00:07:26,355 --> 00:07:29,988
All right, let's begin our Soul
Reaper impostor crisis meeting.

88
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:32,655
If it's okay,
I'll lead this one.

89
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:33,422
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Wait!</i>

90
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:34,155
Hmm?

91
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,688
[frustrated]
Gghh...

92
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,988
What? What's wrong, Ichigo?

93
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:40,288
You really need to ask?!

94
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:42,755
Why're we all
crammed in my room?!

95
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:44,122
Oh calm down!

96
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,522
[Mayuri]
Enough with the interruptions!
Get on with it, already!

97
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:49,388
Ugh.

98
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:56,688
The mastermind behind
this is Kageroza Inaba,
Seventh Seat in Squad Twelve.

99
00:07:56,722 --> 00:08:00,055
A section chief in the
Department of Research
and Development.

100
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:03,288
He oversees research regarding
the Precipice World.

101
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:06,155
It's safe to say he knows
all there is to know about it.

102
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:12,288
<i>[Mayuri]</i>
<i>Everything that's been</i>
<i>happening. has been planned</i>
<i>entirely by Kageroza.</i>

103
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:18,022
<i>He manipulated time in the</i>
<i>Precipice World so the</i>
<i>Cleaner would find us.</i>

104
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:20,688
<i>And we'd be confined there.</i>

105
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:26,388
<i>He also sent back Reigai</i>
<i>versions of us captains</i>
<i>to the Soul Society.</i>

106
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:35,622
If he's left unchecked, all the
Thirteen Court Guard Squads
will be under his control.

107
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:38,022
<i>Rrgh, it's very aggravating!</i>

108
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,155
This Kageroza.

109
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:46,922
He lured me to the Soul Society
by manipulating the Thirteen
Court Guard Squads.

110
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,488
<i>That was when he</i>
<i>tried to capture Nozomi.</i>

111
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:55,755
I mean what the hell
could he be planning to
use that girl for, anyway?

112
00:08:57,422 --> 00:08:58,588
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>My guess is,</i>

113
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:03,622
That girl is carrying
around some kind of secret.
It's something big.

114
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:09,788
It could be that what he
wants is something he's
hidden... in her body.

115
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:10,288
[gasp]

116
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:18,388
I won't let him.

117
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:22,422
I'll never let that
ever happen again!

118
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:29,388
<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>Are you guys finding</i>
<i>everything all right?</i>

119
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:31,455
[Orihime]
Yes, we are, Kisuke.

120
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:35,555
Thank you so much for letting
us use your barbecue stuff.

121
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:37,522
and for getting us
all this food, too!

122
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:42,622
No problem! Don't mention it.
I plan to come enjoy it myself!

123
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:44,355
Eehh??

124
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:50,122
I don't get it. Why are we
having a barbecue, again?

125
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:55,255
Well, it appears to me
that you're even dumber
than Ichigo is.

126
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:57,488
Hmm? Hey,
watch it!

127
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:00,288
You've seen how withdrawn
that girl Nozomi is.

128
00:10:00,322 --> 00:10:02,855
Well, this is Orihime's way
of trying to cheer her up.

129
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,255
Clearly, she's
been though a lot.

130
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:11,155
Aah...

131
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:16,488
Okay I get it, but should
we really be doing this in
the middle of a crisis?

132
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:19,122
Actually, if our
party's successful,

133
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:22,622
she might finally open up
and help us understand
what's going on around here.

134
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:24,255
Gotcha.

135
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:27,788
Whew!

136
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:30,355
Come on, everyone!
Let's get started on this!

137
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:33,122
<i>Uryu, could you cut</i>
<i>the vegetables?</i>

138
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:35,288
<i>And Chad, get the</i>
<i>fire started, okay?</i>

139
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:36,288
[Uryu]
Got it!

140
00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:37,322
[Chad]
[sffirmative grunt]

141
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:40,122
Huh?

142
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:48,988
I get it!

143
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:53,555
Hey! What, you
goofing off already?

144
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,022
Oh. That's right. Sorry.

145
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,288
Guess this is your
welcome party.

146
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:05,688
Anyway, I really want you
to tell me the truth.

147
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:08,022
And I'll help you
any way that I can.

148
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:15,422
Even if you don't want to
tell the others, you can
still tell me, you know!

149
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:19,655
'Cause I mean, after all,
I was the one who saved
your life!

150
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:23,755
Uh?

151
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:26,755
Uuhh...

152
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,788
Huh?

153
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,222
Hey, what is that? That thing
you're holding right there?

154
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:33,888
<i>Oh, it's just chili powder!</i>

155
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:37,022
<i>Why do you have a</i>
<i>can of chili powder?</i>

156
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:42,155
Oh, of course! I get it!
You don't know what
chili powder is, do you?

157
00:11:42,955 --> 00:11:44,855
Admit it: I'm right!

158
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:47,388
Tell you what,
I'll teach you
what it is!

159
00:11:47,422 --> 00:11:51,988
But let me warn you, it's
seriously spicy stuff if
you eat it straight.

160
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:55,388
Exactly! If you put it in your
mouth like that, you'll see-

161
00:11:55,722 --> 00:11:57,288
It's hot!

162
00:11:57,722 --> 00:11:59,955
Ah! My mouth is on fire!

163
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:10,522
Aahh! That's hot, too!
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

164
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:12,022
Yaahhh!

165
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:15,122
Huh... Hrk?

166
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:18,022
What is this?!

167
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:19,522
Don't you get it?

168
00:12:22,122 --> 00:12:25,422
Your stupid goofing around has
defiled the proud Quincy Cross!

169
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:28,155
But that's a
shiitake mushroom!!

170

(woozy reax)

171
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,455
I worked hard on that
shiitake, So eat it with the
respect that it deserves!

172
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:40,955
Uh, yes, sir...

173

You guys!

174

Aw, don't be like that.

193

Let's go back!
Everyone made
all that food,
and just for you!

C'mon, Nozomi!

195

Come back with me.
You know, everybody's
really worried about you!

Not my problem.

197

Huh??

198

Hrrgh! What is
wrong with you?!

199

We're only trying
to cheer you up!

200

We just thought that you'd
be scared because those
guys are coming after you!

201
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,888
How is that not your problem?!

202
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:12,288
Is this how you repay
other people's kindness?!

What?!

209
00:14:40,522 --> 00:14:42,388
[embarrassed]
Oh! Rangiku! Hi.

210
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:44,722
So... What's going on here?

211
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:47,588
You gotta hear
this, Rangiku!

212
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:52,988
That girl is stuck-up and
violent, she just runs off on
her own, and she doesn't
listen to anyone but herself!

213
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:56,555
I mean, we're trying
to look after her,
but she's totally
ungrateful!

214
00:14:56,922 --> 00:14:59,955
Even I've had it with her,
and you know how calm I am!

215
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:02,188
Oh...

216
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:08,288
Whatever's going on,
it sure seems you're
having trouble, huh?

217
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:09,755
Hmm?

218
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:13,722
Hmm!

219
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:19,076
You know what, why
don't you let me
handle this one?

220
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:19,500
What...?

221
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:22,088
I know how difficult
girls her age can be.

222
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,255
We'll talk, girl
to girl. 'Kay?

223
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:27,188
What, seriously?!
Boy, would that help!

224
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:31,522
Oh, No, wait.
Everyone else is
looking for Nozomi, too...

225
00:15:32,522 --> 00:15:36,855
Which means if I come back
without her, they'll just
get on my case again!

226
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:42,322
It'll be fine! I'm sure I
can convince her to come
back in just a little bit.

227
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,022
[grumble]

228
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:46,388
I don't know; I'm a man.

229
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:48,955
And a man must
keep his promises.

230
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:50,988
<i>Come on.</i>

231

Let me handle this.
Pretty please?

233
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,488
All right, she's all yours!

234
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:02,422
Come on, Nozomi,
let's take a walk
and talk, okay?

235
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:04,655
Come along.

[stretching]
Aaahhh!

237
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:16,388
Such a relief that's over! Whew!

238
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:21,655
You know, if that girl were a
little more open and friendly,
she'd might even be cute.

239
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:24,255
[giddy]
But boy, that Rangiku,
she's...

240
00:16:25,388 --> 00:16:27,355
Just let me handle this.

241
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,855
Pretty please?

242
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,622
OohhOOooOOohh!!

243
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:34,255
Rangiku...

244
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:35,622
What about me, Kon?

245
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:36,922
What?! Rangiku!?

246
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:41,022
But...! Rangiku,
why're you-?!
Where's Nozomi?!

247
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:42,855
What's that?

248
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:46,122
What do you mean?
I haven't seen her!

249
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:47,488
What...?

250
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:48,788

Oh!

00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:50,188

you doing here?

00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:51,388

looking for--

Wha?

254
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:56,022
What's with him?

255
00:16:56,455 --> 00:17:00,488
Damn it! This is all my fault!
I let her out of my sight.

256
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:03,155
It's a vital assignment.

You came back!

I'm sorry I took so long!

I saw through your disguise
right from the very start!

Stay out of this, got it? Ugh.

314
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:04,417
Ulp!

315
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:05,584
Hey!

316
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:07,050
What're you talking about?

317
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,950
This all started 'cause
you took your eyes off
her in the first place!

318
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:12,517
Uuh--

319
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,584
What made you think it was
a good idea to leave her?!
Wasn't Rukia clear enough?!

320
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:17,950
Well, I...
It's just that...
I, uh...

321
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:18,917
Pervert.

322
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,984
No, I! I'm not a--!

323
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,717
Hey, Ichigo!
You too, Nozomi!
The food is all ready!

324
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,384
Here, I'll bring it
over to them for you!

325
00:21:27,784 --> 00:21:28,784
That Kon.

326
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,817
Look, don't worry
about it, Nozomi.

327
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,517
Uh?

328
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,017
From here on, we'll protect you.

329
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,250
Are all of you
really this stupid?

330
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,150
Yeah, maybe!

331
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:43,884
[Kon]
Nozomi...

332
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:47,217
Have a shish-kebab!
It's tasty!

333
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,350
C'mon, try it!

334
00:21:57,217 --> 00:22:00,150
[chuckling]

335
00:23:46,814 --> 00:23:48,314
<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>This sure is a mess.</i>

336
00:23:49,981 --> 00:23:53,247
[Mayuri]
Indeed. Two Marechiyo Omaedas
means twice the fried rice
cracker consumption.

337
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:55,014
<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>[sigh]</i>

338
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:57,681
<i>Uh huh...</i>
[Mayuri]
Two Rangiku Matsumotos means two
Soul Reapers who won't do work,

339
00:23:57,714 --> 00:24:00,581
<i>Uh-huh, uh-huh...</i>
while two Kenpachi Zarakis
means double the destruction!

340
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:01,647
<i>Enough!</i>
