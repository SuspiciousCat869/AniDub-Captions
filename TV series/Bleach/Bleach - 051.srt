[theme music]

2
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,534
-[groan] Damn it.

3
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:45,134
This hangover is killing me.

4
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,667
-Dumbass, I drank more
than you, and I feel fine.

5
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,867
It's your smoking that makes you
feel like crap every morning.

6
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,467
-[groan] Shut up!

7
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:55,234
I didn't hear you give me
crap like that yesterday

8
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:56,701
after I kicked your ass.

9
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:57,701
Want some more?

10
00:02:57,734 --> 00:02:58,201
-Yeah?

11
00:02:58,234 --> 00:02:58,834
Come on.

12
00:02:58,867 --> 00:02:59,934
Bring it!

13
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,301
Draw your sword, you
arrogant little punk,

14
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:03,734
and I'll polish you off and then
sweep you up with the trash.

15
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,734
-Polish me off?

16
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,367
Who the hell talks
like that anymore?

17
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,967
You better get ready
to die, old man.

18
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:10,367
-Huh? [groan]

19
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:11,701
[wind blowing]

20
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:12,601
-Hm?

21
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:13,667
-Huh?

22
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:15,501
-What the hell kind
of a sound is that?

23
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:19,667
[shouting]

24
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,101
-[together] Good
morning, Captain Zaraki!

25
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,367
What a surprise!

26
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,467
Thanks for giving us the
honor of sweeping the streets

27
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:31,434
for you! [shouts] Huh?

28
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:32,801
If

29
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:35,001
-You two are gonna goof off,
try to be so obvious about it.

30
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:37,434
-And you'd better get this
street clean enough to eat off,

31
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,501
or I'll kill you both.

32
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:39,701
-You heard the man.

33
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:44,001
Keep up the good work if
you want to live. [laughs]

34
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:45,867
-Why the hell would
the captain have

35
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:47,801
that fool Aramaki
tagging along with him?

36
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:48,934
-Forget that.

37
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,834
Weren't there two women
riding on Zaraki's back

38
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,367
instead of just one?

39
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:58,934
-Well, just which way am I
supposed to go now, woman.

40
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:01,401
-I think it's probably that--

41
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:01,967
-No!

42
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,367
It's this way!

43
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,334
-That hurt.

44
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:05,834
What was that for, Yachiru?

45
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:07,301
That wasn't very nice.

46
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:09,267
-[laughs] Kenny knows
it's this way, too.

47
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:10,234
Don't you Kenny?

48
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,734
-Perhaps we would
be better off just

49
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,167
listening to Orihime, Captain.

50
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:16,267
After all, the lieutenant
is not exactly known

51
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:17,867
for accurate sense of direction.

52
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:22,234
-Perhaps you should shut
up, cueball head. [spits]

53
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:24,867
-Oh, I'm gonna
kill her for that!

54
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:25,567
-Hey, come on.

55
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,767
Keep your cool, now.

56
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,234
You have to admit,
Ikkaku, you were

57
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,867
kind of asking for that one.

58
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:32,067
-Enough of all your bickering.

59
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:34,034
I'm just going to go
with my instincts.

60
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:34,867
-All right!

61
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,034
-That's an excellent plan, sir.

62
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,501
-You go, Kenny, and we'll
follow you anywhere.

63
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:38,501
You're the best!

64
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:45,467
URYU: Huh?

65
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:48,567
A little butterfly just
flew into the room.

66
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:50,334
Such a fragile thing.

67
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:51,567
Heh.

68
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:54,934
Does this mean that it's
spring in the Soul Society.

69
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,167
-Oh, great.

70
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:59,534
Now he's seeing butterflies
and talking to himself.

71
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,034
Why don't you see
if you can catch

72
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,234
the pretty butterflies, Uryu.

73
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:03,867
-What?

74
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:05,334
Why would I do that?

75
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:08,067
And where do you get off
calling me by my first name.

76
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,501
You are nowhere near a close
enough friend for that.

77
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,434
And if you're going to
make insulting comments

78
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,634
about chasing butterflies,
then you never will be.

79
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:16,167
-Hey, who said I
wanted to be friends

80
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:18,034
with an oddball like
you in the first place?

81
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,701
URYU: You must have thought
you could be my friend,

82
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:21,167
or you never would
have called me that.

83
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,867
GANJU: It's part of
the Shiba clan legacy

84
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,701
to always reach out
in friendship, even

85
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:26,067
to those who don't deserve it.

86
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:28,367
URYU: What kind of
ridiculous legacy is that?

87
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:29,167
-Sh.

88
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:29,967
[crowd talking]

89
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:30,667
-What?

90
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,034
What's wrong?

91
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:32,701
-Listen.

92
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:34,067
Don't you hear that?

93
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:34,934
-[together] Hm?

94
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:35,801
[crowd talking]

95
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,901
-Yeah, now that you mention it.

96
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,834
MAN: [shout] What are you doing?

97
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:40,801
MAN 2: Get out of here!

98
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:41,801
MAN: Get out of his way.

99
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,234
[shouting]

100
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,801
-Well, whatever it
is, it does seem

101
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,367
like it's headed this way, huh?

102
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,967
-I'm sure it's just some kind
local parade or celebration

103
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:50,001
or something.

104
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:50,567
-Huh?

105
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,034
-You think so?

106
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:53,701
[shouting]

107
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:54,634
GANJU: What the hell?

108
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,101
We're done for!

109
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:59,934
We're all gonna die!

110
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:01,734
It's-- it's you.

111
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:03,267
But how can this be?

112
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:10,801
[shout] I never wanted
to see you again,

113
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:13,801
Captain Kenpachi Zaraki.

114
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:15,267
Huh?

115
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:16,834
Not you, too.

116
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:20,434
I remember your stupid
haircut and your massive ego.

117
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,834
-I wish I could say the same.

118
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,434
I have a good
memory for the faces

119
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,101
I've seen, with the
exception of the ugly ones.

120
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:28,367
-Hm.

121
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:29,501
You don't know what you're
talking about, pretty boy.

122
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:31,101
The fact is, everyone
tells me that I

123
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:33,167
look cooler than ever with
all these bandages on.

124
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:34,667
Besides, how could
you recognize me

125
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,001
from before with
my face covered?

126
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,534
URYU (VOICEOVER):
Interesting that he

127
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,801
didn't argue about being ugly.

128
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:39,701
[groaning]

129
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:40,201
-Hm?

130
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:45,501
-Huh?

131
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:46,401
Orihime?

132
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:49,101
-Oh, hey, Uryu, Chad, and Ganju.

133
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:52,834
I'm so glad to see the
three of you are all OK.

134
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,834
[groaning] Ow, Yachiru!

135
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:55,801
[laughing]

136
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:56,801
-Stop!

137
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:57,301
Stop!

138
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:12,001
MAN: Byakuya, sir.

139
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:14,134
It is almost time, master.

140
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,534
You should leave
for the Sokyoku.

141
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:19,301
-Very well, then.

142
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,601
I'm off now, Hisana.

143
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:34,034
TETSUZAEMON: Ah!

144
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,234
This is terrible!

145
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:39,134
How could I do such
a thing? [shout] Yeah

146
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,001
A thousand pardons, my captain.

147
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:45,867
Somehow, I fell asleep
sitting on the toilet.

148
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:47,467
And I'm late arriving
to assist you.

149
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,834
Please allow me to kill
myself as punishment.

150
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:50,901
KOMAMURA: Never mind that.

151
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:52,867
Calm yourself, Tetsuzaemon.

152
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:54,834
Everything is fine.

153
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:57,934
All the preparations
have been made.

154
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,334
-Uh, huh?

155
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:03,901
-You needn't take the blame
for everything, Tetsuzaemon.

156
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:04,867
-Huh?

157
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,567
Well, thank you
for saying so, sir.

158
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:08,967
-Don't try to hide it.

159
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:12,301
You're worried, aren't you?

160
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:16,434
You think I may yet doubt the
legitimacy of this execution.

161
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:19,767
And so you've been making
excuses and arriving late

162
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:22,267
to give me more time
so I can think it

163
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,234
through until I'm convinced.

164
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:27,934
-Uh, exactly so, sir.

165
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,334
-Do not worry.

166
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,067
I have no doubts.

167
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:32,434
-[gasp]

168
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:37,834
-My loyalty and dedication to
Captain Yamamoto are absolute.

169
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,667
When I was despised and
made an outcast because

170
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:44,934
of my appearance, he was the
only one who believed in me.

171
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,634
Why would I not spend
the whole of my spirit

172
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:50,167
to repay that debt to him?

173
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:51,967
I have no doubts.

174
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:57,001
If he should ask, I
would give my life.

175
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,167
How about you, Kaname?

176
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:05,501
-For me, the path
ahead is crystal clear.

177
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,101
The road the
sightless eyes choose

178
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:11,534
will always be the one
not dyed red with blood.

179
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:16,201
And I believe that you and
I walk the same path, Sajin.

180
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:22,367
[chewing]

181
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:23,934
-What an annoyance.

182
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,734
What a pain in the ass.

183
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,701
As if it wasn't bad
enough with these Ryokas

184
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,267
sneaking around and then
some kind of murder.

185
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,101
Now we got captains
and lieutenants

186
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:35,134
all arguing about whether the
execution is legit or not.

187
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:37,201
What's there to talk about
when the superiors have

188
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:38,734
made their final decision?

189
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,767
Pretty stupid, don't
you think, Captain?

190
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:41,867
SUI-FENG: Idiotic.

191
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:43,201
-Huh?

192
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,034
-I have no interest in
who's right or wrong.

193
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,001
I am interested
only in the mission

194
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:51,867
and in executing my orders
as the captain of Squad Two.

195
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,867
I kill enemies.

196
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:56,834
That's all there is.

197
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,367
-Yeah, huh?

198
00:09:58,401 --> 00:09:59,434
I guess so.

199
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,301
SUI-FENG: You, too, Marechiyo.

200
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,934
You had best remember
where your loyalty lies.

201
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:09,034
If you cross me, or
trying to get in my way,

202
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,067
then you, too, are my enemy.

203
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:15,701
-Yeah.

204
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:19,634
Well, I'll be sure
to remember that.

205
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:24,934
[humming]

206
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,734
[grunting]

207
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:31,801
-Here you are, Captain.

208
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:34,934
I've been looking for
you for an hour now.

209
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,767
What are you doing
just lying there?

210
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:37,901
Get up.

211
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:39,801
You've got to get ready
to go to the Sokyoku.

212
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:42,367
-Well, I can't get up just now.

213
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:46,267
I seem to be having a little
problem here at the moment.

214
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:49,501
Tell me what you
think I should do.

215
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:50,034
-Why?

216
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,001
What is it?

217
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:52,201
KYORAKU: OK.

218
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,434
You see, I put this blade
of grass in my mouth,

219
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:55,901
thinking it would relax me.

220
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:58,534
But I guess it must be toxic
or something, because now,

221
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:00,067
the more I chew
it, the more I can

222
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:02,134
feel it burning the
inside of my mouth.

223
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:05,434
-Try spitting it out!

224
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:09,834
-Let me ask you, Nanao.

225
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,801
What do you think I should do?

226
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:14,201
-It doesn't matter what I think.

227
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:17,767
And we both know that.

228
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:20,601
Regardless of any
advice I might give you,

229
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:22,167
you'll just go
right ahead and do

230
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,534
what you were
going to do anyway.

231
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:29,334
But don't worry about it.

232
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:31,501
I'll be sure to walk
several steps behind you

233
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:32,767
when we get there.

234
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:34,834
That way, I won't get
dragged into whatever trouble

235
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:35,334
you cause.

236
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:41,134
-That's too bad.

237
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,334
That means I'll be on my own.

238
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:47,334
And old man Yamamoto
will blame it all on me.

239
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,775
[gasping]

240
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:09,142
KENPACHI: Another dead end.

241
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:11,042
-Well, let me explain.

242
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:13,142
You see, it's not that easy.

243
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:14,608
Guiding a big group
through a city

244
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:17,042
is really more luck
than it is science.

245
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:20,075
ORIHIME: Sure, you could run
into dead ends 10 or 12 times

246
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,208
before finding your way.

247
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,408
-I told you we shouldn't
let the lieutenant lead.

248
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,075
What would you
expect to happen when

249
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:28,275
you follow someone around who
has no sense of direction?

250
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:31,108
[shout] Someone get
this creature off me.

251
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:40,075
-Captain?

252
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:41,475
-Yes?

253
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:44,175
You should be ashamed
of yourselves, boys,

254
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,975
sneaking around like that.

255
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:48,208
Show yourselves.

256
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:51,475
Hiding your spiritual pressure
in order to stalk others

257
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:55,175
is no way for a captain to act.

258
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,608
[bang]

259
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,708
KOMAMURA: Your arrogance
knows no bounds, Kenpachi,

260
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:03,742
to talk that way, given what
you appear to be involved in.

261
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:12,875
[gasping]

262
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:15,642
-What are you doing
with these Ryoka?

263
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:18,942
Did you lose your self-respect
when you were defeated?

264
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:24,208
[gasp] Captain Komamura,
Captain Tosen, Lieutenant Iba

265
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:26,442
and Lieutenant Hisagi?

266
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:27,542
Oh, damn.

267
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:29,408
-Don't get your
panties in a twist.

268
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,708
We still outnumber
them almost two to one.

269
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:34,142
-Yeah, but it's not
numbers I'm worried about.

270
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:36,175
KENPACHI: Quit whining.

271
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,942
Who ever said any
of you are going

272
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:42,342
to be in this fight
in the first place?

273
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:46,308
After all, even taking these
guys on four against one

274
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:51,008
won't give my blade much
more than a little practice.

275
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,008
KOMAMURA: Four to one, you say.

276
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,975
So, you think you are good
enough to fight all of us

277
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:57,575
by yourself, Kenpachi?

278
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,642
Though your strength
is well known,

279
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:03,342
Captain, it is no match for
your excessive self-confidence,

280
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,175
as you will soon learn.

281
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,075
KENPACHI: You talk
too much, Sajin.

282
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:15,208
Just hurry up and fight already.

283
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:18,442
And the four of you had better
attack at the same time.

284
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:22,175
If you come at be from all
four sides, then one of you

285
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:26,875
might actually be
able to wound me.

286
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,342
-Uh, Captain, sir?

287
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,408
What about us?

288
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,308
What will we do, sir?

289
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:32,108
-Go!

290
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:33,308
You'll just get in the way.

291
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:34,408
-OK, OK.

292
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:37,308
But he didn't have to
be so mean about it.

293
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:38,242
-Come on.

294
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:40,175
Get over it, Whiskers.

295
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,875
Kenny's happy right now.

296
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:43,742
Believe me, you don't
want to mess with that.

297
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:44,808
MAKIZO (VOICEOVER):
Don't tell me

298
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,308
you've changed my
nickname to Whiskers!

299
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:48,075
-We're gonna go now!

300
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:50,975
We'll go find Ichigo,
and you catch up later.

301
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,908
OK Kenny?

302
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,708
KENPACHI: I'll be right there.

303
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:59,142
-Muscles, Jiggles, Monkey,
Pencil, let's get going!

304
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:01,075
-Uh, what did you say?

305
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:01,908
-Huh?

306
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,842
Did I just get nicknamed Pencil?

307
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,208
-Oh, you'll figure
it out eventually.

308
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:07,642
You too, Whiskers.

309
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:08,675
Run everybody, run!

310
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,208
-Wait for me!

311
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:09,908
-We're coming!

312
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,675
-I'm not staying here!

313
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,508
-I'll be right there, huh.

314
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:18,475
It seems you're deliberately
trying to provoke us now.

315
00:15:18,508 --> 00:15:21,542
Or do you really believe you
can defeat all four of us

316
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:22,808
that easily?

317
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:25,308
Either way, it looks like
you've lost your grasp

318
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,542
on sanity, Kenpachi.

319
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:29,942
KENPACHI: Ha, sanity.

320
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:33,642
What would I do with
something as useless as that?

321
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:37,742
Lucky for me, I never
had any such thing.

322
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:40,175
ORIHIME: Yachiru, wait a minute!

323
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,475
-Hm?

324
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,108
-Are you sure it's a good
idea to leave your captain?

325
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,075
He's pretty heavily
outnumbered back there.

326
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:47,442
-Oh, no problem.

327
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:51,408
Those guys could never beat
Kenny, even if was 20 to one!

328
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:52,842
-Yachiru.

329
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,275
MAKIZO (VOICEOVER):
This Ryoka girl

330
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:56,308
sure has some nerve,
calling the lieutenant

331
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:57,508
by her first name like that.

332
00:15:57,542 --> 00:16:00,208
Either that or she's crazy!

333
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:01,175
-Right, you two?

334
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,875
Can you believe
nerve of this girl?

335
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,142
What do you think, sir?

336
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:04,842
Huh?

337
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,342
Hey, where did they go?

338
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:14,208
-Captain, allow me.

339
00:16:14,242 --> 00:16:15,208
-And me.

340
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,808
Let the two of us
go first, Captain.

341
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:19,075
-You idiots.

342
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,975
I told you I want all four
of you to attack me at once.

343
00:16:22,008 --> 00:16:23,508
YUMICHIKIA: You
think so little of us

344
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:25,175
you would send in
only your lieutenants?

345
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,775
What an insult to our captain.

346
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:30,642
-If that's the case, sir, then
the two of us should go first.

347
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:32,942
-What the-- why didn't
you two clear out

348
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:34,975
along with the others,
like I told you?

349
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:36,508
-Listen, all four of you.

350
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:37,942
You've got a lot
of nerve to think

351
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:39,842
your two lousy lieutenants
are good enough

352
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,808
to take on Squad 11's
Captain Zaraki by themselves.

353
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:44,308
In fact, you should
be happy just

354
00:16:44,342 --> 00:16:46,908
have to me as your opponent.

355
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:48,908
Right, Captain?

356
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,442
-[laugh] So in other words,
you two clowns want to get

357
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:52,442
in on the fight?

358
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:53,975
All right, then.

359
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:54,742
Go.

360
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:56,075
I'll give them over to you.

361
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:58,642
But take it somewhere else,
so you don't get in my way.

362
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:00,675
Or I'll have to kill
you both myself.

363
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,742
-[together] Thank you, sir.

364
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:05,875
-I can hardly believe
what I'm hearing--

365
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:08,675
you guys arguing over
who's going to fight us.

366
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,608
You certainly have
gotten pretty cocky

367
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:14,008
since the last time
I saw you Ikkaku.

368
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:16,342
-A coward who had to
transfer to another squad

369
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,175
just because he
couldn't make the grade

370
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,575
and become a lieutenant
in ours has no business

371
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:23,175
lecturing me, Tetsuzaemon.

372
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,375
-You're going to pay
for that, Ikkaku.

373
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:27,542
-Well, if I do,
it won't be here.

374
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:28,675
Let's get moving.

375
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,575
I have no desire to be
killed by our captain.

376
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:32,808
-Yes, let's do it.

377
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:36,142
Are you two ready to take
this fight somewhere else?

378
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:37,542
-It won't matter.

379
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:40,442
You'll die just the same.

380
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:41,542
KENPACHI: All right, then.

381
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:43,842
We can finally get
down to business.

382
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,708
Of course, your number
has been cut by half.

383
00:17:46,742 --> 00:17:50,475
This will probably be no more
of a workout than my morning

384
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:51,975
exercises.

385
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:54,242
-And still, you brag.

386
00:17:54,275 --> 00:18:00,175
I think the time has come to
put an end to your arrogance!

387
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,775
Here I come!

388
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:02,408
-[gasp]

389
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:15,008
-Now stand back, Sajin.

390
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:17,775
I will break all his limbs.

391
00:18:17,808 --> 00:18:19,175
Suzumushi Nishki.

392
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,175
Benihiko!

393
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:48,108
-It's over.

394
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:51,375
Not even Kenpachi Zaraki could
have survived such an attack.

395
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:56,075
KENPACHI: Ha.

396
00:18:56,108 --> 00:19:03,342
[laughs]

397
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,975
That's it?

398
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:07,242
That's all you got?

399
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,208
[gasping]

400
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:11,542
-Impossible.

401
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:17,908
Tenken, Benihiko-- How
can he still be standing?

402
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:19,108
KENPACHI: Oh, dear.

403
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:25,942
Forget what I said before.

404
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:28,508
My morning exercise
is tougher than this.

405
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,142
-Well then, I guess
I'll be doing.

406
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:41,875
ICHIGO: All right.

407
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,808
-Tell me the truth, Yoruichi.

408
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:55,208
What do you think?

409
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:58,108
Do you still think he's
going to be able to do this?

410
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,208
Because we're out of time.

411
00:20:04,242 --> 00:20:06,275
Can he really
reach Bankia today?

412
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:18,542
-Let's go, Ichigo.

413
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:20,742
One more time now.

414
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:24,042
And let me be clear-- just
because the hour is drawing

415
00:20:24,075 --> 00:20:27,042
near, I don't intend
to go easy on you.

416
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:28,542
-No, of course, you won't.

417
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,375
And that's because I'm
not going to give you

418
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:32,675
the chance to go easy on me.

419
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,408
-Renji.

420
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:34,675
-Hm?

421
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,408
-Do you remember
the first time when

422
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:39,308
you were a child that you stood
up and walked on your own?

423
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:40,208
-What?

424
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:41,275
Of course not.

425
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:43,608
No one remembers
anything that early.

426
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,175
-If you don't remember doing
it, and yet you did it,

427
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,608
it means that you weren't
conscious of it at the time.

428
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:53,042
So how did you
know how to do it?

429
00:20:53,075 --> 00:20:56,375
The answer is all
humans are born already

430
00:20:56,408 --> 00:20:59,208
knowing how to stand up, just
as birds are born knowing how

431
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:03,675
to fly, and fish are born
already knowing how to swim.

432
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,808
It's because of what
we call instinct.

433
00:21:05,842 --> 00:21:07,642
All living creatures
use instinct

434
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:09,442
to obtain their
natural power when

435
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:11,642
the time comes that
they need them.

436
00:21:11,675 --> 00:21:14,942
That's what Ichigo's
face reminds me of.

437
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:18,642
I think he knows instinctively,
somewhere deep down

438
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:22,008
inside, that he has that power.

439
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:26,375
And that is why I
still believe that he

440
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:29,875
will be the one to reach Bankai.

441
00:21:29,908 --> 00:21:33,308

00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:43,968

444
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:46,968
I'm your idol, Kon, and
this is the last installment

445
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:48,334
of the Soul Reaper guidebook.

446
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,668
Last but not least is
that legendary man.

447
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:52,734
By the way, the new Soul
Reaper golden dictionary

448
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:54,401
will begin right after
the next episode,

449
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:56,201
so be sure to keep your
eyes peeled for it.

450

RUKIA: You mean there's more?
