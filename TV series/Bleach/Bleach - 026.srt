00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:53,909
-Such a narrow sky.

00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:01,609
What is that?

4
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:02,909
The sky is glowing.

5
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:09,342
-It hit the membrane.

6
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:10,542
-Yes.

7
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:12,476
And it looks like it's
being held there, somehow.

8
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,476
-How can it have crashed
into the membrane,

9
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,376
and yet not have been destroyed?

10
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,076
It would take a body of
unimaginable spirit power

11
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:19,576
to survive.

Because anyone
who gets separated

That's the one I have to find.

Hinagiku, Baigon, Lily.

Santen Kesshun, I reject.

-Hey, what's your problem?

50
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:16,109
-Shut up!

51
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:17,109
Stay back.

we're safe for the moment.

-How'd all this sand
get in here? [coughing]

58
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:43,109
-Your skill did this.

59
00:04:43,142 --> 00:04:45,176
So shut up already.

60
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,842
-[growling] You know, you
got a hell of a lot of nerve,

just saved your life.

-Saved my life?

63
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:52,576
I only said we were saved.

64
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:55,276
You got that?

65
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,609
-Woohoo!

66
00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:57,542
What luck.

-Can you believe this?

68
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:08,742
First we skip out on
our boring guard duty.

69
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:12,176
And then these two fall
right into our hands.

-(SINGING) Lucky, lucky me.

71
00:05:14,842 --> 00:05:17,409
Today I'm lucky.

72
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:22,376
However, you, on the other
hand most certainly aren't.

73
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:25,142
-Yeah?

74
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:27,176
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
This hole is huge.

MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
How is this possible?

76
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:31,542
-And there's no
one in the crater.

77
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:34,309
So that must mean that
they're still alive.

78
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:34,976
Go find them!

79
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:35,476
-Right.

80
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:36,109
Come on!

00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:36,609
-Let's go.

82
00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:37,109
-Move on.

83
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:37,376
-Let's go.

00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:44,876
-OK.

85
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:48,242
So what now?

[panting]

00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,109
-It's coming.

88
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:56,542
Now get ready.

89
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:58,409
[explosion]

90
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:02,742
-What?

91
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,376
It disappeared.

92
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:05,342
Damn.

93
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:05,976
Find him.

94
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:12,509
-It looks like
I'm on my own now,

95
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:15,742
and something tells me it
just might be better this way.

96
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:19,809
-Wait.

97
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:21,809
This is all no good, Ichigo.

98
00:06:21,842 --> 00:06:22,876
Can't you see?

99
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:26,742
It's not Poo-san,
it's Pee-tan, silly.

100
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:28,742
They sound alike,
but they're not.

101
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:29,976
-Uh, Orihime.

102
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,842
-Oh, come on now, Ichigo.

103
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:32,342
-Orihime!

104
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:32,809
Oh!

105
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:33,309
-Ow!

106
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:34,009
-Careful.

107
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:35,509
Close-quarters combat.

108
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,242
[giggling] Oh, hi.

109
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:40,142
It's only you.

110
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:42,009
-Are you all right, Orihime?

111
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:42,509
-Yeah.

112
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:43,942
I'm fine.

113
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:45,476
-That's good.

114
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:50,576
It appears as though we have
landed in an unpopulated area.

115
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:53,509
-How lucky!

116
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:54,776
-Careful, Orihime.

117
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:57,076
I'm afraid you may have
injured your arm in the fall.

118
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:59,576
Once I realized you were
hurt, I administered first aid

119
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:00,942
with the bandages I had.

120
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:03,776
But unfortunately, I didn't
have any painkillers with me.

121
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:04,742
-I see.

122
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:06,442
So you did this?

123
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,076
Uh, thank you.

124
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:10,542
You keep bandages on hand?

125
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:14,109
Look, I'm fine, you see.

126
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,176
-Forgive me.

127
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,109
I, uh, know that you
were protecting me.

128
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:20,542
If it weren't for
me, then you probably

129
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:22,076
never would have gotten hurt.

130
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,109
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
You think so?

131
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:25,776
Oh, don't blame yourself.

132
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:26,876
I mean, I'm such a klutz.

133
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,709
I probably would have
gotten hurt, anyway.

134
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:30,609
But you already knew
that, didn't you?

135
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:33,009
Besides if you weren't there
with that first aid kid,

136
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:36,276
I could have fainted from
extreme loss of blood,

137
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:40,409
and gone into a state of
shock, and died right here.

138
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:42,476
Does that sound weird?

139
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:43,309
-No.

140
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:45,042
Let's just get going.

141
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:47,142
We made a lot of
noise when we landed.

142
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,576
I'm sure it won't be long
before we attract a crowd.

143
00:07:49,609 --> 00:07:50,076
-Right.

144
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,742
-(SINGING) Who is lucky?

145
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:59,376
I am lucky.

146
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:02,376
None so lucky but me.

147
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:02,942
That's right.

148
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:04,242
I said me.

149
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,542
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky,
lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky,

150
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:10,842
lucky, lucky, lucky,
lucky, lucky me.

151
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:15,876
-Eh?

152
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:24,009
-Ugh.

153
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:25,909
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
What are you doing?

154
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:27,242
-You fools!

155
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:28,476
Come on.

156
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:29,942
Couldn't you see that I
doing my lucky dance for you

157
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,142
both while I was waiting
for you to come crawling out

158
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:33,976
of your stinking
sand box to fight me?

159
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,876
And why are you two gaping at
me like a couple of idiots?

160
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,609
Unbelievable.

161
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:39,842
-What the hell's with him.

162
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:41,176
-Wait a minute.

163
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,109
-Hmm?

164
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:42,676
Oh, come on.

165
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:43,909
-Listen to me.

166
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:45,742
I'm going to make a run
for it, first chance I get.

167
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,976
-So now you're going to run?

168
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,409
What are you, some
kind of little pansy?

169
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:50,109
-These guys have too
much spirit energy

170
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:51,976
for an amateur soul
reaper like you.

171
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:54,409
Don't you understand
anything, you damn idiot?

172
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:56,842
IKKAKU (OFFSCREEN): Hey, what
are those two arguing about?

173
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:59,409
-Well, it could be
they're both scared out o

174
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:01,076
their minds to fight us.

175
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:04,309
So then, why don't we just
let them take their time

176
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:05,442
and argue about it?

177
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:08,509
But then again, if we
let them take too long

178
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,609
some of the other soul
reapers may show up.

179
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:13,442
And then they will
steal our glory.

180
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:15,742
Yeah, that's true.

181
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:16,809
I got it.

182
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:18,609
We'll set a time limit.

183
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,442
That will give me a
chance to do another one

184
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,809
of my pre-fight dances.

185
00:09:21,842 --> 00:09:24,076
So you two can have enough
time to make your decision--

186
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:26,976
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): If you
want to fight, be my guest.

187
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,309
-Aw, you two have a falling out?

188
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:31,342
-Something like that.

189
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:33,576
-He really shouldn't
have run away.

190
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:34,176
Get him.

191
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:34,676
-Right.

192
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:35,409
I'm on it.

193
00:09:39,676 --> 00:09:41,609
-Oh great, just as I expected.

194
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:42,909
One of them's after me.

195
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:43,409
Crap.

196
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,609
IKKAKU (OFFSCREEN): Hey.

197
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:48,909
-Hmm?

198
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:52,342
-So tell me, why didn't you
run away like your friend?

199
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:54,442
He obviously ran
because he sensed

200
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:57,642
that our powers are far
superior to his own.

201
00:09:57,676 --> 00:10:00,542
You know, if you ask me,
I think your friend made

202
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:01,976
a pretty wise decision.

203
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,942
-If your power really
is greater than mine,

204
00:10:04,976 --> 00:10:06,742
it would be useless to run.

205
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:09,276
You'd catch me for sure.

206
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:13,876
But if, on the other
hand, my power is greater,

207
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:17,042
then I'll just defeat
you, and be on my way.

208
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,642
At least that's
the way I see it.

209
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:21,409
-Is that so?

210
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,309
I guess you're not
stupid after all.

211
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:33,509
[roaring] (THINKING)
He dodged it.

212
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:38,876
He moves well.

213
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:42,376

-At least tell me your name.

218
00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:21,609
-Ichigo Kurosaki.

219
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:28,076
-Ichigo, that's a good name?

220
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:29,942
-You think so?

221
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:32,376
No one's ever told
me that before.

222
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:33,476
-Yeah.

223
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,876
They say that guys with
Ichi in their names

224
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:38,776
are overflowing with
talent and good looks.

225
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:41,176
At least that's what I've heard.

226
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:43,109
I'm third seed
assistant adjutant,

227
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:46,809
Squad 11, Ikkaku Madarame.

228
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:50,642
Well, Ichi, what
say we be friends?

229
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,476
-Ain't gonna happen.

Damn it.

237
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,586
This guy sure is persistent.

238
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:28,352
Come on.

239
00:12:28,386 --> 00:12:29,552
Doesn't he ever get tired?

240
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:30,219
-Hah.

241
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:31,419
What beastly running.

242
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:37,452
Up in front of you.

243
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:43,019
-Turn into sand now.

244
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:43,519
Seppa.

245
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:48,419
-Hmm.

246
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:51,352
That is one unusual skill.

247
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:54,986
So that's how you made
that crater back there.

248
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,752
But it's a skill
that could backfire.

249
00:13:02,386 --> 00:13:02,852
-Seppa.

250
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,286
-Look out ahead.

251
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:17,319
-[panting] [roaring]
[gasp] [wailing]

252
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:19,652
Holy smokes.

253
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:21,786
That pit is huge.

254
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:22,852
-Welcome.

255
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,819
This is the old
execution ground.

256
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:29,552
Long ago, we'd bring hollows
that we captured here.

257
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:33,086
We'd throw them down into that
pit to fight with criminals,

258
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:37,386
and watch the spectacle
from up there.

259
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:40,352
-So what you're saying is that
soul reapers are supremely

260
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,952
twisted, aren't they?

261
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:44,652
-Ah, but not as
twisted as your face.

262
00:13:44,686 --> 00:13:46,352
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): I pity you.

263
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:47,552
-Pretty?

264
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:49,586
I'm flattered that even
a brute as awkward as you

265
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:52,386
can somehow recognize my
dazzling handsomeness.

266
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,019
-I said pity, not pretty.

267
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:55,386
-I realize that.

268
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:58,119
I've simply made a
witty, humorous joke.

269
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:01,286
Besides, that twisted
form of execution

270
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:03,219
is no longer performed here.

271
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:07,586
These days, those who fall into
this pit can never get out.

272
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:12,686
I think that's enough chasing
around and prattle for now.

273
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,586
It's time.

274
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,586
I will let to you choose.

275
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:21,486
Will you die by my sword, or
will you fall into that hole,

276
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,119
and die?

277
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:25,652
So which will it be?

278
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:26,986
Aw.

279
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:28,352
You're angry, I know.

280
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:33,086
Turn, and let me see your
face, no matter how it looks.

281
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,419
I love to witness the
agony on one's face

282
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:37,719
when forced to choose
how he's going to die.

283
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,886
[chuckling]

284
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,786
-You are a cruel
bastard, no matter

285
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:44,486
how you try to disguise it.

286
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:52,252
IKKAKU (OFFSCREEN):
I don't get it.

287
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:54,819
Sure there's some
distance between us.

288
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,919
But only a novice
unfamiliar with fighting

289
00:14:56,952 --> 00:14:59,286
would allow a hand to leave
his sword during a match.

290
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,219
-Why don't you just shut
your trap, all right?

291
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:03,686
I got blood in my eyes.

292
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,586
So I just stopped
to wipe it away.

293
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:08,286
-Even shallow wounds above
the eye bleed profusely.

294
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,452
Therefore, you must
stop the bleeding.

295
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,186
You can't just wipe it away.

296
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:17,452
-Hey, that's not fair.

297
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:19,952
You have a special ointment
to stop your bleeding.

298
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,219
-It is too fair.

299
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,319
It's called being
prepared, you idiot.

300
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:24,986
Instead of
complaining, you should

301
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:27,152
be applauding my
professionalism.

302
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:28,786
-Eh.

303
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:29,619
-Heh.

304
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:32,119
You sure are one strange guy.

305
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:34,286
You behave like a greenhorn.

306
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:36,686
And you don't look
like much of a fighter.

307
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:41,552
But you have excellent reflexes.

308
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:43,319
-[roaring]

309
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:44,319
-And fierce attacks.

310
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,386
One could even say the
sum of your movements

311
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:56,086
are nearly close
to matching mine.

312
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:03,152
You shouldn't look so angry.

313
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:05,119
I'm complimenting you.

314
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:06,986
You're too good to be
dismissed as merely

315
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:08,919
a greenhorn with
natural abilities.

316
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:12,652
There's something
about the way you move.

317
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:14,386
Who is your master, Ichigo?

318
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:19,086
-Truth is, I only
trained for 10 days.

319
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:21,819
So I don't know if I can
really call him my master.

320
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:25,552
But there is a man who taught
me the skills to fight.

321
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:27,352
-Who is he?

322
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,919
-It's Kisuke Urahara.

323
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:41,319
IKKAKU (OFFSCREEN): I see
So he was your master.

324
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:44,019
In that case, it would
be rude to kill you

325
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:45,452
without giving it my all.

326
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:51,119
Extend Hozukimaru.

327
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:04,419
Now is not the time to
look surprised, Ichigo.

328
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:06,886
(SHOUTING) Let's go!

329
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,152
No mistakes.

330
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:11,552
-That's right.

331
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:15,452
-[laughing]

332
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:17,119
-A spear's reach is long.

333
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:18,252
I know that much.

334
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:19,619
I won't misread it.

335
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:20,552
-You're wrong.

336
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:26,052
-An opening.

337
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,952
-[roaring]

338
00:17:28,986 --> 00:17:30,119
-Split apart, Hozukimaru.

339
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:43,486
-Now turn around, and face me.

340
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,452
I want to see the
expression on your face

341
00:17:45,486 --> 00:17:47,952
in your last moments of life.

342
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:50,919
Each time I see such
things, my beauty grows.

343
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:53,986
-Maybe it's time you've
got beautiful on your owns.

344
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:55,352
-Huh?

345
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:56,186
-Wretch!

346
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:57,519
What do you see now?

347
00:17:57,552 --> 00:17:59,019
Become sand now!

348
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:07,586
-Just what do you think you're
doing to one as beautiful

349
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,486
as me?

350
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:10,419
Help.

351
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:12,086
I'm falling!

352
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,119
I'm falling!

353
00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:18,619
-[chuckling] Well, what a shame.

354
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:20,819
Talk about digging
your own grave.

355
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:23,852
But I guess some
people actually do it.

356
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:30,586
-[shouting]

357
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:33,152
-How insignificant.

358
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:34,119
Huh?

359
00:18:34,152 --> 00:18:35,552
Whoa!

360
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:37,886
-[laughing] Gotcha.

361
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,852
-What?

362
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:40,019
It's some kind of trick.

363
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:44,819
What is that sphere?

364
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:47,586
-[laughing] Goods thing I
brought a spare with me.

365
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:49,852
This is no average cannon ball.

366
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:53,786
It was originally developed
by my sister, Kukaku Shiba.

367
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:56,186
Even more importantly,
you zanpakuto

368
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,719
can't easily shatter it.

369
00:18:57,752 --> 00:18:58,452
-Too bad.

370
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:00,319
You've underestimated me.

371
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:02,786
Just so you know,
I'm the fifth seed

372
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:05,586
of Squad 11's strongest
squad in the soul society.

373
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:08,152
And if you think that I'm
just an ordinary soul reaper,

374
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:09,986
then you're sadly mistaken.

375
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,286
Bloom for me, Fuji Kujaku.

376
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:17,452
Watch as I break
your Reishukaku core.

377
00:19:17,486 --> 00:19:18,952
I'll shatter it
with a single blow.

378
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,019
What?

379
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:25,452
-Oh, yeah.

380
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:27,319
I've got some news for you.

381
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:29,819
This bomb my sister
made, it's unstable

382
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:33,552
when its concentration of
spirit power is broken.

383
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:35,019
-Huh?

384
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:36,952
-[chuckling]

385
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:38,419
[explosion]

386
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:43,286
-[roaring]

387
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,086
[grunting]

388
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:51,652
-Idiot.

389
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,719
-Heh.

390
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:58,886
Clever strategy, wasn't it.

391
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,719
Still, all things considered,
your one tough bastard.

392
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:07,519
-Don't even tell me
that for one minute,

393
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:12,552
you thought that was
enough to kill me off.

394
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,386
Now I'm really mad.

395
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:14,619
And you're going to pay.

396
00:20:14,652 --> 00:20:15,252
-Hah.

397
00:20:15,286 --> 00:20:16,352
Can't hear you.

398
00:20:16,386 --> 00:20:18,719
Seppa.

399
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:19,986
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Aha!

400
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:20,852
Running away again?

401
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,652
-You can kiss my ass.

402
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:26,086
-An ugly thought.

403
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,052
That's truly ugly.

404
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:35,686
-Remember I warned
you not to misread it.

405
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:38,319
Hozukimaru is not a spear.

406
00:20:38,352 --> 00:20:40,086
It is a three-part pole.

407
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:44,786
Does it hurt?

408
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:49,452
You probably can't hold
a sword with that hand.

409
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:51,952
I'm a man with a
generous spirit.

410
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:55,519
Normally, I would have
taken you in alive.

411
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:58,519
But I'm afraid, in
this case I won't

412
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:00,319
receive any credit
unless I kill you.

413
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:04,652
-Fine.

414
00:21:04,686 --> 00:21:05,819
-Now what?

415
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:07,619
You're not serious, are you?

416
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:09,286
-Dead serious.

417
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,752
-[roaring]

418
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:25,252
-Don't talk as if
our fight is over.

419
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:28,252
You still haven't
seen what I can do.

420
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:31,252
Now it's my turn, Ikkaku.

421
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:35,052
-Those are certainly some
mighty brave words, greenhorn.

422
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:48,453
[music playing]

423
00:22:51,178 --> 00:22:53,445
IKKAKU (OFFSCREEN): You're
pretty good, Ichigo.

424
00:22:53,478 --> 00:22:55,311
But the real battle starts now.

425
00:22:55,345 --> 00:22:58,478
And it's too late to come
crying with apologies.

426
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,845
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Hey, that's my line.

427
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:01,778
Fight!

428
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:02,278
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): Hit it.

429
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:02,978
Cover it.

430
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:04,111
Rock, paper, scissors.

431
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:06,211
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): No,
not that kind of battle.
