The truth is, they all wanted
to speak to you, Ichigo.

But it seemed they were very
hesitant to approach you.

When I get back, I'll explain
things to each one, personally.

103
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:38,764
The Cross Seal
containing Aizen was
taken to the Seireitei.

Why the sad look?
You should be happy
that it's all over.

107
00:08:57,597 --> 00:08:59,230
I'm not really
sure, frankly.

108
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,564
I'm having a lot
of mixed emotions.

109
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,930
You saved everyone's life,
and this entire world,

110
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:10,097
All because you were willing
to risk everything to stop
Aizen which you accomplished.

111
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,897
I know that.

112
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,264
You did the right thing, Ichigo,
believe me. There's no reason
for you to regret anything.

113
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,930
There was no other way.

114
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:36,230
So, let me ask.

115
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,430
About Aizen.

116
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,097
Is it true that
he was really...

117
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:44,397
<i>...rejected by the Hogyoku?</i>

118
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,297
My old man told me that
the Hogyoku's power

119
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,530
is to take in the heart of
the people surrounding it,

120
00:09:54,564 --> 00:09:56,864
and then manifest
their heart's desires.

121
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,764
<i>If that turns out to be</i>
<i>the case, could it be</i>
<i>that Aizen lost his</i>
<i>powers by his own choice?</i>

122
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:14,030
When I battled Aizen,
I finally had enough power to
be able to feel his sword.

123
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:18,397
And I can tell you with
certainty, there was nothing
but loneliness in that weapon.

124
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,864
It's very sad, when you think
about the implications.

125
00:10:25,897 --> 00:10:29,230
If his powers were superior
from the time he was born,

126
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:32,930
<i>perhaps he's been searching</i>
<i>all these years for someone</i>
<i>he could regard as his equal.</i>

127
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:37,430
<i>It must have been</i>
<i>frustrating at first</i>
<i>and then just depressing.</i>

128
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:42,230
At some point,
he must have given up thinking
he would ever find such a being.

129
00:10:43,764 --> 00:10:47,330
I imagine he's been wishing,
somewhere very deep in his
heart,

130
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:51,030
that he could once again
become a simple Soul Reaper,
like the others.

00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:04,097
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Ichigo!

151
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,130
[Rukia]
Ichigo?! What's going on?
Talk to me!

152
00:12:07,164 --> 00:12:10,330
[choking, gasping]

153
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:14,297
[scream of pain]
HRRAAAAGHH!

154
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,096
We will now pass judgment!

155
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:27,762
<i>Former Squad 5 Captain,</i>
<i>Sosuke Aizen!</i>

156
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:33,629
<i>We sentence you to the</i>
<i>lowest level of Underground</i>
<i>Prison 8, 'Muken'.</i>

157
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:39,229
<i>where you will remain</i>
<i>for 18,800 years!</i>

158
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,629
Oh, really?

159
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:44,729
<i>Hm?</i>

160
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:48,462
Interesting. The likes of you,
passing judgment on me.

161
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:51,229
It strikes me as a bit comical.

162
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:53,729
Rrrgh!

163
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:57,429
Incredible! You believe
you can sit there and
push your luck, just
because you're immortal?!

164
00:12:57,462 --> 00:13:00,296
We don't have to listen to this!
Restrain his mouth and eyes!

165
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:03,629
The years of your sentence are
increased, to twenty thousand!

166
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:04,729
Just what he deserves!

167
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:06,329
<i>Lock him up forever!</i>

168
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,462
<i>[Yamamoto]</i>
<i>You idiots!</i>

169
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:23,529
Each of you is telling me you
lost your Captain's coat?!

170
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:26,996
Damaging it is one thing,
but losing it is outrageous!

171
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:30,496
How can the three of you
stand there, looking so
nonchalant about it?!

172
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:33,162
Really, Head Captain...

173
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:35,662
You make too much
of the situation.

174
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:38,162
In the end, they were
just cheap coats.

175
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:40,562
We will pay for them
to be replaced.

176
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:43,229
You think that's going to
resolve the situation?

177
00:13:43,262 --> 00:13:46,262
That's not even the
primary thing I'm
concerned about here!

178
00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:51,596
And by the way, for your
information, you smug
know-it-all, those coats
were anything but cheap!

179
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:53,962
Battles are not
just about winning!

180
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:56,996
What do you people
think the captain's
coat is, anyway?!

181
00:13:57,429 --> 00:13:58,596
A royal pain.

182
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,162
A cheap garment.

183
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:01,396
A fashion statement?

184
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:05,462
<i>You're nothing but a bunch</i>
<i>of ignorant baboons!</i>

185
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,796
The Head Captain seems
to be in good spirits.

186
00:14:10,296 --> 00:14:11,096
You're right.

187
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:13,062
<i>[Yamamoto]</i>
<i>Now listen up!</i>

188
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:15,562
<i>[Jushiro]</i>
<i>It's been ten days since he</i>
<i>lost his left arm in battle.</i>

189
00:14:15,596 --> 00:14:20,196
I was worried that he would see
himself as crippled, and lose
his spiritual vitality.

190
00:14:20,996 --> 00:14:24,262
But his strength seems
to be back, so that's
been a relief to me.

191
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,562
There's no Soul Reaper here
who'd be able to take his place.

192
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:35,496
Captain!
Captain Kurotsuchi,
where are you?

193
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:40,996
Sorry, the Captain's not here.
He went to Hueco Mundo to
research something.

194
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:43,962
Again?! What am I
supposed to do?

195
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:45,129
Maybe you can help.

196
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:51,229
So, Lieutenant Hinamori's
been left in our care for as
long as it takes to heal her
internal injuries, right?

197
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:55,829
Well, Lieutenant Matsumoto's
here to pay her a visit, and
I'm not sure what I'm
supposed to do.

198
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,996
<i>[Akon]</i>
<i>Lieutenant Hinamori is</i>
<i>not allowed any visitors.</i>

199
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:05,129
Besides, we cannot allow
outsiders into the research
facility when Captain
Kurotsuchi isn't here.

200
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:09,829
I'm sorry, Lieutenant Matsumoto,
but you're not really--

201
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:11,229
Hm?

202
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:16,562
I don't see her anywhere.

203
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:18,096
What happened?

204
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:35,062
Huaah!

205
00:15:57,796 --> 00:16:00,296
<i>This isn't good enough!</i>
<i>At this rate--</i>

206
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:08,996
<i>At this rate, I'll fail!</i>
<i>I'll never be strong</i>
<i>enough to protect Momo!</i>

207
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:23,529
I have to keep practicing!
Whatever it takes to become more
adept at using my own Bankai!

208
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,862
Haaaaaaaa!

209
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,529
<i>[Rangiku]</i>
<i>You've gone away.</i>

210
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:48,096
<i>And you didn't even</i>
<i>leave behind a keepsake</i>
<i>to remember you by.</i>

211
00:16:48,696 --> 00:16:51,796
<i>That's exactly the type of</i>
<i>thing I didn't like about you.</i>

212
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:55,062
[gasp]

213
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,929
<i>Everyone's moving on.</i>

214
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:24,429
<i>[Rangiku]</i>
<i>Neither Shuhei nor Renji</i>
<i>were at the barracks.</i>

215
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:27,696
<i>They must be somewhere,</i>
<i>brushing up on their</i>
<i>skills and strength.</i>

216
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,629
<i>I need to do the same thing.</i>

217
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:40,896
<i>You're right, of course.</i>
<i>You had to make a clean break.</i>

218
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:45,862
If you had left behind a
momento, it would have probably
kept me from moving forward.

219
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:47,796
<i>And that would</i>
<i>be terrible.</i>

220
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:55,429
You must have seen that weakness
in me, and knew the only path
you could take was separation.

221
00:17:56,329 --> 00:18:03,029
Thank you, Gin, for being
strong. Now that I think back on
it, that is exactly what I...

222
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,362
...loved about you.

223
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:19,662
[gasp]
[gasp]
[gasp]
[gasp]

224
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:25,162
<i>[Orihime]</i>
<i>Ichigo!</i>

225
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:28,796
Where am I?

226
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:31,829
We brought you
to my house.

227
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:32,496
Huh?

228
00:18:37,762 --> 00:18:39,529
What happened to
your injuries?

229
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:42,096
We all healed a
long time ago.

230
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:44,596
What are you talking about?

231
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:48,162
You've been unconscious for
the last ten days, Ichigo.

232
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,029
You've gotta be kidding.

233
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,196
[gasp]

234
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:52,896
My powers,
are they gone?

235
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:58,262
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>They haven't</i>
<i>faded away yet.</i>

236
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:01,029
So you already know.

237
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:03,896
Yes. Kisuke told
us everything.

238
00:19:04,396 --> 00:19:05,296
I see.

239
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:07,862
Are you all right, Ichigo?

240
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:11,829
It was very strange.
At the moment we all reunited,

241
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:15,162
you collapsed, and we had
no idea what happened.

242
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:17,629
Ichigo!
Ichigo!
Ichigo!

243
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:21,229
Ichigo!
Are you okay?!

244
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:24,062
Ichigo! Can you talk?
Open your eyes!

245
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:32,096
Captain Urahara.
Do you know
what's happened
to Ichigo?

246
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:35,162
If you do know, please tell us!
Is he going to be all right?

247
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:52,662
According to what
Kisuke said,

248
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:57,729
there are several stages you
can expect to go through,
in the course of losing
your Spirit Energy.

249
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:00,529
What did he tell you?

250
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:02,796
Everything. First you
lose consciousness,

251
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:08,029
and the time that
your body spent inside the
Precipice World immediately
begins to flow in reverse.

252
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:10,729
Did you notice your
hair is shorter?

253
00:20:12,696 --> 00:20:17,362
Your height has returned to
what it used to be, and your
Spirit Energy is stable now.

254
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:20,629
And of course, you
still retain your
Soul Reaper powers.

255
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:22,329
Eventually, however...

256
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,796
It will move to
the next stage.

257
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:33,529
When that happens, there won't
be any question, because he will
black out once more, this time
accompanied by intense pain.

258
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:35,729
When he regains
consciousness,

259
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:39,462
he'll have lost all his
Soul Reaper powers.

260
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:41,662
That could happen next week,

261
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:44,362
next month, or a
year from now.

262
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:48,896
Even I don't know how long
his current state of
instability will continue.

263
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,429
Oh well. When that
time comes, it comes.

264
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:08,396
Ichigo, are you--?

265
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:11,262
Don't worry, I'll be
all right, Orihime.

266
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:14,696
More importantly,
I'm glad all of
you are okay.

267
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:15,829
Wait a minute!

268
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:17,929
What the hell are
you talking about?!

269
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,729
How can you act like it's
nothing?! You're about to lose
your Spirit Energy, you know!

270
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:24,296
Come on, Uryu.

271
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:25,162
Ugh!

272
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:30,829
Heh. I got into this, knowing
all the consequences.

273
00:21:31,262 --> 00:21:33,162
I have no regrets
about what I did.

274
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:37,796
Okay then.

275
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:40,962
[Ichigo]
Anyway, now that
we're all healed up,

276
00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:43,796
I guess there's no
reason for us to hang
around here, right?

277
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,096
We should head on back
to Karakura Town.

278
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,896
Everyone there is
probably waiting for us.

279
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:46,522

<i>Head Captain.</i>

280

281
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:50,355
<i>[Byakuya]</i>
<i>As an apology,</i>
<i>I had someone make</i>

<i>You still don't get the</i>
<i>issue here, do you?</i>

283
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:57,022
<i>[Byakuya]</i>
<i>I had it assembled by the</i>

<i>the very best materials.</i>

284
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:59,555
<i>[Yamamoto]</i>
<i>Very well. In that case,</i>
<i>I guess I'll keep it.</i>
