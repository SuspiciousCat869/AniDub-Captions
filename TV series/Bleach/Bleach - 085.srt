00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,808
-[gasp] Rukia!

3
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:49,128
-Can someone please explain
to me what happened?

4
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:54,494
-[laughs] Say, why don't we just
start off with you telling me

5
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,361
your name.

6
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:58,994
-Rukia Kuchiki.

7
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:03,361
-Ah, well that's
a very nice name,

8
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:06,361
worthy of being my new servant.

9
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:10,861
So, Rukia, would you
like to work for me?

10
00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:12,828
-Yes.

11
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:13,328
-[gasp]

12
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:15,328
-[laughs]

13
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:17,294
ORIHIME: What are
you doing, Rukia?

14
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:17,861
Stop.

15
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:18,761
I can't breathe.

16
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:20,261
You're choking me!

17
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:46,461
ICHINOSE: My sincere
apologies, Master.

18
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:49,961
He must have slipped out somehow
when I wasn't paying attention.

19
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:57,028
Mabashi was refusing to suck
out living souls before.

20
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:00,494
But now, it seems he must
have changed his mind.

21
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:06,361
-Eventually, all Bounts succumb
to the inevitable allure

22
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,961
of soul sucking.

23
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:11,028
Now the same thing is
happening to Mabashi.

24
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:12,928
That's all this is.

25
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:16,461
-Do you think he can control
his power, Master Kariya?

26
00:03:16,494 --> 00:03:18,928
-Are you concerned?

27
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:21,561
-It's just that I
may not be a Bount,

28
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:25,261
but I do still consider
myself to be one of you.

29
00:03:25,294 --> 00:03:27,361
-It's not your concern
that's important

30
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:29,828
here, but trust, Ichinose.

31
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:30,961
-Yes, sir.

32
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:35,194
-Trusting each other
is what friends do.

33
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:38,328
Even if Mabashi were to
lose control of his powers

34
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:42,061
and go completely berserk,
it would still be all right.

35
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:48,861
Whatever the result, it's fine
as long as he gets stronger.

36
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:51,561
A battle that doesn't
involve any risk

37
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:54,261
is worse than a fight
between children.

38
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:56,061
It's of no interest whatsoever.

39

[gasping]

40
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:10,528
-Rukia, what happened to you?

41
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:12,394
What are you doing?

42
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:15,861
-Please, let go of Orihime.

43
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:20,528
-[laughs] My doll,
Ritz, is unique.

44
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,861
It allows me to control
people's actions

45
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:25,528
by entering and taking over
their bodies completely!

46
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:26,428
-You let her go!

47
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:27,328
-Oh, no.

48
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,028
She's going to do what I want.

49
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,061
She no longer has
a will of her own.

50
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:34,161
She's a slave who will obey
whatever command I give her!

51
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:39,494
[laughs] And now,
Rukia, kill her!

52
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:45,461
-No, Rukia, don't do it!

53
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,394
[screams]

54
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:50,594
-Amazing.

55
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:53,594
So this is what it's like
to consume living souls.

56
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,528

-What's that?

-Hey, it's been awhile.

60
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:07,061
-You sure are a lot of trouble.

61

-Hey, this is amazing.

62
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:10,028
I'm actually flying.

63
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,761
-Orihime, this is a
rescue, not a joyride!

64
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:15,094
-Rukia, get her!

65
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:16,728
-Hado 31, Shakkaho!

66
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:20,828
-Ah!

67
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:22,128
-Orihime, look out!

68
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:23,494
-Ah!

69
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:25,394
Santen Kesshun!

70
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:31,661
Thank you, everyone.

71
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:33,261
KURODO: Here she
comes again, Orihime.

72
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:41,628
-Rukia, please stop attacking.

73
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:42,728
-Ha!

74
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,461
She won't respond to
your pathetic pleading.

75
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:46,861
She can't even hear
your voice right now.

76
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:48,528
-Hado 33.

77
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:49,694
-We need defense!

78
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:51,528
You've got to use your
Santen Kesshun again.

79
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:52,861
Now, Orihime!

80
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,561
-Sokatsui!

81
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:56,028
-Santen Kesshun!

82
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:59,461
I-- I reject!

83
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:02,228
Ah!

84
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,228
-Orihime!

85
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:05,461
-I'm all right.

86
00:06:05,494 --> 00:06:07,261
-I can't believe what
overwhelming power

87
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:08,261
she possesses.

88
00:06:08,294 --> 00:06:10,128
The force of her
attack is incredible!

89
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,394
MABASHI: You fools!

90
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:13,761
You're just now noticing that?

91
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:15,961
Rukia, continue attacking!

92
00:06:15,994 --> 00:06:19,928
-Hado 33, Sokatsui!

93
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:20,861
-Ah!

94
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:24,261
Keep your defenses up!

00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:30,228
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

-[grunt]

98
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,961
-Are-- are all of you all right?

99
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:38,294
-[groan] We all
managed to survive,

100
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:41,261
but we won't be able to keep
taking hits like that one.

101
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:44,861
-Ritz, draw out some
more of Rukia's power.

102
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:45,561
RITZ: Understood!

103
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:52,561
-Oh.

104
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:55,061
-[laughs]

105
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:02,528
-What?

106
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:04,028
What's this?

107
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:05,028
-Not bad.

108
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:14,994
-Watch out!

109
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:16,461
They're drawing
out Rukia's power

110
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:17,861
all the way to her limits.

111
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:21,061
They're just going to keep using
it until her body falls apart.

112
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:24,061
At this rate, Rukia will
soon be in great danger!

113
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:27,961
-Santen Kesshun-- Ah!

114
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:28,928
Please stop!

115
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:35,328
Oh, Rukia, stop.

116
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,794
Open your eyes.

117
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:42,661

-Orihime!

HINAGIKU: Defend yourself!

120
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:48,761
-[gasp] Santen Kessun!

121
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:52,161
I reject!

122
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:53,128
Sorry, Rukia?

123
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:55,694
-Why are you apologizing?

124
00:07:55,728 --> 00:08:00,061
Slice your opponent
with your Koten Zanshun!

125
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:01,428
ORIHIME: Yes, but--

126
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:04,061
-We are the embodiment
of your will, Orihime.

127
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:06,161
We're not able to do
anything unless you

128
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,894
make the decision for us.

129
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:11,828
-Here she comes again!

130
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:12,794
-No, I can't do it!

131
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:14,261
I can't use that on her?

132
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:14,961
-What?

133
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,161
Have you lost your mind?

134
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:21,361
[screams]

135
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:22,261
-Oh, quit your crying.

136
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,028
Are you trying to die?

137
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:25,928
-Orihime, are you all right?

138
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:28,328
-Yes, but--

139
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:31,994
MABASHI: [laughs]
How does it feel

140
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:35,094
knowing the only chance
you have to survive

141
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:38,594
is by hurting your friend.

142
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:40,328
-Ow, why'd you do that?

143
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:41,528
-Stop being so weak.

144
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:43,294
When are you going to
stop fighting defensively

145
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:44,428
and turn this thing around?

146
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:46,861
Huh?

147
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:50,328
-But this-- this is
Rukia I'm up against.

148
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,328
I can't do anything
to hurt Rukia.

149
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:53,794
Don't you understand?

150
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:55,794
I can't!

151
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,394
-Hado 33.

152
00:08:57,428 --> 00:08:57,894
Sokatsui!

153
00:09:17,094 --> 00:09:19,828
-Why don't you let me
take him for awhile?

154
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:20,794
-Thank you.

155
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:22,128
But I'll tell do it.

156
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,028
He's my friend, and so
he's my responsibility.

157
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:29,694
The poor kid has nothing to
do with all this madness.

158
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:33,594
And just look what happened
to him because of it.

159
00:09:33,628 --> 00:09:35,328
-All indications
are that the Bounts

160
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:38,228
are choosing human victims
completely randomly.

161
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,561
So there's really no need
for you to feel responsible.

162
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:42,461
-I am responsible!

163
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:45,361
Keigo's my friend, And I'm
responsible for keeping

164
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:47,461
him alive.

165
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:50,728
And that's just what I'll do.

166
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:52,061
Sorry.

167
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:55,228
-Just remember that
I'm not your enemy.

168
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,828
You and I have a common enemy
right now, and it's the Bounts.

169
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:02,761
We can't afford to
argue amongst ourselves.

170
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:05,994
Besides, I've lost someone, too.

171
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:11,494
We weren't exactly friends,
but he was important to me.

172
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:15,928
And so I truly understand how
you feel about your friend.

173
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:19,594
And besides all that, I'm not as
weak as you seem to think I am.

174
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:23,494
Let's go.

175
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:25,294
If you really intend
to save your friend,

176
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:29,428
it doesn't make any
difference who's carrying him.

177
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:33,394
-Yeah, you're right.

178
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:40,328
[groaning]

179
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:42,194
-Orihime, are you hurt?

180
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,528
-No, I'll be all right.

181
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,161
MABASHI: [laughs] I
can't get enough of this.

182
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:49,894
This is too good!

183
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:51,361
-These are serious wounds.

184
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:52,828
We can't take much more of this.

185
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,261
-How's everyone else?

186
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:55,228
Are you hurt?

187
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:56,694
-Yes, I'm hurt.

188
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:57,561
We're all hurt.

189
00:10:57,594 --> 00:10:58,894
My wound won't stop bleeding.

190
00:10:58,928 --> 00:10:59,761
This is horrible!

191
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:06,961
Orihime, you have to
use your Koten Zanshun.

192
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:09,928
Use it while I still
have some power.

193
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,161
-After I went all
the way to save her?

194
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:17,728
Far away, all the way
to the Soul Society.

195
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:23,194
Ichigo, and Uryu, and Chad,
too, and the Soul Reapers--

196
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:24,128
everyone.

197
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:27,461
We all did so much
to save Rukia.

198
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:28,894
We were injured.

199
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:30,728
Some of us were terribly.

200
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,894
But we never gave up.

201
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:34,428
I wasn't very much help.

202
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:38,328
But even so, I wanted more
than anything to save Rukia.

203
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:42,261
So how can I find myself
with this decision now?

204
00:11:42,294 --> 00:11:44,928
I know I've been repeating
the same thing over and over,

205
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:47,028
but I can't help it!

206
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:48,461
Rukia is my friend.

207
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:51,861
All I want is for us to
be together again-- having

208
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:58,161
our lunches together, studying
together, laughing together.

209
00:11:58,194 --> 00:12:01,794
And that's why--
that's why I can never

210
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:04,328
use my Koten Zanshun on her.

211
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:05,161
Huh?

212
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:07,094
-Then let's do this, Orihime.

213
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:08,194
-Huh?

214
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,194
-I think I may have
just the plan for this.

215
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:12,194
[laughs]

216
00:12:21,134 --> 00:12:21,767
ICHIGO: Urahara!

217
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,300
TESSAI: What's this?

218
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:28,934
Master!

219
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,400
-Who are you?

220
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:33,734
-My name is Izuru Kira,
Lieutenant of Squad Three.

221
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:34,734
ICHIGO: Urahara, please?

222
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,800
You've got to save
my friend Keigo.

223
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:43,267
-Come inside, won't you?

224
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,200
URAGARA: How is he?

225
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:52,300
-He's not well at all.

226
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:55,234
The strength of his soul
power is weakening--

227
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:57,300
unless we inject
each Ichigo's spirit

228
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,100
energy straight into him.

229
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:01,134
That just might be
enough to save him.

230
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:04,900
Mr. Tessai, do you have a Reishi
injection tool we can use?

231
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:05,667
-Yes, of course.

232
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,334
But what number?

233
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:10,867
-Number one, number three, and
number six too, just in case.

234
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,600
-Got it.

235
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:12,867
Coming right up.

236
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,400
-Isn't Renji Abarai
here as well?

237
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:21,500
-Yes, he's being treated
in the next room.

238
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,634
He's a tough one.

239
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,100
He'll probably recover quickly.

240
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:31,067
Unfortunately, the child he
rescued-- that's another story.

241
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,734
-Number one, number
three, and number six,

242
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:34,767
just as you've requested.

243
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,734
-Excellent.

244
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:36,700
Thanks a lot.

245
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:39,734
I'll get to work
on the process now.

246
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:40,934
Listen Orihime.

247
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,267
I'll tell you my plan.

248
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,700
Since attacking Rukia or the
doll that's attached to her

249
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:47,700
is not an option, how about
a direct attack on the Bount

250
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:49,100
who's controlling her?

251
00:13:49,134 --> 00:13:49,867
-Huh?

252
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,000
-Such an obvious solution.

253
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,967
I don't know why I
didn't think of it be--

254
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,267
-That isn't any good!

255
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,900
Bounts are human, too, so
that doesn't help us at all!

256
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:59,200
You know that I
can't attack humans.

257
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:01,267
-And you can't afford
to worry about that.

258
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,200
If we don't find a way
to defeat this Bount,

259
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:05,967
we're all going to be killed,
along with your friend Rukia.

260
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,200
And then the whole world
will be thrown into chaos!

261
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:09,634
-But still.

262
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,500
KURODO: Listen, it doesn't
have to be a fatal attack.

263
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:14,767
If you could inflict
enough damage on him,

264
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,834
render him unable
to use his doll,

265
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:19,967
then we can capture him
and heal his wounds later.

266
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,300
[laughter]

267
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:25,467
MABASHI: Well, are you finished
with your little strategy

268
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,267
meeting?

269
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,700
What have you decided to do?

270
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,600
-Well, Orihime?

271
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:30,667
-Tsubaki?

272
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,434
-You've finally gotten
up the nerve, huh?

273
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:35,967
-Finish them off, Rukia.

274
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,734
[gasping]

275
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:38,700
-Hurry!

276
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:41,000
What are you waiting
for, Orihime?

277
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:43,234
Do it now!

278
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:44,234
-Right.

279
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:47,167
Tsubaki, Koten Zanshun.

280
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,167
I reject!

281
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,134
I reject!

282
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:52,634
-Oh!

283
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,700
-[laughs] did you fools really
think I was just standing here

284
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,567
defenseless this whole time?

285
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Rukia will defend me.

286
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:06,867
She will fight for
me to the death.

287
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,167
Kill them.

288
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,667
[gasping]

289
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,634
KURODO: Look out!

290
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,634
-[gasp]

291
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,434
Where did you come from?

292
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,700
Who are you?

293
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:29,200
-[grunt]

294
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,700
-Now, then.

295
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:46,900
I'm going to lie down
for a little while.

296
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:49,000
You'll take care of everything?

297
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:49,934
-Yes, sir.

298
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,034
Leave it to me, Master.

299
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,234
-Fine, very well then.

300
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:03,367
-Who the hell are you?

301
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,234
-Squad Nine, Lieutenant
of 13 Court Guard Squads,

302
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,134
Shuhei Hisagi.

303
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,367
-A Soul Reaper, huh?

304
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,167
Am I supposed to be impressed?

305
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,634
-I've been sent here
to destroy the Bounts.

306
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:18,934
-Is that so?

307
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:21,467
-Well, let's see how far you
can get, Mr. Soul Reaper.

308
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,134
Go, Rukia.

309
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:26,134
-What's the meaning of this?

310
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:28,900
-Rukia's being controlled
by the Bount's doll?

311
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:30,867
-Doll?

312
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,767
I take it, then, that's this
Bount's special ability.

313
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,734
Very well.

314
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:42,167
Then it can't be helped.

315
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,100
-I'll have to cut Rukia as well.

316
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:45,234
-Oh, no!

317
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:46,600
-Go ahead and try it.

318
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:50,667
If the host body dies, there
is no shortage of other bodies

319
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700
I can attach my doll to.

320
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:56,500
In fact, why don't I just put
her into your body next time?

321
00:16:56,534 --> 00:17:03,234
[laughs evilly] Strike, Rukia.

322
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:05,534
Huh?

323
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,034
What are you doing?

324
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:07,967
Obey me!

325
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,100
-[grunting] Ori-- hime.

326
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:14,400

-Fire!

331
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:23,900

What are you talking
about, Rukia?

I can't.

-Don't you understand?

347
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:57,934
To let her die while still
holding onto her honor

348
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,900
and pride as a
Soul Reaper-- this

349
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:03,467
would be the greatest
show of sympathy and mercy

350
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,067
you could give her.

351

also wishes it.

-You don't have any choice.

You've go to settle
this one way or another.
