[theme music]

00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,367
-No matter what
you're planning, you

4
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:53,834
are too late to save the Bounts.

5
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:56,334
-Even if you're the last
one, I can still save you.

6
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:57,634
-No.

7
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:01,301
I think I'll kill you
right here and now.

8
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:02,234
[jingling]

[grunt]

10
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,367
-And with help from
the Soul Society,

11
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:15,634
you can build schools
down here as well.

12
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,367
You have my promise
that we will do all.

13
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:18,934
-Who's that lady?

14
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:20,867
-She's a Soul Reaper.

15
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,767
-You don't have to be afraid.

16
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:25,567
She came here from a place
called the Soul Society

17
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:27,701
in order to help and
protect the Bounts.

18
00:02:27,734 --> 00:02:29,167
-Remember.

19
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:31,434
These things will take time.

20
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:31,801
-Soul Reaper.

21
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,234
-Are you all right little one?

22
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:42,401
-Uh.

23
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:42,901
Uh.

24
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:47,234
Uh-- yes.

25
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,234
I'm-- I'm OK.

26
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:51,434
-You're a very young
Bount, aren't you?

27
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,501
-I guess so.

28
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:56,201
-I understand it's very
rare for Bount powers

29
00:02:56,234 --> 00:02:58,901
to have already awakened in
someone as young as you are.

30
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:00,767
You probably don't
realize it yet,

31
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:03,367
but your people are expecting
great things of you.

32
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,634
-Huh?

33
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,334
-Try to do your best.

34
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,867
We all need to work together
in order to help you

35
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:12,601
and the Bounts live a life
without worries or fear.

36
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:13,367
-Oh.

37
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,534
Well, I'll try.

38
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:22,501
-Shortly after that,
the Soul Reapers

39
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:28,134
left us and returned
to the Soul Society.

40
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,701
We were left behind to continue
building our underground city.

41
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:36,234
And to wait patiently for the
Soul Reapers to return one day.

42
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:38,467
Though I was still very
young, I did my best

43
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:39,634
to help the adults
with the work.

44
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:45,767
They had invested
all their hopes

45
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:49,167
in the Soul Reapers' promises.

46
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:53,401
But their dreams were about
to be cruelly shattered.

47
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,367
[cries]

48
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,634
-What was that?

49
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,534
-He's hurt pretty badly

50
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:00,467
-Seize them all then!

51
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:02,201
Kill any who resist!

52
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,601
[gasp]

00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:17,267
[screaming]

56
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:37,834
[panting]

57
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:51,767
-Keep searching!

58
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:53,234
Find that boy!

59
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:55,167
Don't let a single
Bount leave here alive!

60
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,134
Do you hear me?

61
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:56,501
-Yes sir!

62
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:57,567
-Yes sir!

63
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:58,367
-They won't get away!

64
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:05,367
[gasp]

65
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,401
-There you are!

66
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:06,834
Are you all right?

67
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:20,301
-She's helping me but
she's a Soul Reaper.

68
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,267
[quick footsteps]

69
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,834
-I'm going to stay here and try
to keep them busy for a while.

70
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,734
I want you to go on
ahead without me, OK?

71
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:35,701
-Huh?

72
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:36,667
-You can do it.

73
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:39,201
The other Bounts are
waiting for you outside.

74
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:41,701
I want you to escape
with your friends.

75
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:43,567
-But then they'll get you.

76
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:44,401
-Don't worry.

77
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:44,901
I'll be just fine.

78
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:50,467
Take this amulet.

79
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,767
The bounts have a great
deal of power within them.

80
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,401
This will help draw
out that power.

81
00:05:55,434 --> 00:05:56,867
I'm sorry, little one.

82
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,801
You'll be forced to
endure much suffering.

83
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:01,401
But I believe one day
you will rise again.

84
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:03,201
And to see that
day, you must live!

85
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:11,234
-Yes, but--

86
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,134
-You have to go!

87
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:13,234
Now!

88
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:15,567
-Hey!

89
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:18,567
-That was the last time
I saw that Soul Reaper.

90
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:29,901
-But I managed to
escape from the caves.

91
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:33,734
And with the few other
Bounts who survived

92
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,401
I returned to a
life of wandering.

93
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,767
But back above ground
we were like food

94
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:46,501
thrown into a den
of wild animals.

95
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:48,801
Those Bounts who
possessed spirit energy

96
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,601
were little more than
bait for the hollows.

97
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:56,701
Pursued by hollows,
my bitterness

98
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:59,167
toward the Soul Reapers
only grew stronger.

99
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:03,501
[scream]

100
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:05,501
[grunting]

101
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:13,434
-Huh?

102
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,434
[gasping]

103
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:29,801
[scream]

104
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:37,267
-Eh?

105
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:55,401
-Hey you?

106
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,867
What are you?

107
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:01,167
-I feel some power inside me.

108
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:07,401
-That was the first time
I felt the sensation

109
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:09,201
of merging with a doll.

110
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,701
[grunting]

111
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:12,801
-There had always been some
Bounts who could naturally

112
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:15,467
summon the power
to control dolls.

113
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:21,301
Alongside them I fought and
fought with everything I had.

114
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,401
By utilizing this
strength we could finally

115
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,667
confront the Soul Reapers.

116
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:29,501
I realized that
with this power we

117
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:31,334
could create a place
where the Bounts.

118
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:39,401
But my power gradually
changed the attitude

119
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:40,367
of the other Bounts.

120
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:48,367
And before long, I came to
realize that I was all alone.

121
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:51,267
Even so, I stayed
with my comrades.

122
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:53,601
That is, until that fateful day.

123
00:08:56,667 --> 00:09:01,634
That day the Bounts decided to
use the power of the Quincies

124
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,334
in order to enter
the Soul Society.

125
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:05,834
-Think about what you're saying.

126
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:08,167
You must be insane
to want to go there.

127
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:10,234
Why do you want to cling
to the Soul Reapers?

128
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:11,467
We don't need them!

129
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:13,867
With the power we have now we
can create our own paradise

130
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,767
in this world!

131
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,734
-We have to face
that in this world

132
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,334
the existence of the
Bounts is an abnormality.

133
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:23,834
Even if we used our power to
build a home for ourselves,

134
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,767
it would be doomed in the end.

135
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:29,134
For us it is safer to return to
the place where it all began.

136
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:31,667
-You must accept that for
Bounts the Soul Society

137
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:33,867
is that paradise.

138
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:36,601
-Not one of those fools
would listen to my pleas.

139
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:42,167
-And then the fighting began.

140
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:44,401
-Stay close!

141
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:46,367
[yelling]

142
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:50,534
-Make short work of them!

143
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:56,767
-We got them this time!

144
00:09:56,801 --> 00:10:01,834
-In the end, they were
destroyed by the Soul Reapers.

145
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:07,667
[scream]

146
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:09,301
[scream]

147
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,801
-At one point I was
injured by a blast.

148
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:15,334
And before I could do a
thing, the battle was over.

149
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:23,501
To some extent I felt the weaker
Bounts deserved their fate.

150
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:26,301
But I was not about forgive
the Soul Reapers or the Soul

151
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,834
Society for what they had done.

152
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:31,601
I gathered the strongest
surviving Bounts around me,

153
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:34,734
and vowed to destroy
the Soul Society.

154
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,801
The ability to activate and
use the dolls was sporadic.

155
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:42,401
I knew I would have to refine
and perfect the technique.

156
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,734
First, I set out to find
the most powerful Bounts.

157
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:57,601
In that process many
Bounts lost their lives.

158
00:10:57,634 --> 00:11:00,734
But the ones who
survived were truly

159
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:03,501
committed to attaining
great strength.

160
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:05,667
And I rose higher and higher.

161
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:09,367
All in order to one day
destroy the Soul Society.

162
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:15,467
To think I had somehow
forgotten all about you.

163
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:19,567
You who gave us so much false
hope and eternal suffering.

164
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:22,334
Perhaps it's because of
the Jokai crest's power.

165
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,801
But it doesn't matter now.

166
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,334
For all of the weak
and useless Bounts

167
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:30,901
who clung to your empty words,
and for the Soul Society who

168
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:34,501
used us so
mercilessly I will now

169
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:36,467
destroy everything
that you hold dear!

170
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:16,728
-It's you again.

171
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:17,528
That Quincy.

172
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:23,762
-Kariya, I'm the one you want.

173
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:25,062
Not her.

174
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:27,395
[chuckling]

175
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:27,962
-Come on now.

176
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:31,295
What can you do?

177
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:33,028
[gasp]

178
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:41,862
-Amazing.

179
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,595
The Quincy has completely
mastered his weapon.

180
00:12:48,762 --> 00:12:49,895
-How is this possible?

181
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:52,462
I thought you had already
reached your limit with that

182
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:55,795
accessory in the course
of your battle with Yoshi.

183
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:58,628
-This ancient artifact
amasses reishi very quickly

184
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:00,628
and then multiplies
it automatically.

185
00:13:00,662 --> 00:13:02,562
For a Quincy with
weakened spirit energy

186
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:04,628
it's quite useful.

187
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:06,995
In other words, it
accumulates reishi

188
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:11,462
even if the one wielding
it does nothing at all.

189
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:13,862
Up until now, all
I did was attack

190
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:15,628
and then adjust the power.

191
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,928
But doing that is a sure
way to make the artifact

192
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,628
reach its limit.

193
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:21,295
Unable to handle the
load of the reishi,

194
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:23,362
it would eventually
discharge spontaneously.

195
00:13:26,428 --> 00:13:29,795
However, there is
another method.

196
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:33,028
The artifact can be used
solely as an amplifier,

197
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:37,528
with me using my own power to
adjust and control the reishi.

198
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:40,595
Then the stress on
it is greatly reduced

199
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:44,695
and I can still battle
even in my present state.

200
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:47,595
It took the extreme battle
conditions with Yoshi

201
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:51,595
to help me realize it.

202
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:53,528
-He said that he's
using the accessory

203
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:56,628
because he lost his
own spirit energy.

204
00:13:56,662 --> 00:13:58,662
It's amazing that
he can do all this

205
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:00,895
in such a weakened condition.

206
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:04,428
[chuckling]

207
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:07,695
-What are you laughing about?

208
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:10,562
-I'm just wondering why
with such great power

209
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:12,995
you're fighting on the
side of the Soul Reapers.

210
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:15,395
I thought they were the
Quincies' greatest enemies.

211
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:17,562
-Don't get the wrong idea.

212
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:20,462
I'm certainly no ally
of the Soul Reapers.

213
00:14:20,495 --> 00:14:22,028
The fact is I'm here
because I intend

214
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,795
to stop this senseless fight.

215
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:25,295
-Hah.

216
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:27,962
Noble but foolish words.

217
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:30,628
-Yoshino gave her life
to try and stop you.

218
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,795
Do you know what you said to me?

219
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:36,928
She said, Kariya not only
hates the Soul Reapers,

220
00:14:36,962 --> 00:14:39,595
he hates the Bounts too.

221
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,062
And someday his consuming
hatred will end up

222
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:45,295
destroying all off us.

223
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:47,928
Even his own people.

224
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:50,828
Yoshino understood
what you were.

225
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:52,628
She knew that everything
you'd been doing

226
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:54,762
was meaningless to the
Bounts right from the start.

227
00:14:57,795 --> 00:14:59,762
In the end no one
could stop you.

228
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:01,962
Not her or any of the others.

229
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:03,862
Maybe it's too late now.

230
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:07,962
Just the same, I'm going to
give it everything I've got.

231
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:09,628
-You won't stop me either.

232
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:10,862
-We'll see.

233
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:13,795
-Hm.

234
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:17,695
[kiai]

235
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:19,662
[grunting]

236
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:37,928
-I've got you now.

237
00:15:37,962 --> 00:15:38,895
-Don't bet on it.

238
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:43,895
[kiai]

239
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,928
-The quality of the reishi
here in the Seireitei

240
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:56,728
is much higher than
in the Rukon district.

241
00:15:56,762 --> 00:15:59,795
As long as I have this ability
to continually regenerate

242
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:02,995
myself, your attacks
are pointless.

243
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:03,962
-Hm.

244
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:05,962
Huh?

245
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:07,662
[gasp]

246
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:09,862
-A crack in his artifact!

247
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:13,395
-You may have reduced the stress
you're putting on your bow.

248
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:14,828
But it would it's
still weakening just

249
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:16,662
when you need it most.

250
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:18,495
-It's not a problem.

251
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:19,995
The bow will certainly
hold together

252
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:22,528
long enough for me to
bring you down, Kariya.

253
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:24,695
You really think you can do it?

254
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:28,428
I have all the reishi within
the Seireitei at my disposal.

255
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:30,762
-And so do I.

256
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,628
[grunting]

257
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:43,028
[kiai]

258
00:16:46,728 --> 00:16:48,862
-It doesn't matter how
much power your arrows have

259
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,495
if you can't aim more
accurately than that.

260
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:53,428
And you don't seem to
have sufficient power

261
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:56,728
for another kind of attack.

262
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:00,362
Plus, it looks to me like
you don't have much time

263
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,762
before your weapon comes apart.

264
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:06,895
-If things keep
going like this--

265
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:16,362
[gasp]

266
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:17,862
-What's the matter?

267
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:19,328
Your aim is getting even worse.

268
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:27,462
[kiai]

269
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:29,428
[grunting]

270
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:36,695
-This is it for you, Quincy.

271
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:37,395
-Kariya!

272
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:44,962
-What?

273
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:46,495
[grunt]

274
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:48,362
-What's the source of
this spiritual pressure?

275
00:17:51,962 --> 00:17:53,762
Why you!

276
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:54,462
-Huah!

277
00:17:58,395 --> 00:18:00,395
-Back away from him!

278
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:00,995
-Do it!

279
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:01,662
Shoot him now!

280
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:02,728
Quickly!

281
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:03,562
-Uh.

282
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:04,462
-Let go!

283
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:05,662
-Hurry up!

284
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,828
-But I'll hit you.

285
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:07,628
-Forget about me.

286
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:09,995
Shoot now while
you have a chance!

287
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:12,428
Right now I'm intercepting
the power of the Jokai crest

288
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:15,495
and using it to increase
my spiritual pressure.

289
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,595
But I can't keep it
up for very long!

290
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:21,662
-No I can't-- I can't
risk hitting you!

291
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:25,328
-Just shoot!

292
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:27,928
Don't you dare let this
Bount add to his crimes.

293
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:38,895
Yes.

294
00:18:38,928 --> 00:18:41,695
That's how it must be.

295
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:42,495
-Let go of me, damn you!

296
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:58,828
-I'm sorry, Rantao.

297
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:01,762
Tell me you're all right.

298
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:04,695
-Where's Kariya?

299
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,928
-I he's still alive.

300
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:09,295
-Oh no.

301
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:11,762
You fired at half
strength, didn't you?

302
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:12,528
-Yes.

303
00:19:12,562 --> 00:19:13,962
But don't worry.

304
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:17,328
Because now I'm going
to finish him off.

305
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:19,795
[groaning]

306
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:23,928
-Hu-- hurry, Uryu.

307
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:28,795
[painful groaning]

308
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:31,728
[screaming]

309
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:32,995
-What's this?

310
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:34,462
Her spiritual pressure
is out of control!

311
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,828
This must be a result
of the Jokai crest power

312
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:42,562
she intercepted earlier.

313
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:44,628
If I don't do something,
her body will disintegrate!

314
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:49,428
I know.

315
00:19:49,462 --> 00:19:53,295
I can use the artifact's
reishi accumulation.

316
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:55,528
Rantao, hang on!

317
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:58,562
I think I can use the artifact
to remove the unstable spirit

318
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:00,495
energy inside you.

319
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:01,628
-No!

320
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:04,562
Don't you dare do that.

321
00:20:04,595 --> 00:20:08,795
We both know that you Soshingu
is almost at it's limit.

322
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:11,895
You have to use its power
to destroy Kariya and not

323
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:13,662
for anything else!

324
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,062
You don't have to
worry about me.

325
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:18,562
This is no surprise
to me, Quincy.

326
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:21,328
I used this power knowing full
well that this would happen.

-No more talk!

329

You've got to hurry.

This is your only chance!

We'd better go.

00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,328
-You think you can
just walk away?

347
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:30,728
You had your chance to kill me.

348
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:35,495
But you chose not to take it.

349

Now it's your life that's about
to come to an end instead.

You sick creep!

you, but she's a he.
