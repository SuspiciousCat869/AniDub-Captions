00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:10,766
Licht Regen!

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,800
[sobbing]
Please, help me!
Ichigo, please!

3
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:19,566
Impossible!

4
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:11,362
Resurrecion Segunda
Etapa...

5
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:21,095
[struggling]

6
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:27,862
So you have seen my
imposing form and you
still have the will
to fight?

7
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,529
Very well.

8
00:02:34,562 --> 00:02:36,095
You will understand!

9
00:02:54,562 --> 00:02:57,495
You are a fool!...
...Ichigo Kurosaki.

10
00:02:57,529 --> 00:02:58,695
[grunting]

11
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:05,062
Why would you challenge
an enemy you can't
possibly defeat?

12
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:07,962
Most beings want to
preserve their life.

13
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:10,062
I can't comprehend this.

14
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:33,129
You must be doing all of
this because of what you
humans call 'heart'.

15
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:37,495
If so, it would seem to
be more of a liability
than a strength.

16
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:42,195
What stupidity. Because
you possess this antiquated
concept of 'heart',

17
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,329
you have chosen
to lose your life.

18
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:57,395
I didn't decide to fight
you because I can see
myself winning this
battle.

19
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:02,962
The only reason I
continue to fight...

20
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:04,962
... is because I
have to win!

21
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,195
Have it your way.

22
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:21,662
[grunting]

23
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:27,629
[panting]

24
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:51,329
So you've come.
How nice.

25
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:58,795
[gasping]
Ichigo!

26
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:02,695
You're just in time.
Watch closely.

27
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,162
[gasping]

28
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:10,129
Here is the man to whom
you've entrusted all your
hope. Bear witness as his
life comes to an end.

29
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:16,129
[gasping]

30
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:18,162
[screaming]
NO!

31
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:39,729
[trembling]

32
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,795
[gasping]

33
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:11,295
[screaming]
NO!

34
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:18,629
[panting]

35
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:28,529
[panting and crying]

36
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:33,795
It's useless..

37
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,462
Even if you could
reach him...

38
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,762
...it would be wasted
effort on your part.

39
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:42,295
Your powers are not
nearly strong enough
to keep him alive.

40
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:47,462
Ichigo. Ichigo!

41
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:51,662
You should save your
energy. Forget him.

42
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:54,229
Huh!

43
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:04,629
[panting]

44
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:05,829
[grunting]

45
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,129
Licht Regen!

46
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:20,929
[screaming]

47
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:31,262
Mm!

48
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:36,329
Hmm.

49
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,329
How unexpected...

50
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:49,495
I studied everyone
closely allied to Ichigo
Kurosaki. And of all
who surrounded him, I

51
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,329
presumed you were the one
who was the calmest.

52
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:54,729
I am calm.

53
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:58,329
As a result, I have
the best chance of
stopping you.

54
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:03,095
[panting]

55
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:04,529
Ichigo!!!

56
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,562
[gasping]

57
00:08:12,162 --> 00:08:13,729
[gasping]

00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:18,762
[trembling]

59
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:42,062
Just as I feared, those
wings will deflect everything
if I keep on attacking from
a distance.

60
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:46,562
But if I get any closer,
I'll give him the advantage.

61
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,362
I have to buy Orihime
some time, so she can
heal Ichigo.

62
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:56,295
I've gotta keep this
guy engaged.

63
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:02,929
[grunting]

64
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:12,762
[gasping]

65
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:17,029
Where is he? Damn it!

66
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:28,229
[struggling]

67
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:31,495
It's no surprise that his
strength is overwhelming.

68
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:37,162
I need to keep my
distance and find another
way to attack him.

69
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:40,595
He must have an opening
somewhere.

70
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:43,529
Is that all you have?

71
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:52,129
When you first began
attacking me, I observed
exactly how fast you were
able to move.

72
00:09:53,062 --> 00:09:57,562
You're merely human.
And that seems to limit
your capabilities.

73
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:01,229
Oh, I'm just getting
started.

74
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:10,429
[gasping]

75
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:13,962
Is this supposed
to harm me?

76
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:16,195
[gasping]

77
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:34,062
[crying]

78
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,862
What should I do?

79
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:38,529
What can I do?

80
00:10:39,462 --> 00:10:43,729
Somehow, I thought
everything was going
to be all right.

81
00:10:43,762 --> 00:10:49,695
I thought Ichigo was so
strong. He was unbeatable,
that he was going to win.

82
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:55,529
I was blinded by my faith
in him, and didn't realize...

83
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:57,629
... that I was wrong!

84
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:07,829
What should I do? What
should I do?

85
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:11,095
[sobbing]
Tell me Ichigo!
What can I do?!

86
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:14,995
[grunting]

87
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:16,495
Uryu?

88
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:21,495
[struggling]

89
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:27,062
There's nothing to worry
about. I am gonna stay
in this fight no matter
what.

90
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:31,962
I'll cover you. Do what
you can to help Ichigo.

91
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:34,895
[gasping]
Uryu!

92
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,162

What should I do?

100
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:17,962
Help me, Ichigo!
What can I do?!

101
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:24,362
You can't leave me alone
like this! I'm not
prepared! I don't know
how to fight this

102
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:29,695
opponent, he's too
strong! I need your
help, Ichigo!

103
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:36,329
I've never had to face
this kind of power by
myself before! You've
always been there when I

104
00:12:36,362 --> 00:12:40,429
needed you! I need you
now! Please!

105
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:50,195
[sobbing]
Please help me.
Ichigo, please!

106
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:14,217
[gasping]

107
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:26,117
Please help me!
Ichigo, please!

108
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,284
Orihime...

109

[sobbing]

110
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:44,417
She's calling me...
She's in trouble...
She needs me.

111
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,217
Help, Ichigo!

112
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:53,750
Get up... Get up...

113
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,084
I have to get up!

114
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:00,184
I promise...

115
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,017
I will...

116
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,317
I will protect you!

117
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:11,017

[trembling]

121
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:29,417
Is that... Ichigo?

122
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:32,250
This can't be.

123
00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:36,750
You can't be alive.

124
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,150
What is that form?

125
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:48,717
Who are you?

126
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,917
[gasping]

127
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:55,484
[screaming]

128
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,050
Orihime!

129
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:02,484
Did you not hear me?

130
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:06,117
I asked you to identify
yourself.

131
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:13,684
[roaring]

132
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,084
It appears to me... you
can't understand what I'm
saying.

133
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,050
[gasping]

134
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,684
That was undoubtedly the
blast of a Cero.

135
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,484
And it was powerful
enough to counter my
Cero Oscuras.

136
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,617
He may resemble a Hollow,
but he can't have the
powers!

137
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,050
There's no way a human
could discharge a Cero!

138
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:00,450
That's enough.

139
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:11,450
He diffused Cero Oscuras
for a second time!

140
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:29,950
[roaring]

141
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,050
I can't believe it. He's
so powerful!

142
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,750
Is that really... Ichigo?

143
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,317
[struggling]

144
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:04,550
[gasping]

145
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:17,284
My greatest strength is
not in my attack. It's
in my ability to
regenerate.

146
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,417
And I'm unique.

147
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:27,917
In exchange for immense
strength, most Arrancars
lose much of their
ability to regenerate at

148
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,784
ultra high speed.

149
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,984
I alone am able to
regenerate all of my body

150
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:36,850
parts at high speed.
Except for two areas...

151
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,217
...My brain and internal
organs.

152
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:47,317
I don't know how you took
on that form, but it
won't be enough of an
advantage.

153
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,817
You saw what happened
when you tore off my arm.

154
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,917
I was able to regenerate
it quite easily.
Defeating me will
be impossible...

155
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,517
...As you're about to
discover!

156
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:06,017
Lanza del Relampago!

157
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:13,484
Don't move. Stay right
where you are.

158
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:19,017
If possible, I'd prefer
not to unleash this at
close range.

159
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:49,784
[struggling]

160
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:54,950
I'll try again. It's
always been very
difficult to control.

161
00:18:55,917 --> 00:19:00,017
Are you kidding? He can
fire a technique like
that, multiple times?

162
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:05,984
What?!

163
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,984
He slipped completely
past my Pesquisa!

164
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:16,417
That wasn't a Flash Step
he did just now! It was a
Sonido!

165
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:33,650
Uh!

166
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,817
I can't believe how fast
he's moving. I can't
follow him with my eyes.

167
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,850
Ichigo...

168
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,217
Come back here!

169
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:32,084
Am I supposed to be
intimidated because you
can throw something heavy
at me? Nice try.

170
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,717
Uh!

171
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,884
Impossible!

172
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,984
With his bare hand?!

173
00:20:57,517 --> 00:20:58,717
[growling]

174
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,717
[gasping]

175
00:21:18,517 --> 00:21:19,850
[gasping]

176
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:21,617
Is it over?

177
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:27,917
Damn it all. I never
thought it was possible...

178
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,017
... to be defeated by
a Hollowfied human.

179
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:34,884
It's completely...
ludicrous.

180
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,750
[gasping]

181
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:49,617
I should have known
there'd be no mercy.

182
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:52,284
So typical of a Hollow.

183
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:57,217
Go ahead. After all, I
lost to you.

184
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,017
My life no longer has any
meaning.

185
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:02,784
Do it.

186
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:47,352
Because you possess
'heart', you envy.

187
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,052
Because you possess
'heart', you devour.

188
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:50,686
Because you possess
'heart', you rob.

189
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,052
Because you possess
'heart', you irritate.

190
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:53,786
Because you possess
'heart', you despise.

191
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:55,386
Because you possess
'heart', you anger.

192
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:57,119
Because you possess
'heart'...

193
00:23:57,152 --> 00:23:59,452
...I desire everything
about you.
