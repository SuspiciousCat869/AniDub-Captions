NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

4
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:52,930
who was kidnapped
by the Arrancars,

5
00:01:52,964 --> 00:01:56,230
Ichigo, Chad, Uryu,
Rukia, and Renji

6
00:01:56,264 --> 00:02:00,197
have all snuck into Hueco
Mundo, the realm of the hollows.

7
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,964
The journey to Aizen's
fortress, Las Noches,

8
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,397
has been hard fought, as
our heroes have struggled

9
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,864
against endless attacks
from the Arrancar forces.

10
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,864
-All right, let's go, Renji.

11
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:16,764
-Hey, you're not the boss, here.

12
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:17,664
Smart ass.

13
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:22,130
[roaring fire sound]

-(TOGETHER)Yee-ah.

15
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:25,697
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
in Las Noches,

16
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,764
Aizen has shown
Orihime the Hogyoku

17
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,964
as a sign of good faith.

18
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:33,330
This has prompted Orihime
to make a decision.

19
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:37,297
ORIHIME (VOICEOVER): Thank you,
Ichigo, for coming to save me.

20
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,730
But now I know what
I have to do here.

21
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:45,164
It's something
that only I can do.

22
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:49,297
I have to use my power to
erase the Hogyoku's existence.

23
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:53,764
NARRATOR: Upon
entering Las Noches,

24
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:55,897
our heroes find themselves
in a room filled

25
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,230
with disturbing spiritual
pressures and five doorways

26
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:01,397
with five separate
paths into the fortress.

27
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,164
At Rukia's request, they split
up to investigate each one.

28
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:06,564
[smacking]

29
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:09,564
-As we approach the
crucial battlegrounds,

30
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:12,230
believe that our blades
will not shatter,

31
00:03:12,264 --> 00:03:15,164
believe that our
resolve will not weaken.

32
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:18,064
Though our paths may
diverge, our iron hearts

33
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,397
will remain together.

34
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,697
Swear that though the land
itself may break asunder,

35
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,497
we will come back here alive.

[rushing wind]

37
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:40,864

[panting]

39
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,064

[sound of running feet]

41
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:08,997
-[panting] Huh?

42
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,997
-Ichigo!

43
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,630
-Eh?

44
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:11,530
-Ichigo!

45
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:12,164
-What the?

46
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:13,030
No.

47
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:14,230
-Wait.

48
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:15,130
-I can't.

49
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:16,430
You're not supposed to be here.

50
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,297
Go away.

51
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,530
-Don't leave me, Ichigo.

52
00:04:19,564 --> 00:04:21,730
Nel wants to come.

53
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:22,264
-What a pest.

54
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,430
OK, fine.

55
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:28,130
If that's the way
you want to play.

56
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:31,564
-Ooh, super-acceleration.

57
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:32,064
-Huah!

58
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,964
Huah, uhn.

59
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:37,797
Ahh.

60
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,430
-I wanted to see you, Ichigo.

61
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:42,297
I missed you. [sobbing]

62
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:42,864
-What?

63
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:44,130
Are you nuts?

64
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:45,030
-Ichigo.

65
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:46,764
[sobs]

66
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:47,997
-Give me a break, will you?

67
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,664
-[crying]

68
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:50,464
-Stop crying.

69
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:51,464
-Ichigo.

70
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:53,464
-What happened to
all the others?

71
00:04:53,497 --> 00:04:54,930
-Oh, you mean Bawabawa?

72
00:04:54,964 --> 00:04:56,430
I left him outside.

73
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,564
He wouldn't be happy in
a building like this.

74
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:01,597
To live, he has to
eat sand all day long.

75
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,097
-I didn't mean him.

76
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,097
I meant, you know,
Don what's-his-face?

77
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:07,997
Uh, no.

78
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,764
Not him. [buzzer]

79
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:11,030
-Nel's confused.

80
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:12,330
Who?

81
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:15,464
-Come on, those guys who are
always traveling with you?

82
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:17,197
-Oh, Dondochakka and Pesche?

83
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,730
They're right behind, now.

84
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:20,930
They follow Nel everywhere.

85
00:05:20,964 --> 00:05:25,264
[hollow footsteps]

86
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:26,697
-They're missing!

87
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,130
Nel's lost them.

88
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:29,264
This is horrible.

89
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:31,464
Nel never goes anywhere
without those two guys.

90
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,164
Nel's doomed.

91
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,397
Nel won't make it.

92
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,264
-You know, I think the
only thing lost around here

93
00:05:36,297 --> 00:05:38,597
is your mind.

94
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,097
Eyuh.

95
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:46,564
-Ichigo, is there
something wrong?

96
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,730
-Be quiet.

97
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,964
-Mm.

98
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:50,797
-Come on out.

99
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,830
You might as well come out here!

100
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,497
I know you're somewhere
in the corridor!

101
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:03,430
Eyuh.

102
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,397
Damn.

103
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,630
You're not getting away.

104
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:13,397
-Heh, who said I wanted to.

105
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,164
Hyuh?

106
00:06:15,197 --> 00:06:15,964
Doh!

107
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:16,464
Eeah!

108
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:30,797
-Um, hey, are you all right?

109
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,064
-Yee-ah!

110
00:06:32,097 --> 00:06:32,997
-(TOGETHER) Ahh!

111
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:33,564
-Hieah!

112
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:35,364
Rhuhh-hey ahh.

113
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:36,297
Ha ha.

114
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,264
Ahh hoo.

115
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,697
Whoo.

116
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,064
Yee ahh hah.

117
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:43,430
[coughing]

118
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:45,897
-Uhhh.

119
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,397
-Ta da. [coughing]

120
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:00,792
-Hm?

121
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:04,726
What's with you two mocosos?

122
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,892
Aren't you impressed?

123
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,826
Why are you giving me that face?

124
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:08,959
-Well, I mean.

125
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:11,159
-Do not play stupid
with me, nino.

126
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:13,526
Tell me why you're
giving me that face!

127
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,392
-What's your problem?

128
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:16,526
And stop and repeating yourself.

129
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,792
-Are you trying to tell
me you're not completely

130
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:21,859
blown away by my magnificent
entrance just now?

131
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:23,992
-Magnificent entrance?

132
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,426
Excuse me, but didn't
you just slip and fall?

133
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:27,126
-What?

134
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:28,092
That was all planned.

135
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,692
How can you pretend
to be so calm?

136
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:31,392
-Believe me, I'm not pretending.

137
00:07:31,426 --> 00:07:32,992
I don't find you
all that impressive.

138
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:34,159
-You're trying to rattle me.

139
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:35,492
I see what you're doing.

140
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:38,692
Did you order the girl to
act unimpressed as well?

141
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,292
-Uh, ahh.

142
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:42,159
-Heh.

143
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:43,392
Well it won't work.

144
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:45,892
I am secure enough to
know that not everybody is

145
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:47,592
going to react in
the proper way.

146
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:49,826
And it hardly matters
to me, since you're both

147
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:50,592
about to be killed.

148
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,492
Now, prepare
yourself soul reaper.

149
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:59,326
I am know as Dordoni
the Magnificent.

150
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,859
I am Arrancar number 103.

151
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:03,859
And it is my job to destroy you.

152
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:04,826
-Tortolloni the what?

153
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,626
Is that some kind of pasta?

154
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:08,026
-No, you fool.

155
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,559
It has nothing to do with food.

156
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:10,826
Dordoni not Tortolloni!

157
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:13,892
Leave me a little respect, nino!

158
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,992
Now listen up and pay attention.

159
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:17,826
I hate repeating myself.

160
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:21,026
My name's Dordoni, and
I'm Arrancar number 103.

161
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:22,192
-103?

162
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:23,159
Oh, brother.

163
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:24,592
That's a pretty high
number isn't it?

164
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:26,026
-Yeah, really high.

165
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:27,659
-Didn't you say they
were only supposed

166
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:28,926
to have two digit numbers.

167
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,759
-That's right, two digits max.

168
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:31,892
And you know what?

169
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:34,292
I've never even heard of
one with three digits.

170
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:35,459
-Stop that.

171
00:08:35,492 --> 00:08:36,759
What are you two whispering
about over there?

172
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:37,259
-Ahh.

173
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:38,559
-Huh?

174
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:39,726
-How dare you?

175
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,759
I can see that you
have no respect for me.

176
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,059
-I'm sorry.

177
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:46,726
It's just that you
seem really weak.

178
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,526
What was that?

179
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,659
Take me on, and we'll
see who's the weaker one,

180
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:52,026
you little smart-ass.

181
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:54,826
You're going to pay for that
mouth of yours, just you wait.

182
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:57,259
Prepare to be amazed
at my strength.

Well, now, what's the problem?

You're not even close
to landing a blow.

203

You're way out of
your league, nino.

that time, Ichigo!

-Eyuh.

233
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:37,059
-It Nel's mask, so it
didn't hurt at all.

234
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:38,859
You should have seen
the look on your face.

235
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:40,926
-Ah, you little brat.

236
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,392
-You are not a bad
for an amateur, nino.

237
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:44,959
But guess what?

238
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:48,859
Most of your moves were revealed
in that skirmish we had.

239
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:50,992
With those skills, you
won't last very long.

240
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,959
ISHIGO: What a
freaking pain you are.

241
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:55,459
I was actually
worried about you!

242
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:56,826
-Hm?

243
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:59,026
-Nel wouldn't have done it if
you hadn't made fun of Nel.

244
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,326
It's your fault, Ichigo.

245
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,659
-You weren't supposed to
be here in the first place.

246
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:04,192
-Pay attention to me!

247
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:05,459
-(TOGETHER) Huh?

248
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,859
-Dude, I didn't even know
you were still conscious.

249
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:09,759
-Why are you awake?

250
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:10,926
-Because I'm amazing!

251
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,659
A little rock would
never hurt me!

252
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:14,892
-That's great.

253
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:16,726
So how about we stop
all this fighting,

254
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,492
and you let us get on our way?

255
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:19,392
We have things to do.

256
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:20,859
And we're kind of in a hurry.

257
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:22,326
-You are not going anywhere.

258
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:24,526
You don't have the
power to get past me.

259
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,626
Maybe you didn't notice,
but none of your attacks

260
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:27,992
were effective.

261
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:31,059
I don't know where you come up
with this superior attitude.

262
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:32,759
But you're annoying me!

263
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:37,459
-I was hoping to
avoid this, but I

264
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:39,892
guess I'll have to
start fighting for real.

265
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:40,392
-Ahhh!

266
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:43,392
-Yeee-ah.

267
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:52,159
-Ah, Kaname, I see you're
spying on our intruders.

268
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:55,859
That's not a very
sporting thing to do.

269
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:57,459
-Don't be a hypocrite.

270
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,426
You only came down here
to chat because you

271
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,659
were interested in how they were
progressing, the same as me.

272
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:04,659
Isn't that right, Gin?

273
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,592
-I was just joking.

274
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,226
Don't get so upset.

275
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,726
You take this much
too seriously.

276
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,359
Hm.

277
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:15,859
-Haaah.

278
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:20,659
-(PERTURBED) Oho.

279
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:25,426
Kaname, do something about
this crazy kid, will you?

280
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,159
-That'll do, Wonderweiss.

281
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:29,859
-Haaah.

282
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:30,359
Ahhh.

283
00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:35,092
-That kid's a strange one.

284
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:38,159
But he's really taken a
liking to you, hasn't he?

285
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,092
-I believe those
with pure intentions

286
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,892
are drawn to each other.

287
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:43,859
The only problem
is I haven't quite

288
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:47,526
figured out what his intentions
are, pure or otherwise.

289
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,659
-Not being a person of
pure intentions, myself,

290
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:53,259
I can see why he doesn't
get along with me.

291
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:58,592
-That must explain why your very
presence makes him so nervous.

292
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:01,226
Come take a look at
what's happening.

293
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:03,126
The five of them have split up.

294
00:13:07,126 --> 00:13:08,226
-Oh, you're right.

295
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,292
But that's good.

296
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:10,726
They'll have a lesser
chance of success

297
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,626
if they're each on their own.

298
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,026
I wonder if these
kids had any idea

299
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:17,359
as to the extent of
their strength levels?

300
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:19,126
-Indeed.

301
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,859
It looks like they've stumbled
onto an interesting area

302
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:24,192
of Hueco Mundo.

303
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:28,626
-Ah, yes, they're passing
through the Den of Tres Cifras.

304
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:33,059
-Tsuh.

305
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:34,559
-Ichigo!

306
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,026
-Eyuh.

307
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,992
What the hell?

308
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:38,992
How did he do that?

309
00:13:42,226 --> 00:13:45,526
-Tres Cifras, ohhh.

310
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,559
-Yes.

311
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,059
Since you haven't
been here very long,

312
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:50,792
I'm sure nobody's bothered
to tell you about it.

313
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:52,159
Here's what it means.

314
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,392
-Getsuga tensho!

315
00:13:57,426 --> 00:14:00,259
-Tres cifras is three digits.

316
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:03,292
If you mean an Arrancar
with a three digit number,

317
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:07,992
that being is inferior
and has been demoted.

318
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:10,826
That means it's done
something unforgivable

319
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:13,292
and been stripped of its rank.

320
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:15,059
All those with the
three digit number

321
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:17,092
are called Privaron Espada.

322
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:17,592
-Eyuh.

323
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:24,092
-Surprised are you?

324
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:27,792
Didn't your mother ever
teach you the lesson?

325
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:31,826
You should never judge people
by their outward appearance,

326
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:33,326
foolish nino tonto.

327
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:45,814
-Gah.

328
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:57,681
Uhn.

329
00:14:57,714 --> 00:14:59,181
Eyah.

330
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:02,181
Heyah.

331
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:03,648
Uhn.

332
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:04,148
Hrm.

DORDONI: We are a group
known as the Privaron Espada.

00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,148
-No.

335
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,014
What?

336
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:23,614
-Pay attention, soul
reaper, Privaron Espada.

337
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:29,848
It means one who has lost
his place as a full Espada.

338
00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:34,614
In other words, any Arrancar
with a three digit number,

339
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:39,014
including me, used to be
a member of the Espada.

340
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,148
We're the most
powerful group here,

341
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,148
other than the current Espada.

342

strong I am know, nino.

00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:38,214
DORDONI: Oh, come
now, you didn't

00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,081

extent of my power, did you?

00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:42,481
-Uhn.

364

Ahuh?

-Hoo-ah.

00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,414
-Damn it.

00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:46,914
-Yee-ah!

Eyuh.

377
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:15,381
-Not very impressive.

378
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:16,981
You shouldn't have
to look down to find

379
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:19,281

Eyahhh.

Your reactions are slow.

387
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:36,414
Your defense is weak.

388
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:39,448
You can't even deal with a
sudden change in your stance.

389
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:41,248
I cannot fight with you.

390
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:45,314
I mean, really, it's like facing
off with some kind of baby.

391
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:46,814
Pathetic.

-Uh.

00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:48,781

[gasping]

395
00:17:57,248 --> 00:18:00,314
-You're about to
be destroyed, nino.

396
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:03,448
Go ahead, use your bankai.

397
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,848
-Ehh, ahh.

398
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,781
-Believe me, I won't
think badly of you.

399
00:18:08,814 --> 00:18:10,848
But if you don't
use your bankai,

400
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,148
you're never going to
be able to challenge me.

-Ehh, uhn.

00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:17,114
No.

403
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:18,814
I won't do it.

404
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,514
-Why not?

405
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:25,081
-Because I have a mission,
and I won't compromise it.

406
00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:29,914
Privaron Espada aren't
Espada anymore now, are they?

407
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:31,248
-That's correct.

408
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:33,281
-Well there's your answer!

409

Hyuh!

410
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,348
Right now, I have one goal.

411
00:18:38,381 --> 00:18:40,881
I have to defeat
all of the Espada.

-Hoo-ah.

419
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:54,681
-I can't afford to waste my
bankai against just anyone,

420
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,981
especially if
they're not Espada.

Hurr ah-yah!

So I'll just have to defeat you
without the use of my bankai.

I understand how you feel, nino.

going to tell you something.
