<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>Yes, it's true. This is</i>
<i>an inexcusable breach,</i>
<i>isn't it, Hogyoku?</i>

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,800
I'll show you my Final...

3
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:18,433
Getsugatensho!

4
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:25,015
<i>Impossible!</i>

5
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,081
<i>He caught it?!</i>

6
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,481
[Ichigo]
You look surprised.

7
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,515
Does that scare you?

8
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:36,615
That something you can't
comprehend, happened right
before your eyes?

9
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,048
And you couldn't stop it?

10
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,681
[chuckling]
Heh heh heh heh he.

11
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:45,081
Hado Number 90!
Kurohitsugi!

12
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:53,048
[Aizen]
A full incantation Kurohitsugi
performed by one who transcends
both Hollow and Soul Reaper!

13
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:10,815
[Ichigo]
You still haven't realized it,
have you?

14
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:16,515
The power I have is
greater than the power you
possess, even right now.

15
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:21,715
[gasp]

16
00:03:39,515 --> 00:03:40,915
[Ichigo]
What an odd reaction.

17
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:47,481
When I backed away from
you in our last battle,
you stopped and asked me why.

18
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:50,315
Now you're doing the
exact same thing.

19
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:53,381
So let me ask you
the same question.

20
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:56,481
Aizen, why did you
back away just now?

21
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:03,415
I get it now.

22
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:07,181
You're pleased that you
stopped my sword, aren't you?

23
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:13,648
<i>I assume, then,</i>
<i>that you're also</i>
<i>pleased that you</i>
<i>overcame my Kido!</i>

24
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:20,048
I suppose that you're
equally pleased that you
put a scar on my body!

25
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:24,181
Well don't be so full
of yourself! Human!

26
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:27,381
Rauughh!

27
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:36,448
[heartbeat]

28
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:40,748

29
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:46,881
[heartbeat intensifies]

30
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:56,915
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>[big roar]</i>
<i>Rwaaaaaaaaa!!</i>

31
00:04:56,948 --> 00:05:03,081
AAAAAAAAAHH!

32
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:22,081
[Aizen] [Hollow voice]
Yes, it's true.

33
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,948
This is an
inexcusable breach,
isn't it, Hogyoku?

34
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:31,648
That I, with my power,
should allow a human to
get the better of me.

35
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,248
- Augh!
- Aah!
- Oof!

36
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:54,048
Ichigo!

37
00:06:08,015 --> 00:06:11,915
I see you were able to
withstand my attack with
very little damage.

38
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:15,181
However, your left arm
is no longer usable.

39
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:20,381
[growl]

40
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:47,481
Can you hear me,
Ichigo Kurosaki?

41
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:50,215
I have to give you credit.

42
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:55,081
For one brief moment, you
broke the boundary between
Hollow and Soul Reaper, to
become a transcendent being.

43
00:06:55,648 --> 00:07:01,348
But that power is no more!
It has completely dissipated,
and not a trace of it remains!

44
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:04,615
<i>You're not even worth trying</i>
<i>to understand any more.</i>

45
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:05,948
<i>Now it's my turn.</i>

46
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:09,381
<i>I, a true transcendent being,</i>
<i>will cause your death!</i>

47
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,448
I must say, it will
be quite a victory!

48
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:15,848
By eliminating you,
I will completely
break free!

49
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:19,415
From Soul Reapers and
Hollows alike! It's over!

50
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:22,081
Ichigo Kurosaki!

51
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,015
Is it, Aizen?

52
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:24,915
Huah??

53
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:28,348
This the best you can do?

54
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:45,115
Aizen. Let's end
this already.

55
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,281
All this
rambling you do.

56
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:50,248
Well.

57
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:52,515
I'm sick of it.

58
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:56,348
So prepare yourself.

59
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:01,981
I'll show you my Final,

60
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:04,881
Getsugatensho!

61
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:23,781
What is that...
What is that form
he's taking?!

62
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:59,815
You still refuse to
stay down, Ichigo?

63
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,281
I told you already I
won't accept defeat.

64
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:18,448
Not until you describe to me
the nature of the Final
Getsugatensho!

65
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:27,315
I have no intention
of telling you,
As I already said!

66
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,815
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Something's not right.</i>

67
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:47,248
<i>If he were really serious</i>
<i>about killing me in battle,</i>
<i>he could have accomplished</i>
<i>it before now.</i>

68
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:50,148
<i>I was never a match for</i>
<i>him in any confrontation.</i>

69
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:52,581
<i>There was that great a</i>
<i>difference between our powers.</i>

70
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:04,215
<i>If he has no serious</i>
<i>intention of telling me,</i>

71
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:06,415
<i>he should stop fighting,</i>
<i>and keep himself hidden.</i>

72
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:08,681
<i>It would have been easy</i>
<i>for him to just do that.</i>

73
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:14,148
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>I don't understand.</i>

74
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,681
<i>He has me at a</i>
<i>complete disadvantage.</i>

75
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:22,048
So why is it I only sense
sadness flowing from his blade?

76
00:10:58,981 --> 00:10:59,981
Hm.

77
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:04,248
[gasp]

78
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,556
[Zangetsu]
You finally figured it out.

79
00:11:33,323 --> 00:11:40,090
The only way to acquire the
Final Getsugatensho was to
give up all resistance and
accept my blade.

80
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:43,023
I feel no pain.

81
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:47,856
Of course not. You still
don't understand, do you?

82
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,556
I, Tensa Zangetsu,
am part of you.

83
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:54,756
If you accept me, there
can be no pain when I
run you through.

84
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:01,090
Why are you crying then?

85
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,823
Because of the path
you have now chosen.

86
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:09,223
Ichigo. Do you recall
what I said when we
first fought?

87
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:12,490
You need to
understand something.

88
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:18,023
What you want to protect,
Ichigo, is not the same thing
that I want to protect.

89
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:21,990
Right.

90
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:25,790
What I wanted to protect,

91
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:28,790
was always you, Ichigo.

92
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,390
[gasp]

93
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:34,890
What do you mean?

94
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:41,390
The answer will be conveyed
directly through this blade,

95
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,723
along with the
technique's secret.

96
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:53,856
Ichigo, if you use this
technique, you will...

97
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:18,823
<i>The Final Getsugatensho,</i>

98
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:21,656
<i>is about me,</i>

99
00:13:23,123 --> 00:13:25,456
<i>becoming Getsuga itself.</i>

100
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:32,156
<i>Now I understand.</i>

101
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:39,690
If I use this technique,
I will lose all of my Soul
Reaper powers.

102
00:13:41,423 --> 00:13:45,090
That's what
'Final' means.

103
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,190
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>I still can't sense his power.</i>

104
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:54,890
<i>I have evolved into a</i>
<i>being far beyond that</i>
<i>of a Soul Reaper.</i>

105
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:59,823
<i>Just as two-dimensional beings</i>
<i>can never interact with</i>
<i>three-dimensional beings,</i>

106
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,423
<i>No Soul Reaper or human</i>
<i>will be able to detect my</i>
<i>Spiritual Pressure,</i>

107
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:08,956
<i>unless I deliberately</i>
<i>bring my powers down to</i>
<i>their level of awareness.</i>

108
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:17,356
<i>Wait a minute!</i>
<i>If that is the case...</i>
<i>Then that means...</i>

109
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:22,090
<i>he is at an even</i>
<i>higher level...</i>
<i>than myself?</i>

110
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,390
Rrrgh!

111
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:29,123
No, no, no, no, no, noooo!

112
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:34,690
<i>It's absurd! A mere</i>

<i>It couldn't possibly be!</i>

113

<i>These are my final</i>

<i>If you use this technique,</i>

<i>...are disappearing!</i>

[groan]
Mmmmrrahh...

124
00:16:36,756 --> 00:16:40,490
Ichigo Kurosaki.
You've lost this battle.

125
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:42,756
Observe.

126
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:46,223
My Zanpakuto is fading away.

127
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,290
I assume you know
what that means.

128
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:55,990
The Hogyoku has determined
that I will no longer have
any need for a Zanpakuto!

129
00:16:56,723 --> 00:17:00,956
Like you, I have become one with
the Zanpakuto and its power!

130
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,256
However, you no longer
have that power!

131
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,590
So watch as I reach a
level that will be
far beyond yours!

132
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:12,256
It's all over,
Ichigo Kurosaki!

133
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:12,956
Huh??

134
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,856
What the hell is happening?!

135
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,490
Is it a Kido?!

136
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:25,456
I don't get it!
When was
I attacked?!

137
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:29,290
<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>It seems it's</i>
<i>finally taking</i>
<i>effect.</i>

138
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:30,656
Tch!

139
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:36,456
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Kisuke!</i>

140
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,290
Kisuke Urahara!
Are you responsible
for all this?

141
00:17:42,723 --> 00:17:43,656
Yes.

142
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:48,323
I set up this offensive
before you were able to
completely transform.

143
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:54,156
When you were most vulnerable,
I planted that Kido onto another
Kido and shot it into your body.

144
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:56,056
Rrgh.

145
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,590
What I put in you is a seal.
I knew that once you fused
with the Hogyoku,

146
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:05,223
killing you would end up
being very difficult,
if not impossible.

147
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:10,056
So I was forced to invent a new
Kido, which possessed the
capability of sealing you off.

148
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:15,990
Is that so? Too bad.
I hate to disappoint you!

149
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:21,123
But, at this moment, I'm
about to evolve even further
than you can imagine!

150
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,956
As much as you think you're
in control of things,

151
00:18:24,156 --> 00:18:27,890
You won't be able to seal me
off with this level of Kido!

152
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,623
What?!

153
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:36,323
<i>What's happening to me?!</i>

154
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,523
[shaky, choked breaths]

155
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,556
It is the
Hogyoku's will.

156
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:51,556
The reason the seal I
shot into you is only
now taking effect,

157
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,723
is because your powers
have started to weaken.

158
00:18:56,256 --> 00:18:58,156
This is all thanks to Ichigo.

159
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:04,256
The seal was able to take
effect because he fought
so hard, and pushed you
to your limit.

160
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:12,323
The Hogyoku is saying
that it does not recognize
you as its master.

161
00:19:13,956 --> 00:19:15,190
You're wrong!

162
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,423
It can't be, it's impossible!

163
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:20,523
I control this power!

164
00:19:21,356 --> 00:19:22,823
D'aaghh!

165
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:27,023
[pained groans]

166
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:30,990
Urahara...

167
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:36,790
Kisuke Urahara! Do you know
how much I despise you?!

168
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:41,123
With your great intellect,
why is it you don't take
independent action?!

169
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:45,190
Why in the world is it that
you choose to subjugate
yourself to that thing?!

170
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:49,856
When you say 'that thing',
Are you talking about
the Soul King?

171
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:56,056
I see. So you saw it,
didn't you?

172
00:19:57,523 --> 00:20:02,190
Without the existence of the
Soul King, The Soul Society
would split into pieces.

173
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,056
The Soul King is the
keystone to it all.

174
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,790
Without that keystone in place,
the system would fall apart.

175
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:11,723
<i>That, my friend,</i>
<i>is how the world</i>
<i>works.</i>

176
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,856
That's an argument only
a loser would make!

177
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,323
A victor should speak of
how the world should be!

178
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:24,023
Rather than how the world
currently operates!

179
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,556
I refuse to accept a world
ruled by that thing!

180
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,523
I am a victor;
I shall decide how
the world should be!

181
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,356
Ichigo...

182
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:38,056
It's over,
isn't it,
Ichigo.

183
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:47,720
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Hey, Kisuke.</i>

184
00:23:47,753 --> 00:23:50,153
<i>Training in the Precipice</i>
<i>World has made me physically</i>
<i>older by a bit, right?</i>

185
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,120
<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>You could easily say that,</i>
<i>I suppose.</i>

186
00:23:52,153 --> 00:23:55,987
[Ichigo]
Oh yeah! It's not a bad feeling,
being more mature than my
friends.

187
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,720
<i>[Kisuke]</i>
<i>Although, when you think about</i>
<i>it, it means you're an old man</i>
<i>compared to the others.</i>

188
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:00,553
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Damn...!</i>
