00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:40,348
-You freeloaders!

3
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:41,582
Get of off my bed.

4
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:43,448
The bed is reserved
for the team mascot.

5
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:44,948
And the mascot is me!

6
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:48,215
-If I want to be on the
bed, I'll be on the bed.

7
00:01:48,248 --> 00:01:49,215
Got it?

8
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:50,648
So just go be a
mascot somewhere else.

9
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:53,482
There's only so much I
can put up with, you know.

10
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:54,815
-What did you say?

11
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,748
This house was crowded enough
without the three of you.

12
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:59,448
And now we've got a full-blown
population density crisis,

13
00:01:59,482 --> 00:02:01,582
leaving no room for
your annoying bodies!

14
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:03,348
-If you would just
calm down for a moment,

15
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:05,715
you'd realize that your
argument has no merit at all.

16
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:07,682
Because in our current
stuffed-animal form,

17
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:09,048
we take up very little space.

18
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:11,315
So in terms of the
area-to-occupancy ratio,

19
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:13,782
our presence is actually
quite insignificant.

20
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:14,315
-Why, you!

21
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:16,615
I oughta--

22
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:17,782
-What did I say?

23
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:20,148
You guys have got to
get along and be quiet.

24
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,615
-Don't look at me.

25
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:23,015
It's not my fault.

26
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:25,415
We tried to be nice, but that
older model keeps attacking us.

27
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:26,948
-Old model?

28
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:28,315
-What did I do?

29
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:33,282
Why does this stuff always
have to happen to me?

[bell tolling]

31
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:45,882
-Where's Ururu?

32
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,015
-He's in the back room, resting.

33
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:50,348
But he prefers to
be alone for awhile.

34
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:52,048
And we should respect that.

35
00:02:52,082 --> 00:02:52,782
-I understand.

36
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,648
-What about those
Bounts who disappeared?

37
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:04,315
-Nothing.

38
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:04,948
I don't sense them.

39
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:05,882
-Yes.

40
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:06,882
Well, we're not
sure whether it's

41
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:08,782
an atmospheric
phenomenon, or perhaps

42
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,515
an entirely different
condition, which

43
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:12,582
is for some reason blocking
all of our sensors.

44
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:13,315
-But--

45
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:14,982
-We detect nothing.

46
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:16,115
-Yes.

47
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:17,915
-Those weird things that
came out back there--

48
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,082
what were they?

49
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:29,648
-This is just a theory.

50
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:31,248
But my guess is
that the Bounts are

51
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:33,415
able to gather chi
and spirit energy that

52
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:36,148
exists in the World of the
Living, and by manipulating it,

53
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,382
transform it into these dolls.

54
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:41,282
If my theory is correct,
these things that Ichigo saw

55
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:43,148
were probably dolls, too.

56
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,948
These new dolls must be
very important to them,

57
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:48,882
because the Bounts were willing
to sacrifice one of their own

58
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:50,115
in order to create them.

59
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,248
-It keeps getting
more complicated.

60
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:53,715
-Before we can do
anything else, I

61
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:55,882
think we should try to
gather some more information.

62
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:58,182
And I'd like Renji to
help me out with that.

63
00:03:58,215 --> 00:03:59,248
-Hm?

64
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:01,482
-We should go investigate
Kariya's mansion

65
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:02,882
to see what we can find there.

66
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:04,515
-Sounds good.

67
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:06,915
-Chad, Orihime, I
think you'd both be

68
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:08,982
safer if you moved in
here for a little while.

69
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,315
-You think we're in danger?

70
00:04:10,348 --> 00:04:11,615
-Hm?

71
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,882
-Since we can't sense our
enemies' spiritual pressure,

72
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:15,615
we never know when
they'll strike.

73
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:17,382
I think you'll be
safe enough at school.

74
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:19,515
But you both live alone,
and that worries me.

75
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,582
So at night, I'd feel
better if you stayed here

76
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:22,582
where there's a barrier.

77
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:23,115
-Sure.

78
00:04:23,148 --> 00:04:25,048
-Good idea.

79
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,815
-You should probably get home
as soon as possible, Ichigo.

80
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:29,215
You haven't been
there in a while,

81
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:30,648
and I would imagine
your family is

82
00:04:30,682 --> 00:04:32,615
wondering if you're all right.

83
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,582
Also, I want you to
think of a strategy

84
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:37,948
that we can use against the
Bounts when they strike again.

85
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:39,182
-A strategy?

86
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:40,848
-Ririn and the
others will go along

87
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:43,148
to help you with your plan,
while at the same time

88
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,848
keeping a lookout for
any Bount movement.

89
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:47,615
-With our three brains, we'll
come up with a plan in no time.

90
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:50,482
-And you can count on us
to watch your back, Ichigo.

91
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:51,648
-No a problem.

92
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:53,215
-This is a joke, right?

00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:57,782
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): I did what
Urahara said and brought them

94

home.

95
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,015
But I don't know.

96
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:01,948
-You're just a
rookie, but you strut

97
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:03,482
around liking you're all that.

98
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:05,148
-And you're just an old model.

99
00:05:05,182 --> 00:05:06,882
KON: I dare you
to say that again.

100
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:07,382
-Old model!

101
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:07,882
Old model!

102
00:05:07,915 --> 00:05:08,715
Old model!

103
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:10,415
-You are so unbelievably cruel!

104
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:12,715
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Bad idea.

105
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:14,682
RIRIN: Aw, did I hurt
the old model's feelings?

106
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,982
-How am I supposed to
read with all this noise?

107
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:18,048
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Right.

108
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:19,248
She's here, too.

109
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:21,515
-And I had just got to the
best part of the story.

110
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:23,315
It's the climax,
where Caitlin, who's

111
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:24,948
been bullied and
tortured by Rodriguez,

112
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:26,982
finally snaps and seeks
revenge, clutching

113
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,048
her newborn baby and a rifle

114
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:31,982
-Why do you always have to
hide in the closet like that?

115
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:34,715
-Because I decided this is
the best place to sleep.

116
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,548
So I'm gonna sleep here!

117
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:37,915
-Rukia, they're being mean.

118
00:05:37,948 --> 00:05:41,048
Can I come up and-- whoa!

119
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:42,748
-For crying out loud.

120
00:05:42,782 --> 00:05:43,782
When will you learn?

121
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:46,282
-Not even death
can cure stupidity.

122
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:48,948
-But Kon's stupidity
runs through all aspects

123
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:49,748
of his personality.

124
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,648
It's actually quite impressive.

125
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:53,082
-You called me
stupid, didn't you?

126

RIRIN: Oh, yeah?

127
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:54,582
I'll show you.

back right now.

129

00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:57,915
-[groan] Stop it!

131
00:05:57,948 --> 00:06:00,348
The two of you are driving me
crazy with all this fighting!

132

If I have to hear any
more, I'm gonna go nuts.

00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:10,548
Who are you talking to?

138
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:11,748
-Oh, no.

139
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:13,515
This is-- this is
for a class project.

140
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:16,315
-I thought for dinner
I'd make sukiyaki.

141
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:18,648
I know it's your favorite,
so hopefully that

142
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:19,715
will make you feel better.

00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:20,615
-Oh, no.

144
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:22,015
I'm not really--

145
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:22,715
-It's OK.

146
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,115
Don't worry about it.

147
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:26,682
Just know that if you ever
need someone to talk to,

Dad and I will always
be there for you.

Because that's what

Well, I'll see you later!

-She has every reason to worry.

164
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:55,682
For once, I'm actually glad to
hear that stupid alarm go off.

165
00:06:55,715 --> 00:07:00,015
I feel like I'm about
to go nuts around here.

166
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:00,515
KON: Ah!

167
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:01,082
Wait!

168
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:02,415
Don't leave me!

169
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:03,648
-Now then.

170
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:06,182
This is the perfect
opportunity to do our own work.

171
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:07,915
-Well, if they're off
to fight a Hollow,

172
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:10,182
I don't see how we're
going to be of much help.

173
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:11,548
NOBA: Mm.

174
00:07:11,582 --> 00:07:14,415
-Ichigo, Rukia, how could you
run away and leave me alone

175
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:15,515
without any protection?

176
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:16,582
You're horrible!

177
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:19,582
-Would you stop crying?

178
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:20,482
[squeak]

179
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:21,315
-Ugh.

180
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:22,815
What do you think you're doing?

181
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:24,448
-I don't think you
fully understand

182
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:25,382
what's going on here.

183
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:26,948
-Why so serious all of a sudden?

184
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:29,748
-The Bounts are targeting
strong spiritual energy.

185
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,648
-What's that have
to do with anything?

186
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:34,115
-Do we have to spell
everything out for you?

187
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:37,748
Everyone in Ichigo's family
has strong spirit energy.

188
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:39,515
-Now that Ichigo
and Rukia are gone,

189
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:42,215
we have to come up with
a plan to protect them.

190
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:44,182
-Now you're talking.

191
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:47,182
[roaring]

192
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:57,182
-You've gotten
pretty good at this.

193
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:58,348
-Yeah, I guess.

194
00:07:58,382 --> 00:07:59,648
We should probably get back.

195
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:06,615
-Huh?

196
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:07,315
Hey.

197
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:09,315
-What?

198
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:11,282
-Something doesn't feel right.

199
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,315
-Like what?

200
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:14,248
-Well, I'm not exactly
sure what it is.

201
00:08:14,282 --> 00:08:17,248
But I feel a strange energy
coming from your house.

202
00:08:17,282 --> 00:08:18,415
-A Bount or something?

203
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:19,515
-No.

204
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:21,815
It's familiar, but I
can't quite place it.

205
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:30,148
-Ah, that ought to do the trick.

206
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:30,648
[squeak]

207
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:31,615
-Ah!

208
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:33,048
What are you doing?

209
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:35,148
-I was gonna ask
you the same thing.

210
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,648
What the hell is
all this nonsense?

211
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:38,815
RIRIN: It's all right, Kon.

212
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:40,115
I'll explain.

213
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:41,548
-Huh?

214
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:44,415
-It's a booby trap,
designed to ensnare Bounts.

215
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:46,848
-You mean this is
a Bount booby trap?

216
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:47,848
-Right.

217
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:49,182
So no matter when
the enemy attacks,

218
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:50,548
we'll be safe and sound.

219
00:08:50,582 --> 00:08:52,815
-Urahara supplied us
with the materials

220
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:54,815
we needed to build a
trap powerful enough

221
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,215
to stop a Bount.

222
00:08:56,248 --> 00:08:59,615
I dare say you'll be amazed when
you see what we came up with.

223
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:00,748
Look!

224
00:09:00,782 --> 00:09:02,582
This trap uses a bait
specifically designed

225
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:05,615
to grab the Bount's attention
and draw them in close.

226
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:07,715
Then, pull the string-- voila!

227
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:11,582
A proverbial rat in a trap, to
be disposed of at our leisure.

228
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:12,982
ICHIGO: [sigh]

229
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:15,582
KURODO: This basket is made of
a special bamboo that seals away

230
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:18,782
spirit energy to ensure that
those buggers don't get out.

231
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:19,615
-Fascinating.

232
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:21,148
-You've got to be kidding me!

233
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:23,182
KURODO: And the
piece de resistance.

234
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:24,382
Feast your eyes on this!

235
00:09:24,415 --> 00:09:26,148
-What exactly is it?

236
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:28,082
-It's a Bount repellent.

237
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:30,415
The balloons at both ends
gather minute particles

238
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:32,115
of spirit energy
that are in the air.

239
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:34,415
And then the CD-shaped
reflector panels

240
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,715
release a bright light,
which the Bounts hate.

241
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:38,482
-We're not trying
to scare birds here.

242
00:09:38,515 --> 00:09:41,282
-Not to worry, because I also
set up my ground-based Bount

243
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,515
repellent that has
exactly the same effect.

244
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:46,582
I call it Kon's Special
Bount repellent.

245
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:47,315
-Oh.

246
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:48,082
-Great.

247
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:49,715
They can wash their hands.

248
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:52,882
-And if a Bount somehow gets
passed the outdoor traps,

249
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:54,848
we have indoor
traps set as well.

250
00:09:54,882 --> 00:09:57,115
If a Bount comes strolling
down the hall and steps

251
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:58,848
over this mark, he'll
trigger the sensor,

252
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:00,515
releasing the rice
grinder that's

253
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:01,848
been suspended from the ceiling.

254
00:10:01,882 --> 00:10:02,815
-Yes.

255
00:10:02,848 --> 00:10:04,015
And this particular
rice grinder is

256
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,515
made of seki seki, which
seals away spirit energy,

257
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:08,248
rendering the enemy
utterly defenseless

258
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:10,248
and completely at our mercy.

259
00:10:10,282 --> 00:10:12,882
-I don't suppose that trap
you were working on earlier

260
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:14,882
has any special
powers, does it, Kon?

261
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,248
-Of course!

262
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,448
The ropes are treated with a
special liquid that seals away

263
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:21,415
the spirit energy of
anyone's feet touch it.

264
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:24,015
-And you're saying that Urahara
supplied you with all of this?

265
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:25,282
-That's right.

266
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:26,215
-[sigh]

267
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:27,748
-As long as you're
in this house,

268
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:29,182
you're completely secure.

269
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:31,448
-And who do you think is
going to fall for these traps?

270
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:31,982
HANATARO: Ah!

271
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:32,682
Help me!

272
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,248
[crash]

273
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,482
-What's that?

274
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:38,182
-[groaning]

275
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:40,315
-It looks like Hanataro.

276
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,515
-Rukia, is that really you?

277
00:10:42,548 --> 00:10:43,715
-My trap's a success!

278
00:10:43,748 --> 00:10:46,415
It does more than
just trap the victim.

279
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:47,548
You see?

280
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:50,282
It also makes them fall
face first into a pie!

281
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,715
ICHIGO: What are you doing here?

282
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:53,282
-Well, I was looking
for the house

283
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:55,048
that I'm supposed to
deliver this pie to.

284
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:57,048
Oh, in case you need
it, the convenience

285
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:59,848
store I work for has
delivery service now.

286
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:01,048
-OK.

287
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:02,582
And that's when you got
caught by the Bount trap?

288
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:03,648
-Bount trap?

289
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:05,448
-So the Soul Society
didn't send you

290
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:07,815
to the World of the Living
to help deal with the Bounts?

291
00:11:07,848 --> 00:11:10,548
-Ever since I got here, I've
been so busy with everyday life

292
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:12,515
that I don't know
what I'm doing.

293
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,182
-But now that you
bring it up, I can't

294
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,115
remember why I came to
the World of Living.

295
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:18,482
-Come on.

296
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:21,415
-[laughs] I guess we've answered
your question about whether

297
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,015
these traps will work or not.

298
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:23,982
-Whatever.

299
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:25,148
Just get rid of this
crap, all right?

300
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:25,782
[gasping]

301
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:26,415
-What did you say?

302
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:27,348
-I don't believe it.

303
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:28,948
We just explained
how these traps

304
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,515
will protect us from the Bounts.

305
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:32,582
-You've had enough
fun for one day.

306
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:33,815
Now clean it up.

307
00:11:33,848 --> 00:11:36,048
You can come inside and
wash your face, Hanataro.

308
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:37,815
HANATARO: Thank you,
I appreciate it.

309
00:11:37,848 --> 00:11:41,415
-Boy, you sure did fall
for that trap, didn't you?

310
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:42,415
-Hey, Rukia!

311
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:44,382
Wait for me!

312
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:46,715
-That's the thanks
we get for helping?

313
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,582
-They all underestimate just
how powerful the Bounts are.

314
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:51,515
And the only thing that
will open their eyes

315
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:54,248
to the seriousness of the
situation is a good scare.

316
00:11:54,282 --> 00:11:55,182
-Unforgivable.

317
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,015
-[laughs evilly]
Just wait and see.

318
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:08,224
-[laugh]

319
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:09,724
-Yeah!

320
00:12:09,757 --> 00:12:12,390
-These special suits
that Urahara mad for us

321
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,624
to amplify our powers will
be absolutely perfect.

322
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:17,590
Though I never thought that we'd
have to use them in a situation

323
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:18,290
like this.

324
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:19,257
-Yes, you're right.

325
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,724
And it's convenient
that these suits

326
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:23,524
look similar to the Bounts
dolls we saw hatch earlier.

327
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:27,624
-[laughs] We'll show Ichigo
and the others a thing or two.

328
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:29,690
When we show up
looking like this,

329
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:32,990
Ichigo and Rukia will see us
and think that Bounts have come.

330
00:12:33,024 --> 00:12:34,357
Then they'll attack us.

331
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,190
When they do that, I'll amplify
my illusion power with the suit

332
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,457
and dodge the attack!

333
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,324
-Excellent.

334
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:41,590
And while you're
doing that, I'll

335
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:44,424
use my suit's power to enhance
my transformation energy

336
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:47,157
and completely overwhelm them.

337
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,324
-When Ichigo begins
to panic, Noba,

338
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:52,624
who's been hiding all this
time, will release the traps.

339
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:56,557
We'll fall into the traps on
purpose and barely escape!

340
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,190
He'll have no choice bu
to admit the traps work.

341
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:03,957
By risking ourselves, we'll let
them see with their own eyes

342
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,557
how foolish they were to
laugh at our anti-Bount plan.

343
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,224
-They're coming.

344
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:10,490
-All right!

345
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:11,624
Let's do this.

346
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,857
-Ready, willing, and able.

347
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,757
RIRIN: Noba, make sure all
the traps are set properly.

348
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,190
-Mm.

349
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:20,590
HANATARO: I'm sorry I have
to borrow all this stuff.

350
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:22,290
-Don't worry about it.

351
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:23,190
-Huh?

352
00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:24,057
Ichigo?

353
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,324
-What's wrong with you now?

354
00:13:25,357 --> 00:13:26,524
-It-- that is!

355
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,590
-Huh?

356
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,957
[gasping]

357
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,157
-Hado 33, Sokatsui!

358
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,990
[shouting]

359
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:36,324
-So, did I do it?

360
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,624
-I think that you overdid it.

361
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:42,224
RIRIN: I didn't expect that.

362
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:43,757
KURODO: Thank you, Noba.

363
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,657
If you hadn't saved
us with your power.

364
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,290
we'd have been a
couple of dead ducks.

365
00:13:48,324 --> 00:13:50,224
-Noba, can't you hear us?

366
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:54,624
ICHIGO: What's that?

367
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:55,490
Look out, Noba!

368
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:56,424
Get away from there!

369
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:58,357
RIRIN: Hado 31, Shakkaho!

370
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,690
[shouting]

371
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:02,357
-Sorry, Noba.

372
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,457
Are you all right.

373
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,790
-I'm fine.

374
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:09,657
[panting]

375
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,624
-Rukia wasn't surprised one bit.

376
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,190
-I would assume
that's because of all

377
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:14,690
of her training
as a Soul Reaper.

378
00:14:14,724 --> 00:14:16,757
She's used to
life-threatening situations.

379
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,190
That's why when she
saw us, her reflexes

380
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:20,890
allowed her to react
instantaneously.

381
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:22,690
-Why don't we forget this?

382
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:23,790
It's too dangerous.

383
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:25,157
-There's Ichigo,

384
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,290
KURODO: Listen, Ichigo, there's
a perfect good explanation--

385
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,557
-Ichigo, Ririn and Kurodo have
been eaten by those bug things.

386
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,524
-Huh?

387
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:32,957
[shouting]

388
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,924
-Rukia!

389
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,357
-Hado Four, Byakurai!

390
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,824
[screaming]

391
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,924
-Where did they go?

392
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:44,457
-Kon.

393
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,657
-What is it?

394
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,490
-Get in my body, will ya?

395
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:48,690
KON: Ugh, what the hell?

396
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:50,624
-Rukia, did you see which
way the Bounts went?

397
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:51,890
-I've lost sight of them.

398
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:52,857
But they can't be far.

399
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,924
So if we hurry,
we can catch them.

400
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:55,690
-All right.

401
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:58,624
I'm all ready to do this.

402
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:00,757
-I was just able
to contact Renji.

403
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,057
-Uh--

404
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,157
-I know it couldn't
have been easy watching

405
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,090
as your friends got
eaten like that.

406
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:08,290
-No.

407
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,457
-Noba, you he stay right
here and keep watch.

408
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,724
Contact us immediately
if something happens.

409
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:14,324
-Hey, wait for me.

410
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:16,624
-Ririn, Kurodo, even
though we've only

411
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:19,390
known each other a little
while, as a fellow Mod-Soul,

412
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:22,724
you have my word that I
will avenge your death.

413
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:24,124
[scream]

414
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:27,957
-What happened?

415
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,390
Kon, are you all right?

416
00:15:30,424 --> 00:15:31,657
-I can't go on.

417
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,490
The rest is up to you.

418
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:38,057
-Did you find them?

419
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,290
-No, I didn't see anything.

420
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:41,924
I'll go look down that way.

421
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:44,890
-All right.

422
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:46,390
RIRIN: Are they gone?

423
00:15:46,424 --> 00:15:47,090
KURODO: Yes.

424
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:48,657
What ferocious savages.

425
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,890
Our wonderful is
completely ruined.

426
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:55,090
NOBA: At any rate, we
have to clear this up.

427
00:15:55,124 --> 00:15:57,457
-Agreed, but let's get
out of these suits first.

428
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,857
RIRIN: Good idea. [grunt] Ah!

429
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,690
KURODO: I think it must
have short-circuited.

430
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:06,990
[sighing]

431
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:09,557
Why can I still hear your voice?

432
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,724
-The external speakers
seem to be broken.

433
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:13,390
But it looks like the
suit-to-suit radio

434
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:14,424
is working perfectly.

435
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:15,690
-That's it!

436
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,424
I'm sure that Noba has a
receiver for this radio, too!

437
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:19,557
-Of course.

438
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,990
So all we have to do is
go back and tell Noba,

439
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:22,457
and then we'll be saved.

440
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,324
-Because once we
talk with Noba, he

441
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:26,390
can explain to them
exactly what's going on.

442
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:27,757
And they won't
attack us anymore.

443
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,290
KURODO: However, judging from
Rukia's attitude earlier,

444
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,957
I don't think he's had the
chance to explain it just yet.

445
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,590
RIRIN: At any rate, we
should get back there.

446
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:37,090
KURODO: I agree!

447
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:38,090
RIRIN: Someone's coming!

448
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:40,590
[whimpering]

449
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,257
-Why does my big
sister always have

450
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,057
to be such a pain in the neck?

451
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,457
Return your own damn CDs.

452
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,357
What do I look like, a slave?

453
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,557
KURODO: Is he gone?

454
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:54,924
RIRIN: He spotted us!

455
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:57,190
-Hey, afro dude, how
come you're up there?

456
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,424
If you're playing some
kind of game, can I watch?

457
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:00,257
-Be quiet!

458
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,957
This is not a game I'm playing.

459
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,824
And you can't watch!

460
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:04,157
-What's your problem?

461
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,124
You know, I don't think it
would kill you to stop and talk

462
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:07,624
to me for a minute.

463
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:09,424
-Would you please stop talking?

464
00:17:09,457 --> 00:17:13,357
I just don't understand why
so many people in this town

465
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,057
can see me.

466
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,424
RIRIN: What's going on?

467
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:18,057
KURODO: He seems to be the Soul
Reaper in charge of this town.

468
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,024
RIRIN: Huh?

469
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:20,490
Then what are Rukia
and the others?

470
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:23,057
KURODO: Well, I don't think that
Rukia, Renji, and Ichigo are

471
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,390
involved in the day-to-day
protection of the town.

472
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:26,924
They have more specific tasks.

473
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:29,724
But his duties seem to
encompass a broader scope.

474
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,757
-Freeze, you dolls!

475
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,357
KURODO: [gasp]

476
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,290
RIRIN: Oh, no!

477
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:33,690
KURODO: Run away!

478
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:36,957
RUKIA: Hado 33, Sokatsui!

479
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,690
-Hey, what's going on?

480
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,224
-Get back here!

481
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:41,857
-Oh, Lady Kuchiki.

482
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,657
What an unexpected
surprise to see.

483
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,957
-Shakkaho!

484
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,857
-Doh!

485
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,724
Ah!

486
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:51,757
-That looks like Rukia
up there playing war.

487
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,924
I had no idea she
was into that stuff.

488
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:55,490
How come I'm always left out?

489
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:57,357
No one tells me anything!

490
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,424
I can't stand it anymore!

491
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,457
-[sigh] Finally finished.

492
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,424
RIRIN: Almost there!

493
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:07,124
-Huh?

494
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:09,790
KURODO: Ah, Hanataro.

495
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:13,557
-[screams] Oh, god!

496
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,557
Oh, god!

497
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,057
Oh!

498
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,257
[cries] Ouch.

499
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,857
RIRIN: Kurodo, I
just thought of a way

500
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,490
to kill two birds
with one stone.

501
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:23,824
KURODO: I know exactly
what you're thinking.

502
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:24,890
-What?

503
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:26,890
I hope they're not
who I think they are.

504
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:27,857
RIRIN: All right.

505
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,690
Prepare yourself!

506
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,557
KURODO: You are now our hostage!

507
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,024
[screaming]

508
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:33,424
-Not so fast.

509
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:34,857
[screaming]

510
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,190
KURODO: This isn't good!

511
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:39,990
-Roar, Zabimaru!

512
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:42,957
[screaming]

513
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,824
-Renji, looks like you
got here just in time.

514
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,757
-I'd say so.

515
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,957
-Don't let your guard down.

516
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,824
They may be small, but
there with the Bounts,

517
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:50,557
so we can't underestimate them.

518
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,724
RIRIN: Nothing we do
seems to work out.

519
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,224
KURODO: You can say that again.

520
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:56,090
-Looks like we have
no other choice.

521
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:57,490
So you know what this means.

522
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:59,924
-Well, if we must, we must.

523
00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:00,757
RIRIN: Let's go!

524
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,957
KURODO: Right Energy release!

525
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,090
RIRIN: Combine!

526
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:12,324
Go!

527
00:19:12,357 --> 00:19:15,624
-Full demon!

528
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:16,790
ICHIGO: What is that?

529
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:17,990
-I don't know.

530
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,657
That's the dumbest looking
thing I've ever seen.

531
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,957
You're history!

532
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,457
Roar!

533
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:25,724
Huh?

534
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:26,790
What the heck is this?

535
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:30,290
-Renji, over there!

536
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:32,790
-How'd that goofy looking
thing get my Zabimaru?

537
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:34,024
-Roar, Zabimaru!

538
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:42,190
-[shout]

539
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,157
-Save me!

540
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,090
Save me!

541
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:45,924
Please don't let
it hurt me, Ichigo.

542
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,124
-Damn.

543
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:51,457
How did it do that?

544
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,057
-Unbelievable!

545
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,290
-Huh?

546
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,157
What the--?

547
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,824
Stop it!

548
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:03,157
That tickles! [laughs]

549
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,924
-Rukia!

550
00:20:03,957 --> 00:20:06,824
-Ha!

551
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:09,257
Now to finish you off.

552
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,657
-Ichigo, Renji,
something's weird!

553
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,624
RIRIN: [laughs] It's too late.

554
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:21,657
Even if you were smart
enough to figure it out,

555
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,690
there's no way to escape.

556
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,057
-Whoa!

557
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:40,890
[groaning]

558
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,157
RIRIN: Oh, that hurt!

559
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,990
KURODO: How could I make a
stupid mistake like that?

560
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:48,324
-Pitiful Your whole attack
was nothing but an illusion.

561
00:20:48,357 --> 00:20:49,090
[whimpering]

562
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,557
-It's the end of the line!

563
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,924
[whimpering]

564
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:56,124
-Where'd they go?

565
00:20:56,157 --> 00:20:58,624
-Huh?

566
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,124
-Noba?

567
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:03,624
[groaning]

568
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:04,624
ICHIGO: Ririn!

569
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:05,557
Kurodo!

570
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,824
RUKIA: What's the
meaning of this?

571
00:21:06,857 --> 00:21:08,257
-Well, these are--

572
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,657
-Their suits are made by
that perverted store owner

573
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,924
to give these two idiots
more fighting power when

574
00:21:12,957 --> 00:21:14,990
they're in stuffed animal form.

575
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,924
What you've been
seeing is Ririn's power

576
00:21:16,957 --> 00:21:20,924
to show illusions and
Kurodo's power to transform.

577
00:21:20,957 --> 00:21:21,424
-Seriously?

578
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,524
URAHARA: Sorry, I had no idea.

579
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:29,490
We probably shouldn't
use these suits anymore.

580
00:21:29,524 --> 00:21:32,224
It wouldn't be good if you were
mistaken for the enemy again.

581
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,657
-Yeah, you got that
right, because I might not

582
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,290
be around to save
them the next time.

583
00:21:36,324 --> 00:21:37,824
Noba didn't say a word.

584
00:21:37,857 --> 00:21:40,524
So if I hadn't spoken up,
you'd have been goners.

585
00:21:40,557 --> 00:21:44,590
You'd probably be pushing up
daisies right now! [laughs]

586
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:45,990
Am I right?

587
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:47,024
What's wrong?

588
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,257
You know, you had
any manners at all,

589
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,090
you'd show a little less
attitude and a little more

590
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:52,424
gratitude.

591
00:21:52,457 --> 00:21:55,390
Because after all, I am the
one who saved your-- [shout]

592
00:21:55,424 --> 00:21:58,124
-You are the rudest,
most obnoxious man

593
00:21:58,157 --> 00:21:59,857
that I've ever met in my life.

594
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,957
-What did you say?

595
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,857
RIRIN: Don't bite me!

596
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,390
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

597
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:07,724
-It might be a good idea to
disable all the traps for now.

598
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:10,024
We still have to work out a
few of the kinks before they

599
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:11,390
they can do as much good.

600
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:12,457
-That's for sure.

601
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,124
Which reminds me,
did you guys clean up

602
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:15,890
all the ones planted
around the house?

603
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:16,390
-Uh-uh.

604
00:22:19,524 --> 00:22:22,190
KARIN: Yuzu, I'm home!

605
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:23,657
[gasp]

606
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,390
[grunting]

607
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:27,690
-I get it.

608
00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:29,790
Yeah, this is a
new game, isn't it?

609
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:39,086

GROUP: Golden!

612
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:37,219
So Hitsugaya's called
everyone together.

613
00:24:37,252 --> 00:24:39,419
-Yes, he wants to
dispatch several people

614
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:40,552
to the World of the Living.

615
00:24:40,586 --> 00:24:41,886
Who do you think we should send?

616
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:42,986
-What about Yachiru?

617
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:44,852
ARAMAKI: She's in
the sweets room.

618
00:24:44,886 --> 00:24:46,086
-What's Ikkaku doing?

619
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:47,019
ARAMAKI: He's sleeping.

620
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,686
-How about Yumichika?

621
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,586
ARAMAKI: He's
organizing his files.

622
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:51,552
-All right, then.

623
00:24:51,586 --> 00:24:53,119
We'll send Yumichika.

624
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:54,252
-Huh?

625
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,952
But he's the only one
who's doing any work.

626
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:56,886
KENPACHI: You idiot!

627
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:59,352
Play is more
important than work.

628
00:24:59,386 --> 00:25:02,452
You can work whenever you want.
