00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,300
<i>I say</i>
<i>It's neither just nor virtuous</i>
<i>to live in peace and let the</i>
<i>dead go unavenged!</i>

2
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,566
It is evil!!

3
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:18,842
Stop now! Kaname!

4
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:29,508
Is this how far you've fallen,
bastard?!

5
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:52,342
Shuhei, no!!

6
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:54,075
Nngh!

7
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:59,008
<i>What...is this power?!</i>

8
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:11,175
Bankai!

9
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,542
Kokujo Tengen Myoh!

10
00:03:24,675 --> 00:03:26,308
<i>[Sajin]</i>
<i>Kaname!</i>

11
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:28,642
I swear, I will do
whatever it takes,

12
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,508
to open your eyes
to the truth!

13
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,675
How foolish of you.

14
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:57,008
You've seen my power, and yet
you still think you can defeat
me with the likes of a Bankai?

15
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:02,242
"The likes of a Bankai."

16
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,742
Now, that sounds like
something an Espada would say.

17
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:10,042
Don't compare me
to the Espadas.

18
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,508
I have surpassed
all of them.

19
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,708
And you Soul
Reapers as well.

20
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:19,675
Have you forgotten your
days as a Soul Reaper?

21
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:22,008
Soul Reaper?

22
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:30,075
Becoming a Soul Reaper...

23
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:35,008
<i>that was never really</i>
<i>what I was after.</i>

24
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:40,008
Mmm.

25
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:50,408
<i>[Sajin]</i>
<i>Kaname... When was it that you</i>
<i>chose this path to follow?</i>

26
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:02,342
[Kaname]
I- I beg your pardon...
I didn't think anyone was here.

27
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:04,642
Over here...

28
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:05,508
Eh?!

29
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,508
That's odd...
My apologies.

30
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,542
I wasn't able to
sense you over there.

31
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:14,575
Eh?

32
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:20,342
I'm Kaname Tosen.
Pleased to meet you.

33
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:26,842
I have to say,
you're extremely
good at masking
your presence.

34
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:30,508
Especially since
you're so big.

35
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:38,642
You can see, I'm blind,
but there was never a
time I couldn't sense
the presence of another.

36
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:40,808
Sorry. Force of habit.

37
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:44,408
Sajin Komamura?
It's been quite a
while, hasn't it?

38
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:48,542
<i>I see. You've joined the</i>
<i>Thirteen Court Guard Squads...</i>

39
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:51,875
Have you ever considered
becoming a member of my
squad, Sajin?

40
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:55,075
I have a wonderful superior,
I'm sure you'd like him.

41
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:02,808
You're Sajin Komamura?
Kaname's spoken of you.

42
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:04,175
Hmmm?

43
00:06:07,842 --> 00:06:12,208
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Sosuke Aizen,
lieutenant of squad five.

44
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:20,408
[Kaname]
I'm curious, Why did you
choose to become a soul reaper?

45
00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:23,308
[Sajin]
To repay a debt
of gratitude...

46
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,342
to the one who
saved my life.

47
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:29,242
Repaying a debt.
That sounds like you.

48
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:33,008
And what about
you, Kaname?

49
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:37,175
Me? Well...

50
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,742
[sigh]

51
00:06:57,508 --> 00:06:59,042
All right, let us begin!

52
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:17,242
You finally drew
your sword.

53
00:07:18,242 --> 00:07:20,508
You like to take your time,
don't you?

54
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:26,675
Scared?

55
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:30,375
It's no use trying
to ignore me.

56
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:35,508
No matter how strong you are,
I know you have your doubts.

57
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,675
You said so yourself,
a hundred years ago.

58
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:47,242
I never opened up to you.
I never let you get close enough
to learn anything about me.

59
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:52,142
That's why, even
after all this time,

60
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:55,508
you don't know what my
Zanpakuto's power is.

61
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:58,308
You think
that matters?

62
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:02,475
Do you really think I
need to understand its
power before I can act?

63
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:05,875
Who knows?
But I understand yours.

64
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:11,242
I know that your Zanpakuto
tries to gain control of
your opponents by working
on their nerves.

65
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:14,408
You think that puts me
at a disadvantage?

66
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,008
Not necessarily.

67
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,242
But I'll tell you this.

68
00:08:22,842 --> 00:08:27,042
If you think your Kyokasuigetsu
is the only Zanpakuto with the
capability of controling an
opponent's nerves,

69
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:29,342
you're sadly
mistaken, Sosuke.

70
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:37,008
Now Collapse.

71
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,842
<i>[Shinji]</i>
<i>Sakanade.</i>

72
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,042
Yahhh!

73
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:57,875
Have you forgotten?

74
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,208
I know your
abilities too well.

75
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:04,175
I can anticipate
your every attack.

76
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:23,008
Rrraagh!

77
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:48,242
Well, I never said
your destructive power
wasn't impressive.

78
00:09:49,842 --> 00:09:55,042
He's taken hardly any damage...
He stopped it with his
Zanpakuto.

79
00:09:56,342 --> 00:10:00,842
Well, then. You said I
couldn't defeat you with the
likes of a Bankai, right?

80
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:03,175
Yes. That's right.

81
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:10,242
What about Tengen Myo-oh?
Compared to its power,
yours is like an infant's
next to an adult's.

82
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:14,208
Give this up while
you still can.

83
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:19,708
<i>My power,</i>
<i>like an infant's,</i>
<i>you say?</i>

84
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:23,408
<i>You have grown so arrogant,</i>
<i>it's almost pitiful.</i>

85
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:28,308
<i>Very well, Sajin.</i>

86
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:32,042
It's time that arrogance of
yours was cut down to size.

87
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,175
<i>Where did he</i>
<i>get that speed?</i>

88
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:54,175
I'm over here.

89
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:58,075
Agh!

90
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:02,375
Myo-oh!!

91
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,042
<i>You and that thing</i>
<i>are linked together.</i>

92
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:22,842
<i>Every move you make,</i>
<i>the giant makes.</i>

93
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:27,008
And any wound I inflict on it,
is inflicted on you as well.

94
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,742
<i>A very inconvenient</i>
<i>Bankai, Sajin.</i>

95
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:36,142
I'm familiar with it
from seeing it in
action several times,

96
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:39,075
so it's easy for me to
target its weaknesses.

97
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:46,308
You've always relied
on its overwhelmingly
destructive power,

98
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:52,342
never imagining that
any opponent could
survive the first blow,
let alone counterattack.

99
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:56,842
I don't even need to
target your vital spots.

100
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:02,175
If I just inflict enough damage
on your limbs, eventually
you'll become immobile.

101
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:06,675
The same thing is true
for you as well.

102
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:10,475
You think so? Hah.

103
00:12:10,508 --> 00:12:12,675
Hah ha ha ha ha!

104
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:16,675
Don't try to put me on
the same level as you.

105
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:26,008
<i>Instant Regeneration!</i>

106
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:36,308
<i>[Sajin]</i>
<i>So that's it, then.</i>

107
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:40,042
You've really given up being a
Soul Reaper, Haven't you?

108
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:45,175
Given our current situation,
you sound like a sore loser.

109
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:52,642
As I recall, you said
that I was depraved.

110
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:56,842
That deceiving my friends
and subordinates was a
sign of my depravity.

111
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,042
But I ask you this...

112
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:04,542
If someone joined
an organization
solely for revenge,

113
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:09,008
and then abandoned his purpose
in order to live peacefully
within that organization,

114
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:11,175
wouldn't that be
depraved as well?

115
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:19,575
To my unseeing eyes, you
appear to be dealing with a
much greater moral issue.

116
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:26,008
You mean that? You became
a Soul Reaper for no
other purpose than...?

117
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,875
Yes. Revenge.

118
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:46,904
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>I love watching the</i>
<i>night sky, Kaname.</i>

<i>so much darkness, and yet, in</i>
<i>that darkness, so many, many</i>
<i>shining points of light.</i>

120

Clouds come along and try to
smother the lights. Do you
understand what I mean, Kaname?

121
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:10,270
<i>I wish I could gather all the</i>

<i>my acceptance from the</i>
<i>Academy yesterday.</i>

124
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,404
I'm going to become a

125
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,304
and I will let
justice shine.

126
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,304
I wanted you to hear
it from me, Kaname.

127
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:48,104
Congratulations. Of course
you know that if there's
anything I can do to help,
you have only to ask.

128
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:53,237
Thank you. But all I want
you to do is to stay
just as you are.

129
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,437
I want you to be here
to listen to my stories
when I come back.

130
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:03,937
<i>[Kaname]</i>
<i>She said it was a promise.</i>
<i>And I could tell she was</i>
<i>smiling when she said it.</i>

131
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,937
<i>[Kaname]</i>
<i>Those were the last</i>
<i>words I heard her say.</i>
<i>She never came back.</i>

132

<i>It was her own husband</i>
<i>who murdered her.</i>

<i>He had killed a</i>
<i>colleague over some</i>
<i>petty disagreement.</i>

134
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,270
When she reproached him for it,
he killed her too.

135
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:36,637
<i>There was no one who desired</i>

<i>But she wasn't even</i>
<i>given the chance to do that.</i>

139
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,637
<i>What was she lacking?</i>

140
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,270
<i>Is believing in</i>
<i>justice and peace not</i>
<i>enough to attain them?</i>

141
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:01,570
<i>In that case,</i>
<i>I want power.</i>

142
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:04,604
<i>I want the power</i>
<i>to impose peace.</i>

143
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,670
<i>If wanting justice is</i>
<i>not enough, I will</i>
<i>become justice itself.</i>

144
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:17,770
<i>And then, I will sweep</i>
<i>away the evil of the</i>

145
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,604

00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,170
That's right.

148
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,104
You seem surprised, Sajin.

149
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:48,837
You've taken your sight
for granted and become
blind to the truth.

150
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:55,504
Those eyes of yours will never
see the truth that I can see.

151
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:01,104
Too slow!

152
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,637
Ngh!

153
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:05,104
Augh!

154
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,270
Ngyauughh!

155
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,304
What's wrong, Sajin?

156
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:24,604
Have you lost the
will to fight back?

157
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:31,137
Yaahhh!!

158
00:17:45,637 --> 00:17:52,504
Here's a question for you.
It's something I've been meaning
to ask. Didn't you ever wonder?

159
00:17:55,637 --> 00:18:02,470
<i>Didn't you think it strange</i>
<i>that someone would join the</i>
<i>very same organization that</i>
<i>had killed his dearest friend?</i>

160
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,104
... You never
wondered about that?

161
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:09,504
I thought you were in
pursuit of justice.

162
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:14,904
I assumed you were following in
the path of your fallen friend,

163
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:17,437
trying to find the
justice that eluded her.

164
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:20,437
You're right.
It was for justice!

165
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:24,437
Well, then?!

166
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,337
But what is justice?!

167
00:18:28,437 --> 00:18:31,970
Is it to forgive the man who
killed my beloved friend?!

168
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:34,304
That would certainly
be virtuous.

169
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:37,304
Admirable.
Sickeningly so,
in fact.

170
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:41,470
But even if a thing is
virtuous, does that
make it just? No!

171
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:43,937
I say...

172
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,470
...it's neither just nor
virtuous to live in peace and
let the dead go unavenged!

173
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:49,504
It is evil!!

174
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:01,970
Now I understand.

175
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:10,437
It would seem that I
completely misjudged your
feelings all this time.

176
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:16,837
If that's what you truly
believe, Kaname, then you and
I will never see eye to eye.

177
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,604
And because of that
you would kill me?
Is that justice?
How absurd.

178
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:26,470
Yes, it is justice.

179
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:30,470
Our beliefs are
incompatible and it's
fruitless trying to
reason with you.

180
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:35,170
Therefore I must destroy
you, for the sake of the
Soul Society.

181
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:41,470
<i>I don't want to kill you,</i>
<i>But I'm glad I've learned</i>
<i>your true feelings.</i>

182
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:48,104
It makes it easier
to forgive myself.
I've already forgiven you.

183
00:19:53,604 --> 00:19:55,137
You've forgiven me?

184
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:57,104
Really.

185
00:19:58,604 --> 00:20:00,770
You talk as if you
were a god, Sajin.

186
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:05,104
When did I ever ask
for your forgiveness?!

187
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,937
If you want to kill me,
then do it!
But I'm warning you...

188
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,004
...you won't think it's such an
easy task once you have
witnessed my ResurreccÃ­on!!

189
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,337
Eh?

190
00:20:16,504 --> 00:20:18,604
Suzumushi Hyakushiki.

191
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,437
Grillado Grillo!

192
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:21,970
At last, I can see...

193
00:21:22,437 --> 00:21:24,270
I can see..!!

194
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:27,637
Heh.

195
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:30,070
Yeea-ha ha ha ha ha!

196
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:33,437
I can see, Sajin!
I can see, I can see!

197
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:35,970
<i>So that is the sky!</i>

198
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,837
<i>So this is blood!</i>

199
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,770
<i>So this is what the</i>
<i>world looks like!</i>

200
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,604
And so that is what
you look like, Sajin.

201
00:21:53,504 --> 00:21:55,504
You're not how I imagined.

202
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:58,270
You're much, much uglier.

203
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:50,905
<i>[Kaname]</i>
<i>All people are evil, every</i>
<i>living one of them.</i>

204
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:52,638
<i>Most don't</i>
<i>want to admit it.</i>

205
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:55,905
<i>So in order to make themselves</i>
<i>believe they're good,</i>

206
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:59,971
<i>they need to convince</i>
<i>themselves that someone</i>
<i>else is more evil.</i>
