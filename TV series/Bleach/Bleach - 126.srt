Soul Reapers.

The spiritual guardians to
the world of the living.

4
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:57,092
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

Ichigo dug deep into his soul

and finally succeeded in
controlling his inner Hollow.

Meanwhile, Ukitake's
investigation

00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:14,859
of the Di-Ratio
Archive revealed a clue

00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:18,026
to Aizen's ultimate goal.

11
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:21,426
Aizen is trying to
replicate the Oken, which

12
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:24,759
he will use to enter the
Soul King's dimension

13
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:28,092
and then execute him.

14
00:02:28,126 --> 00:02:31,792
And to do so, Aizen
needs 100,000 souls

15
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:35,826
and an area that is rich
in concentrated spirits.

16
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:40,692
If Aizen succeeds, Karakura
Town and its inhabitants

17
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:43,159
will be completely destroyed.

I never let any

It doesn't matter.

It's all the same thing.

Or are you no longer curious
about all those questions

That much is for sure.

And by repeatedly
fighting against a Bankai,

you will certainly
advance to next level.

Your power isn't like

put on your mask is too slow.

-It's practice so that he
can maintain his Hollow

You did it, too.

-Oh no, I didn't.

You liar.

-No, it's true.

263
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:52,811
Mashido was able to
Hollowfy for over 15 hours

from the very start.

265
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:56,077
So she's the only
one who didn't have

266
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:57,677
to go through the training.

00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,177
-Is that how it was?

00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:00,777
-I'd forgotten all about it.

You're such a jerk.

-No, no.

00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:06,944
Huh?

275
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,411
-What's the matter, Hachi?

276
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:13,144
-There's a problem.

277
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:15,244
Someone just slipped
through my force field

278
00:14:15,277 --> 00:14:16,277
and entered the building.

279
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:17,644
-Nnngh?

280
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:18,611
-A Soul Reaper?

00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:19,877
-No.

282
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:23,411
The Hachigyo Sogai I
put around this location

283
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:27,644
is a technique that I devised on
my own when I became a Visored.

284
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:30,511
It can't be broken by
a Soul Reaper's Kido.

285
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:31,877
-Then who is it?

286
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:34,344
Are you suggesting that
it's a Visored like us?

287
00:14:34,377 --> 00:14:35,777
-I really don't know.

288
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:37,511
The thing that
puzzles me the most

289
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,111
is that they didn't get in
by destroying the barrier.

290
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:42,844
Rather, they just simply
slipped right through it.

291
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:45,944
A Visored certainly wouldn't be
able to do something like that,

292
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:47,444
not at all.

293
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:48,477
-You're right.

294
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:50,877
Then what in the hell is it?

295
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:56,144
-Here it comes.

296
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:07,477
-Aaugh.

297
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,511
-A human?

Uh, hi there.

Excuse me.

00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:19,177
Uh, anyone know where
the restroom is?

301
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,477
Just kidding! (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

302
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,077
-Say what?

303
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,577
-She said she was
just kidding, Kensei.

304
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:25,577
it's a joke.

305
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:26,911
Don't get mad.

306
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:29,144
-Well, I wouldn't kid around
if I were in her situation.

307
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:30,877
[laughs nervously]

308
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:32,977
-What are you doing, Ichigo?

309
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:33,911
-Nnngh.

310
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:36,244
Damn.

311
00:15:36,277 --> 00:15:37,644
-Ichigo!

312
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:39,077
It's you!

313
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:39,577
-Orihime?

314
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:43,377
I see.

315
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:44,477
So that's what's going on.

316
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:49,211
What are you staring at?

317
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:49,711
-Huh?

318
00:15:49,744 --> 00:15:50,677
Oh, nothing.

319
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:52,477
I was just thinking
that you don't

320
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:54,577
seem very surprised
by all of this.

321
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:55,677
-I'm surprised, all right.

322
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:58,011
I just don't know how to act.

323
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:00,111
After hearing all
about this Royal Key,

324
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:02,311
I don't think that it's
quite sunken in yet.

325
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:08,711
Wipe that worried look
off your face, Orihime.

326
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:10,911
It'll be OK.

327
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:13,144
I'll stop Aizen, I promise.

328
00:16:13,177 --> 00:16:15,311
[gasp]

329
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:18,111
-I know I can
still get stronger.

330
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,977
I can really feel it now.

331
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,644
I appreciate you
giving me the heads-up.

332
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,511
Thanks a lot.

333
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:27,944
OK, let's get back
to training, Hiyori.

334
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:29,344
-That's Ms. Hiyori to you!

335
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:29,844
-Whatever.

336
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:30,644
-Oh, Ichigo.

337
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:32,477
-That's Ms. Whatever to you!

338
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,211
You have to learn to respect--

339
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,877
-He can't really
process what I told him

340
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:40,211
because he's so busy training
and getting stronger.

341
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:43,311
It doesn't matter what
Aizen is planning.

342
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:47,311
Ichigo knows exactly
what he has to do.

343
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:50,644
He's not afraid.

344
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,877
Yes, he really is
getting stronger.

345
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:57,777
And it doesn't feel heavy
or scary, like before.

346
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:00,977
But it also doesn't feel nice.

347
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,644
It's such a strange feeling.

348
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:07,311
-Nnngh.

349
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:10,111
Just what the hell
was up with that girl?

350
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:11,644
-She talked to
Ichigo for a while

351
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,444
and then just left
a blink of an eye.

352
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:16,877
-It looked to me like she and
Ichigo were close friends.

353
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,511
-That girl was Orihime Inoue.

354
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:20,211
-Huh?

355
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:21,811
What the hell, Shinji?

356
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:23,444
Do you know that
girl or something?

357
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:27,277
-Orihime was my first love.

358
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:29,544
-Now I can tell you're
just lying again.

359
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:32,877
-Shinji, you always say that
about all the cute girls.

360
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:34,644
You even said that
about me once!

361
00:17:34,677 --> 00:17:37,777
-Is she implying that she's
one of the cute girls?

362
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:39,611
-All the cute girls, huh?

363
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:41,877
Funny, I don't remember
you ever saying that to me!

364
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:44,111
-That's 'cause I
didn't, snaggletooth.

365
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:45,777
-Don't take it your eyes off me.

366
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:47,177
-Ugh!

367
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:47,844
-Hachi?

368
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:49,611
-Yes?

369
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:52,544
-You know I think your
barriers are flawless.

370
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:54,511
There's no doubt about that.

371
00:17:54,544 --> 00:17:55,444
-Of course.

372
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:57,677
So then, how is
that girl Orihime

373
00:17:57,711 --> 00:17:59,411
able to find this place?

374
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:03,811
And moreover, how was
she able to get inside?

375
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:06,111
-I'm not entirely sure.

376
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:09,077
However, having examined
her spiritual pressure

377
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:11,644
at close range, I
believe she possesses

378
00:18:11,677 --> 00:18:14,277
the same type of force-field
ability that I do.

379
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:15,977
I could feel it.

380
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,744
If she does have
the same abilities,

381
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,611
it would explain a lot.

382
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:21,977
Only someone like that could
find this concealed barrier

383
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:24,177
and slip through it.

384
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:29,111
Although I must say,
it does seem incredible

385
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:33,644
that a human being could
actually possess such powers.

-I've been looking for
you for some time now.

390
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:47,944
Kisuke asked me to find you.

00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:49,811
-Mr. Urahara?

392
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:51,744
-Yes, that's right.

393
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:54,477
He wants me to bring you to his
subterranean training ground

-So you had some
Ginto stashed away.

402
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:30,111
Haven't you become quite
the over-cautious one?

403
00:19:34,144 --> 00:19:39,011

be calling me out as a coward.

You call that running away?

Your dodging speed
is getting slower.

409

Have you reached your limit?

They can barely move anymore.

415
00:20:07,911 --> 00:20:10,211

pressure is definitely

416
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,244
getting weaker as well.

then my abilities will return.

But so far, there's no
sign of that happening.

I don't know how much of
what he told me was true.

But either way, at this
rate he's going to kill me!

I'm at my limit.
