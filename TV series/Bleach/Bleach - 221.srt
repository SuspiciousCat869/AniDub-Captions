00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:06,834
ICHIGO KUROSAKI (VOICEOVER):
I'm Ichigo Kurosaki,

2
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:09,265
and other than having the
ability to see spirits,

3
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:11,065
I used to be an ordinary
high school student.

4
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,531
But the day I met
Rukia Kuchiki, I

5
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:14,331
was given the powers
of a Soul Reaper,

6
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:16,365
in order to protect the
world of the living.

7
00:00:16,398 --> 00:00:18,765
As I began my work as a
substitute Soul Reaper,

8
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:21,231
I found myself thrown into
a never-ending battle.

9
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:23,965
In the midst of everything,
my best friend, Orihime Inoue,

10
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:27,065
was abducted by ex-Soul
Reaper Captain Sosuke Aizen.

11
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:28,831
My friends Chad
and Uryu joined me

12
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:30,698
as I raced to rescue Orihime.

13
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,098
Once we arrived in Hueco
Mundo, we entered a fight

14
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:35,365
with powerful enemies
known as Arrancars.

15
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:37,198
We were too late to
keep Aizen from entering

16
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,331
the world of the living.

17
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:40,298
But luckily, the 13
Court Guard Squads

18
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,931
were already there to stop it.

19
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:44,198
An all-out war was
about to begin.

20
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:54,265
[music]

21
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:31,943
NARRATOR: Head Captain Yamamoto
assigned Soul Reapers Izuru,

22
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:35,109
Yumichika, and Shuhei to
defend the Tenkai Kecchu.

23
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:38,443
And after facing Fracciones
sent by Baraggan Louisenbairn,

24
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:40,809
the three of them
emerged victorious.

25
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:43,243
However, Ikkaku, who guarded
the remaining pillar,

26
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,376
was defeated by Choe Neng Poww.

27
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:47,743
As a result, Karakura
Town began to return

28
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,576
to the world of the
living, and Poww

29
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:50,909
thought he had won the battle.

30
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:53,643
Then, Squad Seven
Captain Sajin Komamura

31
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,809
appeared at the base
of the destroyed pillar

32
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,209
to change things.

33
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,576
Poww had used his sword release
to turn himself into a giant.

34
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:02,976
So to have a chance against
him, Captain Komamura

35
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:06,109
performed Bankai to bring
out his Kokujo Tengen Myo'o.

36
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:10,276

38
00:03:18,743 --> 00:03:19,709
-What the hell?

39
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:26,676
It can't be.

40
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:36,109
[groans] Wait a minute.

41
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:38,743
Something's wrong here.

42
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:40,176
This is impossible.

43
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,143
Who are you?

44
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:46,209
-Oh, you're right.

45
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:49,776
I guess I forgot
to identify myself.

46
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:52,743
My name is Sajin
Komamura, and I am

47
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,976
the captain of Soul
Reaper Squad Seven.

48
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:59,409
And ashamed as I am, I have
to admit you were right.

49
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:02,009
I am nothing but a lowly maggot.

50
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:08,443

[roaring]

52
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:55,143
-They're dead, all
four of them gone.

53
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,776
-Those damn idiots.

54
00:04:56,809 --> 00:05:06,509
-[groans]

55
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:09,743
[both gasping]

56
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:13,609
-Lord Baraggan, we're
terribly sorry, sir.

57
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:16,576
We know it is our duty to do
away with these Soul Reapers

58
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,043
immediately.

59
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,943
So please, sit while
we take care of them.

60
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:24,376
Hmm.

61
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:39,076
-So just who are you
going to do away with?

62
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:46,843
Are you planning on doing
away with our men down there?

63
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:50,243
Or did you mean
killing all of us?

64
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:51,409
Speak up.

65
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:53,643
The cat got your tongue?

66
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:56,609
Depending on your reply, I will
start by doing away with you

67
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:57,109
two.

68
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:06,709
Actually, I'm going to get
rid of you no matter what.

69
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:09,443
-Not quite!

70
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:11,309
What are you doing?

71
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:12,043
-Don't be crazy.

72
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:31,543
-Very well.

73
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:34,743
Shall we at last get
on with the real fight?

74
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,009
-All this waiting, it's
made my shoulder stiff.

75
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,076
When old man Yama gets
all worked up like this,

76
00:07:04,109 --> 00:07:05,909
I get all tense.

77
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:08,043
-You're probably right.

78
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:10,276
When this is over, he's
going to need a massage.

79
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:13,043
If I'm not mistaken, he hasn't
had one in quite a while.

80
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:16,343
-Hey. [laughs] Hold on.

81
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:19,143
It's my shoulders that
are all tied up in knots.

82
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:19,709
-Come on.

83
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:20,976
You're kidding.

84
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,576
You're always the relaxed one.

85
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,109
I've never seen you
with stiff shoulders.

86
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,909
-[hyperventilating]

87
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:29,443
-Omaeda?

88
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:30,243
-Yes?

89
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:31,843
-You're nervous.

90
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,076
You look tense.

91
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:35,309
Scared of going into battle?

92
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:37,376
-It's actually the opposite.

93
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:40,409
I'm so excited, I'm shaking.

94
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,476
-[sighs] You're so pathetic.

95
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,143
I can't stand to look at you.

96
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:48,476
This may be my best
chance to be rid of you.

97
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,476
Do me a favor.

98
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:51,376
Find a way this
fight to end up dead.

99
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,876
-Huh?

100
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,576
Wait, what are you saying?

101
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:55,809
I'm not scared.

102
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,343
I am ready to fight.

103
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:01,209
Sorry, but I'm not
planning on dying.

104
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:03,043
-I see.

105
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:05,609
Then don't die.

106
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:08,109
-I won't, though it sounded
like you want me to.

107
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:15,376
-Here we go.

108
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:18,809
Is there something
bothering you?

109
00:08:18,843 --> 00:08:21,776
-What are you asking me?

110
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:23,876
-Nothing.

111
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:26,176
All right, stay
focused, Rangiku.

112
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:30,543
-Right.

113
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:39,343
-Kill them all.

114
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:46,109
Don't let even a single
ant escape alive.

115
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,909
There is no place for you
to return to as losers.

116
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:55,309
Don't you dare disappoint me.

-It is up to you.

I want to walk a
path that's stained

121
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:04,043
with the blood of our enemies.

122
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,309
Declare whose warriors you
are to all that are present!

126
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:18,609
We will crush every
one of your enemies

127
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:20,309
and the battlefield
will be stained

128
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:21,576
with their blood, your majesty!

-Hmm?

132
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:52,043
-I'd appreciate you
moving her away from here.

133
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,943
-Why should I?

134
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:05,609
-Because I can't really fight
at full strength with her here.

135
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:08,076
Well, wouldn't it
be the same for you?

136
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:08,943
-What the?

137
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,076
-Just calm down, Lilynette.

138
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:12,343
-Huh?

139
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:15,709
[sighs]

140
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:18,343
-It's fine.

141
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:22,043
You don't need to
fight at full strength.

142
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:26,343
It's because I'm not going to
fight at full strength either.

143
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,909
-Just what do you mean?

144
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:34,743
-See, fighting all out just
doesn't suit my personality.

145
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:37,276
Actually, we could just
pretend that we're fighting.

146
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:41,643
I suggest we just wait
things out, you know,

147
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:44,509
until the others
finish fighting.

148
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,276
-What are you--

149
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:46,409
-Sounds good.

150
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:47,243
Sure.

151
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:49,276
[applauding slowly] I like it.

152
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:51,176
I don't like getting
beat up, so I

153
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:54,776
prefer to do it
that way as well.

154
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:56,776
That's the best thing to do.

155
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:59,309
But we can't justify doing that.

156
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:02,709
I wish we could.

157
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:03,243
-I see.

158
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:09,909
Well then, this is
going to suck for you.

159

--[grunts] These two rejects
just dropped in on us.

161
00:11:22,643 --> 00:11:23,976
-Hmph.

162
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:26,843
-This is unpleasant.

163
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:27,843
-You three.

00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:49,696
you're about 100 years too young
to challenge Master Harribel.

329
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:51,262
Can't you see her
massive breasts

330
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,462
will crush you to death?

331
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:53,762
RANGIKU MATSUMOTO
(VOICEOVER): Wait a minute.

332
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:55,762
Our captain is used to being
pressed by my huge beasts.

333
00:23:55,796 --> 00:23:57,896
That chest of hers won't
even slow him down.

334
00:23:57,929 --> 00:23:58,896
EMILOU APACCI (VOICEOVER): What?

335
00:23:58,929 --> 00:23:59,896
GGIO VEGA (VOICEOVER):
Don't say things

336
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:03,429
that will give people
the wrong idea.
