00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,200
[struggling]

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,766
<i>That girl... is</i>
<i>already one of us.</i>

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,933
Uh!

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,366
That's not a decision
for you to make!

7
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,833
Ichigo!

8
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:32,366
You shall die...
by my sword.

9
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:41,799
What a surprise... its
funny... I never figured
you would be the first
one to draw your sword.

10
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:47,366
On the way here, I was
thinking that you wouldn't
take me seriously enough to
draw right away.

11
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:56,033
So tell me... Is it
reasonable to say you
consider me an opponent
that's equal to you?

12
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,799
You might say that.

13
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:02,899
I consider you an enemy
worth destroying.

14
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,166
That's good enough.

15
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,966
[struggling]

16
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,199

[grunting]

21
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:14,099
Damn! New ones just
keep showing up!

22
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,066
Yeah!

23
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,666
Don't just stand there,
Chad! Let's move!

24
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:22,099
Huuu-ah!

25
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:34,599
Huh?
[gasping]

26
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,166
[screaming]

27
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:49,433
Ugh! Chad! Watch
it, will you?!

28
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:54,299
Sorry. They were attacking
us from the rear, so I did
what I had to do to keep
you alive.

29
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,766
Next time, warn me
when you're gonna
get involved!

30
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:59,633
That way I don't get
caught in the middle
of all your help!

31
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,299
Hm!?

32
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,733
Wait, hold on.
Is there a problem?

33
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:06,399
[grunting]

34
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,299
[coughing]
I told you to
warn me first!

35
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,466
Sorry.

36
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,266
Okay...

37
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:22,933
I should've known better
after all this time. You
really don't say a whole
lot do you, Chad?

38
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,466
Yeah?

39
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:27,066
What do you mean, yeah?!
How can you not have
noticed that before?!

40
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:41,733
Well... it looks like all
of your subordinates have
fallen.

41
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:44,233
Grow Arbol.

42
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:51,833
I can see that this small
achievement has brought
you satisfaction.

43
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:58,699
But soon you will learn
that defeating my men
does not assure victory
against me.

44
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,166
Mmm!

45
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:06,399
Ichigo.

49
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:27,999
Uh!

50
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:32,233
[struggling]

51
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:43,099
[gasping]

52
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:47,666
Uh!

53
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,799
Ichigo.

54
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:55,399
Uh!

55
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:01,133
Chad, are you all right?!

56
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:03,933
Yeah, I'm fine.

57
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,799
Come on! You have to
start paying attention.

58
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:08,933
Got it.

59
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:12,399
Oh wow. This is getting
rough.

60
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,899
Well, I guess that's just
the way it is. Even though
we've had plenty of training
together,

61
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:23,233
we've never had to work
or fight together as a
team.

62
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:33,966
But fighting against
opponents like these Hollows,
it really shouldn't be that
difficult.

63
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,833
Huh? What's that?

64
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,966
[growling]

65
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,433
This one... looks kind
of familiar.

66
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,699
You're right.

67
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:09,099
Yeah! Come to think of
it, I know this one's
weakness. It can't defend
against water attacks.

68
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,699
Hey, Rukia!

69
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:12,999
She's not here.

70
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:19,199
Chad, you're able to do a
water attack and take this
guy out, aren't you?

71
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:22,333
No, I can't.

72
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:25,566
Well, then screw it! I
guess I'll just beat him
down myself!

73
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,299
[screaming]

74
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:39,066
What the hell?! Can't
pull it out?! In fact,
it feels like I'm being
sucked in!

75
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,633
Huh?

76
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,833
[growling]

77
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:45,999
Damn!

78
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,333
Hey thanks.

79
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:57,533
When its mouth opened...

80
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,666
... I figured it
would be attacking.

81
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:02,299
Would it hurt you to
give me a head's up
next time?!

82
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,633
<i>[growling]</i>

83
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:13,066
I was going to swallow
that sword if you
didn't retrieve it...

84
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:14,666
So it talks??

85
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:23,166
My body is protected by
many dense layers of
sand... You are wasting
your time if you think a

86
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,466
tiny weapon like that
will bring me harm!

87
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,133
<i>What?!</i>

88
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,466
I thought as much.
Given its size, I
suspected that--

89
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:34,033
Can you try to tell
me this stuff sooner?!

90
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,566
Damn! How do
we get to him?!

91
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,533
Hmm...

92
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:44,499
Oh...

93
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:49,066
You withstood my Cero
without putting on your
mask.

94
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:51,433
You've grown
stronger.

95
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,066
Is it because you
defeated Grimmjow?

96
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:58,033
Or is it because...

97
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:02,566
... of your friends
who continue to fight
below this tower?

98
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,633
Or is it...

99
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,433
... All for
this girl?

100
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,366
That girl is already
one of us.

101
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,533
Even if you could
rescue her from here, it
won't change that fact.

102
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:25,333
What's that?!

103
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:30,866
Tell me, were you
relieved to see she was
unhurt? Or at least appeared
to be on the surface?

104
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:40,599
You can't save her.
It's pointless.

105
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,966
That's not a decision
for you to make!

106
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:51,099
It isn't. Lord Aizen
will be the one to decide.

Sorry.

114
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:14,666
Knock it off!
Stop saying sorry!

115
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:17,233
[screaming and struggling]

00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:30,299

118
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:39,899
Workin' with you isn't
easy, you know? I'm feeling
pretty exhausted.

119
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,099
Sorry.

120
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,633
Hm. Yeah.

121
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:49,066
It's tough figuring
out how to fight him.

122
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:51,999
But what really sucks is
our attacks aren't working.

123
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,099
Oh, well.

124
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,699
I've got this.
He's mine now.

125
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:02,099
I didn't wanna waste
energy, but I have no
choice.

126
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:04,466

Goodbye.

140
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:18,138
I can do this...I can see
all his moves and still
react in time...

141
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:23,504
His fighting style isn't
going to change just because
his sword is drawn.

142
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,938
He's just got a
much longer reach.

143
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,171
Watch closely.

144
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:33,071
Watch closely.

145
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:34,338
Watch!

146
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:40,238

Well, so much
for him.

00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:27,404
What?

00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:29,904
Damn it.
What the---?

157
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:34,804
I must say that move was
a surprise... But I
thought you would have
realized by now that I

158
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:38,404
have much more strength
than the likes of
Runuganga.

You all right,

You bet.

161
00:14:55,138 --> 00:15:00,771
That Cero attack of his
is closer to an Arrancar's
than to that guardian we
faced here before.

00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,004
So, how come it's
such a pain to beat it?

164
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:10,404
<i>Wait, what did</i>
<i>you just say?</i>

165
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:11,504
Huh?

166
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:14,038
You mean, how come it's
such a pain to beat it?

167
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,471
No. Before that.

168
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:18,238
Uh, I don't know,
what did I say?

169
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:22,004
You said something about it
not looking different from an
ordinary hollow...

170
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:25,471
Well, if you were listening,
why the hell are we playing
guessing games here?!

171
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:29,038
All right. So what about
it?

172
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:32,038
My attacks put force
into a single strike.

173
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:34,404
I always look for an
opponent's weak spot.

174
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:38,104
The whole time we've been
fighting, I've been trying
to figure this one out.

175
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:39,904
Go on...

176
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:46,604
<i>Its abilities may be</i>
<i>close to an Arrancar, but</i>
<i>since it looks just like</i>
<i>an ordinary Hollow...</i>

177
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:50,938
If we cut off its head
the same way, we'll defeat
it like any other Hollow!

178
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:53,938
Well, if that's the
case, let's do it!

179
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:56,771
Wait, I'm not really
sure about that, yet.

180
00:15:57,071 --> 00:16:00,138
Just watch! I'll test
out your idea right now!

181
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:08,338
What was that?

182
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:10,404
Were you just
laughing at me?!

183
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:13,071
No. Not at all.

184
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,471
Hm! All
right!

185
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:20,871
Hikotsu Taiho!

186
00:16:26,204 --> 00:16:27,671
[grunting]

187
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:49,138
I barely nicked you...
That Hierro of yours,
it sure is tough.

188
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:57,438
And yet, it looks as
though I'm reading your
movements better than I
ever could before.

189
00:16:57,738 --> 00:16:58,838
Really?

190
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:04,138
The last time that we
battled together, I couldn't
read any of your moves at all.

191
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:08,738
I had to make guesses
about your attacks,
defense, and speed.

192
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,504
I couldn't read what was
comin' at me, or from where.

193
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:19,271
I felt like I was
fighting against an
emotionless statue
or a machine.

194
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:34,904
So, why am I able to
read your moves this time?

195
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:37,471
Is it because I've
become more Hollow-like?

196
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:41,771
Actually, I think it's
because you've become
more human.

197
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:52,271
[grunting]

198
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,904
No! Chad!

199
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,138
What?!

200
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:06,071
Brazo Izquierdo Del
Diablo.

201
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:13,638
La Muerte!!

202
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:21,071
[growling]

203
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:24,504
[gasping]

204
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,304
[growling]

205
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:29,238
[grunting]

206
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:31,871
Gotcha!

207
00:18:34,638 --> 00:18:35,504
Thank you.

208
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:37,938
Not a problem.
I'm used to it.

209
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:40,571
But what is with
that arm of yours?

210
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:43,471
Oh, this? Guess it's
the first time you've
seen it.

211
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:45,371
It's my
new power.

212
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:50,404
Wow... With that new
power, you were able to
nearly crack that thing
in half just now.

213
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:57,871
You might have come close,
but it's now time for me to
finish both of you off.

214
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,838
Here it comes!

215
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:02,504
Oh no you don't!

216
00:19:04,538 --> 00:19:07,238
[yelling]

217
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:18,038
All right, Chad! Just
leave the Cero to me!

218
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:20,571
But first give it another
taste of that arm!

219
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:21,971
You got it!

220
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:27,771
La Muerte!!

221
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:37,204
[growling]

222
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:39,704
Uh!

223
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:45,804
Heh-heh. Did you think
I wouldn't see that
coming a second time?

224
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:53,804
I'm not the one you
should worry about.

225
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:55,504
What?!

226
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:00,604
Guess you thought we
wouldn't see that
coming either!

227
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:04,971
Bastard! You weren't
the decoy?!

228
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,371
[yelling]

229
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:10,638
No!!!!

230
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,538
[roaring]

231
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:26,704
Yes! We
did it!

232
00:20:31,904 --> 00:20:36,738
Hey, sorry I used you as
a decoy without telling
you, but it did work.

233
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:41,771
It's fine. I had a feeling you
would pull a risky maneuver
like that this time.

234
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:45,871
You kind of... reminded
me of Ichigo.

235
00:20:45,904 --> 00:20:49,771
Huh? Why'd you
say that? Hm.

236
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:57,938
[sighing]
Not done yet!

237
00:20:58,238 --> 00:20:59,804
Hmm.

238
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:01,404
Here we go!

239
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:07,971
Did you say that... I've
become more human?

240
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,304
I see...

241
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:21,738
You must feel very proud,
just being able to keep up
at this level. Let's see
how long that will last you.

242
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:29,304
Uh!

243
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:36,904
Not a chance.

244
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:06,638
Mmm!

245
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:48,655
We forgot to get the name
of that big thing we just
fought.

246
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:49,689
<i>Batticaloa.</i>

247
00:23:49,722 --> 00:23:51,822
Huh?! When did you get
that out of him?

248
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:53,689
<i>It was the first</i>
<i>thing he said.</i>

249
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:55,555
But, that was
just a grunt.

250
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:57,855
<i>I'm used to talking</i>
<i>with cats and dogs.</i>

251
00:23:57,889 --> 00:24:00,389
<i>That thing was the same</i>
<i>as a cat or dog to you?!</i>
