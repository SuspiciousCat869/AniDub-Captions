-Dinner.

168
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,117
Pork.

169
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,650
-Enjoy your meal.

170
00:09:32,684 --> 00:09:34,050
-Look who's here.

171
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:35,617
Didn't trust me to take
out a Hollow all by myself,

172
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,850
so you tagged along, huh?

173
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:39,817
But you two didn't
have to skip class.

174
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,550
-Well, honestly, I've
always had this fantasy

175
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:45,817
about lying just so that
I could get out of class.

176
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,717
-It's a great quality
to be honest about that.

177
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,017
But try not to overdo it.

178
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,784
-I'm really surprised
that Uryu isn't here.

179
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:54,717
-There's nothing he could.

180
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,117
Remember, he doesn't have
spiritual pressure anymore.

181
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,850
-It's been two now and he
still hasn't joined us.

182
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:01,550
-I wouldn't worry about it.

183
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:02,617
He'll figure something out.

184
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,217
It'll be fine.

185
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,550
He fought like a champ when he
didn't have his powers before.

186
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:09,150
CHAD: We should believe in Uryu.

187
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:10,050
ORIHIME: Yeah.

188
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:10,884
You're right.

189
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,584
-Ichigo Kurosaki.

190
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,850
-My oh my.

191
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:42,650
We finished our
unpacking finally.

192
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,617
-Well, good for you.

193
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,950
Though I'm surprised
to find out that

194
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:48,550
you actually had
things to unpack.

195
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:49,917
-I certainly did.

196
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,617
I received a number
of parting gifts

197
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,650
from Miss Orihime, which
was very kind of her.

198
00:10:54,684 --> 00:10:56,050
-Are you sure she
wasn't just dumping

199
00:10:56,084 --> 00:10:58,184
all the useless garbage she had?

200
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,584
-What a thing to say.

201
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,117
How rude.

202
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:04,817
Well, you seem to
have made yourself

203
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:08,217
just as cozy as can be inside
of that stuffed animal suit.

204
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,950
-Hey, why don't you two start
ditching your gegai as well?

205
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:13,284
It's not so bad once
you get used to it.

206
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:14,917
-I agree with you.

207
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,250
We're going to be staying
at Urahara's shop,

208
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:18,917
and it's not going
to cost us a dime.

209
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,017
The least we should
do is try not

210
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,850
to take up space and
cause a lot of trouble.

211
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,784
-What was it that made
you all decide to come

212
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:27,284
and live here with us?

213
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:29,250
-We' are Bount sensors.

214
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:31,250
And now that the
Bounts are gone,

215
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,850
are roles have come to an end.

216
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:36,217
-Plus, Ichigo and the others
spend their entire day

217
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:36,950
at school.

218
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:38,784
Living in secret
every single day

219
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,784
would be too much of a bother.

220
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:43,850
It's easier if we just
live here instead.

221
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:46,250
-We can see them
whenever we like.

222
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:47,817
-Oh, now I understand.

223
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,550
Ah, that hurts!

224
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,250
You're hurting me!

225
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:51,850
Please stop!

226
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:53,584
-Why'd you have to ask the
most obvious questions?

227
00:11:53,617 --> 00:11:54,484
Can't you figure it out?

228
00:11:54,517 --> 00:11:56,150
They're modules that
the boss created.

229
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:57,950
Is it starting to
make sense yet?

230
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,917
They should help out
around here from now on.

231
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,184
-Don't fight.

232
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:03,950
Let's all try to
get along together.

233
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:04,750
-Quiet.

MISATO OCHI: Pay
attention, everyone.

236
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:12,750
The transfer student I told
you about earlier is here.

237
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:14,584
Why don't you
introduce yourself?

238
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:16,717
-There's he, as in
the flat footed.

239
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,217
The ko from Imoko Onono,
that old politician.

makes Shinji Hirako.

Very nice to meet you.

-Hey, Shinji.

243
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:30,584
It's the other way around.

244
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,250
-It's a really good
trick, isn't it?

245
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,917
Backward writing is a very
unusual skill of mine.

246
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,117
MISATO OCHI: So that's
what you were up to.

247
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,550
Now, where will we have you sit?

248
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:40,284
SHINJI: Oh, Miss Ochi?

249
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:41,784
MISATO OCHI: What?

250

next to a cute girl.

MISATO OCHI: A cute girl?

-Uryu.

253
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:48,884
I thought that you would
have recovered by now.

254
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,717
But I guess your
powers won't come back

255
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,284
as easily as I imagined.

256
00:12:53,317 --> 00:12:55,717
MISATO OCHI: I think
better have you sit there.

257
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,222
-OK.

258
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:01,684
Looks like you and I
going to be neighbors.

259

Yeah.

live like this anymore.

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,950
I want to go out and meet
girls with bodacious bodies.

A cute little guy like me
would be a chick magnet.

But I'm stuck inside.

-You'd look even better
with a sock in your mouth.

269
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,850
Be quiet, or everyone in the
whole house will hear you.

because you're not cuddly.

One way or the other, this party
animal is getting out of here.

272

This town better lock
up all the ladies,

273
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,584
and this lion ain't lying.

274

To be perfectly frank, if I
may, you're a pain in the butt.

I miss being in your body.

All that peeping in
windows and under skirts

277
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,217
didn't ruin my reputation.

278
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,650
It only ruined yours.

Oh, Rukia, please come back.

Miss Rukia Kuchiki had a

You mustn't make too much
noise, Ichigo Kurosaki.

335
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,599
Those who have spiritual
pressure like you possess

336
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:36,032
need to learn how to stay calm.

Or your presence will be felt.

Children are so

What a strange sound.

00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,966
I thought that Ichigo found
me for a second there.

It's a perfect night
to get into trouble.

It's huge.

I wonder if that could
be a Menos Grande.

Something almost blasted me
right out of Ichigo's body.

-I explained it.

You're the one to blame.

371
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,099
It's all because
you were releasing

372
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:04,632
your spiritual pressure.

373

tell me who you are.

You do not belong with them.

do not along with them at all.

Well, it doesn't
matter in the end.

I can still fight, even with
