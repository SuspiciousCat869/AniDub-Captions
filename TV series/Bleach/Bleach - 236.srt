1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,166
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:20,400
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:23,366
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,266
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,033
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:26,440
So the only defense left
for you is running away?!

7
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,906
You run away and hide...
Then attack me from the
shadows? You fight just
as dirty as you look!

8
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,740
You think I care how you
fight!?

9
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:57,273
I am a Zanpakuto whose
sole aim is to harvest
as many lives as I can.

10
00:02:57,306 --> 00:03:00,440
I have no interest
in how my Master fights!

11
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:05,673
I just realized something.
I don't like you.

12
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,340
That's fine with me...

13
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:10,273
I feel the same...

14
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:25,240
Using flash step to avoid
a direct hit.

15
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,840
What a complete idiot.
You wouldn't be in pain
if you'd just died.

16
00:03:32,573 --> 00:03:35,340
All the same to me
because it's over!

17
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,573
Who the hell are you?

18
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:55,173
A Zanpakuto slaying his
own master. I
didn't think you could
have such poor taste.

19
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,306
Izuru?

20
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,240
You continue to amuse
me, Ichigo Kurosaki.

21
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,706
<i>When I began this</i>
<i>mission, I never expected</i>
<i>to become so invested in</i>
<i>a single Soul Reaper.</i>

22
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:18,606
Well for a Zanpakuto you
sure talk an awful lot.
Is there ever a point to
your speeches?

23
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:25,706
You know what, I've had
enough of this small talk!
It's time to settle this!

24
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:33,340
Still workin' for
him, huh, Zangetsu?

25
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:43,340
I'm going to fight to get
you back. Even if it means
I have to fight you.

26
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,706
I've made my decision.
So what are you going to
do, Zangetsu?

27
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,173
I have to find out...
Between the two of us,
which one is truly the
strongest?

28
00:04:56,273 --> 00:05:01,306
If it means I get my
answer, I am more than
willing to cross blades
with you.

29
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,506
Without Zangetsu's power
fueling your Zanpakuto,

30
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,740
you won't be able to
fight as hard as you
normally can.

31
00:05:13,306 --> 00:05:16,340
So I guess I will lend
you mine for the time
being.

32
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:22,440
However, in exchange,
you won't be able to
use my power to its
fullest extent either.

33
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,173
Bankai!

34
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:40,940
Snake. Be careful.

35
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,573
Yeah I know.

36
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:48,273
Did something about him
change?

37
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:51,340
Sure seems so.

38
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:58,206
I have had enough of this!
Zanpakuto are supposed to
be used by their masters!
That's the way it is!

39
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,540
What did you just say?!
What kind of arrogant
garbage is that?

40
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:06,906
Wait. That's a pretty
bold thing to say.

41
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,173
I suppose that means you've
finally found the will to
take us on!

42
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:15,773
Oh I have more than will.
I am going to destroy you
with everything I've got!

43
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:19,340
Hm! Don't get ahead
of yourself, Renji.

44
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:21,673
That's right! You better
watch your mouth!

45
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:23,440
Huh?

46
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:27,906
If you think you can beat
us with just the will to
fight, you've got another
thing coming.

47
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,273
Yeah! No matter what you
try, we're still
stronger!

48
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,240
Care for a taste of it?

49
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,240
Of what?

50
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,606
Your own blade, of
course.

51
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,673
Izuru. What now?

52
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:54,673
Shuhei. Stay still and
try not to talk too much.
Those injuries look pretty
bad.

53
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,173
Not gonna happen.

54
00:06:57,206 --> 00:07:00,706
I can't just sit here
and let you take care of
my problem.

55
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,206
Believe me, I wouldn't
have planned it this way
either.

56
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,906
But allowing a lieutenant
to die before we can figure
out how to resolve this
problem would be far worse.

57
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:13,706
I'm not just here to help
you.

58
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,873
Remember, we have a
mission to put down the
Zanpakuto rebellion, at
any cost!

59
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:22,406
Izuru.

60
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:25,873
Another idiot to kill?

61
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:32,840
Well, that's just
fine by me. I don't
really give a damn which
one of you wants to die first.

62
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,173
After all, my desire is
to reap as many lives as
possible.

63
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:41,806
Really aiming high,
aren't you?

64
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,173
I might as well take full
advantage of my freedom!

65
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,706
Too slow!

66
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:10,840
Just waiting on you.

67
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,840
Bakudo Number
Thirty-Seven,
Tsuriboshi!

68
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,706
What the hell is this?!

69
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,840
Here I come, Ichigo.

70
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:31,873
Getsuga tensho!

71
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:32,806
Dammit!

72
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:52,206
So much strength. That
was too close.

73
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,306
Have I been able to exert
that much power?

74
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,406
Get up, Ichigo. I am
not finished.

75
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:02,140
All right then. If
that's what you want!

76
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:04,873
Bankai!

77
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:16,273
I am sorry, Ichigo.
Without my power, you
will not be able to use
your Bankai.

78
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,840
I can see that.

79
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:20,173
Getsuga tensho.

80
00:09:25,573 --> 00:09:29,273
How am I gonna stand a
chance against him
without using my Bankai?

81
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:37,806
I can lend you my power.
But you won't be able
to use your mask.

82
00:09:40,306 --> 00:09:43,240
Getsuga tensho!

83
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,306
Not bad!

84
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,873
You've got more fight
in you than I thought.

85
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:12,140
What are you, dense or
something? I've been
training my entire life!

86
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,840
We have no choice.

87
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:16,906
Let's do it.

88
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,406
Bankai!

89
00:10:33,473 --> 00:10:38,840
Renji, you look
surprised. We are
Zanpakuto, after all.
Surely, you must have

90
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:41,340
known we were capable of
this.

91
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,873
Hikotsu Taiho!

92
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,573
Hey Old Man. You said
you wanted to find out
which one of us was
stronger.

93
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:12,173
Is it really that
important to you?

94
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,573
Why do you ask?

95
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:20,406
Because if it is, then
severing our bond is not
your main goal.

96
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,240
My only goal was to make
you more powerful. You
have surpassed my
expectations.

97
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:29,240
There is nothing left
for me to teach.

98
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:34,273
Whether or not you have the
strength to defeat me in
combat is up to you.

99
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:42,273
And the cold truth is,
even if you were to fall
to my blade, I would be
content with the outcome.

100
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:44,240
Is that so?

101
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:45,906
<i>It is.</i>

102
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,606
Okay then.

103
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,806
So in order to regain
your power, I have to give
this fight everything I have
inside me

104
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,373
and prove my strength.
With or without you.

105
00:11:56,873 --> 00:12:02,706
It is as you say. Do
not hold back, hit me
with all you've got,
Ichigo!

106
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,740
I'm much more difficult
to handle than you might
think!

107
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,840
Fine. Let's go!

108
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:58,641
Our Bankai is nothing
like the one you know.
Ours has no blind spots!

109
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:05,041
The game is over. No
matter what you do, your
Shikai cannot match my
Bankai!

110
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:09,741
Now do you understand?
You will never defeat us.

111
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:11,707
Shut your mouth!

112
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:20,574
Damn it. She's right.
My Shikai can't hold up
against their Bankai.

113
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:23,807
They're reading every
one of my moves before I
make them.

114
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:32,341
I guess it makes sense.
After all, more than
anyone, they know my
usual pattern of attack.

115
00:13:32,374 --> 00:13:35,174
What the hell am I going
to do?

116
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:39,274
Heh!

117
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:43,607
Don't bother trying to
think your way out of this.
Of all your weaknesses, Renji,

118
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:47,774
your lack of intelligence
might just be the most
pitiful one of all.

119
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:51,607
<i>My weakness?</i>

120
00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:56,541
It's worth a shot.

121
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:00,707
What now, Monkey?

122
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:05,441
He probably realizes that
it's pointless to continue
fighting like this.

123
00:14:08,774 --> 00:14:11,107
Bakudo Number Four!
Hainawa!

124
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:18,641
Hm?

125
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:21,441
It's not over yet!

126
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:22,641
Ugh, he never learns.

127
00:14:22,674 --> 00:14:24,674
This is pathetic, Renji.

128
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:28,707
I'm awful at Kido...
which is why they'd never
expect me to use it.

129
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:32,707
Hado Number Thirty-One!
Shakkaho!

130
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:37,274
Someone's getting
creative. So this is
what you were planning.

131
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:40,807
Too bad your level of
Kido is so weak.

132
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:46,407
Not quite.

133
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:48,507
And here comes some
more!!

134
00:14:55,641 --> 00:15:00,341
What're you doing?!
Your Kido is dangerous to
everyone, including you!

135
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:14,607
So you're trying out a
new technique, huh? There's
no way you can beat us with
that sad Kido of yours!

136
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:25,574
Got it! Ha-ha!
What?!

137
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:29,474
It looks like that sword
is really worthless now!

138
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:37,307
Goodbye!!

139
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,641
Not just yet!
Shakkaho!

140
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:41,774
Oh please!

141
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:46,641
What?!

142
00:15:47,274 --> 00:15:48,441
What happened?!

143
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:50,574
Higa zekko!

144
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,107
He blocked me again?

145
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,274
I've told you before,
Ichigo.

146
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:39,407
You have to strike at me
with everything you've got!
Because otherwise, you have
no prayer against me!

147
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:42,241
Don't you think I know
that?

148
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:07,207
You know what? I'm
getting the hang of
it now!

149
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:16,441
I've grown quite tired
of this little skirmish.
Let's settle this, Ichigo.

150
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:17,707
Ready when you are.

151
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:20,607
Very well. Getsuga!

152
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:27,407
Tensho!

153
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,641
Getsuga tensho!

154
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:51,374
Well! It's not like I
can let my host die, now
can I?

155
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:05,207
Impossible! He isn't even
using his Bankai. Yet
this power.

156
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:52,341
You're next, Muramasa!

157
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:56,807
Hmph.

158
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:04,174
Ichigo Kurosaki, didn't
you have any misgivings about
destroying your own Zanpakuto?

159
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:06,707
Not one.

160
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:08,074
What?

161
00:19:08,374 --> 00:19:10,707
I know Zangetsu better
than anyone.

162
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:17,107
I knew he wouldn't run away
from me. That he would take
my attack head on. And that's
why...

163
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:21,074
There was no way I could
run from a battle and
turn my back on him!

164
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:23,274
Our bond is our strength!

165
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,741
I see.

166
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,707
What's happening?

167
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:40,074
Your bond is the source
of your strength.
Fascinating.

168
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:47,707
It seems I've toyed with
you for too long. It is
best that I move on.

169
00:19:48,174 --> 00:19:49,674
Hey, what are
you doing?!

170
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:54,274
Til we meet again,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

171
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:07,607
You all right Zangetsu?

172
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:08,674
Yes.

173
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:15,374
I will be all right now.
His mind control is broken.

174
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:18,141
Mind control?

175
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:30,674
It's true. I may have some
weaknesses, but as long as I
continue to strive for
greatness,

176
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:33,707
I think I'll
become stronger.

177
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:37,107
No. I know I will!

178
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,341
Well, isn't he full of
himself!?

179
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:48,774
<i>That last hit kinda</i>
<i>stung, didn't it snake?</i>

180
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:51,407
You're actually pretty
good, Renji!

181
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:56,374
You guys...

182
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:58,374
<i>We came to our senses.</i>

183
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:02,074
It's time we ended this
ridiculous rebellion.

184
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:05,041
Hm? Wait, what do you
mean?

185
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:14,474
Muramasa. It appears
he was able to control the
Zanpakuto by somehow awakening
our darkest instincts

186
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,374
and bringing them to
the surface of our minds.

187
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:21,574
Hold on, are you saying
that all the other Zanpakuto
are under his control?

188
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:24,541
I can't be sure, but
it's very likely.

189
00:21:26,574 --> 00:21:31,041
Ichigo. This time it was
you who saved me.

190
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:33,341
I can't take all the
credit.

191
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,174
Well, what will you do
now?

192
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:41,174
Isn't it obvious?
I'll find Muramasa.

193
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:44,407
And stop him.

194
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:45,574
I see.

195
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:08,307
Ichigo Kurosaki. He
might be the one.

196
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:51,888
Hey, it's thanks to me
you won this battle! So
you at least have to hear
out my request!

197
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:53,388
<i>What do you want?</i>

198
00:23:53,422 --> 00:23:56,755
I demand a house with a
garden and a garage built
inside your inner world!

199
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:59,422
<i>I wouldn't mind having</i>
<i>a dog or a cat.</i>

200
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:01,488
And it better be a
purebred!
