2
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,066
-OK.

3
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,766
Now tell me what the
rules are for this thing.

4
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,066
Let's get started already.

5
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,966
Huh?

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,133
-We'll use this to begin.

7
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,933
It'll help.

8
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,300
-Huh?

9
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,233
And what is that?

10
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,600
-Bait to bring in Hollows.

11
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:18,966
If I crush this, Hollows will
start gathering here quickly.

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,033
-What the hell?

13
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:23,066
-The rules here
are quite simple.

14
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,566
Whoever kills the most Hollows
in 24 hours will be the winner.

15
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Simple, isn't it?

16
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:31,133
Even you can understand
how that works.

17
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,433
-That won't work.

18
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:33,900
What are you thinking?

19
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,666
Doing that would put everyone
who lives here in danger.

20
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,400
This battle's just between us.

21
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:41,700
-Why are you making such
a big deal about this?

22
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,400
Believe me, no one
is going to get

23
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:46,633
hurt because I know I
will be able to wipe out

24
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,500
every single Hollow
that shows up here.

25
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,833
If you had more confidence
in your abilities

26
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:57,233
to protect people from Hollows,
you wouldn't be worried,

27
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:59,166
and you would accept
this challenge.

And that's one for me.

33
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:47,966
Why does your face look
so tense, Ichigo Kurosaki?

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,733
-Change things back right now.

35
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:51,866
You get those
Hollows out of here.

36
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,100
-It's too late for that.

37
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,733
Soon, the bait will
have the whole town

38
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,266
crawling with Hollows.

39
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,933
Sorry, but the die
has already been cast.

40
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:02,633
You should use your time
in a better way than this.

41
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,566
There's people out
there that need you.

42
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,133
I'd say you'd better
get moving if you're

43
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,800
going to protect the entire
town from all those Hollows.

44
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,600
-Damn you.

45
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:23,833
-I suppose I should remind you.

46
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:26,033
It's a fact that
Hollows have a tendency

47
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:30,566
to attack those who have a high
level of spirit energy first.

48
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,800
[gasp]

49
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,166
I hope that helps.

50
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:38,066
-Karin.

51
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,800
Yuzu.

52
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,600
Damn it.

53
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:41,900
-Hey, Ichigo, wait up!

54
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,400
-Ichigo, you are blind, unaware
of the other gifted people

55
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:50,366
around you.

56
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,866
Besides your family,
you know others

57
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,366
with spirit energy
that need your help.

58
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,900
He's lucky I'll be killing
all the Hollows that

59
00:04:56,933 --> 00:05:00,033
could harm those
near and dear to him.

60
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,133
No matter.

61
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,033
All this will still
make him realize just

62
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:04,700
how weak his power is.

63
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:07,700
At last, he's reached that
place, the point of no return.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,433
[growling]

65
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,433
Soul Reapers are

YOSHI (OFFSCREEN):
Mika, you're the cutest.

67
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,500

YOSHI (OFFSCREEN): I'm serious.

MIKA (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, stop that, Yoshi.

72
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,966
Someone might see us.

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,866
-Hey, it's all right.

74
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,033
No one's watching us.

75
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:40,800
MIKA (OFFSCREEN): Oh,
don't you have a car

76
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,066
or somewhere that's
more private?

77
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,000
-Ugh.

78
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,100
Oh, great.

79
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,100
Just what I want to see.

00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:49,533
Ghosts making out.

00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:50,800
-Huh?

00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,966
Hey, I know where there's
a nice park bench nearby.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,533

you're such a romantic.

MAN (OFFSCREEN): Hey,
Tatsuki, your break's over.

86
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:01,766
Get back in here.

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,833
Tatsuki, are you coming?

88
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:04,333
-Sure.

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,666
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Tatsuki?

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,633
-Huh?

91
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,466
Orihime.

92
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
-Can we talk?

93
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,733
Now?

94
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:18,866
-That was it.

95
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,200
I first started noticing
weird things the night

96
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,600
I brought dinner to her house.

97
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,400
I barely remember what
happened that night.

98
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:29,666
But what I do recall is
feeling really uneasy.

99
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,233
All of a sudden, I
felt this intense pain.

100
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:37,366
And I have this vague
image of seeing someone

101
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,166
who looked like Rukia
standing over me.

102
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,233
I figured it was a dream until
I mentioned it to Orihime.

103
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:47,400
That's when she said
she'd had the same dream.

104
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:50,266
From what she said, we had
shared the same experience

105
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,633
that night.

106
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,066
And ever since that day, I've
been seeing strange things.

107
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,766
And with each passing
day, those images

108
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,500
are getting clearer to me.

109
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,033
-Tatsuki?

110
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:02,866
-Yoo-hoo.

111
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,866
-So--

112
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,433
-(SINGING) You see
me, and I see you.

113
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,133
-Can we talk?

114
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:11,300
-Spank you very much, buddy.

115
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,933
-Would you get the
hell out of here?

116
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,633
-Huh?

117
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,233
-Oh, I'm sorry.

118
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,433
You were saying?

119
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:19,800
You wanna talk now?

120
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,066
-Um, it's not that important.

121
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,766
But maybe--

Don't touch the broken glass.

You're gonna cut yourself.

Let's see you prove it.

Come on!

00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,166
Go ahead!

Karin's not here.

138
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:30,400
She's probably off playing
with her friends somewhere.

139
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:31,866
Where is she?

140
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,866
Damn it.

-Huh?

145
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,500
-So, Urahara, what's
going on here?

146
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:07,500
[beeping]

147
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:08,500
Oh, damn it.

148
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11,066
A Hollow alarm at
a time like this.

149
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,666
Excuse me, Urahara.

150
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,366

Hmm?

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,600
Why did the signal disappear?

154
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,833
-Huh.

155
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:26,133
-Oh, I get it.

156
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,766
Ichigo must be doing well.

157
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,000
He's working quickly today.

What is with this thing?

163
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:39,366
It must be broken.

164
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,500
I mean, it's going haywire.

This is strange.

168
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:48,366
I've never seen so many
signals coming in so fast.

169
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,333
This can't be, can it?

170
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:53,833
[beeping]

171
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,766
[roaring]

172
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:09,733
[thunder]

173
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:13,700
I'm feeling all this
agitated heavy spirit energy.

174
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:19,766
No.

175
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,233
What destruction is
about to happen here?

176
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:38,661
[panting]

177
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:41,661
[laughing]

178
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:43,127
[roaring]

179
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:11,547
-Karin, where are you?

180
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:17,381
[roaring]

181
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:28,547
-Hmm.

182
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:30,181
-Hey, Earth to Chad.

183
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:31,147
You awake?

184
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:32,581
If you don't get
moving, we're going

185
00:11:32,614 --> 00:11:34,281
to miss the lunchtime specials.

186
00:11:34,314 --> 00:11:36,314
I'll make you pay
the difference.

187
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:36,881
-Hmm?

188
00:11:36,914 --> 00:11:38,381
I can't do that.

189
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,714
-That's all the more
reason for us to get going.

190
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:43,414
Come on now or pay extra.

191
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:44,381
[thunder]

192
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:44,881
-Hmm?

193
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:51,414
This is bad.

194
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:52,847
I've felt this feeling before.

195
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:59,514
[groaning]

196
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:00,481
-Hmm?

197
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:01,681
-You just don't care.

198
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:03,747
Here I am, barely getting
by on a part time job

199
00:12:03,781 --> 00:12:05,214
so I can afford to eat like you.

200
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,281
I mean, you've got your folks
giving you a rent free place

201
00:12:07,314 --> 00:12:08,614
to live, doing your laundry.

202
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:10,714
And I know they're paying
all your food bills.

203
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:12,047
-Sorry.

204
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:14,181
-I need my next meal
just to stay alive.

205
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:15,547
What did I just say?

206
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,947
CHAD (OFFSCREEN): I need my
next meal just to stay alive.

207
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:18,547
SHIGEO (OFFSCREEN): Good.

208
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,247
You understand me.

209
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,281
Let's go.

210
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:21,747
I don't buy beef if
it's not on sale.

211
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,381
The sell by expiration
date on chicken?

212
00:12:23,414 --> 00:12:25,247
Just an approximation.
[inaudible].

213
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:28,147
[crash]

214
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,581
-What was that?

215
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:30,414
-I don't know.

216
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:31,414
Maybe it was a gas explosion.

217
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:35,847
-What's that?

218
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:36,814
That spot.

219
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:39,681
It's shimmering like heat waves.

220
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:40,781
-Hey, Chad.

221
00:12:40,814 --> 00:12:41,947
You all right, bud?

222
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:43,147
Let's go.

223
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,547
Whatever's going on here--
it's freaking me out.

224
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,981
[crash]

225
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:52,514
-Shigeo, Harutoki, run!

226
00:12:57,281 --> 00:13:01,047
[screaming]

227
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,114
It's coming after me.

228
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:05,914
I see.

229
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:06,647
Well, then.

230
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:10,681
-Hold on, Chad.

231
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:11,714
Why are you running away?

232
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:17,514
-I'm not really sure
what that big thing is.

233
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,914
But since it's following
me, I know what I should do.

234
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:23,347
I'll just keep running
and lead it to a place

235
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:25,281
where it can't
hurt anybody else.

236
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:26,347
BOY (OFFSCREEN): Go ahead!

237
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:29,881
Ow!

238
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:31,514
-Sorry.

239
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:33,381
-Gee, Karin.

240
00:13:33,414 --> 00:13:35,814
-There you go,
spacing out again.

241
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,781
Then you kicked the
ball without aiming.

242
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:40,447
-Do you wanna play or not?

243
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:42,714
[growls]

244
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:44,581
[whimpering]

245
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:45,881
-Hey, uh, you wanna fight?

246
00:13:45,914 --> 00:13:47,447
-Yeah, we're not afraid of you.

247
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:48,247
You want to rumble?

248
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,214
Bring it on.

249
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:50,481
-Sorry, guys.

250
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:53,214
I think I better head home now.

251
00:13:53,247 --> 00:13:55,081
-Huh?

252
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:56,814
-W-- w-- wait, Karin.

253
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:59,247
No hard feelings, right?

254
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:00,647
-Today sucks.

255
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:02,481
I can't concentrate on anything.

256
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:05,781
I keep thinking about
that weird thing I felt.

257
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:08,181
I guess I'll go take a bath,
eat, and go to bed early.

258
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,681
Huh?

259
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:14,181
[panting]

260
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:20,214
Hey, you're Ichigo's
friend, aren't you?

261
00:14:20,247 --> 00:14:22,647
The cockatiel's uncle?

262
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:24,447
-Oh, hmm.

263
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:26,847
You're Ichigo's little sister.

264
00:14:26,881 --> 00:14:30,414
-So why are you hanging
out at our playground then?

265
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:33,381
[crash]

266
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:33,881
Huh?

267
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:40,281
[growling]

268
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,914
Wha-- what's that
creature there?

269
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:45,381
[rumbling]

270
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:46,347
-Huh?

271
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:46,847
-What the--

272
00:14:57,281 --> 00:15:00,214
-It doesn't look like
that thing is moving.

273
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:02,181
Is it waiting for
us to move or what?

274
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:03,647
It's hard to tell.

275
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,581
Damn it.

276
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:09,814
If I could just see
it more clearly,

277
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:11,047
I could tell what it's up to.

278
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:13,014
KARIN (OFFSCREEN):
It's coming back.

279
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:14,014
-Huh?

280
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,781
-It looks weird.

281
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,481
I mean, what is that thing?

282
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:18,814
-Hey, wait.

283
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:20,847
Are you saying you
can see it clearly?

284
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:21,681
-What do you mean?

285
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,347
Of course I can.

286
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,714
What an ugly creature.

287
00:15:24,747 --> 00:15:26,114
You see him?

288
00:15:26,147 --> 00:15:29,647
Come on, you can't miss him.

289
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:32,614
-Whoa.

290
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,114
[roaring]

291
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:35,114
-Hey, watch out.

292
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:41,614
-Huh?

293
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:42,181
He's gone.

294
00:15:42,214 --> 00:15:44,081
Where did he go?

295
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:45,314
-You're looking the wrong way!

296
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:46,147
He's right there.

297
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:47,114
We gotta move.

298
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:50,847
Hey, big guy.

299
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:51,881
What's going on with you?

300
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:53,247
Can you see that monster?

301
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:54,114
-Kind of.

302
00:15:54,147 --> 00:15:55,514
Just a little.

303
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:58,047
-Well, from what I've seen, I'd
say you really can't see him.

304
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,147
Hang on to me.

305
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:01,114
We gotta work
together to survive.

306
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,047
You be our legs, and
I'll be our eyes.

307
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:03,547
-What?

308
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:04,047
No.

309
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:05,014
No way.

310
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,914
-It's our only chance.

311
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:08,081
You gotta trust me, big guy.

312
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:09,414
I can handle this.

313
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:13,514
This isn't the first time
I've seen one of these creeps.

314
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:15,581
You know, there's some
kind of connection here

315
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:17,547
that's been really bothering me.

316
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:19,214
These freaky creatures
have something

317
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:21,181
to do with my brother Ichigo.

318
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,147
-With Ichigo?

319
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:24,114
-He's on our left.

320
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:24,614
Dodge him!

321
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:33,447
[screams]

322
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:36,881
[roaring]

323
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:37,881
On your right!

324
00:16:43,814 --> 00:16:44,781
[groaning]

325
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:47,247
Hey, you all right?

326
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:48,514
Come on, buddy.

327
00:16:48,547 --> 00:16:51,214
You OK?

328
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:52,147
BOY (OFFSCREEN): Karin!

329
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:53,147
-Get up.

330
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:55,147
Huh?

331
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:55,914
-Whoa.

332
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:56,747
-What happened?

333
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,047
That guy's all covered in blood.

334
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:59,081
-Oh, wow.

335
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:00,514
Was it you that did that?

336
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:02,081
You really wailed on the guy.

337
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:03,147
-Get going!

338
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:05,714
Really, you don't
want to be here.

339
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:07,447
-You have finally lost it.

340
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,881
-We only came over because
we were concerned about you.

341
00:17:09,914 --> 00:17:11,381
-Why are you being
such a head case?

342
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:13,381
BOY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah,
you're acting all freaky.

343
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:13,981
[growling]

344
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:19,681
KARIN (OFFSCREEN): Hya!

345
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,581
OSCAR JOAQUIN
(OFFSCREEN): Please, I

346
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:32,081
want to hear it from you.

347
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:34,581
Don't tell me you hit
someone again, Yasutora?

348
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:39,147
What's the point
of hitting someone?

349
00:17:39,181 --> 00:17:42,181
If you hurt those who
hurt you, what's left?

350
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:44,714
An eye for an eye leaves
the whole world blind.

351
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:52,481
Yasutora, you're
young and very strong.

352
00:17:52,514 --> 00:17:55,381
You are big for your
age and handsome too.

353
00:17:55,414 --> 00:17:56,981
How blessed you are.

354
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:59,147
You possess many precious gifts.

355
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:00,981
A sharp mind, an iron will.

356
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:04,614
And you have a heart of gold
These talents and qualities

357
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:06,014
make you very different.

358
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:09,747
That means people will pick on
you, find fault in what you do,

359
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:11,647
and try to bring you down.

360
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:13,981
I wish we lived in a world
where that doesn't exist.

361
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:16,281
But that's the world we live in.

362
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:18,714
In spite of that,
you must be kind

363
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:22,147
and find a good use for
your big, strong fists.

364
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:27,081
Use them in a way
that helps our world.

365
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:28,547
-I know, abuelo.

366
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:36,481
I know my hands weren't
made for me to hurt others.

367
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:39,414
They were made to protect
me and defend others

368
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:43,381
from evil in this world.

369
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,847
I learned my lesson
and will never

370
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:49,281
abuse the gift I
have been given.

371
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:52,914
But now, I need to
ask something of you.

372
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:56,381
Please, I want you
to give me the power.

373
00:19:01,414 --> 00:19:02,881
[roaring]

374
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:21,214
KARIN (OFFSCREEN):
What the hell?

375
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,781
What happened to your arm?

376
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:25,281
[roaring]

377
00:19:30,814 --> 00:19:31,781
What are you doing?

378
00:19:52,747 --> 00:19:53,481
-Hey, there.

379
00:19:53,514 --> 00:19:55,447
Hey, big guy, your arm.

380
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:57,981
I mean, is your arm all right?

381
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:05,547
How uncool.

382
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,914
Did he really just give
me the thumbs up signal?

383
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:08,414
What a dork.

384
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:12,847
[thump]

385
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,847
Mister!

386
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,447
-What just happened?

387
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,614
Where the hell did
this armor come from?

388
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:19,981
It appeared out of nowhere.

389
00:20:20,014 --> 00:20:23,181
And with it, something else
amazing was given to me.

390
00:20:23,214 --> 00:20:26,314
Finally, I could see
that monster completely.

391
00:20:26,347 --> 00:20:29,747
But how did-- I
can't comprehend it.

392
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:30,481
It just happened.

393
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:36,847
Just tell me that
you're not hurt.

394
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:38,914
Say it, Ichigo's sister.

395
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,514
-Are you kidding me?

396
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:43,681
The only one that's hurt here
is you, you big, stupid giant.

397
00:20:43,714 --> 00:20:44,747
-I see.

398
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:47,681
Well, to me, that
sounds damn good.

399
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:51,047
-That's not good, you jerk!

400
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:53,647
What in hell's name is
good about someone--

401
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:55,047
I mean, anyone getting hurt?

402
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:56,614
What kind of macho
crap are you trying

403
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:58,581
to sell me, you overgrown,
risk-taking dumbass?

404
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:00,347
That kind of logic
really ticks me off.

405
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:02,381
You guys-- you wanna
look cool and all slick,

406
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:06,081
just like my stupid brother
Ichigo. [growls] I've had it!

407
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:07,414
You just stay put.

408
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:09,281
I'll go call my dad so he
can put you back in one piece

409
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:10,347
again.

410
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:11,647
Now, don't move, or
I'll kick you again,

411
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:12,581
you lame-brained kook.

412
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:17,147
So that's Ichigo's sister, huh?

413
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:24,481
I can tell they're related
because she kicks just

414
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:25,714
like her brother.

415
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,147

THEME SONG: Nobody
knows who I really am.

417
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:07,184
I never felt this empty before.

418
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:11,518
And if I ever need
someone to come along,

419
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:16,751
who's gonna comfort
me and keep me strong?

420

ORIHIME NARRATING: With
our town under attack

423
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:02,118
by hundreds of Hollows,
a hot hero arrives.

424
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:04,084
Oh, me, Orihime.

425
00:23:04,118 --> 00:23:06,384
Can this feminine fighter
vanquish the violence

426
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,084
on our village?

427
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:08,451
And let me talk about--

428
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:09,584
ICHIGO NARRATING: Orihime, just
what are you babbling about?

429
00:23:09,618 --> 00:23:11,018
ORIHIME NARRATING:
Dishing up our next show?

430
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:12,318
ICHIGO NARRATING: Just
keep that on the DL.

431
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:13,018
We're out.
