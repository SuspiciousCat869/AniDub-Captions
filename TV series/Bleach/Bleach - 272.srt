1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,700
I will use my greatest
strength to finish you,
in order to minimize
your suffering.

2
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,900
[grunting]

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,366
You have to stop now,
Ichigo!

4
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:21,100
If that's what you
want, that is what
you will get.

5
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:14,744
[roaring]

6
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:16,778
That's enough.

7
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:31,878
[gasping]

8
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:46,511
Come back here!

9
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:49,644
Uh!

10
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:52,711
[grunting]

11
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,211
Impossible!

12
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,411
With his bare hand?!

13
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:09,144
[gasping]

14
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:34,211
Damn it all. I never
thought it was possible...

15
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:37,144
... to be defeated by
a Hollowfied human.

16
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:41,044
It's completely
ludicrous.

17
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:47,611
[gasping]

18
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:53,478
Do it.

19
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:29,378
[laughing]

20
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:33,811
As you can see, you are
outnumbered. Any further
resistance is meaningless.

21
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:37,144
El Directo!

22
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:59,244
[laughing]
What's the matter? Didn't
I make myself clear?

23
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:03,611
There are no limits
to my powers!

24
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:09,578
My branches can grow
forever, and give birth
to countless soldiers!

25
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,478
Damn! He produced a
whole army in moments!

26
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:17,378
And he's using them as
a shield!

27
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:24,778
There's only one way. But
how do we create that
opportunity?

28
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:27,211
Hey, Rukia...!

29
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,344
Am I mistaken, or weren't
you the one who said
'Leave him to me'?

30
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:34,711
[grunting]
We're not gonna get anywhere
if we continue to fight this
way.

31
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,811
Chad!

32
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:47,678
<i>Renji!</i>

33
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:51,811
I'm gonna use Hakuren
to stop the soldiers
from moving on us.

34
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:56,144
Chad, at that point, you
take the frozen soldiers
and destroy as many as
you can.

35
00:05:56,178 --> 00:06:00,178
Renji, you deliver the
finishing blow with
Zabimaru! Everyone
ready?!

36
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:01,911
Time to kick
some ass.

37
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:15,011
Tsuginomai... Hakuren!

38
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,011
Brazo Derecho del
Gigante...

39
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:37,111
[grunting]

40
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:52,144
Hikotsu
Taiho!!

41
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:04,711
Damn it!

42
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:15,344
[laughing]

43
00:07:15,378 --> 00:07:19,011
I must say, I was
impressed by that
team effort.

44
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:23,811
Very smart. First you
freeze my soldiers to
create an opening...

45
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,044
... then you attack me
without a moment of
hesitation.

46
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:32,211
It was an inspired
attempt, but you made a
critical mistake in your
planning. Regardless of

47
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:36,878
what technique you use,
there's no way it will ever
be effective against me!

48
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:41,278
For my loyal and
infinite army of soldiers
will protect me from harm!

49
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:46,511
This fight is coming
to an end. As a show of
respect for all of your
hard work,

50
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:51,144
I will use my greatest
strength to finish you in
order to minimize your
suffering!

51
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:55,311
Hm?

52
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:03,311
Huh?!

53
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:05,244
What's this?!

54
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:06,678
Juhaku!

55
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:14,711
It seems you were the one
who made the a mistake
here.

56
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:24,178
Damn you! You were after
my branches all along!

57
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:29,311
Exactly. Our combined attacks
were all part of a plan to get
close to you.

58
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:33,344
If your power was the
ability to produce soldiers
like fruit from a tree,

59
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:35,878
then the answer to
stopping you was simple.

60
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:40,644
All we had to do was
freeze the branches where
the soldiers were
growing.

61
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:45,244
We all know fruit doesn't
grow on a frozen tree.

62
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:51,344
You shouldn't have been
so cocky in displaying
your powers. It helped me
understand how to stop you.

63
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:52,578
Dammit!

64
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:58,211
[roaring]

65
00:08:58,244 --> 00:08:59,444
What?!

66
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:04,411
[growling]

67
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:10,011
What the hell was that?!

68
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:11,178
I think it's...

69
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:15,344
...Yammy!

70
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:20,011
Yammy?! The Espada
Captain Hitsugaya talked
about?!

71
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:22,778
That's right, but he's
not the same.

72
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:27,911
I fought this guy once
before, back in the World
of the Living...

73
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:31,778
He was a pretty big back
then, if I remember right.

74
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:34,711
But he wasn't this big!

75
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:38,778
Are you saying he can
just change his size at
will?!

76
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:42,511
How in the hell did he
get bigger? Was it some
kind of growth spurt?!

77
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:45,811
No. But something weird
definitely happened...

78
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:48,678
He looks to be twice as
big as before.

79
00:09:49,244 --> 00:09:54,278
Dammit! That four-eyed
bastard is not getting
away with this!

80
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:59,811
I've had it with you
miserable piss-ants! I'm
gonna squash you like the
bugs that you are!

81
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:02,878
I promise, I'll be
the one that kills you!

82
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:18,544
Ahhhh! What the hell
is happening now?!

83
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:20,978
It's coming from outside
of the canopy!

84
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:29,444
That Spirit Energy...
could it be... Ichigo?

85
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:17,311
[gasping]

86
00:11:33,244 --> 00:11:36,211
Stop, Ichigo.
It's over.

87
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,678
You've won the battle.

88
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:41,311
It's true that he
was our enemy,

89
00:11:41,344 --> 00:11:43,944
but there's no
need to mutilate
his body.

90
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:47,944
You've won, Ichigo.
Let it go.

91
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:54,511
Didn't you hear
me? You've won. You
have to pull stop now!

92
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:59,678
If you go through with
this, you will not be
human anymore.

93
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:03,478
You have to stop
now, Ichigo!

94
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:11,911
No, Uryu!

95
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:15,711
Help... her.

96
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:21,044
Must... protect... her.

97
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,678
Help her...

98
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:28,944
I must...

99
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:35,011
I will... protect
help her.

100
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:41,944
This is all my fault! I'm
the one who's responsible
for this!

101
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:48,744
It's because of what I
said... I made Ichigo
help me!

102
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:52,811
How could I let
this happen?!

103
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:56,944
I trained because I didn't
want to be a burden to him.

104
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:08,678
I chose to come to Hueco
Mundo. I did this so I
could protect Ichigo
from getting hurt.

105
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:13,911
So why did I rely on him
for help... at the very
last moment?

106
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:19,211
Ichigo, don't do
this! Please!

107
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:22,011
Listen to me,
Ichigo!

108
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:27,378
[gasping]

109
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:36,944
[gasping]

110
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:47,770
[gasping]

111
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,903
[struggling]

112
00:14:16,137 --> 00:14:17,503
Ichigo!

113
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:24,837
[panting]

114
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:27,270
Ichigo!

115
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:38,503
Don't leave me,
Ichigo! I need you!

116
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,503
My arms, legs, and torso
are regenerating, but
it's all just for show.

117
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:54,070
The internal organs that
he blew away will never
come back.

118
00:14:55,503 --> 00:15:02,037
If it hadn't ended with
that last strike... I would
be the one lying there...
dead.

119
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,570
[gasping]

120
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:10,470
[gasping]

121
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:30,737
Uh!

122
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,070
Unbelievable. The hole
closed up!

123
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,670
It's high speed...
regeneration.

124
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:44,170
Ichigo...
are you...?

125
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,637
[gasping]

126
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,970
I'm still alive?

127
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:57,303
Wait a minute...!
Didn't I...

128
00:15:58,337 --> 00:16:00,903
... Didn't I have a
giant hole in my chest?

129
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,203
Yes, but you're healed.

130
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:09,503
Orihime... Are you all
right?

131
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,370
[gasping]

132
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,437
[struggling]

133
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:26,370
Uryu.

134
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,903
I see you finally...
snapped out of it.

135
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:36,270
Am I the one
responsible
for that
wound?

136
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:39,337
You're a hard guy to
kill.

137
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:47,637
Ulquiorra...

138
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:55,770
[groaning]

139
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:03,637
Pick it up. Let's
finish this battle now.

140
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:08,803
The one who stabbed
Uryu... Was it me?

141
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,370
What difference
does it make?

142
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:18,437
Am I also the one
responsible for cutting
off your left arm and leg?

143
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:27,703
If that's what happened,
then you should cut off
my left arm and leg!

144
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:29,303
What are you
talking about?!

145
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:35,870
The entity fighting you
earlier was a Hollowfied
being with no consciousness.

146
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:37,937
It was not
really me.

147
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,103
If we're going to
settle this fight,

148
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:44,303
I have to be in the
same condition as you, or
we won't be evenly matched!

149
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,103
Hold on, Ichigo!

150
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,603
Are you crazy?! You
can't be serious about
this! It's suicidal!

151
00:17:56,403 --> 00:18:01,570
I'm fine with it. If
that is what you want,
that is what you will get.

152
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,437
[gasping]

153
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:12,303
So this is how it ends.

154
00:18:19,903 --> 00:18:21,303
Kill me, Ichigo.

155
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,137
You don't have much
time left. I won't
resist you.

156
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,937
I no longer have the
strength to even walk.

157
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,570
If you don't take this
opportunity now, our duel
will remain unsettled
forever.

158
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,570
I can't do it.

159
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:42,403
What are you saying?

160
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:45,070
I don't want to.
Not like this.

161
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:49,737
It's wrong.

162
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,337
This is not the way
I want to defeat you!

163
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:57,703
[panting]

164
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:09,870
To the very end...
you just won't do
what I want.

165
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:22,437
And just when I was
finally becoming...

166
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,037
...a little bit intrigued
with the way you people
behave.

167
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:35,437
Are you afraid?

168
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:39,237
It's over.

169
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:45,937
You will die here. You
will die all by yourself
with no one to witness it.

170
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,837
So I want to know, how
frightened are you?

171
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,937
I am not. At all.

172
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:12,203
You see, now I know that
my friends came to rescue
me. So right now...

173
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:17,770
My heart... my
heart is with them.

174
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:21,503
What nonsense.

175
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,203
You're not scared,
because your friends have
come for you?

176
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,870
You can't be serious.
You really think they can
save you?

177
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:34,937
Absolutely.

178
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,437
Tell me, what is a
'heart'?

179
00:20:44,837 --> 00:20:48,737
If I tore a hole in your
chest... would I see it?

180
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:53,837
If I split open your
skull... would it be
there?

181
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:07,337
So, let me ask
you again, girl...

182
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,270
Are you afraid of me?

183
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:18,470
No, I'm not afraid.

184
00:21:20,837 --> 00:21:23,137
Really... I'm not.

185
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:32,637
I understand.

186
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,337
I see now...

187
00:21:47,737 --> 00:21:49,937
... In the palm
of my hand...

188
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:06,570
...is a heart.

189
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:49,926
This guy Yammy, who fell
down from the tower---
Who does he belong to?

190
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:53,959
If we find someone's
belonging, we have to
return it to the owner!

191
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:57,926
<i>If that's the case, then I</i>
<i>think we should be getting</i>
<i>20% of Yammy as a reward.</i>

192
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:00,692
You know, I don't think
I'd really want that.
