1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,100
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,333
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:21,666
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:28,066
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,700
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:32,787
So then to review. This
Muramasa is the one
controlling these
manifested Zanpakuto?

7
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:37,487
From what I've seen and
experienced, it's not
at all that simple.

8
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:42,821
I don't think he's
controlling the Zanpakuto
with his mind. What
he's done, is stir up

9
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:47,421
all the resentment these
Zanpakuto feel towards
their masters. He's
using their anger to lead

10
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:48,687
them against us.

11
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:53,021
Between the two of us,
which one is truly the
strongest?

12
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:58,954
If it means I get my
answer, I am more than
willing to cross blades
with you.

13
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:05,921
There's only one way to
get our Zanpakuto back.
That's to fight and
defeat them, so they'll

14
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:08,287
surrender their power to
us again.

15
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,887
Hmmm... I see.

16
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:16,087
Well, what do you know?
It looks like we've discovered
a way to solve this problem.

17
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:18,354
<i>Yeah, but hold on...</i>

18
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:22,187
This might sound like a
good solution, but truthfully,

19
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:26,854
it's gonna take time to find
all of our Zanpakuto to make
them surrender to us.

20
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:31,321
You think their leader
will sit by while we do
that? I'm thinking no.

21
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,487
In any case, we're
gonna have to.

22
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:38,921
<i>Reporting sir!</i>

23
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:40,754
Ah, you're here.

24
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:44,787
So they said you wanted
to see me?

25
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:48,354
Yes, we heard you forced
your Zanpakuto to submit.

26
00:03:48,387 --> 00:03:52,887
I called you here to find
out if you learned anything
from your battle that could
help us out.

27
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:58,321
I wish they could, but
these two don't remember
anything about what
happened.

28
00:03:58,354 --> 00:03:59,887
Not a thing.

29
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,354
Renji, I'm really
hungry, let's eat!

30
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:06,387
I'll get you food
later, but first are you
sure that you don't
recall a thing!?

31
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:08,287
Not a thing, nope.

32
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:10,787
The both of you are just
plain stupid!

33
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:14,454
Well, we're your Zanpakuto,
after all, we take after you.

34
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,354
I've got this feeling
you're trying to say
that I'm an idiot!

35
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:20,354
Well, don't you
catch on fast.

36
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:23,387
That's it!-Knock this
off and turn back into my
sword right now!

37
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:29,521
Huh? I don't wanna. We
won't be able to tease
you like this if we're
in our blade form!

38
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:30,387
You brat!

39
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:33,854
If you wanna turn me
back, then catch me!

40
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:34,887
Get back here!

41
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:40,854
Why should I, huh?!

42
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:45,487
You're just a bundle of
energy.

43
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:51,854
But here, you mustn't
goof around like you're
a child at a playground.
Please keep in mind that

44
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:54,087
you're in Squad Four's
barracks.

45
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:56,287
Is that clear Lieutenant
Abarai?

46
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:11,887
You two hear that
Zabimaru lost in battle
to a Soul Reaper?

47
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:16,821
Yeah-imagine getting
beaten by a Soul Reaper,
that pathetic or what?!

48
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:20,154
So because you won your
battle, you think you're
hot stuff?

49
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:25,787
Face it-the one you
fought was a third-rate
Soul Reaper!

50
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:32,021
What about your former
partner-he was even worse!
He was only Squad Two's
lieutenant, isn't that right?

51
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:34,787
I'm surprised that you
worked for such a wimp.

52
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:37,154
Hey smart ass!-You
think I had a choice?!

53
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:41,287
That's enough, you two!
None of that matters now!

54
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:44,821
Just focus on destroying
those who once ruled us.

55
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:56,154
Oh, please. I really
dislike guys who only
live to fight.

56
00:05:56,354 --> 00:06:00,154
And who is to say that
you are any better than
those three?

57
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:01,621
You're just as confused
as they are.

58
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:05,887
If you want to get
slapped, then just keep
on saying what you're
saying.

59
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:08,887
Oh, did I hit a nerve?

60
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:14,487
Here's a newsflash, you're
not cute. That's why, when
men see you, they always
run away.

61
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:16,154
Like you should talk?!

62
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:21,254
Guys would have to chop
their noses completely
off to get within a half
a mile of you with that

63
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:23,021
putrid smelling perfume
you wear.

64
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:29,487
Say what?! You act like
you're so innocent! But
real men don't fall for
that act anymore!

65
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:33,821
Men like their women as
pure and innocent as I
am!

66
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:36,987
Who'd want to be with
some redhead in a stupid
pink catsuit?!

67
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:37,787
You shut up!

68
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:39,121
No you!

69
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:52,321
Darling!

70
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:54,954
You must protect
me! Tobiume's picking
on me!

71
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:57,454
Stop it, Haineko! Quit
lying about me!

72
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,887
See?! She is such a mean
person!...

73
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:03,421
More lies! You need to go
away. You're really
starting to annoy him.

74
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:05,487
<i>What's going on here?</i>

75
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:12,021
Nothing. Just talking,
right?

76
00:07:12,054 --> 00:07:15,021
Uh, right! We, uh--

77
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:16,521
Hey!-Wait up!

78
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:17,821
<i>Muramasa.</i>

79
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:23,754
I heard that you let a
Soul Reaper get away.
That's just not like you.

80
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:29,754
Ichigo Kurosaki. That one
possesses a special power.

81
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:33,254
A substitute Soul
Reaper...?!

82
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:37,487
If he shows his face to
me, I'll peel it off of
him!

83
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:42,187
No. If at all possible,
I want him to be captured
alive.

84
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:46,021
Yeah? I'd like to help.
How do you plan to catch
him?

85
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:50,887
Count me in! It could
be a good challenge.

86
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:54,387
Well... With my charms
catching him should be
easy.

87
00:07:55,554 --> 00:07:57,487
He's in as well...

88
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:04,154
What you did was
reckless.

89
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:07,154
It may take quite a while
for you to heal.

90
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:10,354
Now I want you to just
take it easy and rest up.

91
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:14,454
Thank you very much,
Lieutenant Kotetsu.

92
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:19,487
Ichigo, I'm--
I'm so sorry.

93
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:24,754
Rukia. Why did you
come back alone?

94
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:32,821
Like I said before,
Byakuya is strong. He
won't go down easily.

95
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:37,754
Yes, I know that what you're
saying is true, it's just--

96
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:49,254
It's just... I have a
really bad feeling, Ichigo.

97
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:56,421
<i>We will find him.</i>

98
00:08:57,487 --> 00:09:02,121
I promise you. Now
you just get better.

99
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:05,354
Yeah.

100
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:11,521
Ah! Here you are! I
finally found you.

101
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:15,421
So is it true, then? You
got your Zanpakuto back?

102
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,421
I wanna hear all about
it!

103
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:32,754
<i>Stop yawning!</i>

104
00:09:32,787 --> 00:09:34,487
You gotta stay alert!

105
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:36,421
You don't need
to tell me.

106
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:38,954
What the hell?!

107
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,987
I mean jeez, this is just
ridiculous.

108
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:54,454
Making me go check out
the archive records-

109
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:59,187
To see if a Zanpakuto
called Muramasa ever
existed.

110
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:01,387
Honestly, what a pain!

111
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:02,921
What a whiner.

112
00:10:02,954 --> 00:10:06,421
He jumped at Captain
Ukitake's request
'cause he knew
investigating the

113
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:09,021
Seireitei would've been
a lot more work...

114
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:11,487
Hey, did you
say something?!

115
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:12,754
Nothing sir!

116
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:14,087
Hmph!

117
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:26,787
Lieutenant!-Are you all
right sir?!

118
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:32,121
Owe! What lazy bum left
this log in the middle of
the path?

119
00:10:34,154 --> 00:10:39,021
What?! How did?!

120
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:48,321
What in the world
happened here??! What's
going on? Who's responsible
for this?!

121
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,287
Uh, who are you?!

122
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:59,454
Those were squad
members? How pathetic!

123
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:02,087
They weren't even good
for a warm-up!

124
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:10,454
Tasty!

125
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:14,121
Could you be, who I think
you are?

126
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:17,787
Oh yeah. I am the
mighty Gegetsuburi!

127
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:23,187
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

128
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:26,454
I see, I see! So you're
Gegetsuburi.

129
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:29,187
My Zanpakuto! So,
you're him, huh?

130
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:33,354
<i>You're a pretty stylish</i>
<i>lookin' guy! Like me!</i>

131
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:37,187
Huh? When was the last
time you took a look in
the mirror?!

132
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:39,321
<i>I've seen more hair on</i>
<i>a baby's butt!</i>

133
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:44,054
What?! I'm not goin'
bald! This is just the
way I style my hair!

134
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:50,954
That's lame! You're the reason
my manifestation has a spare
tire instead of a waist, you
lazy ass!

135
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:57,754
Lazy ass?! For someone who's
supposed to be my Zanpakuto,
you lack the basic understanding
of what beauty really is!

136
00:11:57,787 --> 00:11:58,787
What?!

137
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,221
Wanna fight?

138
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:08,287
Hey! When we're done,
I'm gonna force you to
surrender to me!

139
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:14,787
Yeah, well good luck
makin' that happen...
And Hozukimaru, you stay
out of this!

140
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:18,421
It's not my style to
interfere with other
people's battles.

141
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:49,354
Oh great! Knocked down
the wrong guy.

142
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:52,387
No big deal. It's
just Marechiyo.

143
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:58,321
Besides, I never
expected to find
Zanpakuto here.

144
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:02,721
Perfect. Now you'll
see the results from my
training.

145
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:04,887
Who the hell are you?!

146
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:13,387
I sure have
missed you, partner.

147
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:16,087
What are you saying?

148
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:20,221
Your weapon!

149
00:13:20,254 --> 00:13:21,954
That's right.

150
00:13:21,987 --> 00:13:23,887
I'm Hozukimaru!

151
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:30,854
You're really
Hozukimaru?

152
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:32,254
Wanna confirm it?

153
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:35,254
How would I do that?

154
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,787
You can do it however you
want.

155
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:44,454
All right, then why
don't we do "that",
you seem game!

156
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:47,321
What is "that"?

157
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:52,287
If you're actually
Hozukimaru, then you'll be
able to keep up with me when
we go for it.

158
00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:56,787
Now I see. Let's go.

159
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,303
Let's do it!

160
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:16,536
Right!

161
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:19,603
Luck, luck, luck!
Luh-Luck-Luck!

162
00:14:19,636 --> 00:14:22,536
Luck, luck, luck!
Lu-uck!

163
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:25,469
Luck, luck, luck!
Luh-Luck-Luck!

164
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:28,069
Luck, luck, luck!
Lu-uck!

165
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:31,203
Luck, luck, luck!
Luh-Luck-Luck!

166
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:35,669
Luck, luck! Luh-Luck!

167
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,303
What were you doing
just now?

168
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:45,203
C'mon! Did you forget
about it, Ichigo?

169
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:51,036
That was my big "Lucky
Dance"! I showed it
to you the first time we
battled-You remember!

170
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:52,703
I've seen that before?

171
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:57,703
Oh just forget it.
Anyway, your dancing was
perfect.

172
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:01,636
<i>Proving without a doubt</i>
<i>that you are Hozukimaru!</i>

173
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,636
This is perfect.

174
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:11,603
After I defeat you, all
of my Zanpakuto power
will once again be mine
to use.

175
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:13,603
You think you can defeat
me?

176
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,669
I'll give it a shot.

177
00:15:21,136 --> 00:15:22,103
Got-cha!

178
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:27,736
Aww! Thought I had you!

179
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,669
What the hell was
that all about?

180
00:15:30,836 --> 00:15:34,736
Hey, don't blame me, you're
the one who needs to start
paying attention.

181
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,103
You're just a cheater.

182
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,436
Winning is all that
matters here!

183
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:50,436
Since you are my
Zanpakuto,I expect
you know my rules
for fighting, right?

184
00:15:50,469 --> 00:15:54,469
Why of course. Battles
are always fought
one-on-one.

185
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:57,603
Right, and whoever
dies...

186
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:01,036
Has no regrets!

187
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:20,003
What's wrong with you?!
There's no way my
Zanpakuto would be in a
battle and be this weak!

188
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:25,536
Hah! Don't be so quick
to judge! This battle
has only just begun!

189
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:50,369
You really can
fight! Good job!

190
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,469
I can tell you are
blood-thirsty.

191
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:56,369
Heh! I'd say that
we both are!

192
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:59,269
This is where the real
fight starts!

193
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:03,236
Heh, in that case, I
should start getting
more serious!

194
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,536
What's that?

195
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,469
Ikkaku!

196
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:39,036
You doin' all right?
Talk to me!

197
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:49,336
All you've got are
cheap shots!

198
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,536
Stop sneaking around,
you creep! Come out
and fight!

199
00:17:54,236 --> 00:17:59,803
My former Soul Reaper
partner is pitiful but he's
in the Stealth Force, so
that's the style I know!

200
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:01,369
Right, gotcha.

201
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:08,369
I hope you're ready!
I'm takin' you out!

202
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:24,236
Not even close!

203
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:32,669
Uh, that was
nothing. Huh?

204
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:59,469
Ikkaku! You all right?

205
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:03,436
<i>What's wrong?</i>

206
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:08,636
Hey Soul Reaper, is that
all you've got?

207
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:11,169
Damn you!

208
00:19:11,203 --> 00:19:13,436
Wait. Ichigo!

209
00:19:17,836 --> 00:19:20,036
Do not interfere.

210
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:25,036
It's my battle. I
will handle this!

211
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:27,169
Got get him.

212
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:42,036
You stop right there!

213
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,403
We've got you
surrounded.

214
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:50,669
Yeah, sorry, but we're
gonna need to butt in.

215
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:52,636
Captain Ukitake!

216
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:57,036
What are you guys doing?!
My Zanpakuto, my fight!

217
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:02,736
It's not much of a
fight.

218
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,536
What was that?!

219
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,469
I said I'm done fighting
for today.

220
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:09,703
Wait!-You can't just go
and quit now!!

221
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,369
Don't stand there!
Now, bring him down!

222
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:23,436
Yes Ma'am!

223
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:35,436
Where is he?!

224
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:40,136
Go on, move!
After him!

225
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:43,303
It's no use. His
Spiritual Pressure is
gone.

226
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:46,469
<i>Captain, up here!</i>

227
00:20:49,236 --> 00:20:51,736
We did get one of them,
Ma'am.

228
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:54,436
Shall we hand him over to
Lieutenant Omaeda?

229
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:57,669
Omaeda!? Where is he?

230
00:20:57,703 --> 00:20:59,303
<i>Over here, Captain!</i>

231
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:02,469
He seems to be
unconscious.

232
00:21:02,503 --> 00:21:04,803
Lieutenant! Please sir,
you must wake up!

233
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:06,803
<i>Don't bother.</i>

234
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:08,169
Huh?!

235
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:09,403
Just leave him.

236
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,569
My, my. Aren't
you a strict one?

237
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:17,736
For now, I suggest we
hand that Zanpakuto over
to the Department of
Research and Development

238
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:19,203
for a full investigation.

239
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,503
That's fine.

240
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:25,403
Hold on a second, where's
Ichigo?

241
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,569
Come on. Isn't it pretty
obvious where he is?

242
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,669
Don't think you'll get
away from me.

243
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:49,369
<i>Bankai!!</i>

244
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,536
Was that--?

245
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:08,236
Byakuya?!

246
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,477
<i>Hey-Where's Gegetsuburi?</i>

247
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,077
<i>I sent him to the</i>
<i>Department of Research</i>
<i>and Development.</i>

248
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,410
Oh, thanks for that.
Wait, what?!

249
00:23:53,444 --> 00:23:57,777
<i>And don't worry about</i>
<i>Squad Two. From now on,</i>
<i>you can focus on your</i>
<i>family business instead.</i>

250
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,644
Hold it!-What's going to
happen to me and
Gegetsuburi?!
