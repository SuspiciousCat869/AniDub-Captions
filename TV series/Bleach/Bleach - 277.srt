1
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:11,033
Your Bankai intrigues me.
I want to see it.

2
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,300
Bushogoma!

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,366
Kick about... Los Lobos!

4
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,798
Hyoten Hyakkaso!

5
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:34,598
Hirvi--!

6
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:49,065
Hyoten Hyakkaso.

7
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:54,865
Anything that snow comes
in contact with, freezes
instantly into the shape
of a flower.

8
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:58,498
By the time these hundred
frozen flowers have
blossomed...

9
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:05,365
Your life will have
disappeared.

10
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,131
Ahhhhhh!

11
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:11,865
All right, attack!

12
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:15,765
[grunting]

13
00:03:15,798 --> 00:03:19,098
Damn you! Give me back
my sword, now!

14
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:24,265
What's wrong? You
worried about that kid
down there?

15
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:27,765
No, it's not that.

16
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:32,098
Don't worry. Jushiro
won't do anything to
hurt that kid.

17
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:35,431
You should be concentrating
on our battle instead.

18
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:38,331
I said, that's not it!

19
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,398
I'm just not
gettin this.

20
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:47,398
Ah! Oh, no!

21
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,298
I must say, you're very
good at running away for
a fat chunk of meat!

22
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:01,965
This isn't going to
work! It's obviously
not going to work!

23
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:04,898
I'm screwed! I'm
gonna get killed!

24
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:07,698
Save me!

25
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,531
Time to end this.

26
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:19,465
What the hell
is that?

27
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:24,931
Gran Caida. A
guillotine too
good for a coward.

28
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,598
Rot and die!

29
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:30,731
Ah!

30
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:34,398
Bankai!

31
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:39,231
What??!

32
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:40,365
Hunh?!

33
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:48,131
Jakuho Raikoben!

34
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:56,165
So that's what your
Bankai looks like.

35
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:58,365
Ca- Captain!

36
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:02,665
So that's Captain Soi
Fon's Bankai. This is my
first time seeing it!

37
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:06,065
What's with that
shape?! How's she going
to fight with that?!

38
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,365
Huh?!

39
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:12,931
That's a ginjotan! A
steel band used as an
under layer for armor!

40
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:17,531
Why did she wrap herself
in something so heavy?!
With that steel sash
wrapped around her...

41
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:20,565
... even the Captain
won't be able to move
freely!

42
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:28,031
If possible, I had hoped
to end this without
using this Bankai.

43
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:34,565
This Bankai, it violates
my standards as a member
of the Stealth Force.

44
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:35,598
[gasping]

45
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:42,031
This Bankai's too big
for me to conceal it.
And it's too heavy to
move freely.

46
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:44,298
And its attack...

47
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,731
It's too flashy for an
assassin.

48
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:11,998
Uh!

49
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:16,665
Captain Komamura!

50
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:31,831
[screaming]

51
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:37,365
[groaning]
Dammit!

52
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:45,198
Did I... did I hit him?

53
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:54,165
[grunting]

54
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:57,698
Captain!

55
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:16,431
I gotcha.

56
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:18,031
That you, Marechiyo?

57
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:21,465
Yeah. Captain,
look over there.

58
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:26,031
You did it.

59
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:33,831
Captain!

60
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:46,598
[screaming]

61
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:08,798
Get off me. It's
disgusting.

62
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:23,931
[grunting]

63
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:32,398
You gonna play defense
all day or what?

64
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:34,131
Stay focused.

65
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:39,298
Or you'll get hurt.

66
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:06,331
You're distracted.
What's wrong?
Aren't you Arrancar
number one?

67
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:09,931
Don't tell me you're
still worried about
your friends.

68
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:14,465
Come on, spill it.

69
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:17,231
My friends...

70
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:29,565
Don't worry about it.
It's not important.

71
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:53,231
Hey.

72
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:54,531
Hm?

73
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:58,831
The Bankai all you
captains have... are all
of them that powerful?

74
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,265
Huh?

75
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:05,231
I know you heard the
question. Are they just
as strong!?

76
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:09,731
I think so. I mean, the
Bankai... is our ace in
the hole.

77
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:12,398
So all of 'em are
pretty damn powerful.

78
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:13,565
I see.

79
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:15,431
Then how does
yours stack up?

80
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:20,631
For example, between the
Bankai of that ice guy over
there and yours, which is
stronger?

81
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:25,831
Kinda hard to say, ya
see, Captain Hitsugaya is
what you'd call a prodigy.

82
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:31,265
If I had to guess, I'd
say he'll surpass my
strength in about a
hundred years.

83
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,231
Interesting.

84
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:37,665
So that means at this
moment, you're still
stronger than him.

85
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:45,665
[chuckling]
Jushiro!

86
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:49,798
[grunting]

87
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:52,031
What's this,
Shunsui!?

88
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:54,398
<i>Hold my kimono,</i>
<i>would ya?</i>

89
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:59,231
I'll need a minute.
Looks like this guy's
ready to throw down.

90
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:02,765
Yeah.

91
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:08,065
Your Bankai intrigues
me. I wanna see it.

92
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:12,831
He sheathed it?
What's he thinking?!

93
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,698
Lilinette!

94
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:16,798
Come!

95
00:11:19,498 --> 00:11:23,198
Don't bark at me like
that! I'm not your
slave you know!

96
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:25,965
Why do you need the kid?

97
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,798
Because this kid
is my other half.

98
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:33,331
Hmm?

99
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:40,998
The Zanpakuto is the
heart of an Arrancar's
power, sealed in the form
of a sword.

100
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:47,131
Therefore, whenever a
sword release is
performed, an
Arrancar's true form

101
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,531
and essence is freed to
the world.

102
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:56,865
Over the centuries, most
Arrancars have confined
their Hollow powers to
their swords.

103
00:11:57,398 --> 00:11:59,965
But ours works a bit
differently.

104
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:10,031
When the others evolved
from Hollow to Arrancar,
they divided their powers
into a body and a sword.

105
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:13,731
We, on the other hand,
divided ours between two
bodies.

106
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:21,931
And when we are reunited
as one... our power
becomes fully released.

107
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:46,731
Kick about... Los Lobos!

108
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,165
Katenkyokotsu!

109
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:40,798
All right...

110
00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:58,165
Round two. Let's
go, Lilinette.

111
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,977
Ah, this Spiritual
Pressure...

112
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,210
It feels almost as if
everybody has released
their Resurrecion.

113
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:31,910
And it also appears that
the Soul Reapers are putting
up quite a fight. Don't you
agree, Captain Aizen?

114
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:40,010
I wish I could see it in
person. I would assume this
show is quite the spectacle.

115
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:46,643
Can't we do anything about
this wall of flames? It's
rather annoying.

116
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,510
Listen, Gin...

117
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:48,877
Yes?

118
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,377
Try to be patient. The
time to act will come
soon enough.

119
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,210
Hm.

120
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:08,143
Uh!

121
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:12,243
All right.

122
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:15,510
Round two.
Let's go.

123
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:20,110
Uh, Lilinette?

124
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:25,543
Are you listening?!

125
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,743
Don't ignore me!

126
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:35,343
Answer me!!

127
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:36,610
<i>Ow!!</i>

128
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:38,443
What?!

129
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:41,577
Did that pistol
just talk?

130
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,743
<i>Are you trying to kill</i>
<i>me!? You almost cracked</i>
<i>my skull, dummy!</i>

131
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:51,610
I don't care! It's
your own fault for not
cooperating in the first
place!

132
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:56,643
Plus, how the hell am I
supposed to know where your
head is when you're in pistol
form, anyway?!

133
00:15:56,677 --> 00:16:01,643
<i>The end of the barrel is</i>
<i>my head. I've told you</i>
<i>that hundreds of times!</i>

134
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:08,843
<i>What now? Ouch! That's</i>
<i>my butt! Stop it! Ow! Ow!</i>
<i>Ow! Ow! Ow! Come on! You're</i>
<i>killing me</i>

135
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:12,910
<i>me here! Ouch. Ouch.</i>
<i>Take it easy back</i>
<i>there! Hey, hey!</i>

136
00:16:12,943 --> 00:16:15,243
<i>You bastard!</i>

137
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:18,077
You're doing this on
purpose, aren't you?

138
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,877
Owwww! Okay, okay,
already! I'm sorry!
I apologize!

139
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,743
A sneak attack in the
middle of our conversation?
That's quite...

140
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:43,443
Bushogoma!

141
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:48,143
[gasping]

142
00:16:54,643 --> 00:16:55,843
Takaoni.

143
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:11,077
You didn't let me
finish my sentence.

144
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,610
I was saying that's
quite a desperate move,
Captain.

145
00:17:14,643 --> 00:17:17,677
It's not like you.
Not at all.

146
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,943
Well, actually, I was
hoping to spare you the
pain and kill you with my
first strike.

147
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:28,343
But then you went and
dodged it. I gotta say,
that release of yours is
no joke.

148
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,643
And that counter attack
packed a punch. Damn,
I'm impressed.

149
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,143
Why thank you.

150
00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:38,910
While we're on the
subject...

151
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:43,277
Your two pistols... I
bet both shoot Ceros,
don't they?

152
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,677
Very astute.

153
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:51,643
Yeah, but that's not
the only thing they
shoot... am I right?

154
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,643
You're wrong.

155
00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:06,310
And you're a terrible
liar. Come on, there's no
point in hiding it any
longer.

156
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:08,010
You're quite
presumptive.

157
00:18:09,277 --> 00:18:12,377
I went through all the
trouble of a sword
release.

158
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,043
You can at least show
me what I want... your
Bankai.

159
00:18:27,277 --> 00:18:31,043
<i>Stark, your aim sucks!</i>
<i>You couldn't hit the</i>
<i>broad side of a barn!</i>

160
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:34,643
Shut up! Just do your
job and keep firing!

161
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,377
That won't work.

162
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,043
It's nearly impossible
to hit a moving target
with one of those things,

163
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:45,043
let alone someone who
moves this fast.

164
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:46,943
Yes. I'm aware.

165
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:48,510
Oh, good.

166
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:52,243
Then maybe you shouldn't
be wasting all those shots!

167
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,177
Stark!

168
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:03,043
They're not a waste if
they help me track you
and learn your pattern.

169
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:21,643
You blocked
that rather well.

170
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:26,677
I'll be sure and take
that into consideration as
I predict your next acts of
futility.

171
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:29,410
Bushogoma!

172
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:31,643
Don't bother.

173
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,543
Ah ah ah.

174
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,077
I know your right pistol
is empty!

175
00:19:42,043 --> 00:19:43,277
[gasping]

176
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:49,310
Now I'm confused.

177
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:55,243
Your right pistol packs a
wallop, but needs to be
recharged in the holster
after each shot.

178
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,243
Your left gun is weaker,
but can blast away
repeatedly.

179
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,710
At least, that's how I
thought it worked a
second ago.

180
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:06,877
Like I said, you're
rather presumptive.

181
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,010
You got me pegged there!

182
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:11,010
So how will you
evade me now?

183
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,777
Well, I guess I won't.

184
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:20,610
Don't act shocked. You
know I don't need to.

185
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:26,677
Up 'til now, you've
only been firing a Cero.

186
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,810
I know their power like
the back of my hand.

187
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:33,010
So what's your point?

188
00:20:33,043 --> 00:20:37,110
Dodging your random shots
is pretty annoying,
I'll give ya that.

189
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,077
But no matter how
powerful you might be in
that released state of
yours, a Cero blast

190
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,677
isn't enough to kill
me.

191
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,943
And pretty soon... Huh?!

192
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:50,077
Uh oh.

193
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,777
Cero Metralleta.

194
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:07,210
It's no use running
away.

195
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,277
Hey! Hold on,
wait a second!

196
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,043
You had your chance!

197
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:21,510
When fired like this,
even a Cero blast should
be enough to destroy you,
right?

198
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:24,277
I dunno, isn't that
kinda like cheating?!

199
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,377
<i>Seems fair to me.</i>

200
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:30,910
What's wrong? Have
you had enough, Captain?

201
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:34,743
Maybe it's time you
show me... your Bankai!

202
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,510
Looks like I don't
have a choice...

203
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:42,277
Sogyonokotowari!

204
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,377
Jushiro?

205
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,077
What the hell? Did
he shoot... a Cero?

206
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,499
Captain Ukitake shot a
Cero?!

207
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:49,832
<i>What are you worried</i>
<i>about this time,</i>
<i>Lieutenant Kira?</i>

208
00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:51,765
No, there's no way the
Captain would betray us!

209
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,499
<i>Oh, you're such a</i>
<i>positive thinker!</i>

210
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:58,032
Wait! Captain Ukitake has
white hair! Which means
he's a traitor like
Captain Ichimaru.

211
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:00,265
<i>[sighing]</i>
<i>Same old</i>
<i>Lieutenant.</i>
