00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:52,110
-Sosuke Aizen has invaded
the world of the living

3
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:55,310
with a force of Hollows
to destroy Karakura Town.

4
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:57,110
In order to stop
him, the Soul Reapers

5
00:01:57,144 --> 00:01:58,977
have taken up
defensive positions

6
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,310
and are prepared for
a fight to the finish.

7
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,544
Under orders from
Genryusai Yamamoto

8
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:06,110
to enable members of
captain class to do battle,

9
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:08,477
Kisuke Urahara
constructed four pillars,

10
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,710
one at each corner of the town,
to form a giant Senkaimon.

11
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:15,777
He also had Karakura Town
relocated to the Soul Society,

12
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,044
and placed an identical
replica of the town

13
00:02:18,077 --> 00:02:19,944
back in the world of the living.

14
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:22,177
Genryusai then stationed
one Soul Reaper

15
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,177
at the base of each
pillar and assigned

16
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,877
them to defend the
perimeter at all costs.

17
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,144
The warriors are Ikkaku
Madarame, Izuru Kira,

18
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:33,477
Shuhei Hisagi, and
Yumichika Ayasegawa.

19
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,377
All four easily
defeated the Hollows

20
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,177
who attempted to
destroy the pillars,

21
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,044
but each defender
now finds he is

22
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:42,044
faced with an even greater
threat, Espada Baraggan's

23
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:42,544
Fracciones.

24
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:50,244
-Hm.

25
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,910
Now what's the matter, Gin?

26
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:57,477
-Well, I've been
getting the feeling

27
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,410
that-- that Izuru
is really angry.

28
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:06,810
-You're worried about the
subordinate you abandoned?

29
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:08,277
Can you blame him?

30
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,044
Actually, I think
it may have helped.

31
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:12,110
-Excuse me?

32
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:13,777
-Yeah.

33
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,444
It's toughened him up, and I
think he's doing better now.

34
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,444
-Very good.

35
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:35,977
That's the face I
was hoping to see.

36
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,377
The face of a man in battle.

37
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,610
You're becoming an asset!

38
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:45,677
Now scrape the summit.

Crumble.

-Crumble to pieces,
along with your spirit.

47
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:59,077
Crumble to pieces, starting
with your big nose.

48
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:13,744
What so you mean, crumble to
pieces along with your spirit?

49
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:15,410
That's out of line,
you big, ugly jerk

50
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:16,610
-Yeah, well, you said
crumble to pieces

51
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:18,044
starting with your big nose.

52
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:20,177
You have no business
insulting my nose, you ugly

53
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,677
little bastard.

54
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,277
-What do you mean, ugly?

55
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,210
You empty headed freak!

56
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:26,377
Come on!

57
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,877
-I've been listening to you
call me ugly over and over again

58
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,044
for days now.

59
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,444
And that makes you the
real ugly one you know.

60
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:33,744
-Ha.

61
00:04:33,777 --> 00:04:35,744
I don't think you've been
paying very close attention.

62
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,977
As a matter of fact,
you've used the word ugly

63
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,677
three more times than I have.

64
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,277
So, if calling someone
ugly makes you ugly,

65
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,210
then doesn't that make you
three times more ugly then me?

66
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,110
-That's enough.

67
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:52,644
Hm.

68
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:56,144
It appears that trading insults
isn't giving either of us

69
00:04:56,177 --> 00:04:57,944
an advantage.

70
00:04:57,977 --> 00:04:59,644
So let's simplify things.

71
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:01,744
I have a proposal for you.

72
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:03,610
-A proposal?

73
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:07,177
-Whoever dies is
automatically the ugly one.

74
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,510
-Makes sense to me.

75
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:10,744
When I win, it'll prove
I'm superior to you

00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,377
in both fighting
skills and beauty.

77
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,177
-You never stop talking, do you?

78
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,044
It's going to make my
victory all the sweeter.

-Glad I amuse you.

-Enough fun.

00:05:23,877 --> 00:05:26,777
I guess you won't mind if I make
things a little more serious.

ultra funky, fantastic,
dramatic, romantic, sadistic,

87
00:05:56,777 --> 00:06:00,210
erotic, exotic, miraculously
apparatic guillotine attack!

88
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:15,277
My, my.

89
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,844
Is he gone already?

90
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,177
Maybe I overdid it.

91
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,410
Should have given him
more of a fighting chance.

92
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:23,177
Nice try.

93
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:28,444
YUMICHIKA (VOICEOVER):
I didn't expect

94
00:06:28,477 --> 00:06:31,944
him to be so powerful
when he attacked.

95
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:33,510
He really is a monster.

96
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:36,677
-Well now, running
out of energy already?

97
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,577
You'll never defeat
my beauty if you're

98
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,910
exhausted before we even begin.

99
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:42,877
-Oh, I'm fine, really.

100
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,610
I was a little
sick to my stomach

101
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:47,010
because of the stupid name
you gave your attack technique

102
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:48,577
a minute ago.

103
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,544
-Huh?

104
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:50,844
You must be jealous.

105
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,077
That's the only
possible explanation.

106
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,744
You're jealous of my unique
and exceptional word skills.

107
00:06:55,777 --> 00:06:57,077
Why don't you admit it?

108
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,844
-Stop spewing nonsense while
you're swinging your seaweed

109
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,077
hair all over the place.

110
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,310
-Wha-- What did you just
call my beautiful hair?

111
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:05,244
Seaweed?

112
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:07,777
How dare you talk
about my lovely,

113
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,577
jet black hair with
it's shimmering purple

114
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,744
highlights and compare it to
something as common and gross

115
00:07:13,777 --> 00:07:14,910
and seaweed.

116
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:16,577
-If you have the nerve
to be that nasty,

117
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,210
then I don't feel guilty calling
you a big, black toadstool!

118
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:22,244
-You think I'm a toadstool?

119
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:23,377
-Let's face it.

120
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,844
You're feeling inferior
because you found out

121
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,344
my amazing killer
technique was unstoppable.

122
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:28,144
Believe me.

123
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:29,377
I understand your feelings.

124
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,377
Your mouth is the only
thing operating effectively.

125
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:37,210
-OK, why don't you
give it another try?

126
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:39,277
We'll see if your
confidence is justified.

127
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,444
Maybe you got lucky
the first time.

128
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:44,344
-You think so, huh?

129
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:45,710
All right then.

130
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:49,144
Since you insist, I'll be
happy to play your little game.

131
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,010
Let's try this one more time.

132
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,577
-Ready.

133
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,310
-Special kill!

134
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:06,644
No complaints.

135
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:09,910
Don't say I didn't warn you.

136
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:11,277
Beautiful Charlotte
Chuhlhourne's

137
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,977
stylish, dangerous,
psychedelic, variable

138
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,677
economic, continental,
incredible, unbelievable,

139
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,644
shining attack!

140
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,277
-Take this!

141
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:27,810
-Seems you can fight.

142
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:38,910
-Have you changed your mind
about my lack of energy?

143
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:41,044
-Apparently you were
holding out on me.

144
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:43,044
That's very good.

145
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:46,710
It's what I would expect
from a rival warrior.

146
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:48,410
-Rival warrior, hm?

147
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,710
You're showing me some
respect at long last.

148
00:08:50,744 --> 00:08:52,244
Not that I'm impressed.

149
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:54,744
How can I take it seriously
when it comes from someone

150
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,644
with a weird hairdo like yours?

151
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:09,477
-Argh.

152
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,410
You filthy, rotten bastard!

153
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:15,544
How dare you attack my
hair and spoil my beauty?

154
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:18,510
A mane so perfect, people
gasp in admiration.

155
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:20,944
So perfect that
people are amazed.

156
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,677
So perfect that people
literally cannot find the words

157
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,510
to describe it.

158
00:09:25,544 --> 00:09:29,244
You have crossed the line.

159
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:29,810
Unforgivable.

160
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:30,644
Unforgivable.

161
00:09:30,677 --> 00:09:31,644
Unforgivable.

162
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:33,110
Unforgivable!

163
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:37,677
Now you are going
to pay for this!

164
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,110
-Is he going to do it?

165
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:43,377
-Ready to die?

166
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,644
Glitter.

167
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:46,277
Reina de Rosas!

168
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,181
-What the hell?

169
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:44,448
[gasp]

170
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,648
-Ha ha ha ha.

171
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:59,348
What the hell is that?

172
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:01,548
[laughter]

173
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:04,648
-Well, that's an
unexpected reaction.

174
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,181
Ignoramus.

175
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:08,348
I can see what a
Philistine you are.

176
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:11,248
My beauty must truly be
unimaginable to someone as ugly

177
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:12,714
as yourself.

178
00:11:12,748 --> 00:11:16,681
Allow me to educate you.

179
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:18,981
The design that goes from
my shoulders to my waist

180
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:19,881
is stunning.

181
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:21,448
It's an artfully
arranged tableau

182
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,781
that conjures a
silhouette of flowers.

183
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,181
You may have noticed
the sleek accoutrement

184
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:28,581
that adorn my ankles and wrists.

185
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:30,248
These delightful
accents complete a look

186
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:32,281
that possesses both
novelty and elegance

187
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:35,414
while maintaining a balance
to the overall look--

188
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:36,848
pay attention!

189
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:38,281
-I'm so sorry!

190
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:39,514
Wait a minute.

191
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:41,914
What in the world am
I apologizing for?

192
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:44,548
This guy's making my head spin.

193
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:46,581
I mean, look at him!

194
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:48,081
He's ridiculous!

195
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:51,381
[laughter]

196
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:52,781
-That's weird.

197
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:57,181
I could swear I heard Yumichika
laughing his ass off somewhere.

198
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:58,914
But that would be impossible.

199
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:00,381
He wouldn't do that
during a fight.

200
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:04,114
Hm?

201
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:04,614
Ha!

202
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:09,814
Too slow, big boy.

203
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:12,714
I told you, you can't win this
fight with just muscles alone.

204
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:18,181
[panting]

205
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:25,181
-I've finally calmed down.

206
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:27,548
-I'm glad you got
control of yourself.

207
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,681
I have an idea of
what happened here.

208
00:12:30,714 --> 00:12:33,681
From what I can tell, you
were so dazzled by my beauty,

209
00:12:33,714 --> 00:12:37,081
it threw you completely
into hysterics.

210
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:38,048
Isn't that right?

211
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:44,248
Ah!

212
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:46,514
-He's faster than he was before!

213
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:49,714
-Ready for a surprise attack?

214
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:51,014
-Huh?

215
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:51,881
Damn.

216
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:52,381
-Ha!

217
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:04,981
-Dammit.

218
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:09,781
That single assault broke my
arm in three different places.

219
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:11,481
-Yoo-hoo!

220
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:15,148
So, are you beginning to
appreciate my beauty yet?

221
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:16,281
How about a closer look?

222
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:17,048
-Not a chance.

223
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:25,448
CHARLOTTE: I guess you
need more instruction.

224
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:28,081
But don't worry, I can help.

225
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:29,381
Be thankful.

226
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:31,448
I'm going to be giving you
a customized beauty lesson.

227
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,248
-I think I'll pass.

228
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,314
I'm not interested in
experiencing your wacko

229
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:38,381
aesthetics.

230
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:39,114
-Oh!

231
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:40,148
Wacko?

232
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,348
-Now bloom, Fuji Kujaku.

233
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:54,048
[gasping]

234
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:57,348
-Heh, heh, heh.

235
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:58,414
-Sorry.

236
00:13:58,448 --> 00:13:59,548
Fooled ya.

237
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:00,048
-What?

238
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,281
-Your weapon is Fuji Kujaku.

239
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:08,214
How appropriate its
name would be so plain.

240
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:13,348
But it's completely ineffectual,
even though it has four blades.

241
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:16,281
[shouting]

242
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:21,681
[scream]

243
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:32,181
-Custom Kill!

244
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:34,581
Beautiful Charlotte
Chulhourne's lovely, fanatic,

245
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:37,081
frenetic, artistic, aquatic,
gigantic, climactic, dynamic,

246
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:42,748
didactic, historic--
oh, I bit my tongue.

247
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,214
Here comes my Thunder Punch!

248
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:08,081
Pity.

249
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:11,114
Biting my tongue caused my
attack to lose half its power.

250
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:13,348
But did you notice how
both my speed and power

251
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:16,114
have increased
since I transformed?

252
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,048
You have to understand, it's
all because of my beauty.

253
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:23,348
Can you feel it?

254
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,781
You have to admit, it's
truly overwhelming.

255
00:15:26,814 --> 00:15:29,481
Power is beauty.

256
00:15:29,514 --> 00:15:31,781
Beauty is power.

257
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:33,448
Isn't it about time
you opened your mind

258
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:34,914
and accepted that idea?

259
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:39,948
-I can't accept it.

260
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,248
-I see.

261
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:46,548
So you're unable to
understand what I'm saying?

262
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:47,781
OK, all right.

263
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,981
I can forgive you.

264
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,181
The fact is, when
you think about it,

265
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:54,648
it isn't a crime to like
an appreciation of beauty.

266
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:59,081
I'm sure lots of people are
deficient in that regard.

267
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:01,614
Truthfully, it's
something to be pitied.

268
00:16:01,648 --> 00:16:04,248
-Oh, really?

269
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:06,281
CHARLOTTE: Living with
such a vulgar aesthetic

270
00:16:06,314 --> 00:16:10,348
must be absolute
torture for you.

271
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:14,614
Believe me, I have the utmost
sympathy for your condition.

272
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:19,014
In fact, since I am the object
of your tortured ignorance,

273
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:22,248
relieving your pain is my duty.

274
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,548
-You like to flap your gums
in the wind, don't you?

275
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,448
-Please accept this.

276
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:35,548
Special kill, beautiful
Charlotte Chulhourne's

277
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:37,681
delicious, apparitious,
superstitious, surreptious,

278
00:16:37,714 --> 00:16:40,648
expeditious, ceremonious,
felonious, glorious,

279
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:43,881
uproarious, sexy,
sexy, glamorous Cero!

280
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:48,714
-It's just an ordinary Cero!

281
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,448
Damn.

282
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:57,848
That's a dirty little technique.

283
00:16:57,881 --> 00:17:00,681
The attack is so broad, there's
nowhere to get away from it.

284
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,381
It's over!

285
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:13,448
-Oh, really?

286
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:13,948
For whom?

287
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:20,148
-You still think those
blades give you an advantage?

288
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:21,548
Forget it!

289
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:22,248
-Wait a minute.

290
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,214
-Now do you get it?

291
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:35,614
If I say it's over,
believe it, my friend.

292
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:47,516
A princess always gets her way.

293
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,050
It may not be fair, but
that's the way things are.

294
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:15,716
-This blackness.

295
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,416
What is it?

296
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:20,016
-Rosa Blanca.

297
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,850
The Sentence of the White Rose.

298
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:26,650
My most beautiful, and my
most cruel battle technique.

299
00:18:30,716 --> 00:18:34,183
You're enveloped in this
brier covered with black.

300
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:35,516
This is your fate.

301
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,250
You will die here,
unseen by anyone,

302
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,883
smothered in white petals.

303
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:47,183
-Completely unseen by anyone?

304
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:48,750
-That's right.

305
00:18:48,783 --> 00:18:52,850
The ebony black brier shuts
out all views from the outside.

306
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:55,516
It's so efficient
that no one will even

307
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:01,350
be able to detect the presence
of your spiritual pressure.

308
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:04,783
Your life force will continue to
weaken until it's extinguished.

309
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:07,983
The moment of your death
will go entirely unnoticed.

310
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:12,116
It's an ugly way to die,
alone and unmourned.

311
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,750
But it's a fitting end for an
ugly little warrior like you,

312
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:18,916
who has no sense of grace
or beauty in his life.

313
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,916
-No one can see in here at all?

314
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:35,416
In that case, thank you.

315
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:35,916
-Huh?

316
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,383
Tear in frenzy, Ruri'iro Kujaku.

317
00:19:58,183 --> 00:19:59,150
[gasp]

318
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,016
[gasp]

319
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,016
-What is all this?

320
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,916
-The final act.

321
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,150
Look around.

322
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:39,650
-Are those buds?

323
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:40,816
Why are they growing?

324
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:51,050
-Your spirit energy is slowly
collecting within these blooms.

325
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,350
-What are you saying?

326
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:56,183
-The flowers are feasting
on your life force.

327
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:58,483
All the spirit
energy you radiate

328
00:20:58,516 --> 00:21:01,383
is being stolen absorbed
into these buds.

329
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,283
Do you understand?

330
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,050
-Why did you wait to
use such a technique?

331
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,250
-If you had fought
an ordinary battle,

332
00:21:13,283 --> 00:21:16,983
I wouldn't have had
to use it at all.

333
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:19,950
However, you isolated us.

334
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:22,316
You created a space where
no one could see in,

335
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,916
and nothing that happened
inside would ever be revealed.

336
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,383
It was the perfect place
to use my secret weapon.

337
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:32,616
This way, when you're gone
it will remain a secret.

338
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,750
You've created your
own death trap.

339
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:38,083
Think of it as an honor.

340
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:41,650
You're the only one who will
ever see my Ruri'iro Kujaku.

341
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:44,150
-Ruri'iru Kujaku?

342
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:47,116
-Your time is almost over.

343
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,850
The moment those
flowers bloom will

344
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:52,583
be the moment your life
ends, Charlotte Chulhourne.

345
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:56,583
-No!

346
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:22,785

347
00:23:46,476 --> 00:23:48,909
YUMICHIKA: Those blooms really
made the end of the episode.

348
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:51,242
I wonder, though, do you think
your screen was big enough?

349
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:52,142
CHARLOTTE: Well, now
that I think about it,

350
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:53,076
you make a good point.

351
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:54,076
I'll tell you what?

352
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:55,509
Why don't I just do it over?

353
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:56,409
YUMICHIKA: Mm, sorry.

354
00:23:56,442 --> 00:23:57,742
We don't have time for that.

355
00:23:57,776 --> 00:23:59,442
CHARLOTTE: No!
