[theme song]

2
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,108
NARRATOR: Ichigo
and Rukia returned

3
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:54,342
to the Soul Society in
search of Princess Rurichiyo

4
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,775
where they disrupted what
they thought was her wedding,

5
00:01:56,808 --> 00:02:01,075
but ended up falling into a trap
set by Gyokakku Kumoi instead.

6
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:05,308
They were soon surrounded
by Soi Fon and Squad Two.

7
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:07,075
Ichigo and Rukia
managed to escape

8
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:10,108
into an underground passageway,
but when they emerged,

9
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:12,075
Squad Three was
waiting for them,

10
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:14,808
and Ichigo was forced
into an unexpected battle

11
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:17,142
against Captain Shusuke Amagai.

12
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:20,342
Shu Kannogi selflessly threw
himself between the two men

13
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,675
to stop the fight.

14
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,742
He told the captain about the
plight of the Kasumioji Clan

15
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:26,508
and Shusuke decided
to help them.

16
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,242
-Move quickly, everyone.

17
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:32,908
Don't stop.

18
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,108
-This is all such a pain.

19
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:46,908
-Lieutenant Omaeda.

20
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:48,475
-Hm?

21
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:51,108
-The security team is
ready for deployment,

22
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:52,875
awaiting your orders, sir.

23
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:54,708
-Hold position.

24
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:55,775
-Pardon?

25
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,508
-All morning long,
every one of the squads

26
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,608
has been out dealing with this.

27
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:02,842
Now even the punishment
force is getting

28
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,008
in on it, which means besides
parking ourselves right here

29
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:08,908
and taking a break, there's
nothing for us to do.

30
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:26,675
IZURU (VOICEOVER): This would
be the most likely place

31
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:30,475
for Makoto to try and hide out.

32
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:32,208
But with all those
court guards around,

33
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:35,008
it would be tough for
him to go unnoticed.

34
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,808
He must be somewhere else.

35
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:47,508
-What's this?

36
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:50,408
The captain and Ichigo Kurosaki?

37
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:53,675
A Kasumioji Clan conspiracy?

38
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,675
-So what's the next step?

39
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,008
-There are a few places I
think we should check out.

40
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:00,908
-Just the four of us?

41
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:04,342
-I'm only helping you people
for my own personal reasons.

42
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,308
I can't involve my
squad in this affair.

43
00:04:07,342 --> 00:04:10,008
I sent them back
to the barracks.

44
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:14,442
However, Aida and a few others
have agreed to pitch in.

45
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:17,042
-I'm curious, why
are you so willing

46
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,308
to drop everything and help us?

47
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,908
You might be making enemies
of other Soul Reapers.

48
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:26,875
-Like I said, I have my
own personal interests.

49
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:29,442
-Would you mind elaborating
on what they might be?

50
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:30,208
-Huh.

51
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:31,875
Sure, I suppose I could.

52
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:34,308
But first, we should
really get out of here.

53
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,642
I'll explain everything
while we move.

54
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:37,742
-Right.

55
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:38,308
Shu.

56
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:39,242
-Oh, yes.

57
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,075
-Huh?

58
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:49,042
-Huh?

59
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:51,375
-We'd better tell
Captain Komamura.

60
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:54,108
-Uh, right.

61
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:56,042
-There's a man
named Makoto who's

62
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:57,842
the third seat in my squad.

63
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,642
He's extremely capable,
but I've learned

64
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,475
he's somehow connected
to the Kasumioji Clan.

65
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:05,008
-One of your own men?

66
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:08,075
-What's more, he's kept
that connection a secret.

67
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,842
Even before you people showed
up, something wasn't right.

68
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,575
I was suspicious.

69
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:17,375
-In this incident, do you think
he's somehow involved with it?

70
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:18,542
-I don't know.

71
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:21,742
But just in case, I had
Izuru keep an eye on him,

72
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:25,608
and Makoto's been missing
since this morning.

73
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:28,042
In fact, Izuru's
searching for him now.

74
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:30,675
-So that's why he
wasn't with you?

75
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,542
-It's troubling to
suspect one of my own,

76
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:36,442
but I have a bad
feeling about this.

77
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:38,308
-Then instead of
shuttling us around,

78
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:40,742
shouldn't you go and report
this to your higher ups?

79
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:43,275
-Makoto is someone
I chose personally.

80
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:47,308
If he turns out to be a traitor,
it'll be my responsibility.

81
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:51,075
When I find him, I have
to deal with him myself.

82
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:53,475
And besides, it's not that easy.

83
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:57,442
The 13 Court Guard Squads is
a very stubborn bureaucracy.

84
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:59,675
It'd take forever to
get their approval.

85
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,542
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

86
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:04,108
-Excuse me, but
didn't you say you

87
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:06,842
might have an idea where
Rurichiyo might be?

88
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,175
-Just a hunch.

89
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,942
First I want to check out some
spots inside the Kasumioji

90
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:11,442
palace.

91
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,875
-And that is the end of
Captain Komamura's message.

92
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:18,608
-Hm.

93
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:20,042
Very well.

94
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:21,442
You're dismissed.

95
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:23,675
-Yes, sir.

96
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,475
-Well, Head Captain?

97
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:27,342
So what do you think?

98
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:31,008
-Make it known to all squads
the captain of Squad Three,

99
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:35,542
Shusuke Amagai, is now under
suspicion of grave offenses.

100
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:38,408
He is to be brought
in immediately.

101
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:39,575
-Sir!

102
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:43,042
-And call a captain's
meeting, now!

103
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:44,275
-What's that?

104
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:46,075
-What did Shusuke do?

105
00:06:46,108 --> 00:06:47,042
-It's true.

106
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:48,775
The members of Squad
Seven witnessed

107
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,675
him operating in collusion
with Ichigo Kurosaki.

108
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:53,975
-Oh, great.

109
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:56,442
That must be why
we got called in.

110
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:57,575
-What's going on?

111
00:06:57,608 --> 00:07:00,242
It just doesn't make any sense.

112
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:01,542
-I have no idea.

113
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:04,042
I'm worried.

114
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,042
-Me too.

115
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:08,942
Things are about
to get complicated.

116
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:10,708
-Listen up!

117
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:13,175
We're the ones who
uncovered this whole thing,

118
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,108
and we're not losing
out to the other squads!

119
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:18,342
-That's right!

120
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,908
-So where was he?

121
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:22,175
Did you see him
around here, guys?

122
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,008
-Yes sir.

123
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,842
That is correct.

124
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,775
-Captain Amagai.

125
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:27,108
Why would he do this?

126
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,275
Hm?

127
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:36,175
Mind telling me what you
think you're doing here?

128
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,675
Huh, Renji?

129
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,442
-Well, isn't it obvious?

130
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,942
We're looking for the
same people as you.

131
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,275
-Oh really?

132
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:45,508
So you came all
the way out here?

133
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:48,842
It's awful far from your
squad's assigned position.

134
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,142
-I was told your men were the
first to see them out here.

135
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:54,508
Ichigo and Captain Amagai.

136
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,308
So it wouldn't be
a stretch to assume

137
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,875
they're still in
the area, right?

138
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:00,775
-That's a pretty safe bet.

139
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:04,075
But you're standing in my
squad's assigned section.

140
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,308
If I were you, I'd follow
orders and cover your own area.

141
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:17,208
What do you think
you're doing, Renji?

142
00:08:17,242 --> 00:08:19,975
Didn't you hear me
tell you to go back?

143
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:24,175
-Well, I apologize, but I
won't let you stand in my way.

144
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,908
-What was that?

145
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:32,975
-Run like your
lives depend on it!

146
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:34,742
-I don't give a damn
about some substitute

147
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,542
Soul Reaper or Squad
Three's Captain!

148
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:41,475
But if there's a fight, Squad
11's gonna get there first!

149
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:41,975
Huh?

150
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:49,975
-Hey, you're, uh--

151
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:52,742
-Lieutenant Hisagi of Squad 9!

152
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:55,375
-You're in Squad 9's area.

153
00:08:55,408 --> 00:08:58,208
Go back to your barracks.

154
00:08:58,242 --> 00:08:59,475
-How dare you!

155
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:01,708
Are you looking for
a fight here, Mister?

156
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,375
-Just because
you're a lieutenant

157
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:05,875
doesn't mean you can order
our squad around like that!

158
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:08,608
-Yeah, what do you
take us for, idiots?

159
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:10,008
-No.

160
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:12,975
I was an idiot for assuming I
could reason with you people.

161
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:16,008
I should've just used
force from the beginning.

162
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,442
-Huh?

163
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:18,275
-Oh yeah?

164
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,542
Well if that's what you want--

165
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:21,208
-Hold it!

166
00:09:25,342 --> 00:09:28,275
I'll gladly take you on, Shuhei.

167
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:28,775
-Ikkaku.

168
00:09:32,342 --> 00:09:34,042
-Now, I don't pretend
to know what's

169
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:37,142
going on inside
Captain Amagai's head,

170
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:40,208
but there is one thing
I'm certain about.

171
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:43,242
I know Ichigo and Rukia better
than anyone else looking

172
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:47,575
for them, so I'm asking
you to let me through.

173
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:50,175
This isn't something you
want your squad involved in.

174
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,208
Please trust me.

175
00:09:52,242 --> 00:09:53,775
-You have a point.

176
00:09:53,808 --> 00:09:56,208
This substitute
Soul Reaper-- you do

177
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:57,875
know what makes him tick.

178
00:09:57,908 --> 00:10:00,308
However, an order is an order.

179
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:03,875
I cannot abandon the assignment
I was given, and Renji,

180
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:05,608
the same goes for you.

181
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:08,108
So set aside whatever
personal feelings

182
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:11,675
you have and start acting like
a lieutenant, because if you

183
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:18,708
can't, I'll make you leave
even if I have to kill you.

184
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:20,275
-Is that so?

185
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:23,842
I was hoping you'd be a little
more understanding about this.

186
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,008
But if that's the case,
then I have no other choice.

187
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:33,542
I'm passing through, and
nothing will stop me.

188
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:36,608
-Well, this is
certainly a problem.

189
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:38,075
Men, listen up.

190
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:39,108
Stay put.

191
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:40,142
No one interferes.

192
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:54,242
-Anything?

193
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:56,842
-Well, no one's seen
anyone suspicious.

194
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,808
-I see.

195
00:10:57,842 --> 00:11:00,175
-And now there's
something even worse.

196
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,642
Word has gotten out about
Captain Amagai working

197
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:04,375
with the substitute Soul Reaper.

198
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:05,775
-What did you say?

199
00:11:05,808 --> 00:11:08,875
-But Inose, how were you able to
speak with the head of security

200
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:11,508
with all this going on?

201
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,242
-From what I gather,
they all assume

202
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:15,375
the captain has been
acting on his own.

203
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,608
Our squad isn't under suspicion.

204
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:19,042
-I see.

205
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:21,242
-I'm worried about
Captain Amagain.

206
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:24,775
He seems to completely trust
the substitute Soul Reaper.

207
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:27,975
How do we know he's
not making a mistake?

208
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:29,042
-Hmm.

209
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:32,142
Well, uh, I'm not
really sure about that.

210
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:35,008
-Up until now, we never
thought about things like that.

211
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,808
Lieutenant Kira and
Third Seat Kibune did.

212
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:40,342
-Speaking of which,
where is Lieutenant Kira?

213
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,675
-He's been gone all
morning carrying out

214
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,342
the captain's orders.

215
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,842
-Man, what is
going on out there?

216
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:01,675
-I guess searching
randomly is pointless.

217
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,842
Still, why did Makoto choose
this moment to go into hiding?

218
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,775
Is it connected to the
appearance of Ichigo Kurosaki

219
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:09,375
and the others, or not?

220
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:21,342
Well, in any case, I have
to find him, and quick.

221
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,908
But where could he be?

222
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:27,942
In fact, now that
I think about it,

223
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:30,808
I hardly know
anything about Makoto.

224
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:32,875
We were never close.

225
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:36,308
He spent much more time
with Inose and Aida.

226
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:38,342
They were always sharing
things with each other

227
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,908
that I wasn't privy to.

228
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,908
-I heard of this place, but I
never actually set foot in it.

229
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:55,042
-Me neither.

230
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:58,042
Nobody uses fighting
arenas like this anymore.

231
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:01,075
Seeing how we have access
to it, Third Seat Kibune

232
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:04,175
thought we might as well
use it for training drills.

233
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,108
-A place where you
could hide without fear

234
00:13:06,142 --> 00:13:06,942
of being discovered.

235
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:10,375
That's it!

236
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:22,256
-That is all!

237
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:26,389
You are to apprehend Ichigo
Kurosaki and Rukia Kuchiki,

238
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:30,123
and the same goes for their
accomplice, Captain Amagai!

239
00:13:30,156 --> 00:13:32,956
Stop him at once!

240
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:34,089
-Pardon me.

241
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:37,323
If I may interrupt, sir,
Captain Amagai's actions

242
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:39,423
are still somewhat
unclear to us.

243
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:42,189
And the motives of Ichigo
Kurosaki and the rest

244
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:44,189
are also puzzling.

245
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,689
In the first place,
sir, what reason

246
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:50,323
would they have for infiltrating
the Kasumioji palace?

247
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:54,523
They wouldn't have taken such
a risk without a purpose.

248
00:13:54,556 --> 00:13:57,889
I implore you to investigate
the Kasumioji Clan.

249
00:13:57,923 --> 00:13:58,956
-No!

250
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:03,089
I forbid any investigation
into that clan.

251
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:05,856
All squads, carry out
your orders immediately!

252
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,456
-I don't understand this.

253
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:19,523
-I know.

254
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:22,523
The Kasumioji Clan
are high aristocracy.

255
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:27,289
But it's safe to say they are
at the root of this disturbance.

256
00:14:27,323 --> 00:14:30,289
-Yeah, you're absolutely right.

257
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:32,023
-At this rate,
the chaos may even

258
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,823
spread as far as
the court guards.

259
00:14:33,856 --> 00:14:34,323
-Captain!

260
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:35,256
-Huh?

261
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:37,089
Nanao?

262
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,723
There's a fight
in the Seireitei!

263
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:47,656
-Man, why do you have to be
so stubborn about this, Renji?

264
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:50,823
I can see you haven't
changed one bit.

265
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,923
-Yeah, well, look
at you, Tetsuzaemon!

266
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:54,423
Orders are orders, huh?

267
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:57,389
Are orders corners everything?

268
00:14:57,423 --> 00:14:58,856
-They are to me!

269
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:10,656
-Blocking's the only thing
you're good at, Shuhei.

270
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:11,589
-Ikkaku, you--

271
00:15:14,423 --> 00:15:15,456
-Split apart, Hozukimaru!

272
00:15:19,156 --> 00:15:24,123
Weren't you supposed to
arrest Ichigo, Shuhei?

273
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,323
-Shut your mouth!

274
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:41,089
-You're being reckless, Renji!

275
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:42,789
-I wouldn't have to
be reckless if you

276
00:15:42,823 --> 00:15:44,556
weren't standing in my way.

277
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,023
-Don't you get it?

278
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:50,156
What you're doing is
disobeying a direct order!

279
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:51,456
-You're wrong!

280
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:54,323
I'm only trying to stop
them, and that's it.

281
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:57,723
-Yeah, same difference.

282
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:01,723
-Just listen for a second, Iba!

283
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:05,189
I may not understand why Ichigo
and Rukia have been acting so

284
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:08,089
irresponsibly, and without
any apparent reason.

285
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:12,856
However, I do know
they won't quit

286
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,089
until they get what they want.

287
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:16,089
That's just who they are.

288
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,789
-What do you think
you're doing, Ikkaku?

289
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:26,889
Take your squad and get back
to your position at once.

290
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:29,323
-Jeez, you're just as
hard headed as always.

291
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:34,456
Use your brain for
once, will you?

292
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:36,389
They must be onto something
we haven't noticed.

293
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:37,823
That's why Ichigo
and his buddies

294
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:39,023
are doing what they're doing.

295
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:40,823
Don't you understand that?

296
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:42,889
-I don't!

297
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:45,289
That's just an excuse!

298
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:48,156
-You have met him before, right?

299
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:50,523
-That's got nothing
to do with it!

300
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:53,623
-This is exactly why
you're such a loser!

301
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:55,723
-Why don't you mind
your own business?

302
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:02,223
-What's wrong?

303
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:03,723
-Lieutenant Kira!

304
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,123
-Is that--

305
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:09,089
-It's Sugama, the one who's
been missing since last night.

306
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:12,289
-This man-- he went
after Third Seat Kibune?

307
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,656
-Captain Amagai ordered us
to return to the barracks,

308
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:17,156
but the squad members who stayed
back had already found him.

309
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:24,289
-Continue on to the barracks.

310
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:24,789
-Hm?

311
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,523
[clatter]

312
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:39,023
-Huh?

313
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:47,389
-Oh, wow!

314
00:17:47,423 --> 00:17:49,189
It opened!

315
00:17:49,223 --> 00:17:54,889
After all, you never know until
you try, just like Ichigo said.

316
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:58,489
Thank goodness no one seems
to be around right now.

317
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:02,923
Oh, well.

318
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,256
Nothing is ever easy.

319
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:10,623
-Who are those men?

320
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,456
And the girl-- that's Princess
Rurichiyo of the Kasumioji

321
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:14,956
clan.

322
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:16,191
What's going on?

323
00:18:17,423 --> 00:18:20,656
I'd better inform Captain
Amagai about this right away.

324
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:27,223
Still, the fact that the
Kasumioji Princess is here

325
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,423
reveals a lot.

326
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:37,956
That means-- Who are you,
and what do you want?

327
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:41,923
Not so fast!

328
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:47,256
You chose the wrong foe.

329
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:50,989
Now you will tell me what you're
doing here, or you're next.

330
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:53,823
-[laughing]

331
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:55,156
-What's so funny?

332
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:58,423
-I'm afraid you are the one
who chose the wrong foe.

333
00:18:58,456 --> 00:18:58,923
-What?

334
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:10,489
-Nice try!

335
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:25,923
IZURU (VOICEOVER): Such power.

336
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,889
Their speed and spiritual
pressure got a sudden boost.

337
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:30,289
RURICHIYO (OFFSCREEN):
Unhand me!

338
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:33,289
I said let me go!

339
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:36,256
Are you not of the
Kasumioji Clan?

340
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:37,756
I am a princess!

341
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:38,756
Stop this insolence!

342
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:39,689
-No, wait!

343
00:19:39,723 --> 00:19:40,756
RURICHIYO (OFFSCREEN):
Unhand me!

344
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,723
-Out of my way!

345
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:55,723
[growling]

346
00:19:55,756 --> 00:19:58,356
-I'm getting a strange feeling.

347
00:19:58,389 --> 00:19:59,289
-Huh?

348
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:03,656
-And it's not just
from you and me.

349
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:07,556
All over the place, spiritual
pressure is going haywire.

350
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:11,056
So much chaos from
just one order.

351
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,923
I've never seen this before.

352
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:14,856
-So why not let me go, then?

353
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:16,889
I swear to you, I will
prove their innocence!

354
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:22,889
-I guess if you're
that confident,

355
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:27,489
I'll put my trust in
Ichigo Kurosaki too.

356
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:29,056
You're not alone.

357
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:31,389
I bet we all feel the same way.

358
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:35,656
Most of us have a lot
of faith in that guy.

359
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:38,889
However, we gotta follow
orders, and I still

360
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:42,223
want to find Captain
Amagai and the others.

361
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:45,989
Like you said, how else can
we prove their innocence?

362
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:49,889
-When you cross swords
with Ichigo, you'll get it.

363
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:51,656
You'll know that
he wouldn't raise

364
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:55,656
all this hell for
no good reason.

365
00:20:55,689 --> 00:21:03,356
But 'til then, I refuse to
let anyone get in his way.

366
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:05,589
-What if you're wrong?

367
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:09,489
-What if it turns out
that he's betrayed us?

368
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:11,823
-We'll deal with it
when the time comes.

369
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:14,123
-And his sentence will be--

370
00:21:14,156 --> 00:21:14,623
-Death!

371
00:21:20,556 --> 00:21:25,423
-[panting]

372
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:26,389
Damn.

373
00:21:26,423 --> 00:21:27,589
I've got to catch up.

374
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:41,456
-[groan]

375
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:47,823
-What a shame.

376
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:51,623
Just like always,
you're too slow.

377
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:54,556
I'm afraid the princess
is long gone by now.

378
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:57,323
Sorry, Lieutenant Kira.

379
00:21:57,356 --> 00:22:02,256
-So all of this madness--
it's your doing?

380
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:03,056
Third Seat Kibune!

381
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,970
[theme song]

382
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,292
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Shuhei,

383
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:51,359
you sure saw a lot
of action today.

384
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:52,759
SHUHEI (VOICEOVER):
To be honest,

385
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:55,592
I got a lot more screen time
before Squad Three started

386
00:23:55,626 --> 00:23:56,859
getting all the attention.

387
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:58,092
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER): Huh?

388
00:23:58,126 --> 00:23:59,592
SHUHEI (VOICEOVER):
I'd better shine

389
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:01,326
while the spotlight is on me.

390
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,859
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
It's really bugging you, huh?
