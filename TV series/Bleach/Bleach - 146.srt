NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:52,827
who has been abducted
by the Arrancars,

00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:55,094
Ichigo, Uryu, and
Chad have snuck

into the Hollow
World, Hueco Mundo.

After making it
through the Garganta,

00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:02,027
Ichigo and his friends
were confronted

00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:05,461
by the guardians of Underground
Path 22, a place where

10
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:07,461
intruders are intercepted.

11
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,227
They crushed the Arrancars
standing in their way,

12
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:13,427
and set off for Aizen's
palace, Las Noches.

13
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:17,327
-It has to be that Las Noches
place those guys talked about.

14
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:20,061
That thing's enormous.

15
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:21,827
-I'm not actually sure
how far away it is.

-The way this place works, we'll
be dragged into another flight

-No way.

23
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,261
There can't be another
human living here.

24
00:02:46,294 --> 00:02:47,761

Stop picking on us, will ya?

37
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:35,794
Why don't you just
leave us alone?

We're really sorry!

00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:53,094
We never thought our
game of eternal tag

43
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:55,027
would cause such a
misunderstanding.

44
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,927
It'll never happen again.

45
00:03:56,961 --> 00:04:00,061
-You mean you play a
game called Eternal Tag?

46
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:03,461
-Unfortunately there's nothing
else to do here in Hueco Mundo

47
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,394
to pass the time.

-Eternal Tag?

49
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:09,361
But you were crying while you
were running away from them.

00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:10,461
-Sure!

51
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:12,427
Nel is a masochist,
and it's no fun for Nel

52
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,961
unless Nel is chased to the
point where Nel starts to cry.

53
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:17,727
-Why are you teaching this
kid words like masochist?

54
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:18,894
-Wait, I'm confused.

55
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:21,361
Nel is your name, right?

00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,561
-That's right!

57
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:25,894
Nel is an Arrancar, and
Nel's full name is Nel Tu!

00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:26,894
-An Arrancar?

59
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:28,061
-Nel sure is.

00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:29,461

Nel's brothers.

-And this guy right
here is our pet.

His name is Bawabawa.

-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

67
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:44,794
-You have a question?

68
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,794
-Since when do Arrancars
all of a sudden

69
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,561
have siblings and pets?

70
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:49,427
-What do you mean?

71
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:51,194
Arrancars have always had those.

72
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:53,194
-When I met Nel, she
was so cute that I

73
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:54,727
decided to become
a big brother, you

74
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,894
know what I'm talking about?

75
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:56,994
-Yep, same here.

76
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:03,161
-But that means you're not
really siblings at all.

77
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:03,627
-Huh?

78
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:10,227
-But if these guys aren't my
siblings, what are they then?

79
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:11,027
-Not her brother?

80
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,194
What are you talking about?

81
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:14,461
-No way!

82
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,394
-I mean, what am
I talking about?

83
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:17,361
Sure.

84
00:05:17,394 --> 00:05:18,461
You guys could
definitely be siblings.

85
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,227
-This is all so bizarre.

86
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:27,794
Are you sure you guys
are really Arrancars?

87
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,161
-Hey, what are
you trying to say?

88
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:30,161
Can't you see this here?

89
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:33,261
A beautifully cracked
Arrancar mask.

90
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:36,594
-It's just that you seem
different from the Arrancars

91
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,661
that came to the
world of the living.

92
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:41,061
-Oh, but of course we do.

93
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:43,761
The Arrancars who went to
the world of the living

94
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:44,561
are called Numeros.

95
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,427
-Numeros?

96
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:46,794
Wait, what are they?

97
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:49,461
-Numeros are the guys who are
even stronger than the Menos

98
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:50,561
Grande.

99
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:52,527
That is, before they
turned into Arrancars.

100
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,394
All the Numeros
can be identified

101
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:56,694
by two digit numbers,
and they serve directly

102
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:58,161
under the Espada.

103
00:05:58,194 --> 00:05:59,761
-They sure have it good.

104
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:00,561
-You're telling me.

105
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,061
It just ain't right.

106
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:03,227
-Numeros are combat experts.

107
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:06,494
They're an elite fighting force.

108
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:09,761
There's no comparison to them
and garbage bugs like us.

109
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:12,361
-Garbage bugs?

110
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:14,127
-You have some
nerve, telling us we

111
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:15,861
don't look like
Arrancars when you

112
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:18,861
look even less like
Arrancars than we do.

113
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:21,427
You don't have a mask, and
you wear a black kimono.

114
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:22,594
You're dressed more like a--

know what I mean?

00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:27,227

-What are you guys, anyway?

00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,931
-Ichigo Kurosaki,

-A Quincy and a human?

128
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,331
-What are we going to do?

129
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:55,565
-Do you know what this means?

130
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,898
-You're the bad guys!

131
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:01,765
-You mean, you didn't have any
idea at all who we really were?

132
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:02,765
-That's right!

133
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,631
Because you didn't
say who you were.

134
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:06,831
-You should have told
us from the start.

135
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:07,565
-Bad guys.

136
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:09,565
I can't believe it.

137
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:11,431
-This is terrible.

138
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:14,231
Nel is sure the, the bad
guys are going to kill us!

139
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:15,731
-Uh huh.

140
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:16,531
-No.

141
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:18,231
We're not going to kill you.

142
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:20,565
-Wow, I wasn't
expecting this at all.

143
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:23,631
-Who knew there were
Arrancars like this.

144
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:26,431
-We're in big trouble.

145
00:07:26,465 --> 00:07:28,031
-We're gonna die.

146
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:30,131
-Nel thinks we really
should try to kill

147
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,198
the bad guys before
they try to kill us.

148
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:34,765
-Yeah, but I don't think
there's anyway we can beat them.

149
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:35,598
-We have to.

150
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:37,065
Soul Reapers are the bad guys.

151
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:38,365
-That's right.

152
00:07:38,398 --> 00:07:40,831
Let's invite them to play
a game of Eternal Tag.

153
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:42,865
And while we're pretending
to play, we jump them,

154
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:45,331
and then we run for it.

155
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,465
-Now that's a good idea!

156
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:48,498
-Yeah, maybe this
way we can beat them!

157
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:50,231
-Yeah.

158
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:52,198
-What is it now?

159
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:55,131
-Oh Mr. Soul Reapear,
if you're not bad guys,

160
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:56,031
then play with us!

161
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:57,065
-Huh?

162
00:07:57,098 --> 00:07:58,565
-OK, here we go.

163
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:00,565
Let's start!

164
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,998
On your mark, get ready, tag!

165
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:05,498

Currently our Second
Division, the patrol core,

332
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:14,983
have spread their search to
all corners of the seireitei.

333
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:19,250
-Those fools.

334
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:30,416
[crying]

335
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,883
-More Soul Reapers.

336
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,883
More of the bad guys.

337
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,883
-Rukia!

338
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,016
Renji!

339
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:48,883
You guys are here.

340
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,183
-Hey!

341
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,250
Easy!

342
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:07,316
-Are you all right, Ichigo?

343
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,650
-No, I'm not.

344
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:09,783
-You idiot!

345
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:11,883
Why did you go off on
your own to Hueco Mundo?

346
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,983
Why couldn't you have
just waited for us

347
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:15,950
to come back and help you?

348
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:16,883
-Because.

349
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,650
I had no idea if
you were actually

350
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:20,316
going to come back and--

351
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,983
-Of course we were!

352
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:24,616
No matter what!

353
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,283
Renji and I were
planning on coming back

354
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:28,516
from the very beginning.

355
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,683
Why didn't you wait for us?

356
00:18:30,716 --> 00:18:32,250
Why couldn't you trust us?

357
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,183
I thought we were supposed
to be your friends, Ichigo.

358
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,050
-Yeah.

359
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:45,650
You're right.

360
00:18:49,783 --> 00:18:54,016
-Well, as long as
you understand now.

361
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,683
Please don't ever make me
confirm something as silly

362
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:57,850
as this, ever again.

363
00:19:03,516 --> 00:19:08,516
That aside, who are they?

364
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,516
-Huh?

365
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,016
What kind of rude
question is that?

366
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,416
Nel Tu!

-Pesche Guatiche!

369
00:19:15,116 --> 00:19:16,316
-And together we're--

[interposing voices]

371
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,416
-You're not on the same page.

372
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,050
-We talked about this before!

373
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,683
We're the Nel-Don-Pe
Phantom Thieves!

374
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:28,250
-I told you that I would
only accept The Great Desert

375
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:29,583
Brothers!

376
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:31,616
-I want Three Brothers in
the name, or forget about it.

377
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,983
-Well, you get the idea.

378
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:34,416
You know, they're all Hollows.

379
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,950
-What idea am I supposed to get?

380
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:38,616
-Oh no!

381
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,650
Bawabawa is crying.

382
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:42,150
-It's all right, Bawabawa.

383
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:43,783
We haven't forgotten about you!

384
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:44,950
-Right!

385
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,316
Including Bawabawa, together
the four of us are--

386

[interposing voices]

387
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,416
-It's time for you
guys to be quiet now.

388
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,550
Are you ready to get going?

389
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,550
Come on.

390
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,316
-All right, Ichigo.

391
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,116
-They're leaving?

392
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:03,850
-Forget about it.

393
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,383
-Hey!

394
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,316
Hold up a sec!

395
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,083
Itsigo!

396
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:13,550
-Hey, it's not Itsigo!

397
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,483
-If you'll wait for us, Nel
will guide you to Las Noches.

[wind blowing]

-Uh, why is she staring
at you like that?

400
00:20:30,183 --> 00:20:32,250
-I don't know.

401
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:35,516
-May I ask you what your
relationship is with Itsigo?

402
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,550
-What?

403
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,316
-You're pretty popular
with the ladies!

404
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,216
-Just shut up.

405
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,416
Hey, by the way, where did
you guys get those cloaks?

406
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,716
Did you pick them up somewhere?

407
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,183
-They're gifts.

408
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:48,950
I was told that Hueco Mundo's
deserts have a pretty rough

409
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:50,916
terrain, and you
need protection.

410
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,750
-Who said that.

411
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:54,683
-My brother did.

412
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:03,016
-Then, does that
mean that Byakuya

413
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,250
sent you guys all the
way here to find me?

414
00:21:05,283 --> 00:21:06,983
-Well, actually,
it was Kisuke who

415
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,583
opened up the Garganta for us.

416
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:10,650
But it was my Captain who
got us through the world

417
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:11,783
of the living.

418
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:14,716
-My brother said, the
only order received

419
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,850
was the one to bring us
back to the Soul Society.

420
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:19,483
-I never received
any orders concerning

421
00:21:19,516 --> 00:21:22,283
what to do with you
after I brought you back.

422
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:24,250
Do whatever you like.

423
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:24,716
-See?

424
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,150
-Yeah, I see.

425
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:30,783
Byakuya did that, huh?

426
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:33,183
Sure has gotten
rather soft lately.

427
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:35,850
-He also said that it must
be unpleasant for the enemy

428
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:39,750
to have that dingy
boy wandering around.

429
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:41,483
-That bastard!

430
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:42,516
-Ichigo!

431
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,616
What are you doing,
punching our ride?

432
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,316
-That's right!

433
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,550
Don't pick on Bawabawa.

434
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,316
If you want to pick on
someone, please pick on Nel!

435
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:50,850
-Ah!

436
00:21:50,883 --> 00:21:51,350
Enough!

437
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,650
-Oh man, what is it now?

00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:44,993
-Hey, don't I get a cloak?

441
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:47,726
-Sorry, my brother
only gave me two.

442
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,426
-There's only enough
for us, Ichigo.

443
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:50,559
Are you jealous?

444
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,626
-He actually didn't want
to give you one, either.

445
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:55,393
But he reluctantly gave one
to you because I asked him to.

446
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:56,226
-Damn.

447
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:59,759
-Yeah, that sounds like Byakuya.
