And anyway, you're too
small, even for an appetizer.

It's the girl I saw
that day six years ago,

25
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:53,674
the one down by the river.

26
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,641
-Six years ago?

27
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:56,774
Ichigo, do you mean--

00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:58,174
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
That's right.

29
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,641
She's the one.

30
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:01,641
I tried to stop her from
jumping into the river,

31
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:04,474
but when I finally came
to, she disappeared.

32
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:09,141
And my mother-- she was dead.

HOLLOW (OFFSCREEN):
Six years ago?

34
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:12,408
That's a long time.

35
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,008
And there have been so many.

36
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,541
You can't expect me to
remember every one of the souls

37
00:03:16,574 --> 00:03:18,541
I've eaten.

38
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,508

RUKIA (OFFSCREEN):
It's Grand Fisher.

42
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:34,808
That's the code name
we've given him.

43
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:38,608
He keeps himself invisible and
disguises the lure growing out

44
00:03:38,641 --> 00:03:40,274
of his head as a human.

45
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:42,574
Anyone who sees
the lure he knows

46
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:45,174
has high spirit energy
and immediately attacks

47
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:49,074
and devours them, thus
gaining all of their power.

48
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:51,608
For over 50 years,
this Hollow has

49
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:54,241
evaded every Soul Reaper
that's gone after him.

50
00:03:54,274 --> 00:03:55,374
-Ah.

51
00:03:55,408 --> 00:03:59,241
-And we know his favorite
victims are women.

52
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:02,908
-So does that mean my mother
was actually killed by--

-Impressive.

56
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,641
You have been lucky, little boy.

57
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:15,141
You saw my lure,
and yet you lived.

58
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:17,108
Perhaps it was my
intention to eat you

59
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:19,574
on the spot for
your spirit energy,

60
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:22,141
but there's something
about the women.

61
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:26,574
They're just too sweet and
lovely for me to pass up.

You sacrificed yourself.

We kill them without
mercy, no matter what. .

When a Hollow attacks at random

that person's loved ones
are the real victims.

They're left with
nothing but an emptiness.

As a Soul Reaper, I
couldn't let that happen.

He's a Soul Reaper.

You back me up.

00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:50,241
I don't really
know how long Yuzu

172
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:53,841
grieved after our mother died.

173
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:55,974
And I can only imagine
how lonely Karin

174
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:58,574
must have felt without her.

175
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,841
-We must always
protect the innocent.

176
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:09,408
-I've also made it my duty
to protect the innocent.

177
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:14,108
That means it's my
duty to destroy you!

178
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:15,941
[laughing]

179
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,774
[shouting]

180
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:20,241
-I guess you didn't listen
when your friend told you not

181
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:21,608
to be so reckless.

182
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,741
[grunting]

183
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:25,641
-You've been lucky so far.

184
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:27,474
How many times do you
think you can get away

185
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:32,474
with jumping into the lion's
den without any strategy?

186
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,841
[gasp]

187
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:36,874
-Well, today's the day your
luck finally ran out, maggot!

188
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:57,215
[cough]

189
00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:00,082
[gasp]

190
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:09,736
[gasping for breath]

191
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:13,170
-That'll teach you to be so
reckless, amateur Soul Reaper.

192
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:15,103
Rejecting your
comrade's offer of help

193
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:17,403
will prove to be
your final mistake.

194
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:20,670
And now you'll endure the shame
of dying without even having

195
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,970
wounded the great Grand Fisher.

196
00:11:24,003 --> 00:11:24,803
-Ichigo!

197
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:25,936
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Stay back!

198
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,003
-Huh?

199
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:30,670
-I'll do this my way,
whatever it takes.

200
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:33,836
No matter what it
costs, even if I die,

201
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,970
I'm going to finish this.

202
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:37,536
-Then die you will,
because you allow

203
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,903
your passion and your rage to
distract you from your purpose.

204
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:43,803
And that distraction
dulls your sword.

205
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,470
You flail wildly, but
your physical skills alone

206
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:49,103
are not enough to defeat me.

207
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:52,536
And now, I shall show you why
your mind is not strong enough

208
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,770
to fight me, either.

209
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:54,270
Behold!

210
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,136
[gasp]

211
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,070
-Is that your mother?

212
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:04,570
-Bastard!

213
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,803
GRAND FISHER (OFFSCREEN):
Even the most cold-blooded

214
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:13,336
Soul Reaper has one person
whom he can never kill.

215
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,803
That is a fact which
you cannot deny.

216
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:20,236
By learning who
that person is, I

217
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,803
have evaded every
Soul Reaper who

218
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:25,203
has come before you
for over 50 years.

219
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:29,003
And I have learned that for
you, this is that one person.

220
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:33,970
-Do you remember me, Ichigo?

221
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,936
-Ichigo.

222
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,736
-You're forgetting something.

223
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,770
-Huh?

224
00:12:39,803 --> 00:12:41,436
-What about his honor?

225
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,470
You want to help.

226
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:44,336
And if you lend him
your strength now,

227
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,003
he will probably be saved.

228
00:12:47,036 --> 00:12:51,770
But in doing so, you will have
forever destroyed his honor.

229
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:54,270
Now listen and
remember this, there

230
00:12:54,303 --> 00:12:56,270
are two different
kinds of battle.

231
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:59,903
We must always be careful to
distinguish between the two.

232
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:02,136
There is the battle to
protect innocent life,

233
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,836
and then there is the battle
to preserve one's honor.

234
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,570
-I understand.

235
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:09,436
This is a better
for Ichigo's honor,

236
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,236
and one he must fight alone.

237
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,003
I cannot lend him my strength.

238
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:16,903
No matter how much
I may want to,

239
00:13:16,936 --> 00:13:20,870
or how much I want him to
live, I won't help him.

240
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:22,970
I must not help him.

241
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,903
But don't sacrifice
yourself, Ichigo.

242
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:37,836
-Oh damn, I fell asleep again.

243
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,336
Oh well.

244
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:45,103
-Well, Soul Reaper,
can you draw your sword

245
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:47,870
against your own
mother? [laughing]

246
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,203
-Bastard.

247
00:13:49,236 --> 00:13:51,936
How dare you defile her memory
by bringing her into this?

248
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,236
You disgusting freak!

249
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,936
You make me sick! [shouting]
I'll cut your heart out! [gasp]

250
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,036
-Ichigo, you mustn't do this.

251
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,036
You mustn't hurt your mother.

252
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,036
Please, son, you must
put your sword down.

253
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,770
Do it for me.

254
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,436
[grunt]

255
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,936
[groaning]

256
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,436
-Ah?

257
00:14:26,936 --> 00:14:28,170
-Didn't I tell you?

258
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:30,703
Your rage only serves
to dull your blade.

259
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,003
It makes you vulnerable.

260
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,636
And now with my next
blow, I'll finish you off!

261
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,636
Now, before you die,
I want to tell you

262
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,103
that after having faced
so many Soul Reapers,

263
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:46,803
you were the most foolish and
by far the weakest of them all!

264
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:48,303
-Ichigo, watch out!

265
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:55,903
-What?

266
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:59,770
Why don't you die?

267
00:14:59,803 --> 00:15:01,270
-What is that?

268
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:04,236
[laughing]

269
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:04,736
-Mom?

270
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,203
Is that you?

271
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:17,103
-That lure we see isn't
actually his mother,

272
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:19,670
but she's transmitting
her thoughts to him.

273
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:22,436
-That can only mean that the
lure recorded her thoughts

274
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,136
at the very moment
she was killed.

275
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,903
-Her dying thoughts
were recorded?

276
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:30,036
EIKICHIRO (OFFSCREEN): I
thought this might happen.

277
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,470
I had a vision of it earlier.

278
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:36,736
Now this battle
could go either way.

279
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,236
-Ichigo.

280
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,070
My son, I'm very proud of you.

281
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:47,503
You and your father
and Karin and Yuzu,

282
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:51,270
I am so lucky to have had
those years with all of you.

283
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:54,636
And I know that because of the
love that all of you share,

284
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,203
you will always keep the family
together and strong, even

285
00:15:58,236 --> 00:16:00,536
without me.

286
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,970
Ichigo, live on, my son.

287
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,436
Live with strength and
kindness, and never lose

288
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:12,870
that smile, the smile you always
wore when you looked at me.

289
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:15,870
Ichigo, thank you for loving me.

290
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:20,803
[crying]

291
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:24,770
-Mother--

292
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,403
-Ichigo.

293
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:38,370
-Mother, now I know what
your last thoughts were.

294
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:40,270
-Hmm?

295
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:43,370
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): You
say anger dulls the blade.

296
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,303
You may be right about that.

297
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:48,970
But there's something else
that you haven't considered.

298
00:16:49,003 --> 00:16:53,770
To kill a slimy scumbag like
you, a dull blade like this one

299
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:57,703
is all that I need.

300
00:16:57,736 --> 00:16:59,070
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
Sometimes, I

301
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:03,536
wish I could be like the rain.

302
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,503
If I were, then
would I have a way

303
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:11,703
to connect two hearts together,
the way the rain connects

304
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:18,670
the earth and the sky, even
though the two never touch?

305
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,170
With each day that
passes, Ichigo,

306
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:27,136
I think I've come to understand
you at least a little bit more.

307
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:38,570
[shouting]

308
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:40,370
-Curse you, Soul Reaper!

309
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:42,736
You haven't seen the last of me!

310
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,670
You'll burn for this someday!

311
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:47,170
-Coward!

312
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,236
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN):
Ichigo, it's over.

313
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,603
You did it!

314
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:57,136
You stopped him!

315
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,903
Put down your sword and rest.

316
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:00,736
This battle is over.

317
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,103
-No it isn't!

318
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,503
It won't be over
until I've killed him!

319
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:05,336
I have to!

320
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,470
-Ichigo--

321
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,670
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): I
will avenge my mother!

322
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:19,503
-I'm glad you didn't
die today, Ichigo.

323
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:22,070
I'm so thankful.

324
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,270
EIKICHIRO (OFFSCREEN): Your
friend is something else.

325
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,836
As you know, the power
a Soul Reaper possesses

326
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,070
is determined by his life force.

327
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:30,203
Heh.

328
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:31,836
This kid's potential is
a little frightening.

329
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:37,570
Well, time for me to head home.

330
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:39,303
After all, two's company.

331
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:40,703
Three's a crowd.

332
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:42,170
Isn't that what they say?

333
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:45,103
It looks like our little Rukia's
finally grown into a woman.

334
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:46,203
And, uh--

335
00:18:46,236 --> 00:18:47,503
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Give
it a rest, will you?

336
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:48,903
-OK, have it your way.

337
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:52,636
But you know the Soul Society's
going to find out eventually.

338
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,770
Bye, Rukia.

339
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:54,770
Good luck.

340
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:56,736
Say goodbye to the kid for me.

341
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:17,470
-I'm so sorry, Mother.

342
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:21,670
I tried to avenge your death,
but I guess I failed you.

343
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,236
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN):
Well, if your mom

344
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,270
can see that you're taking
good care of yourself,

345
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:28,203
then I think that'll make
her happy on the other side.

346
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:30,836
-Dad, those were
private thoughts.

347
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,136
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

348
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,870
Hey, I thought you quit smoking.

349
00:19:40,103 --> 00:19:41,836
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN):
Your mom told me once,

350
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,803
back when we'd only
been dating for a little

351
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:47,403
while, she thought I looked
cool holding a cigarette.

352
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,270
Now that I think
about it, that might

353
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:51,703
have been the first
compliment she ever gave me.

354
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:54,170
It might have been
the last one, too.

355
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:56,570
That's why I always smoke
just one when I come here

356
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:58,870
on this one day of the year.

357
00:19:58,903 --> 00:20:02,303
-How can you smile
about anything here?

358
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:05,236
Why doesn't anyone blame
me for causing mom's death?

359
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,136
It would be so much
easier to understand

360
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,570
if you all blamed me.

361
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:10,436
I can't take it!

362
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,803
I can't!

363
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,303
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN): Why
should we blame you, Ichigo?

364
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:17,770
If I were ever to blame you
for having caused your mother's

365
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:19,203
death, she'd never forgive me.

366
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:21,470
It's no one's fault
that she died.

367
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:25,536
Sometimes in life, bad things
just happen, and she knew that.

368
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,170
She was the woman I loved,
a woman with so much love

369
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:35,170
in her heart, she would do
anything to protect her family.

370
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:37,503
And remember this.

371
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,470
That woman, whom
I loved so much,

372
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:43,003
was willing to give up her
own life to protect yours.

373
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:46,070
-Wow, Dad.

374
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:47,203
-Ow!

375
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:49,270
What was that for?

376
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:52,770
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN): Can't have
you going soft on me, boy.

377
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:54,603
Be strong, Ichigo.

378
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:58,636
Live well, grow old well,
grow bald well, and then

379
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,003
die long after I've died.

380
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:03,603
And if possible, die with
a smile on your face.

381
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:06,903
Otherwise, I'll never
be able to face Masaki.

382
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:09,503
Try to shake off that
gloom and depression, son.

383
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:13,270
You're way too young to carry
around such a heavy burden.

384
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:15,036
I'll be waiting at the
bottom of the hill.

385
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,236
-Are you listening, Rukia?

386
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,736
I want you to let me be a
Soul Reaper for a little while

387
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,536
longer.

388
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,570
I want to become strong
so I can continue

389
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:31,870
to protect the
innocent from Hollows.

390
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:35,736
I must become strong enough to
defeat any Hollow, especially

391
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,536
this Grand Fisher.

392
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,936
I can't face my mother
again until I've killed him.

393
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:45,870
-Ichigo.

394
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:01,010
THEME SONG: Nobody
knows who I really am.

395
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:05,977
I never felt this empty before.

396
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,244
And if I ever need
someone to come along,

397
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:15,477
who's going to comfort
me and keep me strong?

398
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,677
[singing in japanese]

399
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,344
-Whoa, was that one
scary Hollow or what?

400
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,177
I know I was pretty
pitiful in this episode,

401
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,177
and I didn't do much, but I
promise, in the next episode,

402
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,544
old Kon is gonna be rocking!

403
00:23:04,577 --> 00:23:06,477
I'm gonna really show
my stuff! [inaudible]!

404
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,910
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Kon, you don't

405
00:23:07,944 --> 00:23:09,644
have any scenes in
the next episode.

406
00:23:09,677 --> 00:23:11,210
-Gah!
