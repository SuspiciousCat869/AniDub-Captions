1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,833
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,366
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,666
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,066
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,133
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:27,435
Spiritual Pressure?!
But who's is it..?

7
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:44,335
Rukia!

8
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:54,201
Rukia!

9
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:58,168
Are you okay?! Talk to
me! What the hell happened?
Who did this?!

10
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:04,135
Good to see you. No
need to worry.

11
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:09,835
How can I not worry?
You're all beat up!
So how'd it happen?

12
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:32,768
Who is that woman?
Could she be a hollow?

13
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:35,668
She doesn't have a mask
or a hole.

14
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:39,768
You are this town's Soul
Reaper. Is that right?

15
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:42,968
So... Who are you?!

16
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,335
I'll take her now.

17
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:10,268
What's that?

18
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:17,801
I don't know just who you
are.

19
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,001
But you're not taking
Rukia!

20
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,101
I see now.

21
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:27,768
You are the Substitute
Soul Reaper.

22
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:33,335
How is it that
you know me?!

23
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:38,701
Somenomai... Tsukishiro.

24
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:48,901
Wait!-That was---

25
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:53,601
Tsuginomai...
Hakuren.

26
00:04:57,301 --> 00:05:00,601
Damn! Getsugatensho!

27
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:20,335
Who the hell are
you? Tsukishiro and
Hakuren are Rukia's
techniques!

28
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:26,435
Yes. Which makes them
my techniques as well.

29
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:27,835
Say what?

30
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,135
Huh?!

31
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:39,968
Wait!

32
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:44,101
Damn! Rukia!

33
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:48,501
I know you're in bad
shape, but just who was
that woman?

34
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:50,635
Rukia.

35
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:55,568
She's Sodenoshirayuki.

36
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:58,635
She's my Zanpakuto.

37
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:00,035
She's what?

38
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:04,101
Rukia? Rukia!...

39
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:13,568
Here you go.

40
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:16,468
Hoo-pah!

41
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:21,335
I hope my girl is okay.

42
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:25,601
There's no need to worry,
because Orihime is tending
to her!

43
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,301
That's encouraging.

44
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:30,035
What happened..?

45
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:34,568
Rukia said that the woman
who confronted her was
Sodenoshirayuki, right?

46
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:40,201
She did. But it sounds
crazy that a Zanpakuto
would take on a physical form
and attack its master...

47
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:45,968
Interesting.

48
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:47,501
Um?

49
00:06:47,535 --> 00:06:51,335
I sent Yoruichi to the
Soul Society to start
checking things out.

50
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:54,935
Let's have a chat with
Rukia before we make any
moves.

51
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,768
Rukia's regained
consciousness!

52
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:02,168
I've been worried sick
about you, Rukia!

53
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:05,301
Don't worry, I'm fine.
I'll be alright.

54
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:08,568
But you don't
know what I--

55
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:13,968
Jeez!-Didn't you hear
her say that she's all
right!? You really should
have more faith in Orihime!

56
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:18,601
Talk to us, Rukia. Can
you give us more details
about what happened?

57
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:28,168
I felt like I
was trapped inside a
nightmare.

58
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:35,935
I am known as
Muramasa.

59
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:42,601
And this night marks the
end of the Soul Reapers'
reign over the Zanpakuto.

60
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:45,068
From now on...

61
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:49,068
It'll be the Zanpakuto
who rule over the Soul
Reapers.

62
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:21,001
The Zanpakuto will rule
the Soul Reapers?

63
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:22,801
What is that,
a joke?!

64
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:25,301
Oh, on the
contrary.

65
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:30,035
Every one of your
Zanpakuto are now free
from your control.

66
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,601
Roar, Zabimaru!

67
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:47,768
This Zanpakuto news is
pretty important, but
hold on...

68
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:49,768
Where is Old Man Yama?

69
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:54,168
After all, he's the one
who actually called on us
to meet here.

70
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:59,768
Got any news on where he
is?

71
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:04,768
Genryusai Yamamoto
has been sealed away.

72
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:12,968
When we approached
Genryusai's Zanpakuto,
Ryujinjakka, it refused
to cooperate with us.

73
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:18,268
It was then that we
called upon your
Zanpakuto-Katenkyokotsu,
Sogyonokotowari, and

74
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:22,935
Minazuki, who combined
their Spirit Energy to
seal Genryusai's power
away.

75
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:24,335
You did what?!?

76
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:26,801
Captain...

77
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,701
Insane! They couldn't
seal away the Head
Captain!

78
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:32,668
Is that even possible?

79
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:36,268
This is truly
interesting.

80
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:39,001
So you expect us to
believe that?

81
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:43,201
You may not believe it.
But that is the truth.

82
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:51,568
Ikkaku!

83
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:58,601
We've all heard enough
from you. The time for
listening to what you have
to say is over!

84
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:00,768
Shunsui!

85
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:02,835
I guess it's time.

86
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:31,768
Isane! Get Lieutenant
Sasakibe!

87
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:32,668
Yes ma'am!

88
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:36,068
Captain!...Huh?

89
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:37,601
I'll help you!

90
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:46,601
Shunsui! Retreat!

91
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:49,001
That seems like a
pretty good idea!

92
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:57,568
What an amazing sight,
it appears as though it's
about to spit out poison.

93
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:58,768
Everyone run!

94
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:01,794
It's no use.

95
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:29,021
What the hell is going
on?!

96
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:42,421
Where'd all those
captains run off to? I
really want to fight
them!

97
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:54,554
There's nowhere for you
to run... Soul Reapers.

98
00:12:11,854 --> 00:12:14,621
Damn!-They're destroying
everything!

99
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:17,154
Think all of us got away?

100
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:19,821
Of course! No need to
worry about the captains!

101
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:42,354
Rukia?-How's your
Zanpakuto?

102
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:44,388
Dead-I can't use my
Shikai.

103
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:45,354
Great.

104
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:47,221
Here they come!

105
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:54,154
What?!

106
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:07,188
Rukia!

107
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:14,421
Bakudo Number Sixty
One.

108
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:15,988
Rikujokoro.

109
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:23,521
Brother!

110
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:24,654
<i>Rukia!</i>

111
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:28,821
Are you all
right?...Captain!

112
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:32,654
Keep your guard up.

113
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:34,588
<i>He's right.</i>

114
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:39,821
Your Soul Society
captains are truly
impressive.

115
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:44,054
I can see they possess
the strength to control
powerful Zanpakuto.

116
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:54,721
Careful!

117
00:13:57,354 --> 00:14:00,821
My name
is Senbonzakura.

118
00:14:02,454 --> 00:14:03,354
Leave.

119
00:14:03,388 --> 00:14:05,054
But brother!

120
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:07,221
I will not repeat myself.

121
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:20,288
You are obviously a man
of experience. More than
anyone you should know
that it is hopeless to

122
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:23,988
challenge my thousands of
blades with just one
sword.

123
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,054
You can't escape!

124
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:34,421
It's useless!

125
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:39,688
No, brother!

126
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:42,554
No!

127
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:43,621
Hey! Stop!

128
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:45,121
Let go!

129
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:49,388
Your brother can handle
this himself! Besides,
look who's here!

130
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,321
Is that really...

131
00:14:57,988 --> 00:15:00,121
Tsuginomai Hakuren.

132
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:13,554
Renji and I got separated
right after that. I
escaped to the World of
the Living through a

133
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:17,288
Senkaimon while fighting
off my Zanpakuto.

134
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:21,788
So the Zanpakuto are
resisting their Soul
Reaper's will and
turning on them.

135
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:25,054
How strange-I've never
heard of something like
this thing happening
before.

136
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:31,288
What doesn't add up is
a Zanpakuto's true form
exists within their Soul
Reaper's inner world.

137
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:34,354
What is a Zanpakuto's
true form?

138
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:39,321
A Zanpakuto has a
consciousness controlling
its power. Its true form.

139
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:44,588
A Soul Reaper can draw
power from a Zanpakuto by
conversing with its true
body.

140
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:47,888
Does Zangetsu have a true
form as well?

141
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:50,354
Sure it does.

142
00:15:50,388 --> 00:15:53,488
Naturally my Benihime
possesses one as well.

143
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:57,954
How about the Seireitei?
Is everyone all right?

144
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:04,488
They're all fine.

145
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:07,421
The Thirteen Court Guard
Squads haven't been
destroyed.

146
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:10,521
<i>Yoruichi! You're back</i>
<i>already?</i>

147
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:15,354
Then you must know. So
how is the Soul Society
doing?!

148
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:17,521
And my brother! How is
my brother?!

149
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:19,421
<i>Just calm down.</i>

150
00:16:22,421 --> 00:16:24,254
I'll tell you
everything I saw.

151
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,621
The Seireitei was in a
terrible state.

152
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:34,521
It was daytime so I could
clearly see the damage
that had been done and
that the battle had

153
00:16:34,554 --> 00:16:39,321
ended. Many buildings
were demolished and many
Soul Reapers were injured.

154
00:16:39,354 --> 00:16:45,121
I wanted to find someone
who could explain what
happened. So I went over
to Squad Four's relief center.

155
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:54,521
I found Captain Unohana,
Captain Ukitake, and
other Soul Reapers that
had been staying at the

156
00:16:54,554 --> 00:16:56,421
Squad Four barracks.

157
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:07,288
Let me get this
straight-These renegades
did all this damage in a
few hours, and then just

158
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:08,988
quickly disappeared?

159
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:11,021
Without a trace, yes.

160
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:13,521
So many were injured in
the Seireitei.

161
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:18,021
They tore this place
apart. Starting with
Squad One's barracks,
they burned down a lot of

162
00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:19,988
our buildings. Right
to the ground.

163
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:24,688
The only good news we
have is that luckily they
left the relief center
untouched.

164
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:28,588
Squad Two and Twelve's
compounds are also still
intact.

165
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:32,321
Captain Soi Fon and the
rest of the Stealth Force
already headed out.

166
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:34,654
They going to try and
track down the Zanpakuto.

167
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:39,988
<i>And Captain</i>
<i>Kurotsuchi's already</i>
<i>investigating to find out</i>
<i>what's behind all of this.</i>

168
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:44,321
For now, let's use
Squad Four's barracks as
our command center.

169
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:49,954
I will start assigning
all of the able-bodied
Soul Reapers to security
posts immediately.

170
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:51,321
Yes, do that.

171
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:57,354
With Genryusai Yamamoto
missing, I think all of
us know that we need to
pull together.

172
00:17:57,554 --> 00:17:58,654
We do.

173
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,854
Guess I'd better
pitch in.

174
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:08,254
I'm going back to the
World of the Living.

175
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:14,854
We need to figure out why
these Zanpakuto are
rebelling. I'll have a talk
with Kisuke about this.

176
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:19,754
Yes, good idea. It seems
that we need as much help
as we can get.

177
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:22,621
Well then, I'll
get to it.

178
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:33,421
Well that news sure
cheered me up! Sounds
like the captains are
doing okay.

179
00:18:33,954 --> 00:18:38,754
The bad news is that the
Thirteen Court Guard
Squads are under the gun
and in terrible shape.

180
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:39,554
Depressing.

181
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:40,988
Lots of problems.

182
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:42,888
More depressing.

183
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:44,788
Ichigo.

184
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:45,921
Hm?

185
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:48,888
Have you noticed any
changes with your
Zanpakuto?

186
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:51,279
No. It hasn't
changed at all.

187
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:53,479
How about that?

188
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:58,212
So what we have here are
numerous reports from
Soul Reapers over in the
Soul Society, complaining

189
00:18:58,246 --> 00:19:01,946
about all the trouble
they're having
controlling their
Zanpakuto.

190
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:06,046
And like Ichigo, I've
had no problems with my
Benihime either.

191
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:11,512
So you're inferring
that whoever the enemy
is, their ability to exert
control over Zanpakuto...

192
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:16,579
Appears to work only in
the Soul Society and it
has no effect here in the
World of the Living.

193
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:23,046
Is the enemy's power
unable to reach the World of
the Living or is there another
reason for this dynamic?

194
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,746
I'd say we won't know
until we take a deeper
look into all of this.

195
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:32,212
All right. Tomorrow morning,
I'll head back to the Soul
Society again.

196
00:19:32,246 --> 00:19:34,212
<i>Yes, please do.</i>

197
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:36,712
Yoruichi. My brother?

198
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:41,812
Well, I was told
they've confirmed the
whereabouts of all the
Squad captains,

199
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:45,012
lieutenants, and
high-ranking officers.

200
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:48,912
The only one still
classified as missing, is
your brother.

201
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,379
I knew it.

202
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:01,279
Don't worry...

203
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:04,379
Byakuya's gotta be
okay.

204
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:08,079
Do you really think they
could take down someone
as strong as he is?

205
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:11,312
Never.

206
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:26,979
Good evening!

207
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:27,946
Hm?

208
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:29,612
Bad news, Ichigo!

209
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,846
Why are you here this
late?!

210
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:33,212
It's an emergency!

211
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:34,846
A big problem!

212
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:37,146
It's Rukia-she's
disappeared!

213
00:20:38,712 --> 00:20:40,346
She what?!

214
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:45,512
Rukia!
Poor Rukia!

215
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:52,746
It sure looks like a
Senkaimon's been opened.
Guess Rukia must've gone
back to the Soul Society.

216
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:57,279
What does Rukia think
she's doing?! She knows
she's too weak to go
back in there.

217
00:20:57,846 --> 00:21:02,303
She must have been so
worried about her brother
that she couldn't stay
behind.

218
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:03,803
She sure is tough.

219
00:21:05,836 --> 00:21:09,736
Kisuke, open up a
Senkaimon. I'll go get
her.

220
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,803
Think about this-Ichigo!

221
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:16,736
With the current situation,
I'd say it's too dangerous!
Before you go there, we need
to have more info.

222
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,203
We can't wait around,
we may not have that much
time!

223
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:21,870
I'd think twice.

224
00:21:21,903 --> 00:21:24,303
<i>I say you let him go.</i>

225
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:28,303
I'll be heading back to
the Soul Society in a few
hours myself.

226
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:32,070
Don't you think I'll
be able to get a lot more
done if someone else went
with me?

227
00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:33,670
I second that!

228
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:36,003
Come on, Kisuke!

229
00:21:37,103 --> 00:21:38,670
All right...

230
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,803
Looks like I can't stop
you... So go on.

231
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,236
I'll do whatever I can
to help both of you from
here.

232
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,870
Just try not to rush into
things.

233
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:55,903
Got it.

234
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:58,436
Ichigo.
Let's go.

235
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,536
Just stay calm, Rukia.

236
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:06,136
Don't do anything
crazy.

237
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:48,731
Rukia! I'm coming right
way!

238
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:50,298
<i>So Kon, you're ready to</i>
<i>go?</i>

239
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:51,931
Yeah!

240
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:54,065
<i>Ya know you're gonna</i>
<i>have to fight lots of</i>
<i>Zanpakuto, right?</i>

241
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:55,498
Yeah?

242
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:57,598
<i>You'll have to fight</i>
<i>swords with your bare</i>
<i>hands.</i>

243
00:23:57,631 --> 00:24:00,231
Rukia, I think I'll
take a rain check...
