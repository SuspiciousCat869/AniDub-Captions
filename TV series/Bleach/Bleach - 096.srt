[theme music]

2
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:52,542
-Getsuga Tensho!

3
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:15,208
-Oh.

4
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:15,708
Ichigo.

5
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:36,642
-Too slow.

6
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:48,875
Byakuya.

7
00:02:48,908 --> 00:02:50,575
You gotta stop doing that.

8
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:53,608
If you keep it up, you're
going to get me killed too.

9
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:56,075
-I warned you that
you were in the way.

10
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:56,775
-What?

11
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:58,708
You know, you suck.

12
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:10,042
What?

13
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,408
Damn it.

14
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:24,708
How's he able to catch
up with me like that?

15
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:27,908
-I may not have been blessed
with your native speed,

16
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,042
but my years of
fighting experience

17
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:32,108
have given me a bit
of an advantage.

18
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:34,708
-What?

19
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:38,875
-I know in advance exactly
which way you are going to move.

20
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:39,875
Too bad for you.

21
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:48,308
-It seems your wind defense
isn't so strong after all.

22
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:50,008
It can't protect you
against everything.

23
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:56,375
No matter how impenetrable
you may think your barrier is,

24
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:59,142
it's still possible
to get through it.

25
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,175
It's simply a matter of
using an attack that's

26
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,208
more powerful than
anything you have.

27
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:10,608
-It appears as though you're
much better than I thought.

28
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:11,642
But no matter.

29
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:14,675
You still won't be
able to defeat me.

30
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,508
I told you, the Soul
Society is filled

31
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,142
with concentrated reishi.

32
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,808
We Bounts heal immediately.

33
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:24,208
We are immortal here.

34
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:26,108
-Why don't we test that theory?

35
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,608
Prove your immortality.

36
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:53,875
-What the hell?

37
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,808
-Oh, what could it be now?

38
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,775
-But how?

39
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:19,242
-Huh?

40
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,242
That's so weird.

41
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:24,175
She looks like
that Yoshino lady.

42
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,042
-It can't be.

43
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:36,375
-So I finally found you.

44
00:06:36,408 --> 00:06:38,242
-What?

45
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:39,275
Who are you?

46
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:41,008
Tell me?

47
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:43,042
-You would know me as Ran'Tao.

48
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:44,475
-What the hell?

49
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:46,908
-No.

50
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:49,808
-Did you say Ran'Tao?

51
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,508
-Yes.

52
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:52,842
Ran'Tao.

53
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,308
She's the one who was
exiled from the Seideitei

54
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:58,142
after creating the Bounts.

55
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:00,642
-So you're still alive?

56
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:02,175
-Hold on a second.

57
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,775
Are you really her?

58
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,042
I mean, your face.

59
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:06,575
You look just like--

60
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:08,408
-The attitude of
the Soul Reapers

61
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:12,142
seems to have changed a great
deal, and not for the better.

62
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:13,042
-What?

63
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,508
-How vulgar.

64
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,475
-Huh?

65
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:18,842
-Isn't the fact that I have
knowledge of the Bounts proof

66
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,608
that I am who I say I am?

67
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,175
I'm the only one who
knows about the Bounts,

68
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:29,208
other than the Soul
Reapers of the Seideitei.

69
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:31,008
All of the
information on Bounts,

70
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:34,008
except for a small archive,
should have been destroyed.

71
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:42,108
You're a Bount, aren't you?

72
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:46,675
There's no doubt in your mind
that I am the real Ran'Tao.

73
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,508
You can feel it, can't you?

74
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:51,775
I was certain
you'd come one day,

75
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:54,075
though I never imagined
it would take this long.

76
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,575
But still, I waited.

77
00:07:58,242 --> 00:07:59,542
-Indeed.

78
00:07:59,575 --> 00:08:02,875
Our arrival was delayed
for a very long time,

79
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:05,542
and we Bounts have
suffered every second

80
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:07,408
of that lengthy wait.

81
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:12,075
We owe our retched
existence to you?

82
00:08:12,108 --> 00:08:13,775
-You're a much
more emotional man

83
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:16,308
than your expression
would indicate.

84
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:18,508
And quite short tempered,
despite your demeanor.

85
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:27,775
Do you want to kill me?

86
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:28,542
-Hold on a minute.

87
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:33,742
-If you're really Ran'Tao,
we've got a lot of questions

88
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:35,675
and you're the only
one with the answers,

89
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,975
so I'm afraid I can't
allow you to die here.

90
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:43,608
-I don't recall saying anything
about killing her here and now.

91
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:45,408
-What?

92
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,442
-Why would I want that?

93
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:51,008
I want her to live so she
can see us achieve our goal,

94
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:55,242
to see what happened as
a result of her actions.

95
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:59,708
I will kill her, but only after
I've destroyed the Seideitei.

96
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:00,308
-Damn you.

97
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,775
Byakuya.

98
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:07,475
-I told you already.

99
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:10,175
I will kill all who are
enemies of the Soul Society.

100
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:15,575
-Come back!

101
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:36,475
I guess Byakuya's
not the only one who

102
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,308
can get through your
so-called wind defense.

103
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:50,742
-Hm?

104
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:04,775
-Now Kariya.

105
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:06,375
We should get out of here.

106
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:07,408
-All right.

107
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:08,375
-Come, Dalk.

108
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:11,342
Cover us.

109
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,575
-Well.

110
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:15,775
Look at all those handsome men.

111
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:17,275
I'm so sorry.

112
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:20,108
I'm afraid I just can't
play with you today.

113
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:20,608
Ha!

114
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,508
-Ririn, can you tell
where they went?

115
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:48,075
No.

116
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:49,408
I'm afraid not.

117
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:50,808
It's no good.

118
00:10:50,842 --> 00:10:53,775
My sensors aren't working right,
after all those explosions.

119
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:55,675
-Damn.

120
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,642
Hey.

121
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:57,942
-What?

122
00:10:57,975 --> 00:11:00,375
-Are you just going
to let Kariya go?

123
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:04,375
-He's already disappeared
somewhere over the horizon.

124
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:06,842
-Don't you think chasing
him would do any good?

125
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,208
-There's always next time.

126
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:15,608
-Man, you're a
real piece of work.

127
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,275
So what's the deal?

128
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:20,742
Are you with us, or are
you would against us?

129
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:21,542
[laughter]

130
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:39,656
-Heh, heh, heh.

131
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:42,823
A lot more are showing
up than I expected.

132
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:46,156
Ichinose, if they keep
pouring in at this rate,

133
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:49,723
we're going to start
running out of room.

134
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:51,623
-I guess this means
there are a lot of people

135
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:54,156
who weren't too happy
with the Seireitei.

136
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:55,123
-Huh?

137
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:56,189
Now what?

138
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:58,856
Where the heck did
Kariya disappear to?

139
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,923
I don't see Koga, either.

140
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:02,289
He must have gone with him.

141
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:03,856
-They'll be back very soon.

142
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:18,489
-Hm?

143
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:19,089
Ichigo.

144
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:19,956
Someone's coming.

145
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,923
-Where?

146
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:23,923
Hm?

147
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:26,423
Uryu!

148
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:27,923
-Ichigo.

149
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,489
You're safe.

150
00:12:29,523 --> 00:12:32,089
Good.

151
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:34,523
But-- Yoshino?

152
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:36,823
How--

153
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,289
-Hm?

154
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:39,056
-No.

155
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:40,123
It's Ran'Tao.

156
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:42,123
The one Yoruichi told us about.

157
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:43,289
-What?

158
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:44,823
Your clothing.

159
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:46,356
You're a Quincy?

160
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:49,356
-What exactly is going on here?

161
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:51,689
-A Soul Reaper and a Quincy.

162
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:53,356
That's a very
interesting combination.

163
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:59,256
If you're planning on going
up against the Bounts,

164
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:02,823
then I can safely assure
you that I'm not your enemy.

165
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:03,689
-All right, then.

166
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:05,056
Since you're not
with the Bounts,

167
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:08,723
what can you tell
us that will help?

168
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:12,189
-Before I do that, I'll
take care of your wounds.

169
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:14,189
-Huh?

170
00:13:14,223 --> 00:13:16,289
-My home is nearby.

171
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:18,089
We can continue talking there.

172
00:13:25,523 --> 00:13:26,989
-There, there.

173
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,156
All right, Bonnie, hold on.

174
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:30,256
Take a rest.

175
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:31,623
Now, let's see.

176
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:35,856
Unless I'm wrong, he should be
somewhere right around here.

177
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:36,723
-Uh, Ganju?

178
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,056
You sure about this?

179
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:39,823
-Watch and see.

180
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:41,256
[whistle]

181
00:13:56,023 --> 00:13:57,956
-Huh?

182
00:13:57,989 --> 00:13:59,223
-What's this?

183
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,856
-He's bull Bull of Kusajishi.

184
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,889
-So, what are you after, Ganju?

185
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:05,989
-Hey.

186
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:07,756
It's been a while, huh?

187
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,556
-Damn, that hurts!

188
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:27,223
-Hm?

189
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:28,489
-Just deal with it.

190
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:29,823
I'm almost done.

191
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:31,489
-Ah!

192
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:32,523
-That's it.

193
00:14:32,556 --> 00:14:35,656
You're all healed.

194
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:36,489
-Hey!

195
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:38,256
My wounds are completely healed.

196
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:39,556
-Of course they are.

197
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:42,589
Never underestimate science.

198
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:46,456
Now, where should I
begin the explanation?

199
00:14:46,489 --> 00:14:47,889
But first, tell me.

200
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:51,489
How much exactly do you
know about these Bounts?

201
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,289
-We know that you
were using human souls

202
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:55,289
in your experiments.

203
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:57,856
Trying to create life
that would never die.

204
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:00,956
I learned that much from
the leader of the Bounts.

205
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,856
Kariya told me that.

206
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:04,189
-Kariya.

207
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:05,756
I see.

208
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:08,523
So that man earlier is
actually their leader.

209
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:09,023
-Yeah.

210
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:14,723
-We had thoroughly prepared,
and there was never

211
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:16,489
the slightest doubt.

212
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:19,323
Success seemed inevitable.

213
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:21,823
ICHIGO: But then
there was an accident.

214
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,889
It affected the
cycle of rebirth.

215
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,889
And that was what
created the Bounts.

216
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:26,389
Wasn't it?

217
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:37,456
-Right.

218
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:40,389
There was no place in the world
of the living for the Bounts,

219
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:43,889
so they turned to
the Soul Society.

220
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:47,356
But the Soul Society
rejected them completely.

221
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:49,889
They thought that if they
allowed the Bounts in,

222
00:15:49,923 --> 00:15:53,156
it would have required
accepting their existence.

223
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:54,856
In other words,
they would have had

224
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,923
to admit their guilt in
creating an entire sub-species

225
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:02,123
as a mere side effect
of the experiment.

226
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:05,189
Repudiated and
abandoned, the Bounts

227
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:08,789
tried to fight their way
into the Soul Society.

228
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:12,289
And that was when the
Quincys became involved.

229
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:24,989
-Urgh!

230
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:33,589
[shouting]

231
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:39,989
RAN'TAO: The Soul Society
seized their opportunity,

232
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:42,923
and nearly succeeded in
annihilating the Bounts.

233
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:48,389
[screaming]

234
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,489
Those who escaped, or
were living elsewhere

235
00:16:58,523 --> 00:17:01,156
during that battle,
they are the survivors

236
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:03,789
that we are fighting today.

237
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,889
They have joined up with Kariya.

238
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:09,456
-You took the time to
gather all this information.

239
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:12,256
Why haven't you done
anything before now?

240
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:14,489
You were one of the
people who created them.

241
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:16,523
Couldn't you have
done something?

242
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:20,723
Why didn't you go to the
world of the living to help?

243
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:25,056
You're so concerned, and yet you
haven't done anything for them.

244
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,389
Nothing.

245
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:30,089
As a scientist, didn't you
feel any responsibility at all?

246
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:31,823
Even if they were
created by accident?

247
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:40,189
-Wha--?

248
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:47,189
RAN'TAO: At the time, I was
exiled from the Seireitei.

249
00:17:47,223 --> 00:17:51,089
My Soul Reaper powers
were taken away from me.

250
00:17:51,123 --> 00:17:53,956
That included visiting
the world of the living.

251
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:58,123
I don't even have the
ability to leave here.

252
00:17:58,156 --> 00:18:00,656
-Then what was that power you
used out there earlier when

253
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:02,389
you got between us?

254
00:18:02,423 --> 00:18:05,489
-After many years and
much diligent research,

255
00:18:05,523 --> 00:18:08,323
I was finally able to regain
enough spiritual pressure

256
00:18:08,356 --> 00:18:09,656
to fight.

257
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:13,923
However, that's a resource
which is extremely limited.

258
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:19,356
ICHIGO: But I don't understand.

259
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:23,423
Why were you exiled from the
Seireitei in the first place?

260
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:28,089
-The ones in the Seireitei--
the ones who chose to exile me--

261
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:30,456
were quite relieved to
learn that the Bounts didn't

262
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:32,723
have the reishi
conversion ability.

263
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:34,389
-Did they think they'd
be safe if things

264
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:37,056
were setlled in the
world of the living?

265
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,456
-I made a very
unpopular prediction.

266
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:41,723
I said it was inevitable
that the Bounts would

267
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:45,789
use any means they could to
return to the Soul Society.

268
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:47,423
I came up with a plan.

269
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:49,923
I suggested that we publicize
everything and accept

270
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,523
the Bounts into our society.

271
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:55,056
And this was my reward.

272
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:56,489
-Sorry to hear that.

273
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:01,323
-Quincy.

274
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:02,789
-Hm?

275
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:04,389
-I think it's fair
to say that I'm

276
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:06,889
the source of many
of your problems.

277
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:10,289
It was actually your power
Kariya used to come here.

278
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:12,889
Wasn't it?

279
00:19:12,923 --> 00:19:13,423
-Yes.

280
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:14,123
-Hm.

281
00:19:14,156 --> 00:19:15,456
That's very interesting.

282
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,389
What's the connection?

283
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,589
But the fact is the Bounts
did use the Quincy power.

284
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:23,789
So it would make sense that
you should be considered

285
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:26,523
their ally, since
you helped them.

286
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,156
But from everything
I've seen, you

287
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:30,956
consider them to be
your bitter enemy.

288
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:33,289
How do you explain this?

289
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:34,989
-Well--

290
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:38,689
-There was a lot
of stuff going on.

291
00:19:38,723 --> 00:19:41,323
-Let me ask this.

292
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:42,589
that gauntlet.

293
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:46,456
Do you have any idea
what its power is?

294
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,523
-What is it?

295
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:51,389
-That tool is
incredibly dangerous.

296
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,589
If you use it recklessly--

297
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:54,223
-Yes.

298
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:55,356
That much I know.

299
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:57,123
But I have to use this power.

300
00:19:57,156 --> 00:19:59,356
It's the only thing I know
that will defeat the Bounts

301
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:00,223
and Kariya.

302
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:01,923
And I must use it.

303
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:03,323
No matter what.

304
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:05,589
-And you think you're
ready for this, do you?

305
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,323
I see.

306
00:20:10,356 --> 00:20:12,056
Well, be careful.

307
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:13,756
Let's hope there
aren't any problems.

308
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:17,723
Not just for yourself,
but for anyone around you.

309
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:19,189
-Hey.

310
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:20,823
-No, it's all right, I'm fine.

311
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,823
-Are you sure?

312
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:29,523
-Didn't you think that my
appearance was, perhaps,

313
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:31,323
a little unusual?

314
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,989
-How?

315
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,056
-Agewise.

316
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:35,889
You see, I'm actually
quite a bit older

317
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:37,923
than most Soul Reapers are.

318
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:39,323
-What?

319
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:42,723
-What I'm saying is that it was
necessary to do a little work

320
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:47,223
on myself so I'd be able to
wait for the Bount's arrival.

321
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:48,256
Sorry.

322
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,723
I have to rest now
for about 12 hours.

323
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:51,889
-12 hours?

324
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:53,923
-Yes.

325
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:55,056
-Wait a minute.

326
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:56,123
Hold on.

327
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:57,489
There's still some
things I need to know.

328
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,189
-When I recover.

329
00:20:59,223 --> 00:20:59,856
We'll talk then.

330
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:09,889
RIRIN: She's already asleep.

331
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:14,089
-Just like that?

332
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:16,389
I hadn't even finished
talking to her yet.

333
00:21:16,423 --> 00:21:18,556
-She says she's a lot
older than she looks,

334
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:21,823
so I guess it can't be helped.

335
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:22,789
-Hm.

336
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,223
So what do we do?

337
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:27,289
Are we going back
to Kukaku's house?

338
00:21:27,323 --> 00:21:28,623
-No.

339
00:21:28,656 --> 00:21:30,723
We have a lot of things we need
to ask her when she finally

340
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,456
gets around to waking up
again, so we should probably

341
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:35,089
just get some rest while we can.

342
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:37,589
-Yeah, that sounds
like a good idea.

343
00:21:42,523 --> 00:21:45,789
KOGA: How was Byakuya Kuchiki?

344
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:47,423
-Not too bad.

345
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:50,356
I think going up against him
made a pretty good declaration

346
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:51,889
of our intentions.

347
00:21:51,923 --> 00:21:54,456
-And was that really your goal?

348
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:59,423
-I've noticed you've had a
lot of questions lately, Koga.

349
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:02,123
-Maybe because I'm
in such high spirits.

-Ichinose.

352
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:11,323
-Yes?

353
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:12,956
-Where are the others right now?

354
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:15,389
-Watching and recording the
movements in the Seireitei,

355
00:22:15,423 --> 00:22:17,556
as you instructed them to do.

356
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:18,723
-I see.

357
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:20,289
It's almost time.

358
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:21,723
-Yes.

359
00:22:21,756 --> 00:22:24,123

ORIHIME: Rukia has such
a cool older brother.

362
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:11,656
Calm, refined, and
incredibly wonderful!

363
00:24:11,689 --> 00:24:14,289
ICHIGO: You mean, insensitive,
inarticulate, and stupid?

364
00:24:14,323 --> 00:24:14,989
BYAKUYA: Scatter.

365
00:24:15,023 --> 00:24:17,589
Senbonzakura.

366
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,456
I told you once
you're in the way.

367
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:20,523
ICHIGO: Wait a minute.

368
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:22,756
I thought you'd gone home.

KON: Illustrated
Guide to Soul Reapers.

00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:35,456
MEN: Golden.

372
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:36,489
-A souvenir, huh?

373
00:24:36,523 --> 00:24:38,756
-Yes, Captain Komamura.

374
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:40,623
I heard of your
unhappiness that there

375
00:24:40,656 --> 00:24:43,223
weren't any hair combs
suitable for you.

376
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:45,156
So when I went to the
world of the living--

377
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:51,489
-It looks very different
than a regular comb.

378
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,623
Oh.

379
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:54,923
Mm.

380
00:24:54,956 --> 00:24:55,956
Oh yes.

381
00:24:55,989 --> 00:24:57,289
Quite a rarity.

382
00:24:57,323 --> 00:24:58,923
-I'm so pleased he's happy.

383
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:02,723
Orihime Inoue knows
the best stores.
