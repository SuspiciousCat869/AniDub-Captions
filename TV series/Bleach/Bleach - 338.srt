1
00:01:57,135 --> 00:01:58,871
Are you Ouko Yushima?

2
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:06,888
He's not responding so
far.

3
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:09,259
Hey, you there! Get up!

4
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:13,267
Wakie wakie! Hey, anybody
in there?!

5
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,369
It's no use.

6
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:16,473
Huh?

7
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:20,815
I hate to say this, but
it doesn't look to me
like he'll ever regain
consciousness.

8
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:22,719
Are you serious?

9
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:32,772
[straining]

10
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:48,338
[roaring]

11
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:55,718
Hey! Snap out of it! Come
on!

12
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:57,589
It won't do any good.

13
00:02:57,622 --> 00:03:01,930
But if he won't talk to
us, we'll never be able
to get him to reveal the
location of Kageroza's

14
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,701
secret lab.

15
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:09,780
Here we finally
discovered where the
developer of Mod Souls
was hiding and he's no help.

16
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,453
Actually, I was sort of
expecting this.

17
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,423
Huh?

18
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:18,865
The Soul Society wanted
to hide the existence of
Project Spearhead...
Knowing he'd be locked

19
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,535
away, Ouko likely---

20
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:21,471
Uh!

21
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:24,944
What's going on?

22
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:27,483
I believe this is
a clue to finding
the lab.

23
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:29,220
Are you serious?

24
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,224
What is it?

25
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:32,459
It's blood.

26
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,764
Blood? Whose?

27
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,703
I don't know yet, but it
seems to still be fresh.

28
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:49,293
It doesn't appear to be
his blood... Which
means... Someone else
came to see him recently.

29
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:50,696
Kageroza!

30
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:51,765
Yes.

31
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:08,898
But how's that blood
going to help us find the
location of the lab?

32
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:12,674
Well, my friend, we need to
thank Mayuri for that bit
of fortune.

33
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:17,950
Huh? Wait, isn't that
device for finding
Reishi?

34
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:23,561
Yes, indeed. Right now
I'm using it to scan
this blood sample so we
can track down Kageroza.

35
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:27,970
Track him down? But I
thought you said his
Spiritual Pressure
couldn't be detected.

36
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:31,578
If it was just his blood
alone, we'd be out of
luck...

37
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:35,720
However, Mayuri was able
to inject Kageroza with a
certain drug.

38
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:40,394
Can you tell? It's very
powerful. It stops all
thought processes.

39
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:41,297
[chuckling]

40
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:47,610
That drug's still in
his system. So if we can
trace the signature matching
this blood, then...

41
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:58,331
...That's where Kageroza
will be! And we'll find
his lab!

42
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,903
Exactly my thought!

43
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,788
[roaring]

44
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:12,594
[panting and gasping]

45
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:17,570
It's a Hollow!

46
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,842
What's it doing here?!

47
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:22,312
What squad are you men
with?

48
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:24,951
[gasping]
Lieutenant Ise!

49
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:29,093
Listen to me carefully.
All squads are to stand
by at their barracks.

50
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:32,901
But... Where did this
Hollow come from, ma'am?!

51
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:37,409
And we also sense
Captain-level Spiritual
Pressures clashing
everywhere!

52
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:38,780
What's going
on here?!

53
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,950
It's very confusing and
upsetting!

54
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:42,587
Everyone calm down!

55
00:05:42,587 --> 00:05:44,456
[roaring]

56
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,599
[roaring]

57
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,335
[gasping]

58
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:52,775
That Hollow needs to be
dealt with, immediately.

59
00:05:52,808 --> 00:05:54,510
Take him down.

60
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:55,780
Yes ma'am!

61
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,887
Hmph.

62
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:01,091
[grunting]

63
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:05,767
[grunting]

64
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:08,005
[grunting]

65
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:18,993
Give it up. I am the true
head of the Kuchiki Clan.

66
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:29,080
Hey Byakuya! Looks like
you're having trouble
there, my friend-- Do you
need some help?

67
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:32,120
No thanks. Do not
interfere.

68
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:35,793
However, if you need any
help, feel free to ask.

69
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:37,030
Heh!

70
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:41,171
[growling]

71
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:46,548
I don't need help. I'm
havin' way too much fun!

72
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,654
By the way... Let me make
this clear...!

73
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:52,460
This one's mine, so
don't butt in!

74
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,540
Well now.. Looks to me
like they have the edge
on us.

75
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:02,780
I see that the
capabilities of the
Reigai have improved.
Damn that Kageroza.

76
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:05,152
He sure knows how to make
the party exciting.

77
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:08,092
Say... You think they
brought some drinks?

78
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:10,965
Don't joke about this.
Here they come.

79
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,433
Bushogoma!

80
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,945
Hey, that's a pretty good
imitation of me!

81
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,515
Bushogoma!

82
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,785
Sogyonokotowari!

83
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:24,824
Uh!

84
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:25,926
Huh!

85
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:29,033
Sogyonokotowari!

86
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:37,083
Great move!
That was really
nice return fire.

87
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:39,789
Stop fooling around,
Shunsui! What's the
matter with you?

88
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:44,532
I guess you're right. It
does seem inappropriate
to the circumstances.

89
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:52,948
I suggest we make a
strategic retreat.

90
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:55,553
Right! You heard her,
everyone!

91
00:07:55,586 --> 00:08:00,464
All Captains, cease
your attacks against the
Reigai! We're pulling
back!

92
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:01,998
I won't give in to these
frauds!

93
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:03,068
That's an order, Captain!

94
00:08:03,102 --> 00:08:07,211
It's no use trying to
run. You will die here.

95
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:11,486
Gokei...! Senbonzakura,
Kagayoshi!

96
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:12,754
Bushogoma!

97
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:15,059
Guncho Tsurara!

98
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:17,164
[yelling]

99
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:21,739
Hado Number Eighty-eight!
Hiryu Gekizoku Shinten
Raiho!

100
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:30,055
This is the place!

101
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:33,863
It's humongous! What is
this structure?

102
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:38,806
It's the Senkaimon, a
gateway to the World of
the Living. It's the main

103
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,846
gate used by all Soul
Reapers in the Soul
Society.

104
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,516
Why exactly are
we here?

105
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,919
I'm not sure myself.

106
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:48,293
I gotta tell you, you
don't inspire too much
confidence.

107
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:50,530
[gasping]
Hold it.

108
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:56,008
Is that a Reigai?

109
00:08:56,042 --> 00:09:00,050
It looks to me like this
is definitely the right
place!

110
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,794
And on top of that, it
looks as though I'll
have to battle it out
with my Reigai, as well.

111
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:10,737
Listen carefully. While I
distract him, use the
opportunity to find a way
inside.

112
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:16,181
Wait a minute, why me?!
I'm no good with technology
and computer programs and I
have no idea what to do!

113
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:21,859
It's really not that
hard. It's just the same
as what I did at the Department
of Research and Development.

114
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:27,270
I'll try and catch up
as soon as I can. Until
then, it's up to you to
carry out this mission.

115
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:31,746
Listen, I hear what
you're saying, but I'm
not sure that I can
really...

116
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,950
Remember, Nozomi
could be there.

117
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,789
Is that right?! I'm on
it, then!

118
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:41,767
That must be the
entrance. Well, here
goes.

119
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,136
[grunting]

120
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:54,158
You caught me off guard,
friend. I see you came
dressed ready for the
occasion.

121
00:09:54,191 --> 00:09:57,865
You knew it was me all
along? Should have
expected that.

122
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:08,854
I have to tell you, it
feels kind of awkward..
Crossing swords with
myself like this.

123
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:12,995
You really think so?
That's funny, it doesn't
bother me at all.

124
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:16,001
I'm just sorry you insist
on getting in the way!

125
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:21,278
This is my chance!

126
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:29,228
[panting]

127
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:33,670
This way!

128
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,214
Nozomi! Where are you
being held?!

129
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:42,320
[panting]

130
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:44,794
No... This way!

131
00:10:49,836 --> 00:10:51,306
Come on, Nozomi!

132
00:10:58,754 --> 00:11:00,356
I'm coming, Nozomi!

133
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:21,332
[gasping]

134
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:25,340
Nozomi!

135
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:36,831
Nozomi! Hey, Nozomi!

136
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:40,471
It's me, Kon! Can you
hear me? Wake up,
willya?!

137
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:43,010
[groaning]

138
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:48,219
Come on, Nozomi! You've
gotta wake up! I'm here
to rescue you! Nozomi!

139
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:50,189
[gasping]

140
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:54,332
Will you shut up... you
pervert.

141
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:56,971
[choking up]
Nozomi...!

142
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:01,079
I'm gonna get you right
outta there!

143
00:12:04,152 --> 00:12:06,222
But how do I
get you out?

144
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:07,358
You need to go.

145
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:08,360
Huh?

146
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,868
Hurry. Get out of here.

147
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:17,144
I'm not leaving! Why do
you think I came all this
way to find you?!

148
00:12:17,178 --> 00:12:24,158
So just relax! I'm gonna
rescue you and restore
Ichigo's Spirit Energy!
Two birds one stone!

149
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:26,062
Listen to me! Get out
while you can!

150
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:30,270
I said I'm not leaving,
so save your breath! I'm
not going to ignore a
friend in trouble!

151
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,774
[grunting]

152
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:33,076
I'm your friend?

153
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,915
All right. How do I do
this?

154
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:39,957
Let's see... First, I'll
restore Ichigo's Spirit
Energy...

155
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:42,029
What did Clog-Dude say?

156
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:49,142
It's really not that hard.
It's just the same as what I
did at the Department of
Research and Development.

157
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:51,746
Yeah. Except I can't
remember what he did!

158
00:12:51,746 --> 00:12:54,085
This happens all the
time! I'm such an idiot!

159
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:58,761
That sounded to me like
Kon screaming. I'd better
hurry!

160
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:00,330
You're not going
anywhere.

161
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,171
A portable Gigai?!

162
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:04,873
That's correct.

163
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:06,176
[grunting]

164
00:13:10,217 --> 00:13:13,791
I even impressed myself!
Damn, I'm good.

165
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:16,329
Yes, I am. Thanks.

166
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:22,041
Uhhh... Hmm...?!

167
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:27,486
Come on, think, of
something, Kon! If I don't
hurry, Nozomi will end up
being fused with Kageroza!

168
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,094
And if that happens,
Ichigo and the other Soul
Reapers will all be
toast!

169
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:36,937
I'm not going to let
that happen! But damn it,
how are you supposed to
work this thing?!

170
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:39,342
I'm not kidding! You've
got to get out of here!

171
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:41,112
I said forget it!

172
00:13:41,146 --> 00:13:45,555
Once the fusion is
complete.. There's no
telling what will happen.

173
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:51,233
Hold on a minute! Are you
saying you don't even
know what's next? I can't
believe this!

174
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:54,907
So once you're fused...
Will you no longer be
you?

175
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,314
I don't know. But I know
about Ouko Yushima...

176
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:02,189
He swore an oath of
vengeance against the
Soul Society.

177
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:08,935
After all the brilliant
work he did in the
creation of Mod Souls,
they refused to recognize

178
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:13,444
his accomplishments. To
get revenge, he split
himself into two Mod
Souls...

179
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:18,086
In the process, his
original body became a
mere shell.

180
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:33,385
[grunting]

181
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:36,189
Don't move!

182
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:44,273
Hey! What happened?!

183
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,543
Damn it! Call Squad Four,
quickly!

184
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:55,394
Hide... Lose yourself
among those incompetent
Soul Reapers and hide
your existence. And one

185
00:14:55,428 --> 00:15:03,209
day, my legacy shall be
fulfilled... You two will
carry on my will and complete
my research...

186
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,218
[stunned]

187
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:14,166
By splitting himself in
two, his Spirit Energy
also changed so he
could go unnoticed.

188
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:19,276
In the split, Kageroza
inherited Ouko's
vengeance and ambition.

189
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:20,546
And you, Nozomi?

190
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,685
I inherited his
self-control.

191
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,194
Kageroza and I... are
just like darkness and
light.

192
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:33,270
Like the light? Then there's
a good chance you'll
still remain, after the
fusion!

193
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:37,613
I can't be sure. In the
end, I could be swallowed
up by the darkness.

194
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,383
What?!!

195
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:44,226
That is what I've been
trying to tell you all
this time, Kon. The
vengefulness Kageroza

196
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,465
inherited from Ouko
has gotten stronger.

197
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:50,639
...to the point where
even the light might be
swallowed.

198
00:15:50,672 --> 00:15:55,449
That's why you need to
get away quickly. While
I still have my
consciousness!

199
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:57,018
Nozomi...

200
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:07,172
Nozomi!

201
00:16:10,478 --> 00:16:12,349
Nozomi-Wait!!

202
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,065
[struggling]
Nozomi!!!

203
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:25,174
I told you I'm not
leaving!

204
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,244
[gasping]

205
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,320
How could I leave you?
You said you were the
light.

206
00:16:31,353 --> 00:16:34,761
I was all alone until I
met you.

207
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,167
The truth is, you're my
light, as well.

208
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,672
You and Ichigo changed
that for me.

209
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:43,545
And I won't let that
light be extinguished!

210
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:47,152
For the first time in my
life... I see I'm not
alone.

211
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:49,090
I promise I'll protect
you!

212
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:50,258
You and I, we're--

213
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,528
We're bound by...

214
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:53,231
... friendship!

215
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:58,408
Hado Number Thirty-Two...
Oukasen!

216
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,083
Hado Number Fifty-Four...
Haien!

217
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:10,365
Another portable Gigai?!
Man, give me a break!

218
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:14,574
[grunting]

219
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:15,742
[panting]

220
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:24,126
Oh, come on! How many
Gigai do you have?!

221
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,604
Why, I oughta--!
[yelling]

222
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:31,174
Kon...

223
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:32,676
[groaning]

224
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,119
Damnit. This isn't
working at all.

225
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:38,521
Mmm.

226
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,096
Listen to me!

227
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,298
Huh?

228
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:45,802
From this point on, do as
I tell you.

229
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:48,509
Really? You know what to
do?

230
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:51,547
From Kageroza... I read
his memory.

231
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:53,119
What did you see?

232
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,190
I'll tell you, but first,
we're going to need
Ichigo's Reishi.

233
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,793
I brought it with me!

234
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:04,740
Hey, watch it!

235
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,348
Out of portable Gigai? At
least, that's what it
looks like to me.

236
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,519
You're right, I've used
them all up.

237
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:12,856
Well, if you have any last
words, go right ahead.

238
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,531
How polite. But I'm
afraid I have some bad
news for you.

239
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:19,136
Despite what you
think, it isn't over
yet.

240
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,375
Is that so? Well, then...

241
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:25,817
Hado Number
Eighty-Eight... Hiryu
Gekizoku Shinten Raiho!

242
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:30,226
A Number Eighty-level
Hado, without an
incantation?!

243
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:38,876
Hey! It started up!
Nozomi, am I doing this
right?

244
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,350
Think so. Next, flip the
switch on the far right.

245
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:43,486
Got it!

246
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:51,668
Oh, yeah! That's the
ticket! It's working!

247
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:54,172
You can relax now,
Nozomi!

248
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:57,480
I'll have you out of
there in no time!

249
00:18:57,781 --> 00:19:00,520
So far, so good...

250
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:02,757
Come on, folks, let's
move it along!

251
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:08,603
This is sure taking
forever!

252
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:12,410
Come on, come on! Come
on, already!

253
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,461
I don't want to worry
you, but we seem to be at
a disadvantage here.

254
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,801
Regardless.. We can't
afford to lose this
fight.

255
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:30,145
You guys don't know when
to give up. Can't you
admit that you can't win
against us?

256
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:33,620
It's time for the Reigai
to become the real thing.

257
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:36,157
You might as well
surrender.

258
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:37,428
I refuse!

259
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:41,468
I don't understand. Why
do you continue to oppose
us? For what?

260
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:45,476
Don't make me repeat
myself.

261
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:49,584
We protect what must be
protected. That's all
there is to it.

262
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:54,729
We understand. But the
same is true for us, as
well.

263
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:58,737
Oh please. How can you
say such a thing?

264
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,708
He's right. We're not
really the same as you.

265
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:08,422
And you're about to see
why. In a few moments,
we'll show you what sets
us apart.

266
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:11,862
Mm.

267
00:20:16,806 --> 00:20:20,412
I swore an oath to
protect. And that's
what I'll do!

268
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:30,633
Just a little bit more...

269
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,474
[gasping]
Kon!

270
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:35,509
Huh?

271
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:37,347
Ah!

272
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:41,889
[gasping]

273
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,733
Kon! Kon!

274
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:48,268
Kon!

275
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:56,886
What are you doing?!

276
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:05,503
[trembling]

277
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:08,676
No, stop it! Stop!

278
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,916
[grunting]

279
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:23,572
Kon...!

280
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,729
[growling]

281
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:37,568
[grunting]

282
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:40,706
Hado Number Thirty-One!
Shakkaho!

283
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:47,889
Get back!

284
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:49,024
[gasping]

285
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,830
Get back!

286
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:55,872
[growling]

287
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:57,541
[gasping]

288
00:21:57,842 --> 00:22:00,981
[roaring]

289
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,064
What a pitiful creature.

290
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,853
I'm so proud of myself!
I'm strong, even as a
Reigai!

291
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:55,493
Come on, did you expect
anything less? There is
one small thing that
bothers, me, though.

292
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:58,761
What a coincidence! I
have a concern, as well!

293
00:23:58,795 --> 00:24:01,631
The stubble has to go!
Wow, we think alike!
