00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,008
NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

3
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,241
who has been kidnapped
by the Arrancars,

4
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:55,808
Ichigo, Uryu, and Chad have
snuck into Hueco Mundo.

5
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:58,841
They fought an endless stream
of Hollows and Arrancars

6
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:00,874
as they raced across
the desert on their way

7
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:03,774
to Sosuke Aizen's
fortress, Los Noches.

8
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:06,074
Joining them were
Rukia and Renji,

9
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:09,074
who unexpectedly followed
them into Hueco Mundo.

10
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:11,008
Before they could
reach Las Noches,

11
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:13,174
Runuganga, the Guardian
of the White Sand,

12
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,508
appeared before them,
and they were pulled down

13
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,741
into the depths of Hueco Mundo's
underground realm, the Menos

14
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:19,741
Forest.

15
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:21,274
The fall from the
surface separated

16
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,108
Rukia from the
rest of the group.

17
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:27,808
Now, as their search for Rukia
draws them deeper and deeper

18
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:30,541
into this dangerous
landscape, our heroes

19
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:33,341
are forced into yet another
fight against the Hollows,

20
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:36,541
who lurk around every
corner of this domain.

21
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,774
-Ichigo!

22
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:39,008
-Damn it, we've been caught!

23
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:39,908
I

24
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:41,541
-They're going to eat us!

25
00:02:41,574 --> 00:02:43,941
-No!

26
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:45,608
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
Rukia has been

27
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:49,241
rescued by a mysterious Soul
Reaper who remains silent

28
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:52,441
and keeps his face hidden
behind a Hollow's mask.

29
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:54,874
-Is that light created by Kido?

30
00:02:57,774 --> 00:02:59,308
It's true.

31
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:01,041
You're really a
Soul Reaper, right?

32
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:08,741
Tell the truth.

33
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:11,174
You left your squad, didn't you?

34
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,741
Well, what do you have to say?

35
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:15,141
-My name is Ashido.

36
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:15,641
-Ashido?

37
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,941
What are you trying to do?

38
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,408
Ah!

39
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:55,641
-Why'd you attack me?

40
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:58,274
-I was testing your strength.

41
00:03:58,308 --> 00:03:59,674
-For what reason?

42
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,774
-This forest is vicious.

43
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,674
The weak cannot survive here.

44
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,174
-Ashido.

45
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,608
-Someone's fighting.

46
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:15,741
I can sense it.

47
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:17,708
-That spiritual pressure.

48
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,241
It's Ichigo's.

49
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:21,741
-They're recklessly
exposing their position.

50
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:24,608
They're going to draw
the Menos toward them.

51
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,841
-I'm coming too.

52
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:26,441
-No.

53
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,341
Stay here.

54
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:28,174
-They're my friends.

55
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,341
I came here with them.

56
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:32,574
We fight together.

57
00:04:32,608 --> 00:04:34,974
-What's your name?

58
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,808
Tell me your name.

00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:39,308

No matter how many Menos
I destroy, more of them

just keep appearing.

-Ichigo!

00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:08,574
-This is completely crazy.

69
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,008
We should retreat!

70
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:10,808
-He's right.

71
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:11,641
We can't win.

72
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:12,941
There's just too many of them.

73
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:14,274
I know.

74
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:16,808
-Even so, what do we do
about Nel and her friends?

75
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:17,674
-Save them.

76

-And Rukia?

-We'll find her.

is to track down Nel.

-The atmosphere in the
forest has been agitated.

-Because of the
intruders, I imagine.

-If that's true, it looks like
the report from Las Noches

90
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,508
was correct.

something better.

I found you!

The second highest
ranking Menos.

152

They're superior to Gillians.

Is this the first
time you've seen one?

00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:45,608
-Yeah.

172
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:47,041
Thanks.

173
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:50,308
-It looks like Aroma soon
was defeated in battle.

174
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:51,841
-How is that possible?

175
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,841
Was it Ashido again?

176
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:55,074
-Not alone.

177
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,874
There was another spiritual
pressure here as well.

178
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,908
-The intruder we've
been hearing about?

179
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:01,041
-Yeah.

180
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:03,874
It looks like this one
is also a Soul Reaper.

181
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:07,908
-So the intruder and Ashido
are working together?

182
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:11,941
I wonder if our captives
are aware of this.

183
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:12,908
[whimpering]

184
00:11:12,941 --> 00:11:14,874
-We can use them as bait.

185
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,774
-This is more like a
nest than a forest.

186
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:29,574
-That's exactly what it is.

187
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:31,841
A giant nest of Hollows.

188
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:33,041
We better get moving.

189
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:34,374
-Yeah.

190
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:38,874
-I have to tell you, I
underestimated your strength.

191
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,774
With your abilities,
you shouldn't

192
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:42,374
have any trouble
fighting the Adjuchas.

193
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:48,241
-There's something I've been
wanting to ask you about.

194
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,341
-What is it?

195
00:11:54,374 --> 00:11:54,941
-That mask.

196
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,474
Why do you-- never mind.

197
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:01,808
You don't have to talk about it.

198
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,674
-I came here from the
Soul Society long ago.

199
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,808
It was several hundred
years ago, actually.

200
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:27,208
-Unbelievable.

201
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,241
-I know.

202
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:30,441
I was chasing after
a Hollow back then

203
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:32,841
as it was retreating
to Hueco Mundo.

204
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:36,141
I followed and landed in
this place before I knew it.

205
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:38,708
And I've been here
ever since, constantly

206
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,541
fighting and destroying Hollows.

207
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:42,474
-That's horrible.

208
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:45,174
Isn't there any way to escape?

209
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,141
-Yes, there is.

210
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:50,874
-Well, then why haven't
you tired to leave?

211
00:12:50,908 --> 00:12:55,474
-Because, I am a Soul Reaper.

212
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,141
-And so?

213
00:12:58,174 --> 00:12:59,708
-It's likely that
all of the Hollows

214
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:03,608
that appear in the world of
the living originate from here.

215
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:05,374
In which case, if
I can dramatically

216
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:07,741
reduce their numbers, then
the world of the living

217
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:10,541
will suffer much less damage.

218
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:13,274
That's why I stay and
kill as many as possible.

219
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:19,174
Has the number of
Hollows appearing

220
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,874
in the world of the
living decreased at all?

221
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:23,808
-Uh.

222
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:27,874
-I can tell from your
expression that it has not.

223
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:28,874
-I can't lie to you.

224
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,641
I'm afraid it's
gotten much worse.

225
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:32,441
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:33,908
-Don't apologize.

227
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:34,541
It's all right.

228
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:52,414
[laughing]

229
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:53,711
-You know, it
sounds like they're

230
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,511
planning some kind of banquet.

231
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:56,544
-You're right.

232
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:58,477
And Nel knows who
the main course is.

233
00:13:58,511 --> 00:13:59,477
-Wait a minute!

234
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:00,944
You're not talking about--

235
00:14:00,977 --> 00:14:05,211
[screaming]

236
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,927
-Now, let me ask
you something, OK?

237
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,593
Have you kept that hood up ever
since we arrived here or what?

238
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:10,427
-Yeah.

239
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,793
The whole time.

240
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:13,560
-I've got a plan to
get us out of here.

241
00:14:13,593 --> 00:14:20,527
[screaming]

242
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,727
[coughing]

243
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,727
-Everybody, gather
round and listen up.

244
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,927
Some important news about
our amazing younger sister.

245
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,360
-We forgot to tell you this.

246
00:14:31,393 --> 00:14:35,460
Our sister Nel was transformed
into an Arrancar by Lord Aizen.

247
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:38,227
She's now the Great Nel.

248
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,527
-Yeah.

249
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,460
-As proof, she's wearing
the Arrancar's cracked mask.

250
00:14:46,393 --> 00:14:51,260
[growling]

251
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:54,227
[laughing]

252
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,793
-The Great Nel is now looking
for an exit from here.

253
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:58,393
Does anyone in the
audience know where

254
00:14:58,427 --> 00:14:59,927
she might be able to find one?

255
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,760
-Go through the hole
in the rock over there.

256
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:03,693
It takes you right
to the surface.

257
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:04,593
-Thanks a lot.

258
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,127
-My mask is cracked a
little too, right here.

259
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,227
So long, suckers.

260
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,893
-That plan worked perfectly.

261
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:17,727
-Oh really?

262
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,193
And which plan was that?

263
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:24,060
I think it's about time we
all went back to my plan.

264
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:25,960
[screaming]

265
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,793
-Did we happen to mention
to you that Lord Aizen made

266
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,227
Nel an Arrancar?

267
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,227
-That gets you a free
cup of tea at Las Noches.

268
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,527
-Ah.

269
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
With lemon and sugar?

270
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:47,093
-Where are we?

271
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:51,260
-This is where we first
arrived centuries ago.

272
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:53,527
-You didn't travel
here by yourself?

273
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,993
-I had teammates with me.

274
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,827
We knew where we had
ended up and how important

275
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,960
it was to emerge victorious.

276
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,227
We fought with everything we'd
been taught as Soul Reapers.

277
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,560
But there were so many Hollows.

278
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:42,860
We were barely able
to contain them.

279
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:45,827
And then the Menos got
involved in the battle as well.

280
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,227
I saw friend after friend become
exhausted, until finally, they

281
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,127
were too weak to
resist, and were killed.

282
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:02,260
[screaming]

283
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:15,960
[screaming]

284
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:19,427
-In order to protect
human souls and keep

285
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,760
the promise I made to
those who lost their lives,

286
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:25,427
I stayed here and fought.

287
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,427
I won't allow their deaths
to have been in vain.

288
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,627
I asked you earlier if
the number of Hollows

289
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,227
had decreased.

290
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,927
I didn't ask in hopes of
hearing how well I was doing.

291
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,227
I just thought it would be nice
to report in to my friends.

292
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,793
-Sorry.

293
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:48,893
-It's OK.

294
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,060
You don't have to apologize.

295
00:18:52,627 --> 00:18:53,093
Rukia.

296
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:56,927
When you meet up
with your friends,

297
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,660
you should go right back
to the Soul Society.

298
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:02,293
If we're not making a dent
in the number of Hollows,

299
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:05,593
there's no point
in staying here.

300
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:08,360
-I'm not leaving until
I make it to Las Noches.

301
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:09,827
-What for?

302
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,327
-One of my friends is
being held captive there.

303
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,893
-There are Vasto Lordes
in that fortress.

304
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:18,193
Average warriors
can't defeat them.

305
00:19:18,227 --> 00:19:21,060
-So I've heard, but
I still have to try.

306
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,360
The girl's a friend of mine.

307
00:19:25,393 --> 00:19:27,593
A very dear friend.

308
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:28,593
Don't worry though.

309
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,760
I'm not going there on my own.

310
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:33,160
All of my friends will
work together to save her.

311
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:41,107
Ashido, why did
you bring me here?

312
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:47,007
-Whenever I talked, you'd
respond, ask questions,

313
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,174
and interact with me.

314
00:19:49,207 --> 00:19:53,474
I wanted to let my friends hear
another voice besides mine.

315
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:01,107
It's been quite a
while since they've

316
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:02,807
heard a different
Soul Reaper's voice.

317
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,074
[explosion]

318
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:18,407
-What going on?

319
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:19,607
-It's Ichigo.

320
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:20,241
-Follow me.

321
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:34,707
-Where are we?

322
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:37,274
-That's strange.

323
00:20:37,307 --> 00:20:41,274
I'm sure I felt your friend's
presence here just moments ago.

324
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,407
-You're right.

325
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,074
Now there's no spiritual
pressure left at all.

326
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:47,541
-Because I destroyed
all traces of it.

327
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:49,474
If I haven't done
that, I wouldn't

328
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:52,474
have been able to pull
off this ambush, would I?

329
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:53,941
Gillians, attack!

330
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:04,141
-There's-- there's
so many of them.

331
