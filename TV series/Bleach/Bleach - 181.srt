NARRATOR: In order to seize
power of the Kasumioji Clan,

3
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:54,794
Gyokaku Kumoi secretly
sent assassins

4
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:57,060
to kill the clan's
princess, Rurichiyo.

5
00:01:57,094 --> 00:02:00,060
Ichigo agreed to become
the princess's bodyguard

6
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:02,260
and fought to protect her.

7
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:05,394
After a fierce battle,
Ichigo defeated Hanza Nukui,

8
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:06,960
the leader of the assassins.

9
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,460
But Uryu and Chad
sustained serious injuries.

10
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,994
Princess Rurichiyo was
overwhelmed by guilt

11
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:16,760
at the suffering she had caused.

12
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:18,627
So she returned to
the Soul Society,

13
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,394
hoping to stop the fighting.

14
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:23,494
Rurichiyo was already aware
that Kumoi was the one targeting

15
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:26,727
her, but she returned
home to go through

16
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,994
with her arranged
marriage anyway.

17
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:31,260
Ichigo and the others
followed Rurichiyo

18
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:34,594
and interrupted the ceremony.

19
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:35,094

-Hey, Rurichiyo!

25
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:55,260
Rurichiyo, listen to me.

26
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:56,094
-Huh?

27
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:56,960
What?

28
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:59,094
-Rurichiyo, we've come for you.

29
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:01,494
It's me, Ichigo.

-Stop panicking.

00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,994
Calm down!

-Stop right there.

40

-Ichigo Kurosaki, what could
you possibly be thinking?

41
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:47,994
To intrude upon a ceremony
for nobles is forbidden.

42
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,560
-Captain Sui-Feng,
please hear me out.

43
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:52,494
There's a good reason for this.

44
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:54,927
This marriage and the
naming of the new clan lord

45
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,194
would not be valid if
allowed to proceed.

46
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:01,060
-Sorry.

47
00:04:01,094 --> 00:04:02,394
Can you give me just a second?

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,660
-Go ahead.

49
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:14,927
-Rurichiyo, I'm
sorry-- sorry that we

50
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,960
made you feel alone
instead of protecting you.

51
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:20,194
We drove you into a corner.

52
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:25,060
We all know how much
you've been through,

53
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:27,360
and we came here to tell you
there's no reason that you

54
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:29,494
should have to shoulder
the entire burden yourself.

55
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,494
But if you've made up your
mind, then we'll support you.

to listen to Kumoi.

of the Kasumioji Clan.

If there's anything
you can't do alone,

we'll help you-- myself, Kenryu,
Rukia, Orihime, Uryu, and Chad.

61

You won't be alone again.

It's up to you.

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760

decision for yourself.

and towards this ceremony.

ICHIGO: I don't understand.

71

You can't be serious.

myself in time.

-You disappoint me.

I thought you were supposed
to be a lot smarter than what

you've shown me today.

132

I've misjudged you.

-Wait, please.

You have to listen to me.

-How dare you all
treat me this way?

-There-- there's a reason.

-Nice job.

148

Don't let him go, Enryu.

Don't you realize who I am?

-Over there.

00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,827
That Rurichiyo was an impostor.

158
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,494
-What proof do you have?

159
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:34,694
-I just know.

160
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:36,794
You have to trust me, Sui-Feng.

161
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:39,297
-I've had enough
of your nonsense.

162
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:59,756
Obviously, you're not used
to fighting with hakuda.

163
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:06,427
By getting up, I assume
you want to feel more pain.

164
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:12,904
Well, then-- sting all
enemies to death, Suzumebachi.

165
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,260
I wanted to finish this
without releasing my zanpakuto,

166
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:24,494
but-- guess I can't.

167
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:25,260
[speaking japanese]

168
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:09,596
What now?

169
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:12,362
-Ichigo, we should
get out of here.

170
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:13,329
-Damn it.

171
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,129
I guess we have no choice.

172
00:12:15,162 --> 00:12:18,396
-Not that way!

173
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:19,729
It's too dangerous.

174
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:22,229
This way is safer.

175
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:23,162
Hurry up.

176
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:24,962
The soul reaper's
will come soon.

177
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,129
-There's no sign that
Ichigo Kurosaki or Rukia

178
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:38,996
Kuchiki have left.

179
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:42,329
We think they're probably
hiding inside the palace.

180
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,629
-All right, then.

181
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,496
Gather the available men
and reorganize the squad.

182
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:47,362
Go after them.

183
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:48,962
-Right away.

184
00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:52,829
-Captain, what do we
do with these two?

185
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:54,329
-We'll deal with them later.

186
00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:58,129
Right now, concentrate on
finding Kurosaki and Kuchiki.

187
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:01,129
-Captain Sui-Feng,
I am going to ask

188
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:05,029
you to refrain from
pursuing them in the palace.

189
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:07,296
-How else will we find them?

190
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,162
-Leave that part to us.

191
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:12,729
The intruders will be forced to
flee the palace on their own.

192
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:15,329
Then all you have to do
is simply capture them

193
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,029
as they run outside.

194
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:17,829
-It won't work.

195
00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:20,296
-Please, Captain Sui-Feng.

196
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:22,229
Surely you will
honor the request

197
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:24,662
of a high-ranking noble family.

198
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:25,162
-Hmm.

199
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:41,529
-You should be all right here.

200
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:43,462
This place is pretty safe.

201
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:46,029
Everyone has been in a panic
since you crashed the wedding

202
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:48,562
ceremony.

203
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:53,129
-So, you're Shu Kannogi, the
fiance of Lady Rurichiyo.

204
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:54,929
Why are you helping us?

205
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:01,129
-Well, it's-- because I
wanted to help Rurichiyo.

206
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:07,396
Please tell me where the
real Rurichiyo is being held.

207
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:10,096
Did anything bad happen to her?

208
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,262
-I know you have
questions, but calm down.

209
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:14,362
-How could I possibly calm down?

210
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,329
I am Rurichiyo's fiance.

211
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:20,496
I'm supposed to be the
one protecting her.

212
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,696
-I see.

213
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,962
-I heard what you said
after the ceremony.

214
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:28,629
It made me think-- just what
is my purpose for being here?

215
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:35,562
Both our families arbitrarily
agreed on our engagement.

216
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:38,962
But then I saw her.

217
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:41,829
And from the first moment I
caught a glimpse of Rurichiyo,

218
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:45,329
I've been in love with her.

219
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:46,829
-No need to bow.

220
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:48,729
You must be Shu Kannogi.

221
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:55,462
SHU KANNOGI: Even then,
I knew that Rurichiyo

222
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:59,296
was in a difficult position--
having to keep everyone happy

223
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:02,062
while trying to preside
at the same time.

224
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:04,529
Yet even though I was
right by her side,

225
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,862
I knew she always felt alone.

226
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:10,162
And I-- I couldn't help her.

227
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:16,696
-Don't worry.

228
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,229
It's still not too late.

229
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:20,096
We can protect
Rurichiyo together.

230
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,562
But before we do, we
have to get out of here.

231
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:29,096
-Careful.

232
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,829
Sui-Feng and the
others have probably

233
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:33,362
surrounded the palace
looking for us.

234
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:34,396
-You're right.

235
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:35,262
What do we do?

236
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:37,096
-Um--

237
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:38,696
-What is it?

238
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,262
-Just that I kind
of have an idea.

239
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:49,596
-Has there been any
word from Kumoi yet?

240
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:50,829
-No.

241
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:52,096
-Look at this place.

242
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,462
I mean, they may be high
and mighty aristocrats,

243
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,262
but their palace is obscene.

244
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:59,396
What do they need so
much land for, anyway?

245
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:02,129
-Omaeda, mind your
disrespectful tongue.

246
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,196
-OK.

247
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,029
-Now tell me what
happened to the two men

248
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:06,762
you captured earlier.

249
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:08,629
OMAEDA: They're
under strict guard.

250
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:10,429
SUI-FENG: Make sure of it.

251
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:14,296
Ichigo Kurosaki and the
others may come for them.

252
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:15,062
-What?

253
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:16,362
No way.

254
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:18,562
Not a chance with
all this security.

255
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:19,062
-Reporting.

256
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:20,162
-Hmm?

257
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:22,696
-Ichigo Kurosaki
and Rukia Kuchiki

258
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:24,429
have appeared near
the back gate.

259
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:25,296
-What?

260
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,862
Seize them, immediately!

261
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:30,229
-But they're holding Lord
Kannogi as a hostage.

262
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:31,196
SUI-FENG: They're what?

263
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:43,129
Stop right there, Ichigo.

264
00:16:43,162 --> 00:16:45,662
You weren't satisfied with
merely crashing the wedding

265
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:48,696
ceremony, so now you're
taking a hostage, too?

266
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:50,429
-Captain Sui-Feng, this is not--

267
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:52,629
-Rukia.

268
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,462
I'm sorry, Sui-Feng.

269
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:55,829
Please move out of our way.

270
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:00,262
Now.

271
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:09,696
Let's go.

272
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,220
-Right.

273
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:20,911
-And don't try to follow us.

274
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:27,578
-Impossible.

275
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:28,911
Not Rukia and Ichigo.

276
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:32,978
-Excuse me.

277
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,211
Who is Ichigo Kurosaki?

278
00:17:35,244 --> 00:17:36,344
-I forgot.

279
00:17:36,378 --> 00:17:38,811
You've never met him,
have you Captain Amagai?

280
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:41,478
He's a human
substitute soul reaper

281
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:44,911
who we're beholden to for
helping us in the past.

282
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:47,044
-Substitute soul reaper?

283
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:49,544
I didn't realize there
was such a position.

284
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:52,711
-Kurosaki and Kuchiki
took Shu Kannogi,

285
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:54,411
son of the Kannogi clan.

286
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:56,711
Together, they escaped
to the Seireitei grounds,

287
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,878
where we picked up their trail.

288
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,844
They're good, but Squad Two
has been successfully tracking

289
00:18:01,878 --> 00:18:02,911
them.

290
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:05,078
Still, considering
Ichigo Kurosaki's power,

291
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:07,544
I believe we need
reinforcements.

292
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:10,744
-In that case, it makes
sense for me to go.

293
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:13,278
Since you're all obviously
quite close to them,

294
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:15,679
it may prove difficult
for you to bring them in.

295
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,144
-I approve of Captain
Amagai's plan.

296
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:22,078
Deploy your men immediately
to the Sereitei.

297
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:24,611
Squads Two and
Three-- I order you

298
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:28,411
to capture the substitute
soul reaper, Ichigo Kurosaki,

299
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:33,178
and Rukia Kuchiki of Squad 13.

300
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:33,978
-Yes, sir.

301
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:35,311
-Excuse me, Head Captain.

302
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:37,478
There's one more thing.

303
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:38,978
-Yes?

304
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:43,411
-Gyokaku Kumoi, the Kasumioji
Clan's senior retainer.

305
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:45,378
He requested our
help, yet he refused

306
00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:47,578
to allow us onto
the palace grounds.

307
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:50,711
He is a bit cautious when
dealing with soul reapers.

308
00:18:53,344 --> 00:18:55,444
And there's another
unusual circumstance

309
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:56,611
involving Ichigo Kurosaki--

310
00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:59,844
-Very well, I shall keep
all of this in mind.

311
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:00,844
-But, sir--

312
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:01,544
-That is all.

313
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:07,478
-Captain.

314
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:09,211
-Izuru, did you get word?

315
00:19:09,244 --> 00:19:10,178
-Yes, sir.

316
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:12,044
Everything is ready
as you ordered.

317
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:15,111
-Substitute soul
reaper-- it may be

318
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:17,244
an uncomfortable
mission for you.

319
00:19:17,278 --> 00:19:20,478
But it is all for the
Order of the Soul Society.

320
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:22,144
You understand what I'm saying?

321
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:22,911
-Yes, sir.

322
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:23,711
-All right.

323
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:24,578
Get ready to leave.

324
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:26,911
-Uh, one thing, Captain.

325
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:28,111
-Go ahead.

326
00:19:28,144 --> 00:19:32,811
-About the substitute soul
reaper, Ichigo Kurosaki.

327
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:35,544
Did he really break in
on the Kasumioji Clan?

328
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:36,811
-Of course.

329
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,378
Didn't you get the report?

330
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:38,878
-Yes.

331
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:44,211
-Well then, what's the matter?

332
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:45,911
Go ahead, speak your mind.

333
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:52,882
-Well, you see, I'm torn, going
back and forth over what to do.

334
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:56,078
But in this case, I
believe it's my duty

335
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,044
to let you know what
I think, Captain.

336
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:02,044
Recently, I saw third
seat Makoto Kibune

337
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:05,344
entering and leaving
the Kasumioji grounds.

338
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:06,711
-Makoto?

339
00:20:06,744 --> 00:20:07,711
-Yes, sir.

340
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:09,244
I confronted him about it.

341
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:13,144
But strangely enough, he denied
ever visiting such a place.

342
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,278
-What else?

343
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:17,244
-I had hesitated to tell
you any of this earlier,

344
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:19,278
but this isn't the
first time third seat

345
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:22,944
Kibune has acted suspiciously.

346
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:25,311
Once before, he tried to
kill one of his comrades.

347
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:33,578
And he's also been spotted
recording secret information

348
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,611
during a battle.

349
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:37,744
He seems quite sincere
on the outside,

350
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,111
but there's a different
side of him he rarely shows.

351
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:42,878
-I find that hard to
believe about Makoto.

352
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:45,011
I've never heard any
rumors like that before.

353
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,511
-It's true, Captain!

354
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:48,878
And this time there
was a disturbance right

355
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:51,111
after he visited
the Kasumioji Clan.

356
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:55,411
And All the while, he denies any
connection to the clan at all.

357
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:57,511
There must be something--

358
00:20:57,544 --> 00:21:00,078
-It's too soon to
jump to conclusions.

359
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:03,011
Even if Makoto is somehow
connected to the Kasumioji

360
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:05,544
Clan, it would be
unfair to convict him

361
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:07,711
on hearsay and speculation.

362
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:10,178
-Yes, sir.

363
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:13,344
-Then again, with all
that's happened and now this

364
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:15,944
on top of it, he
can't complain if we

365
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:17,911
suspect him of wrongdoing.

366
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,044
-Captain--

367
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,644
-Izuru, did you discuss
this with anyone else?

368
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:24,844
-No, sir, not a single person.

369
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:28,078
-My gut is telling me something.

370
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:30,978
I'm afraid there may be
much more to this incident

371
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:32,411
than we think.

372
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:33,544
-And what would that be?

373
00:21:33,578 --> 00:21:35,911
-I don't know yet.

374
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:40,044
In any case, just keep an
eye on Makoto's actions.

375
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:42,511
If anything happens,
let me know immediately.

376
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:43,544
Understand?

377
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:44,811
-Yes, sir.

378
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:48,244
AMAGAI: First, we
capture Ichigo Kurosaki.

379
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:51,344
Then we'll deal with
everything else.

380
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:54,278
[music playing]

381
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:18,594
[music playing]

382
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:50,127
-Isn't there an easy way to
capture the substitute soul

383
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:51,361
reaper and the others?

384
00:23:51,394 --> 00:23:52,961
-Why not put a
bounty on their heads

385
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:54,894
as well as a reward
for information?

386
00:23:54,927 --> 00:23:55,961
-Good idea.

387
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:57,794
I'll make arrangements
right away.

388
00:23:57,827 --> 00:23:59,661
By the way, what's the
reward going to be?

389
00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:00,727
-Whatever you can afford.

390
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:04,261
-Huh?
