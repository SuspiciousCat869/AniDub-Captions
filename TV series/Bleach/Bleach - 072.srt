00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,007
NURSE: If you feel like cleaning
up, the shower's over here.

3
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,407
Right next to that
is the toilet.

4
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:44,974
And next to that is the sink.

5
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:51,341
And, um, of course, the
refrigerator's right here.

6
00:01:51,374 --> 00:01:53,907
Currently, there are no other
patients on the ninth floor.

7
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:56,441
But the eighth floor nurse's
station is just below you.

8
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:57,941
And we can be here in a snap.

9
00:01:57,974 --> 00:01:59,307
If there's something
you need, you

10
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:01,041
can use this anytime to call me.

11
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:04,341
-Hm.

12
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:09,741
-A refrigerator and everything.

13
00:02:09,774 --> 00:02:12,507
This room is amazing.

14
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,741
Pretty convenient the we're the
only ones on this entire floor.

15
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:17,507
This way, we don't
have to worry about any

16
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:21,874
of the other patients getting
hurt if we get attacked.

17
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:24,374
-One of the perks of
being my father's son.

18
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:25,541
-Hm?

19
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:27,574
-This is my father's hospital.

20
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:32,041
-Ah, you never told us that the
family owned a hospital also.

21
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:35,507
Well, it's a whole lot different
from my father's clinic.

22
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,374
-You should probably get
some rest while it's quiet.

23
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:41,874
You'll need all the energy
you can get if they come back.

24
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:43,741
-OK.

00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:44,674
ICHIGO: Yeah, go on.

26
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:45,474
Go to sleep.

27
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:46,574
We've got it under control.

28
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:48,141
You just cuddle up and snooze.

29
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:49,407
We'll keep watch tonight.

00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,541
URYU: You can't
rush me like that.

31
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:54,241
I can't got to sleep
just because you say so.

32
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,674
ICHIGO: You got to stay focused.

33
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:56,241
URYU: Focused?

34
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:05,674
-Weird, huh?

35
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:08,274
Who would have thought they'd
want to target Quincies?

36
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:11,741
-Hm, why them in particular?

37
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,307
What do they want with
the Quincy's power?

38
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:16,874
-Should we even believe
that crazy story of his?

39
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:19,474
Remember Uryu took a pretty
good shot to the head,

40
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:22,407
so it's possible he just dreamed
this whole thing happened.

41
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:25,541
-And I suppose he dreamt up that
woman who took him away, too.

42
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:26,841
What's wrong with you?

43
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,807
Don't you have any brain at all?

44
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,841
No need to answer.

45
00:03:29,874 --> 00:03:31,407
It's pretty obvious.

00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:33,374
-Why, you little bird brain!

47
00:03:33,407 --> 00:03:34,341
Aah!

are so amazing.

Rukia described it.

Humans simply don't have

They're physically inferior.

116

With their limited
lifespans, they

you think something's wrong

something's wrong with them!
