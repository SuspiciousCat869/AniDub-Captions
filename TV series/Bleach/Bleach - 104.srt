00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:09,207
-Zeige dich, Dalk.

00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:26,241
-Shall I deal with them?

00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:33,741
-What is happening there?

8
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:37,074
Report at once!

9
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:37,641
-Dammit.

10
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:39,574
I told them to wait.

11
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:41,041
We've got to help them.

00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:47,707
-Oh, no.

00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,474
-Are you all right?

15
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:58,474
-What happened here?

16
00:02:58,507 --> 00:03:00,407
-My apologies, captain.

17
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:02,074
I failed.

18
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:03,674
I thought that we
could capture him,

19
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:09,274
but-- but then his
Doll took us out.

20
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:10,441
-It's all right.

21
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:11,341
Don't worry.

22
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:13,274
I'll call for help.

23
00:03:13,307 --> 00:03:16,074
Just rest.

24
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:17,707
The Ryoka's probably close by.

25
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,141
Let's move.

26
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:21,307
Based on his fighting
style, it seems likely

27
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:23,141
that this Bount was
the same one that Izuru

28
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:24,507
fought in the world
of the living.

29
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,241
If so, he's very powerful.

30
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,274
Be careful.

31
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,474

-Renji.

35
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:34,674
-Well, what's going on?

36
00:03:34,707 --> 00:03:37,007
Are we having a party here?

37
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,441
-Renji.

38
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:40,974
How did you find us?

39
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:42,507
-We followed the Bounts'
spiritual pressure.

40
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,974
-The Bounts' spiritual pressure?

41
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:45,907
-Ah, that's right.

42
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,674
That's this little
one's special ability.

43
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:49,907
-Yes.

44
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:53,007
That is my job, and I do it
quite well, if I say so myself.

45
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,474
-What is the meaning of this?

46
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:58,741
-Weren't you told about
Kurodo here, Captain?

47
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:01,241
He's one of the mod-souls
Ichigo and the others

48
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,741
used in the world of the
living to track the Bounts.

49
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:07,474
-Pleased to meet you, Captain.

50
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:09,474
-That's a mod-soul?

51
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:11,307
I have heard of them,
but why would one

52
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:13,641
take a form like that?

53
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:16,174
-Well, that would take a
while to explain, you see.

54
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:18,307
-Have Ichigo and the others
actually found such things

55
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,674
to be useful?

56
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:20,607
-Yes.

57
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:22,574
He isn't quite as
worthless as he looks.

58
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:24,974
-Why, what a thing to say!

59
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:25,974
-All right, then.

60
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,707
Lieutenant, I'll need
to borrow your mod-soul.

61
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:30,174
-Huh?

62
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:33,541
-You're going to
carry Kurodo, Captain?

63
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:37,474
-Don't we look just fabulous?

64
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:41,107
-Well, that might not be
such a bad combination.

65
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:41,741
-No.

66
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:42,741
Not me.

67
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:44,307
-You'll be carrying it.

68
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:45,141
-Aw.

69
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:47,307
That's no fun.

70
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:50,541
-Uh, I'm happy to lend
it to you, Captain,

71
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:53,074
but then what will I do?

72
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:54,474
-I need you to
stay here and take

73
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:56,641
care of my injured men, Renji.

74
00:04:56,674 --> 00:04:59,274
-Again I'm getting
left out of the fight.

75
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:01,607
-You'll get your
chance soon enough.

76
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:02,874
-Well, what do you know?

77
00:05:02,907 --> 00:05:06,207
It looks like I'm back to being
carried by a real lady again.

78
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:08,274
That's a definite improvement
over being bounced around

79
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,341
by some rough riding brute.

80
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:12,007
-Just what are you saying?

81
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,741
-Oh, a little
jealous now, are we?

82
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,741
-Are we on the
Bount's trail now?

83
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:24,741
-Yes.

84
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:26,441
In fact, I'm certain of it.

85
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:28,107
-Then what should we do?

86
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:30,074
-Surround him.

87
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:32,407
We don't know how much they've
learned about the Soul Society

88
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,507
in the time they've
been here, but it's

89
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,007
safe to assume that we still
know it better than they do.

90
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,574
-Understood.

91
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,341
Squad 10, calling all units.

92
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:45,274
Squad 10, calling all units.

93
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:47,607
The targeted Bount has been
tracked to Northern District

94
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:50,174
2, center street number two.

95
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,274
Target is currently on the
move, believed heading south.

96
00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:55,741
Groups one and two are to
reverse direction at once

97
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:57,707
and proceed through
Eastern District 6.

98
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:00,274
Groups three and four are
to reroute and close off

99
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:02,107
all connecting roads.

100
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:04,141
All other teams
converge on the target.

101
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:13,107
-The noose is getting
tighter and tighter.

102
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:14,607
-Well, what do we do?

103
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:20,541
-Oh, my!

104
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:22,041
Something's changed!

105
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:23,641
-What is it?

106
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,974
-Its spiritual
pressure just weakened.

107
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:26,674
-Really?

108
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,207
Then which direction is he in?

109
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:30,407
-It's that way!

110
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:33,141
-Toward Eastern District 7.

111
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:34,541
-Wait.

112
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:36,974
Did the spiritual pressure
disappear completely?

113
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:38,507
-No.

114
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,274
It's still moving, but it
suddenly became weaker.

115
00:06:41,307 --> 00:06:42,141
-Hm.

116
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:43,441
What could he be up to?

117
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:56,474
[sigh]

118
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:59,141
-Why are we walking
down here in this sewer?

119
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:01,241
I'm likely to rust.

120
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:03,607
-If we lay low here,
it'll buy us some time.

121
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:06,274
-Oh, but I'm still
not satisfied.

122
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:07,241
I want to cut loose.

123
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:09,441
To fight, and kill, and maim.

124
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:11,474
-You'll have to wait.

125
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:14,307
Right now we have to
find out where Kariya is.

126
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:17,207
We don't dare leave him
alone for very long.

127
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,407
-My, what an interesting
thing to say.

128
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:20,674
-What do you mean?

129
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,107
-It sounds like you
don't trust Kariya.

130
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:25,207
-Something like that.

131
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:27,007
-Did you quarrel?

132
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,407
-I'm afraid it's a
little more complicated.

133
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:33,274
-What's the conflict, then?

134
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:36,707
-We have different
points of view.

135
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:37,007
Hide.

136
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,174
-Huh?

137
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:41,207
-Keep your eyes open.

138
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,307
-Check over there!

139
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:43,441
-I don't see them.

140
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:44,241
-Hm.

141
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:47,074
Even down here,
we can't get away.

142
00:07:47,107 --> 00:07:48,674
-What are we going to do?

143
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:51,141
Just keep hiding from them?

144
00:07:51,174 --> 00:07:52,207
-No.

145
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:54,341
We have to break
through somehow.

146
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:57,107
The only way is to attack.

147
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,641
-Was I right?

148
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:00,341
-Yes.

149
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:02,307
The Bount seems to be using
the underground passages.

150
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:05,574
-Ah, you truly are a
captain, despite your size.

151
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:09,674
Because you take notice of
things others would overlook.

152
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:12,407
-He'll surface when he
realizes that we're on to him.

153
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:16,507
If I could only track him while
he's still in the underpass.

154
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,541
-All units in the
Western Districts

155
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:20,374
report to the
underpass for backup.

156
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:21,741
-Unit Three responding.

157
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:23,241
-Understood.

158
00:08:23,274 --> 00:08:24,374
-Changing course to
the northwestern roads

159
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:25,574
to provide backup.

160
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:30,574
-Ha ha!

161
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:32,407
-We've encountered
the Ryoka's doll.

162
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:34,207
RANGIKU (OVER RADIO):
What's your location?

163
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,974
-Western District 6,
street number three.

164
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:38,441
The middle of the third
block from the north.

165
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:39,441
-Good.

166
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:41,741
Try and lure the target
out into a wider area,

167
00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:43,107
then wait for backup.

168
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:44,207
-Let's go.

169
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,741
Right.

170
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:48,407
[shouting]

171
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:54,541
-Ah.

172
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:56,341
A little mayhem was
just what I needed.

173
00:08:56,374 --> 00:08:58,474
Although they were
pretty worthless.

174
00:08:58,507 --> 00:08:58,974
-Hm.

175
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,607
-Unit Three,
respond immediately.

176
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:08,007
-The spiritual pressure
has disappeared again.

177
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,474
It looks like yet
another battle has

178
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,341
ended, and with
us as the losers.

179
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:14,741
Enough of your
useless commentary.

180
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:15,307
-Sorry.

181
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:17,407
-Send this to all units.

182
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:20,141
No rash attacks upon
the Ryoka or his Doll.

183
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:24,007
Report in and stand
by for backup.

184
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,541
-This is Unit Six.

185
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:28,074
We've arrived at Southern
District street number four.

186
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:29,707
RANGIKU (OVER RADIO):
Any sign of the Ryoka?

187
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:31,041
-Negative.

188
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:32,174
-There it is again!

189
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:35,107
I'm getting a strong Bount
spiritual pressure signal.

190
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,041
-From where?

191
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:40,274
-Well, it's somewhere around
the area of Southern District,

192
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:42,007
and maybe street number four.

193
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,541
-Are you positive?

194
00:09:43,574 --> 00:09:46,307
But that's the group I was
just communicating with.

195
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:48,374
Unit Six, the
target is confirmed.

196
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:50,007
Right there, in your vicinity.

197
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,141
-Understood.

198
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,074
He's close now, men.

199
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:53,207
Keep your eyes open.

200
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,374
-Yeah.

201
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:56,041
-Unit Six requesting
immediate backup

202
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:58,507
at Southern street number four.

203
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,107
-Have you noticed?

204
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,074
Each team has a butterfly
for communication.

205
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,174
All right, Dalk.

206
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,274
I want you to destroy them all.

207
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:07,974
All at the same time.

208
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:08,574
-Aw.

209
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,307
Poor things.

210
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:12,074
But very well, I'll try.

211
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:23,074
[gasp]

212
00:10:23,107 --> 00:10:23,974
-Captain.

213
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:25,574
The hell butterflies.

214
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:26,574
-What's wrong?

215
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:27,741
MAN (OVER RADIO: Lieutenant!

216
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:31,541
The hell butterflies are-- argh!

217
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:32,407
-Oh, no!

218
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:34,241
It looks like the
Bount has figured

219
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:36,641
out our means of communication,
and has cut it off!

220
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:41,241
-I've lost contact with all
of the patrols, Captain.

221
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,174
-Lieutenant!

222
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:45,507
Come in, Lieutenant!

223
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,707
-Ah.

224
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:47,741
Hello there, boys.

225
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:48,641
Do you want to play?

226
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,674
-Now, Dalk.

227
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:55,441
-Here goes!

228
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:13,095
-Oh!

229
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:15,695
What a disaster!

230
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:16,928
-Hey!

231
00:11:16,962 --> 00:11:18,995
He's alive.

232
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:20,995
-This one's still
breathing, too.

233
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,695
-This one, also.

234
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:25,095
And this one's still alive, too.

235
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:27,162
I imagine we ought to be
glad he let them live,

236
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:28,828
instead of killing them.

237
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:29,895
But I wonder why?

238
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:35,262
-Take care of them.

239
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,828
-But Captain--

240
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,628
-Listen, mod-soul.

241
00:11:38,662 --> 00:11:40,962
Tell me, where is his
spiritual pressure?

242
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:43,762
-It-- it's headed this way!

243
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:44,695
-I thought so.

244
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:46,762
-Captain.

245
00:11:46,795 --> 00:11:49,162
What are you going to do?

246
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:51,628
He knew that we were
operating in group in concert

247
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:53,128
with each other.

248
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:55,895
This has been his
plan all along.

249
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:58,928
To defeat all of the
suborindates one by one,

250
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:01,128
and then wait for the
commander to come out.

251
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:03,795
-Are you planning
to face him alone?

252
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:06,062
-That's right.

253
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:08,328
Take care of the
wounded, Rangiku.

254
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:10,328
-I understand, sir.

255
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,262
Please, be careful.

256
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:13,195
-And good luck.

257
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:31,895
-Are you the captain?

258
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:33,095
-Yes.

259
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,362
You injured my men.

260
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:37,128
-I did hold back, though.

261
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:40,828
I try not to hurt young
people, if it can be avoided.

262
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:43,895
-I suppose I should
thank you for that, then.

263
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:47,595
But it doesn't mean
I'll go easy on you.

264
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:49,662
So get ready.

265
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:51,795
-Very well, then.

266
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:53,995
Zeige deke, Dalk.

267
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:03,328
-Oh, my.

268
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:04,828
Hello there.

269
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:07,295
What a cute little boy.

270
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,328
Are you here to play with me?

271
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:15,862
You simply are impatient.

272
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:22,662
Oh!

273
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:24,195
You've scarred me, you
horrid little brat.

274
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:28,895
[scream]

275
00:13:46,162 --> 00:13:47,295
-Ha.

276
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,695
You're pretty good.

277
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,595
But you shouldn't
have done that.

278
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,862
Like any disobedient
child, you must

279
00:14:01,895 --> 00:14:05,228
be captured and
severely punished!

280
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,128
-Rain over the frosted heavens.

281
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:07,628
Hyorinmaru!

282
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:12,862
-Bring it on!

283
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:17,328
Ha ha Ha ha!

284
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:19,195
Looks like I caught you.

285
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:20,162
Huh?

286
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:20,995
What's this?

287
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,128
It's-- it's cold!

288
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,095
[scream]

289
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:27,062
-No, Dalk!

290
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,095
Dalk.

291
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,762
You must return.

292
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:42,628
It's dangerous to
separate and reassemble

293
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:44,128
when you're still frozen.

294
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:46,028
-Don't worry, I'm all right.

295
00:14:46,062 --> 00:14:47,895
I can still fight.

296
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,895
I'll deal with the cold somehow.

297
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:50,362
-No, Dalk.

298
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:52,195
Stop.

299
00:14:52,228 --> 00:14:52,828
-That's it!

300
00:14:57,728 --> 00:15:00,328
-That ought to teach you
not to ignore me, boy!

301
00:15:00,362 --> 00:15:03,028
Ha ha ha!

302
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:03,828
[scream]

303
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:09,028
-Dalk, pull back.

304
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:10,362
-No, I can't quit now.

305
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:12,728
Don't worry, I can
handle this by myself.

306
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:18,162
Don't you know, Soul Reaper?

307
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:20,362
No hunk of snow and ice can
defeat my burning heart!

308
00:15:20,395 --> 00:15:21,962
-No, Dalk!

309
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:26,095
[laughter]

310
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:28,662
[scream]

311
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:28,962
-Dalk!

312
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:29,662
No!

313
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:46,295
Dalk!

314
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,928
-I'm sorry.

315
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:50,728
I was defeated.

316
00:15:50,762 --> 00:15:51,762
-It's all right.

317
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:55,295
You fought bravely, Dalk.

318
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:57,762
-Thank you.

319
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:00,062
I'm glad you're
with me to the end.

320
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:07,795
-It's different
from the reports.

321
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:09,762
-What is?

322
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:12,128
-Well, I was told that
a Bount disappears

323
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:14,695
as soon as he loses
his Doll in a battle.

324
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:16,295
Not true?

325
00:16:16,328 --> 00:16:17,728
-Hmph.

326
00:16:17,762 --> 00:16:19,628
-What?

327
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:24,128
-Each member of our tribe
has had his own role to play.

328
00:16:24,162 --> 00:16:27,762
Mine was to train the young, to
grow into full fledged Bounts

329
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:29,795
as soon as possible.

330
00:16:29,828 --> 00:16:31,762
There were those who grew
up well, and those who,

331
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:33,928
for whatever reason, didn't.

332
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:37,162
Something from long
ago just came to me.

333
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:39,328
-What is all of this about?

334
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:40,928
And why the hell
are you rambling

335
00:16:40,962 --> 00:16:42,928
instead of answering
my question?

336
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:44,062
-Yes.

337
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:46,662
I heard you.

338
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:51,162
The reason I haven't
collapsed yet is simply this.

339
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:53,828
I'm still here because
Dalk isn't dead.

340
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:54,128
-What?

341
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:15,662
What's that?

342
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:17,362
-This is Dalk.

343
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:20,062
This is her core.

344
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:25,628
Her essence lives on
within this blade of steel.

345
00:17:25,662 --> 00:17:27,728
As a captain of the 13
Court Guards Squads,

346
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:29,762
you are everything I expected.

347
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:34,128
In order to get past you, I will
have to use my full strength.

348
00:17:34,162 --> 00:17:35,962
I have something I
must do, and nothing

349
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:38,095
will stop me from pursuing it.

350
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:40,228
If you persist on
standing in my way,

351
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:43,162
I will have no choice
but to eliminate you.

352
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,195
-I'm not about to let you go.

353
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:47,295
-Quite a bit of
Dalk's power remains

354
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:49,862
concentrated in this axe blade.

355
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:52,028
I'm going to add my
spiritual pressure to it.

356
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:54,328
Then I'm going to
strike you down.

357
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:55,862
Let's go, my Dalk.

358
00:18:08,828 --> 00:18:09,928

-This spiritual pressure.

361
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:22,195
I guess this is where the
battle begins for real.

362
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:25,295
In that case, I'd better
start getting serious as well.

367

Do you still plan to fight?

-I have no choice but to
keep going after Kariya.

00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:45,595
all the reishi you've absorbed.

375
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:49,362
-Then I'll have to finish this
now before it breaks down.

376
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:52,195
Let's do it, Dalk.

-So this is the end.

380
00:21:24,795 --> 00:21:25,762
I guess I'm the loser.

381
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:34,762
-What were you planning to
do when you found Kariya?

382
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:38,628
-There wouldn't have been
anything I could have done.

383
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:44,162
But in any case, that dispute's
between no one but me and him.

going to go once all of this

00:21:46,662 --> 00:21:48,762
was over?

-To a future where
there would be no wars.
