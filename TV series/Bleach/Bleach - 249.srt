1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,733
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:21,500
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,266
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:29,300
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,266
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:33,839
You can't move yet!

7
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:37,139
Wait--- you're--

8
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:38,739
I'm almost done.

9
00:02:39,673 --> 00:02:42,439
This power.
Who are you?!

10
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:45,506
Are you one of the
Substitute Soul Reaper's
friends?

11
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:46,706
Huh?

12
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,473
Why would you help me?

13
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:53,573
Because you were injured
and if I see someone that's
hurt, I help them.

14
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:55,639
And besides...

15
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:58,239
You looked like you were
in so much pain...

16
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:06,539
Foolish Girl!

17
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:15,273
This Spiritual Pressure
of his! It's just as dark
as an Arrancar's!

18
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,839
Uryu! Chad!

19
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:33,006
Come on! Make your next
move already!

20
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:35,173
Oh, Kenny.

21
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:38,473
Do it!

22
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:51,606
Kenny, no!

23
00:03:57,873 --> 00:03:59,973
Don't you worry, Yachiru.

24
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:04,273
Ya know, this guy's
better than I thought.

25
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:07,673
This battle's getting
tough.

26
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:12,839
Just my kind of fight!!
[laughing]

27
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:33,373
That was a damn good
attack. But you're gonna
have to do better to beat me!

28
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,873
And I ain't done yet!

29
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:54,806
You're going down!
Growl!

30
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:58,873
Shunko!

31
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:04,873
Where is she?!

32
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:06,973
Behind you!

33
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,073
Damn you!

34
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:12,739
You leave yourself
wide open!

35
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:18,639
Obviously you pay too much
attention to boys and clothes
and you don't spend enough
time training.

36
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,839
Why don't you shut
up, old lady?!

37
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:27,506
What a waste. And here
I was giving you a piece
of advice from one cat to
another.

38
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,673
You're not getting away!

39
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,973
You should quit
while you're ahead.

40
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:42,239
They call me the Flash
Master for a reason.

41
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:44,806
You girls couldn't
catch me in a hundred
years!

42
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:50,073
No matter how fast you
you might be, we cannot
afford to lose this fight.

43
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,873
Hmph. Apparently, the both
of you are too naive to realize
that Muramasa has tricked you.

44
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:59,273
Just what are you talking
about?

45
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:07,873
<i>That's right. Your</i>
<i>friends Katenkyokotsu and</i>
<i>Sogyonokotowari? They were</i>
<i>already destroyed by Muramasa.</i>

46
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,639
Liar! We aren't gonna
fall for that!

47
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:16,639
Very well, then. I guess
I have no choice but to
do this the hard way.

48
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,773
We should probably focus
our energy on regaining
control of Ryujinjakka.

49
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:33,339
<i>Good idea.</i>

50
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:37,273
But with this ring of
fire, capturing him isn't
going to be an easy task.

51
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,639
Excuse me,
master Hitsugaya.

52
00:06:40,673 --> 00:06:46,339
We are facing the most
powerful fire-type
Zanpakuto. A very
worthy opponent.

53
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,073
Will it be okay for
me to lend you my power?

54
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,473
What is wrong?

55
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:58,773
There's no need to be so
formal with me now,
Hyorinmaru.

56
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:02,839
What I'm saying is you
can put your mind at ease.

57
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,606
There are four captains with
you, after all. This fight
will be a routine exercise.

58
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,639
Captain Hitsugaya makes a
pretty good point.

59
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:15,606
We haven't got time to
waste, let's wrap this up.

60
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,073
Afterward, we can catch
up with Ichigo.

61
00:07:18,673 --> 00:07:20,039
Well count me in.

62
00:07:22,906 --> 00:07:24,173
Let's move out!

63
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:37,606
Uh! Chad!
Uryu!

64
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:40,106
Orihime, are
you all right?

65
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,406
Oh, um... yes,
I'm fine.

66
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:49,506
That Spiritual Pressure.
But he doesn't look like a
Soul Reaper or an Arrancar.

67
00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:51,473
So who is he?

68
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,339
Don't move!

69
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:58,939
And who might you be?
Friends of the Soul
Reaper's?

70
00:07:59,573 --> 00:08:02,339
I'm not a Soul Reaper.
I'm a Quincy.

71
00:08:02,906 --> 00:08:05,439
A Quincy? What's that?

72
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:12,873
Head's up, Chad!

73
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:25,906
Chad?!

74
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,173
This is the worst
kind of timing.

75
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:35,506
You insects have wasted
enough of my time! I really
must be going.

76
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:48,473
Uryu!

77
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,739
Damn it.

78
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:59,173
Why must they interfere
when I'm so close?

79
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,273
Chad, you attack him from
the other side!

80
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:03,473
Got it!

81
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:11,573
Where are
you going?

82
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:22,173
What?!

83
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:26,473
That was... Byakuya
Kuchiki's Senbonzakura!

84
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:29,839
Nice try.

85
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,606
Senbonzakura...

86
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,839
Muramasa, please leave
them to me.

87
00:09:37,873 --> 00:09:40,573
He's one of the
Zanpakuto rebelling?

88
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:42,873
Scatter!

89
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:46,006
Uryu!

90
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:56,873
You should probably spend
less time worrying about
your friend.

91
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,006
I'm home?

92
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,139
Abuelo!

93
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:46,439
Hmph. You certainly aren't
a Soul Reaper, are you?

94
00:10:47,073 --> 00:10:48,606
Far too easy.

95
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:57,973
Oh, you can still move?
Just die already!

96
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:12,973
Chad! Chad!
Are you okay?!

97
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,739
Your help is useless,
woman. Your companion has
fought his final battle.

98
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,806
How could you?!

99
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:22,073
Huh?

100
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:26,539
Uryu!

101
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:42,606
Hey, Quincy.
I'm over here.

102
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,673
Bankai!

103
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:05,573
Uryu!

104
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,506
Santenkesshun!

105
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,673
What?!

106
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:23,973
Why are you doing this?

107
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:32,073
I can tell that you're
burdened with a deep
sadness.

108
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:35,306
I saw it the moment I
looked into your eyes.

109
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:38,306
So, why would you do this?

110
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:40,606
Orihime.

111
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:45,239
Who are you, really?
What is your purpose
here?!

112
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:51,106
Don't pretend to
understand me, woman!

113
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,806
What makes you think you
could know anything about me?!

114
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,673
My name is Muramasa!
And my sheer power will
alter this world!

115
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:14,206
<i>Hado number thirty-three!</i>

116
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:16,206
Sokatsui!

117
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:37,659
Rukia!

118
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,792
Are you guys
doing all right?

119
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:41,392
We're fine...

120
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:42,892
<i>But Chad is hurt!</i>

121
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:44,459
What happened?

122
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,526
Rukia Kuchiki. How
did you find us?

123
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,892
I followed my brother's
Spiritual Pressure.

124
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:55,626
You followed his Spiritual
Pressure? Is he here too?

125
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,459
I'll explain it later.

126
00:13:57,492 --> 00:13:59,192
We need to be careful.

127
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:03,959
He's the one who manifested
the Zanpakuto and left the
Seireitei in chaos.

128
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:07,026
What?!

129
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,826
So then why is he in
the World of the Living?

130
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:11,859
And where's Ichigo!?

131
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:17,126
The Substitute Soul Reaper?
He should be burning to death
in Ryujinjakka's flames.

132
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:22,559
Ryujinjakka? Are you saying
you gained control of the
Head Captain's Zanpakuto?

133
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:23,292
That is correct.

134
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:24,759
Impossible!

135
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:27,726
Ichigo will come back, I
just know that he will!

136
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,992
Oh will he?

137
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,359
Muramasa??

138
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:34,159
I'm all right, but I
don't have much time
left.

139
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,526
What's he doing?

140
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:43,326
A Hollow?

141
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,192
That Spiritual
Pressure. I knew it!

142
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:59,626
Why are Hollows here?
You told us that you
were a Zanpakuto!

143
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:02,692
Care to explain exactly
what's going on here?!

144
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:05,892
I didn't lie. I am a
genuine Zanpakuto.

145
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:09,592
A Zanpakuto with the
power to change the
entire world.

146
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:12,526
And the only thing I am
trying to do right now is

147
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,392
release myself from this
long, lonesome and cursed
battle.

148
00:15:17,326 --> 00:15:18,526
Take care of this.

149
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:20,492
Not so fast!

150
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,959
You're not getting
past me!

151
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:33,192
Rukia!

152
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:36,226
Orihime! Take Chad and
hide somewhere safe!

153
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:37,259
Right!

154
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:40,392
Hado number thirty
three! Sokatsui!

155
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:58,926
Almost there... very
soon now.

156
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:01,826
Koga.

157
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,492
I finally made it all
this way.

158
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:23,659
Now gather around the
supreme one, purified by
the darkest soul,

159
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,559
and give a blood
sacrifice upon
the alter!

160
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:30,959
Rukia! We'll
be okay here.

161
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:32,459
Are you sure?

162
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:36,426
Muramasa's being consumed by
that sadness that I sensed
inside of him earlier.

163
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:38,192
We have to stop him.

164
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:40,992
They're here!

165
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:46,559
Rukia!!

166
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:47,792
Watch out!

167
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:56,459
Chad!

168
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:58,226
Chad. are
you all right?!

169
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,592
I'll be okay.

170
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,992
Rukia. Go.

171
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:11,626
I understand.

172
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,559
Rukia. You must hurry!

173
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,292
Come on!

174
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:28,426
Now what?

175
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:33,592
I bestow upon you a
cherished offering from
the dark heavens. Take
this holy grail, oh

176
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:40,559
vengeful spirit, break
free from your slumber,
and rise up with the six
keys passed through the ages.

177
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,059
Damn it! I've got to do
something, and fast.

178
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,626
Which makes this the
worst time to be
distracted!!

179
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:51,992
Impossible.

180
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:59,059
Forgotten coffin. I
command you to open!

181
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,626
The tree was just---
a barrier?!

182
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,926
Well, well. I never knew
that Quincies use swords.

183
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:29,826
But you can't win with a
weapon you aren't skilled
with!

184
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:34,792
Farewell, Quincy!

185
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:39,626
How?!

186
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:41,926
Seeleschneider
isn't a sword.

187
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:45,226
It's a tool that weakens
the bonds between Reishi.

188
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,692
Making it easier
for me to steal.

189
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,659
I don't believe it!

190
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:21,226
Master! I have
arrived at last!

191
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,259
Hado number thirty-three!

192
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,426
Sokatsui!

193
00:19:31,392 --> 00:19:32,826
Do not interfere!

194
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:33,959
Rukia!

195
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:36,626
Don't even try it!

196
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:51,959
What's inside
of that thing?!

197
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:53,926
What are you going
to do with it?!

198
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:58,592
My master is entombed
inside that coffin. The most
powerful Soul Reaper ever.

199
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:04,259
Who even tried to seize
control of the Soul Society!
Koga lies within!

200
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,359
What?!

201
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:08,626
My only wish is to revive
Master Koga.

202
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:11,426
Everything I've done is
for this moment.

203
00:21:04,326 --> 00:21:06,192
Greetings, Master.

204
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:07,692
<i>Hold it!</i>

205
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,659
Ichigo!

206
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:17,159
Ichigo!

207
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,826
Careful Ichigo!

208
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:25,192
You again?

209
00:21:25,226 --> 00:21:27,526
Rukia. Sorry
I'm late.

210
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:30,059
It's about time.

211
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:33,559
How could you have made it
past Ryujinjakka's blockade?

212
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:38,826
Who knows? But now that
I'm here, I'm gonna put
a stop to whatever it is
that you're doing!

213
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:43,792
Are you? Well that's too
bad. Because you're too late.

214
00:21:56,059 --> 00:22:01,392
You see? The wish
I've had for an
eternity has been
granted.

215
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:06,826
Damn it.

216
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,330
Are you guys all right?

217
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:49,963
<i>Huh?</i>

218
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:51,097
<i>Who are you?</i>

219
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,651
Huh?

220
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:52,430
<i>Huh?</i>

221
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:53,597
<i>Yes, who are you?</i>

222
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,697
Guys, it's me!

223
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,563
<i>A friend who goes off to</i>
<i>the Soul Society without</i>
<i>telling us is no friend</i>
<i>of ours.</i>

224
00:23:59,597 --> 00:24:00,663
[stuttering]

225
00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:02,730
Huh? Oh, sorry about
that!
