1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,333
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,066
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,733
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:26,733
The Zanpakuto is born with
its Soul Reaper, and dies
with its Soul Reaper...

5
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:29,766
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:32,512 --> 00:02:33,512
<i>Captain!</i>

7
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:37,179
Ohh, what took you so
long, Nanao?

8
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:41,312
What do you mean what
took so long? Did you need
me here to help you enjoy
your down-time?

9
00:02:41,346 --> 00:02:44,212
I'm just drinking as I
view the plum blossoms.

10
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:49,779
I'd view the cherry
blossoms, but it's a
little early for them
to bloom.

11
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:52,346
I think these petals
have clouded your brain.

12
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,812
You'll have time to relax
after the Sword Beasts have
been dealt with.

13
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:57,612
Come on, we have to go.

14
00:02:57,646 --> 00:03:01,912
<i>Nah, I think I'll pass on</i>
<i>this one. Why don't you</i>
<i>go in my place, Nanao?</i>

15
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:03,546
That's completely
ridiculous.

16
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,646
I know! You can take my
two Zanpakuto with you!

17
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,579
How very generous of you.

18
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:13,112
Why should I get up and
leave a drinking party to
go do back-breaking work?
That's silly.

19
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:18,546
If you wanna send someone,
send this one. She seems to
have nothing better to do.

20
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,579
Good plan, come
to think of it.

21
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:25,012
It's set, then. Nanao,
how 'bout you two run off
and take care of the problem?

22
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:27,246
Huh? Uh...

23
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:47,946
Ugh, I can't believe
he forced me to babysit
her.

24
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,212
Anyway, so...
how are you?

25
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:55,312
Katenkyokotsu? Wait a
minute, that's not right,
since there are two of them.

26
00:03:55,346 --> 00:03:58,012
Do you have a name you
prefer to be addressed
by?

27
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:02,846
Uh!

28
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,679
Are you listening to me?

29
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:08,779
What are you doing?!

30
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:18,279
Nanao...

31
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:19,146
[grunting]

32
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:21,179
[gasping]
Are you feeling
all right?

33
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:24,346
Oh, Rangiku. Sorry
about that.

34
00:04:24,912 --> 00:04:28,446
Heyyy! Who's this cute
girl you're walking with?

35
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:30,879
Is she Captain Kyoraku's
love child?

36
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:33,646
She happens to be one of
the Captain's Zanpakuto!

37
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:37,446
I know that! I don't
live in a cave, you know!

38
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,579
So, is he making you
babysit her?

39
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,712
No, but unfortunately
it does feel that way.

40
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:47,779
He got lazy and asked the
two of us to go out and hunt
down the Sword Beasts in his
place.

41
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:48,779
What?

42
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:53,979
Hold it! Just where do
you think you're going?!

43
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,779
What's this strange
Spiritual Pressure?

44
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,912
You sure she'll be all
right on her own?

45
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:10,046
Yeah. She's very
competent.

46
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,846
And why shouldn't she
be? I mean, after all,
the two of you are both
part of my Zanpakuto.

47
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,412
That's not who I meant.

48
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:17,279
Hm?

49
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:19,679
I'm talking about
Lieutenant Ise.

50
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:26,346
She'll be fine. Nothing
to worry about.

51
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:28,546
Well, I hope you're
right.

52
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:32,346
It's around here,
I'm sure.

53
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,179
[screaming]

54
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:39,046
Mmm!

55
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:41,846
[trembling]

56
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,646
[screaming]

57
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,846
Damn it!

58
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:53,946
All right, girl... What
are you waiting for?
Aren't you going to
finish me off?

59
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,412
She's not taking this
seriously. She's just
toying with him.

60
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:04,312
This girl... She has no
emotions. It's like a
game to her.

61
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:06,879
[screaming]

62
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:12,412
[struggling]

63
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,246
<i>Bakudo Number Four,</i>
<i>Hainawa!</i>

64
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:23,246
Listen to me! Slaying
Sword Beasts isn't a
game!

65
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,379
If you won't administer
the finishing blow, then
I'll be forced to end
this for you!

66
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:33,412
Huh?
[sighing]

67
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:38,446
Stop it! Hado Number
Four! Byakurai!

68
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:41,012
Uh!

69
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:53,646
A falling out!
How convenient!

70
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,379
Wait a minute!

71
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:55,379
Heh!

72
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:58,679
Uh!

73
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:05,412
[gasping]

74
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:11,079
Hmm.. So that's what
happened, eh?

75
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:13,312
I'm very sorry, sir.

76
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:17,012
Well.. We can't do
anything about it
if it got away.

77
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:20,246
But if that Sword Beast
was wounded in the way
you describe,

78
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,646
then we can assume it
wasn't able to get
very far.

79
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,779
I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about.

80
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,379
I hope so.

81
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,112
Nanao...

82
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:31,879
After all this time,
I think I know you
pretty well...

83
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:34,679
... There's something
important that you're
keeping from me, isn't
there?

84
00:07:34,712 --> 00:07:36,212
Huh?

85
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:40,412
I assume it's more than
just the Sword Beast. You're
bothered by my Zanpakuto.

86
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,546
Oh...

87
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,546
Well, it's all right...

88
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:46,679
Proceed on your own, if
that's what you prefer.

89
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:49,646
You decide and then
do whatever is most
comfortable for you.

90
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:54,412
You might find that working
together with other people on
a team just doesn't suit you.

91
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:55,479
Really?

92
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:56,879
Mmm-hmm.

93
00:07:56,912 --> 00:07:59,146
Just do
what's easiest.

94
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,979
We can work together
just fine.

95
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:02,479
<i>Huh?</i>

96
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:06,046
I was given an order. And
I intend to complete the
mission with my partner.

97
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,246
Wait. Don't feel
compelled in any way---

98
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,712
Excuse me.

99
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:12,312
[sighing]

100
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:15,746
She's so stubborn.
Good grief.

101
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,012
<i>You're confusing</i>
<i>stubbornness with pride.</i>

102
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:23,812
The Lieutenant is
confused about the
dynamic here. You realize
that, right?

103
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:26,212
Hmmm...

104
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:32,012
Unlike your lieutenant
who's all business, my
counterpart approaches
battle as a type of game.

105
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:36,446
Catch a dragonfly and
she'll pluck off its
wings. Catch a butterfly
and she'll drown it in

106
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,912
water. Catch a cicada and
she'll rip off its legs.

107
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:45,812
She can be very
innocent and ingenuous,
but merciless and cruel
at the same time.

108
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:49,312
I like to enjoy the finer
things in life, but she's
different.

109
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:52,479
In fact, she tends to be
rather dark and malicious.

110
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:57,179
After seeing what she's
capable of right before
your eyes, it would be
hard to accept her.

111
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,646
And for Lieutenant Ise,
who's so straight-laced,
it's especially true.

112
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,246
After all, the Zanpakuto
in question belongs to
her captain.

113
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,146
You can't really blame
her for being confused.

114
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,546
Heh.

115
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:22,779
But still, when all is
said and done, they are
both very, very dear to me.

116
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:33,179
Hi!

117
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:34,312
[gasping]

118
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:36,346
Hey, it's
just me!

119
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,179
Wow, this girl goes into
no-questions-asked

120
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,312
fighting-mode the minute
she feels someone approaching
her!

121
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:45,746
I have to admit, what
happened earlier was
partially my fault.

122
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,479
But having said that, let
me add, there are some
issues with the way
you fight, as well.

123
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:54,746
Even so, I'd still like
to work together with you
to slay the Sword Beasts.
Huh?!

124
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:56,846
[gasping]

125
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,646
[growling]

126
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,312
[sighing]

127
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:13,546
Why did I have to go and
insist that I was capable
of working with the
captain's Zanpakuto?

128
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:16,412
Yoo-hoo!

129
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:18,279
[screaming]

130
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:20,746
What the hell?! Don't go
scaring me like that!

131
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:23,646
Hold on there, Rangiku,
you're the one who scared me!

132
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,312
Sorry, so, what's
the problem?

133
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:28,646
Looks like you have a lot
on your mind. Is it a
man?

134
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,779
Of course not!

135
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:35,579
So. Are you still having
trouble with Captain
Kyoraku's Zanpakuto?

136
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:40,146
Yeah. I'm not sure I can
find a way to get along
with her.

137
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:42,779
I get it! It's just like a
bride and her mother-in-law!

138
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:44,146
Far from it.

139
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:46,946
All right, then. Is it
more like a daughter and
her stepmother?

140
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,146
Not even close.

141
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,346
Good heavens! A current
and ex-girlfriend?

142
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:52,746
You're getting
much colder.

143
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:55,579
Sounds bad---Why don't
you excuse yourself from
the mission?

144
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:59,312
I have my pride! I
refuse to be defeated
by a Zanpakuto!

145
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:07,312
Well fine, then...! You
back away and let me take
care of this!

146
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:12,612
It turns out I'm pretty
good at getting difficult
younger kids to open up
and work well with others.

147
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:13,746
Right...

148
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,079
Katenkyokotsu!

149
00:11:23,512 --> 00:11:25,446
What are you
up to, there?

150
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:32,912
Well, well, she's
not very friendly,
is she?

151
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:35,012
That's what I've been
telling you all along.

152
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:39,846
Being that she's Captain
Kyoraku's Zanpakuto, I
thought she'd be a lot
more outgoing.

153
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,712
After all, her master is
a charming individual.

154
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:45,379
[sneezing and sniffling]

155
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:51,812
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

156
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:54,746
We wanted to invite you
to come have some fun
with us girls!

157
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,246
What do you mean 'us'?

158
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,479
You're coming, too.

159
00:11:57,512 --> 00:11:59,879
Count me out,
it's your idea.

160
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:05,379
So cute!

161
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:07,946
You look adorable!
Don't you agree, Nanao?!

162
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:09,979
Hang on, Rangiku. I
don't think it worked.

163
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:10,879
Huh?

164
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:15,679
That's odd. Most of the
girls I take shopping are

165
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:18,712
thrilled to dress up
and walk around in
high-end fashion.

166
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:23,212
I think you're projecting
your own personal fantasies
onto this girl, Rangiku.

167
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:25,912
We are at your
service, ma'am.

168
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:30,146
This is sure to work!

169
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:32,512
I've found that young
girls like her are shy,

170
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:36,746
But if they're given the
opportunity, they respond
quite well to the opposite
sex.

171
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,446
That goes for both Soul
Reapers and Zanpakuto.

172
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,846
That's an interesting
theory.

173
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,046
Huh?

174
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,746
Maybe she can date them,
once they get out of the
hospital.

175
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:49,346
<i>You've got to agree, this</i>
<i>is my best idea yet!</i>

176
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:53,146
Have you ever met a
woman who didn't have
a sweet tooth?!

177
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,512
Delicious!

178
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:58,612
[groaning]

179
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:02,146
I admit defeat. She
doesn't respond to
anything.

180
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,546
I think you should just
give up, Nanao---

181
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,112
[sighing]

182
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:20,879
Huh?

183
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,546
Wait a minute...
could it be?

184
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:37,979
I wonder... is it possible
she has the same connection
with those blossoms?

185
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,946
She is the Zanpakuto of
Captain Kyoraku, so
maybe...

186
00:13:54,662 --> 00:13:55,862
A party?

187
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:57,695
You say you wanna
throw a party,

188
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:01,695
but why have a party
under a cherry tree that
hasn't even blossomed yet?

189
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:05,362
It seems to me, you don't
know how to really appreciate
the beauty of things.

190
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:06,762
Forgive me.

191
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:09,762
In the grand scheme of
things, those certainly
seem like minor details.

192
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:13,229
If Nanao says she wants
to throw a party, that's
good enough for me.

193
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:17,395
Hey. Just being able to
toss a few down with
Nanao will be very
satisfying.

194
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,729
You know you're
a drunk, right?

195
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:20,195
What? I didn't
catch that.

196
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:21,929
It was nothing
important.
<i>Oh.</i>

197
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:25,229
But as long as we're on
the subject, try not to
drink too much at the
party, all right?

198
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:26,262
<i>Okay.</i>

199
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:33,262
Why are you so concerned
about that girl? The only
thing you have to worry
about is destroying those

200
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:37,862
Sword Beasts. If she
participates, great. If
not, what do you care?

201
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:42,195
I know what you're
saying, and I mean, at
first, I thought she
was nothing

202
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:45,729
but a creepy girl.
But then, gradually...

203
00:14:45,762 --> 00:14:48,629
... I began to feel
sorry for her.

204
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:50,129
Why is that?

205
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:52,462
Well, she's a Zanpakuto.

206
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:58,195
She was born only to
fight, so she's never
gotten to experience
any real emotions.

207
00:14:58,229 --> 00:15:00,762
It just feels
awfully sad.

208
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:02,595
Huh...

209
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:05,595
I don't quite get your
concern, really...

210
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:08,429
But.. If you think you
can help, go for it!

211
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:09,929
You there, young lady...

212
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:11,462
The name's Nanao!

213
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,729
Would you mind pouring a
little for me?

214
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:16,329
Huh? You've had a
little too much already.

215
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:18,662
Hey, would you pour
some for me, too?

216
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:22,629
You're always so generous.
I can count on your drinks
to do the trick.

217
00:15:22,662 --> 00:15:25,795
You don't have to worry
about the portions.
You're already drunk.

218
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:28,195
So, you're too
young to drink, right?

219
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,195
What--? Come back!

220
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:36,095
What happened?
Please, don't go!

221
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:39,462
Huh?

222
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:47,562
[gasping]

223
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:49,495
I didn't mean
to startle you!

224
00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:51,762
[chuckling awkwardly]

225
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:55,129
[sighing]
Huh?

226
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:10,829
Oh, You enjoy like
flowers?

227
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:17,262
Let's add an
accessory.

228
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,195
There, all
finished. Nice.

229
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:25,562
You look cute.

230
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:31,829
So... You like it?
[gasping]

231
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,062
Why did you come all
the way out here?

232
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:54,062
Could it be... because
you want to see more
flowers?

233
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:58,095
[sighing]
Mm!

234
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:01,429
Okay, I want you
to come with me!

235
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:03,795
I'll show you where there
are lots of flowers!

236
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:15,129
See? Around the time
the plum blossoms fall,
the peach blossoms begin
to come out.

237
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:18,195
What are you doing?!

238
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:23,429
Why don't you leave the
sword? It's fine, you won't
need to use it here.

239
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:32,229
I knew it. If I treat her
decently, she's rather
cooperative.

240
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:37,029
You want those
flowers, don't you?

241
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:38,729
Let me pick one for you.

242
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,795
Hm.
[gasping]

243
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:49,295
Uh!

244
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:58,629
Hmm.

<i>[chuckling]</i>

247
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:10,462
How nice to see you
again.

248
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,162
It's you!

249
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:16,829
I want to show my
appreciation. Since you
saved me from that brat!

250
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:21,295
So, to pay you back, I
thought we'd have some
fun before I kill you.

251
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:27,629
Oh, no. I had her
give up her weapon!

252
00:18:29,362 --> 00:18:31,229
I don't think that's
a good idea!

253
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:36,362
Ohhh...

254
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:40,329
Is this what you were
looking for? Your
little toy?

255
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:43,529
Instead, how 'bout we
see what you can do
without your weapon?

256
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:48,629
I'll give it back to you
when I finish cutting you
up! [laughing]

I won't finish you off
just yet. I had to survive
your torture last time,

00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:16,662
now it's my turn to
put you through the
same pain!

it just as enjoyable.

That was the most force I
could come up with, in my
weakened condition.

269
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:33,529
Still sticking your nose
in. Since you were kind
enough to save me the
last time around,

270
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:36,462
I was going to return
the favor and let you
live.

271
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:40,262
But since you're being so
rude, I guess I'll have to
change my plans!

Why...?!

Well, that's easy. Because

Did you get that girl to
change at all?

296
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,295
Not really. But I realize
now that..

297
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:08,829
...it was more important
that she be true to herself.

298
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:13,129
Ohh... Well, at least you
attempted to make sense of
her.

00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:53,129
It's very nice.

303
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:55,162
Thank you.

304
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:01,662
Hm.

305
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,995
Hm. Huh?

306
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:07,262
[chuckling]

307
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:50,750
Come on, Nanao. Tell
the truth. Didn't you
think I was even cooler
than usual, today?

308
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:51,483
<i>Huh?</i>

309
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:52,950
Aren't you in love with
me yet?

310
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:53,816
<i>Uh...</i>

311
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,416
If you hesitate, I might
get swooped up.

312
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,916
<i>You're so annoying when</i>
<i>you say things like that.</i>

313
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,783
Ohhh.
