1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,833
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:21,600
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,100
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,300
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,366
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:37,206
How about Ichigo? Can
we save him?!

7
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,306
I don't know. The fact
is, we can't take the
chance of getting near
that thing,

8
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:44,373
so we're stuck leaving
it up to Ichigo to save
himself.

9
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:45,773
That's awful!

10
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:48,739
Ichigo!

11
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:50,473
Ichigo.

12
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:52,173
Please be okay.

13
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:29,139
Where am I?

14
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,806
Ichigo Kurosaki...

15
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,639
I'm surprised
to see you.

16
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:38,639
How did you get here?!

17
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:42,073
I don't know. Where
the hell are we?

18
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:43,806
Can't you tell?

19
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:48,539
Just as your precious
Zanpakuto has a home in
the world that is your
mind,

20
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:51,906
I also had a place
to call my own.

21
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:54,339
Then... this is...

22
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:56,806
But Koga's dead!

23
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:59,639
<i>I don't understand</i>
<i>it myself.</i>

24
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:04,039
How did I end
up in this place?

25
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:12,039
Did my reunion with Koga
somehow summon me here?
Or is this whole thing a
figment of imagination?

26
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:16,473
In either case, this
place will soon fall
apart.

27
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:22,406
But no matter what, I am
eternally grateful to the
destiny that connects you
and I.

28
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:26,673
For that destiny will
allow me to finish our
battle!

29
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:33,406
But why?!

30
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,039
There's no longer any
reason for us to keep
fighting each other!

31
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:43,039
Don't you see? The
power you possess will
nourish me, Ichigo.

32
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:49,373
And until I obtain that
power, I will never stop
fighting you. Understand?

33
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:01,539
Not gonna happen!

34
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,673
Nice try.

35
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:19,139
Not gonna let
you use that!

36
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:22,373
Not this time!

37
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:24,806
What?!

38
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,939
It's useless.

39
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:38,973
Flailing your sword around
like an idiot won't be
enough to protect you
from my onslaught.

40
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,439
No... damn it...
can't move.

41
00:05:53,473 --> 00:05:55,406
Goodbye, Ichigo.

42
00:05:57,206 --> 00:06:02,573
[laughing]

43
00:06:02,606 --> 00:06:03,473
Huh?

44
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:09,273
What?! I can move!

45
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,973
Getsugatensho!

46
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:37,606
I figured it out! Your
technique isn't invisible.

47
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,706
You make your enemies
think there's some kind
of invisible force at work.

48
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:45,273
But I saw the image of
your attack reflected
in the water.

49
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,839
And...

50
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:56,139
That was the answer. It
turns out the real power's
contained in the reflected
image.

51
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:58,206
Which means--

52
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:10,206
If it can't reflect on
the water, then you can't
use your technique!

53
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:17,906
You're mine now!

54
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:41,039
Indeed, I cannot utilize
my technique to its fullest
extent right now...

55
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:45,639
But you should know
that's not the only
ability I possess.

56
00:07:56,606 --> 00:08:01,006
I had you placed under my
spell the moment we faced
each other in battle.

57
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,539
How do I...
beat him?

58
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,573
Ichigo.

59
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:32,706
Feel it.

60
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:34,206
Zangetsu!

61
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:39,839
His power of suggestion
does not work on me. I
will become your eyes.

62
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:44,339
But, it is impossible for
this to work unless you
and I...

63
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:48,873
Zanpakuto and master...
are truly connected to
one another.

64
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:52,606
Okay, Zangetsu.

65
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,839
You're going to try
again?

66
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:05,139
Get ready.

67
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:26,039
How did he see me!?

68
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:39,639
Getsuga...

69
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,573
... tensho!

70
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:07,506
I see. So you have your
Zangetsu by your side
once again.

71
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:27,839
Now I understand what he
was trying to say.

72
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:29,806
What?!

73
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,739
Recognizing and accepting
each other's existence...

74
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:39,006
That's the foundation of
the relationship between
a Zanpakuto and a Soul
Reaper.

75
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,173
But I bet you already
knew that.

76
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:46,673
What do you know about
anything!?

77
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,739
Why won't you just
accept it!?

78
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:16,173
Ichigo. We must
leave this place.

79
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:19,506
There is a maelstrom of
deep-seated anger here.

80
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:24,539
Driven by the Hollows
that Muramasa consumed
for all those years.

81
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,073
And at any moment, they
will rise up and destroy
him.

82
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:43,239
We don't have much
time, Ichigo!

83
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:44,673
I know.

84
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:37,209
His voice never
reached me.

85
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:20,576
<i>Muramasa!</i>

86
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:28,442
Ichigo, get out of here!
If you stay, you will be
trapped forever.

87
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,476
Muramasa! Why can't
you just let this go?

88
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:53,109
It's none of
your business!

89
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:59,176
Come on, he told you that
he didn't need you anymore.
So just give up, already!

90
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:04,409
Koga's abilities were
so immense that he could
rule over the entire Soul
Society.

91
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:07,976
I was always
so proud of that.

92
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:10,476
He possessed amazing
power!!

93
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:14,976
That's why I
will never stop!

94
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,476
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

95
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:24,476
What about your whole
mission to free the
Zanpakuto from captivity?!

96
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:27,742
You'll believe almost
anything, won't you?

97
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:30,942
That was all just a phony
ploy to trick you idiots!

98
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:35,509
Is that the truth!?

99
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:43,242
You even told us you
killed your master!

100
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:48,642
But when it comes right
down to it, your master
never saw you as anything
but his weapon!

101
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:52,242
You knew that. But you
still struggled to exist,

102
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:54,976
all for the sake of
freeing Koga from
his seal!

103
00:14:55,742 --> 00:15:00,242
Face it. You did all that
because you wanted Koga to
appreciate you just once!

104
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:09,876
It was a lofty goal.

105
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,776
It wouldn't have
lasted long.

106
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:19,542
Hey!

107
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,776
Ichigo. Time
is running out.

108
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:35,042
If he becomes a Hollow,
the pockets of Reishi in
the World of the Living
would become dangerously

109
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:39,376
unbalanced. And Karakura
Town could be destroyed.

110
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,409
Don't worry, he won't
become a Hollow.

111
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:50,342
Muramasa!

112
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:55,042
My Zanpakuto and I...
we're gonna be together
to the end!

113
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:02,309
And not only me. All my
friends, and even the
captains.

114
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:08,209
To Soul Reaper and
Zanpakuto alike, they're
each special and irreplaceable
to one another!

115
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,642
You knew that better than
anyone else.

116
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:14,776
So how could you betray
the honor you once fought
for?!

117
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:17,776
You have no right to
stand there and judge me!

118
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,242
I knew what I was doing
all along!

119
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:25,142
Taking what you want
when you want it isn't the
way to treat a Zanpakuto.

120
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:30,076
The Zanpakuto should have
free will, just like the
Soul Reaper!!

121
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:37,809
Well, it appears my
time has finally come.

122
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:38,942
Ichigo...

123
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:41,209
I know. Let's
end this!

124
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:56,809
Hyorinmaru!

125
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,209
Captain!

126
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:04,109
That was the last of
them!

127
00:17:04,142 --> 00:17:05,076
Yes.

128
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,476
What's going on?

129
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:38,542
What now?!

130
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:54,742
Muramasa... Muramasa!
Muramasa!!!

131
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:04,476
How ironic. After all
this, it's your voice
that reaches me.

132
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:19,342
What happened?

133
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:23,542
I don't know why, but
the Hollows' Spiritual
Pressure is all gone.

134
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:26,609
Then Karakura Town is
safe now?

135
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:35,242
Ichigo...

136
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:36,442
What?

137
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:39,442
That's definitely his
Spiritual Pressure!

138
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:51,609
This feeling... is this
what you've been trying to
explain to me all along?

139
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:53,442
Yeah.

140
00:18:55,276 --> 00:19:00,676
I see. I wound up making
quite a mess of Koga,
didn't I?

141
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,876
Everyone makes mistakes.

142
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,542
That means that someday
you'll fix it.

143
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:23,942
I hope... someday.

144
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:52,076
Ichigo.

145
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:56,642
Is everyone all right?

146
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:58,476
Yes, we're safe.

147
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:01,276
Is Muramasa really gone
for good?

148
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:03,742
Yeah.

149
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:08,442
And he kept his pride as
a Zanpakuto until the
very end.

150
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:13,642
Byakuya?

151
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:16,876
You okay?

152
00:20:23,076 --> 00:20:24,342
Rain?

153
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:39,609
What is this?

154
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:49,676
I dunno. It
feels strange.

155
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,609
Let's go home.

156
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:11,809
Good to have you.

157
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:17,142
Welcome home.

158
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:17,909
Let's go.

159
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,342
Wha?

160
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:23,009
What? Hold on!

161
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:33,609
They're gone.

162
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:36,442
Yes. Well, it's
about time.

163
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:50,242
Ichigo Kurosaki.

164
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:53,042
This is the second time I
am thanking you.

165
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:55,276
I appreciate your help.

166
00:22:00,842 --> 00:22:02,176
Sure.

167
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:51,001
Uh-oh, I better get back
to Las Noches fast!

168
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:52,901
Huh? Sure is quiet around
here.

169
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:54,634
What's going on?

170
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:56,201
<i>Ichigo Kurosaki.</i>

171
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,634
<i>Looks like no one updated</i>
<i>you on what happens next.</i>

172
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:01,001
Ulquiorra?!

173
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:02,768
Oh no, not this again!
