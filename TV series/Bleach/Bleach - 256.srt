1
00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:12,368
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:20,035
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:21,835
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:27,802
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul Reaper.

5
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:30,735
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:30,146
[chatting]

7
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,146
Hey look! It's the
Captain! He's here!

8
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:40,213
How come you're not going
over to say hi to him?

9
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:42,113
I'm fine right here.

10
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:46,180
I've dealt with him
plenty---It's time for
everybody else to have
a chance.

11
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:51,680
Maybe so, but the fact
is, they look all tense
and uneasy around him.

12
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,613
It's understandable.
He's not usually this
open.

13
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:59,913
I never thought he'd let us
use his house for a Garden
Party.

14
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,980
Well... The battles with
the Zanpakuto left
everyone completely
exhausted.

15
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:08,780
It's my brother's way of
trying to help the squads
to relax. You should be
grateful he cares!

16
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,413
Calm down, there... Hm?

17
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:16,313
Come to think of it,
wasn't this place blown
to bits during all the
fighting?

18
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:22,713
By your Zanpakuto, if I
recall! I mean, Squad Six
hasn't even begun making
repairs to their barracks!

19
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:24,980
The Kuchiki Clan has
money and connections--

20
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:28,046
Lieutenant, will you join
us? It's getting awkward
over here!

21
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,280
Come on, you guys! He's
just a person, like
anybody else.

22
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,446
Well that was annoying.
Renji wasn't even listening
to me. Unbelievable.

23
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,680
<i>[screaming]</i>

24
00:03:58,313 --> 00:03:59,646
Hey, that's enough!

25
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,613
Who are you and what do
you want?! Explain
yourselves!

26
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:09,346
I'm unarmed.

27
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:24,513
Great.

28
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:29,080
<i>Dance...!</i>

29
00:04:29,546 --> 00:04:32,413
Tsuginomai... Hakuren!

30
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:45,446
You're not getting away.

31
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,246
Be careful...
Sodenoshirayuki!

32
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,113
I told you before, you're
not getting away! Somenomai!

33
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,713
Are you all right,
Sodenoshirayuki?

34
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,546
Completely unharmed, Sir
Senbonzakura. And you,
are you all right, Lady
Rukia?

35
00:05:27,713 --> 00:05:31,513
I don't understand. I
thought you both returned
to being swords!

36
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:33,246
What are you talking
about?

37
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,313
Huh?!

38
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:38,680
As far as I can recall,
neither of us ever made
such a promise to you.

39
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,513
I suppose that's true,
but...

40
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:43,146
You shouldn't blame us
for your own false
assumptions.

41
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,113
Wait a minute!

42
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:46,180
<i>What is this</i>
<i>commotion about?</i>

43
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:54,613
Explain.

44
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:11,113
I must say... this
is most unusual.

45
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:13,913
I wasn't expecting a
visit from any of you.

46
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:18,680
Um, well. As you can see,
our Zanpakuto are still
manifested...

47
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:21,346
... And we were hoping that
you could tell us why!

48
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:26,913
Well of course they are!

49
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:31,280
After all the trouble, I
was able to reverse their
brainwashing,

50
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:35,113
but I never said I was
returning them to their
normal state.

51
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:37,646
Here. Take a look for
yourself.

52
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:50,480
See? That's your
explanation.

53
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:56,813
Now please stop bothering
me with all your simple
questions---I barely have
time to get things done

54
00:06:56,846 --> 00:07:00,280
as it is. Nemu.. It's
time to get back to work.

55
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:02,113
Yes. As you
wish, master.

56
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:04,180
Wait a minute, Captain
Kurotsuchi---

57
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:07,580
What is it now? I told
you I was busy, didn't I?

58
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:10,880
Yes, I'm sure you are,
but can you help us with
one more thing?

59
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:13,213
One more and that's it.

60
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:15,613
This Zanpakuto has me
concerned.

61
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,380
Ah... fascinating.

62
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:26,580
This is an instance of a
Zanpakuto going out of
control, after Muramasa
manifested it.

63
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,713
So then you were
aware of this?

64
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:34,713
Absolutely. It isn't
hard to understand. You know
that Muramasa's abilities
affected not only captains,

65
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:40,380
but also regular squad
members, right? And in
those cases, once their
Zanpakuto were released,

66
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:44,246
some of them found that they
had suddenly lost control
over these weapons.

67
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,480
And as a result,
they died.

68
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:51,746
This Zanpakuto is one of
the many that lost control
after the unfortunate loss
of its master.

69
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,146
I was unaware of this.

70
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,780
Usually, when a
Zanpakuto's owner dies,
the Zanpakuto disappears
as well.

71
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:01,880
We can only assume
something abnormal
happened here.

72
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:07,380
At that point, truthfully,
the weapons are no longer
Zanpakutos, Soul Reapers
or even Hollows.

73
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:12,180
The most accurate
description is that
they're mutants. That
gives me an idea!

74
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:16,813
I should have thought of
this before. I shall call
them 'Sword Beasts'.

75
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:21,080
More importantly, why did
that sword suddenly lose
its manifested appearance?

76
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:25,780
We don't know yet.
But we do know it no
longer possesses
Spiritual Pressure.

77
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:30,413
Now from what I've been
told, one of them
escaped, right? If
you're somehow able to

78
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:34,880
recapture it, I can run
experiments and possibly
find an answer to your
question.

79
00:08:38,846 --> 00:08:41,646
Oh. There's one more
thing you should know...

80
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:48,380
The power of a Sword
Beast is equal to that of a
Zanpakuto's true power. In
other words, its Bankai.

81
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:54,580
Even if they belonged to
lower-ranking Soul Reapers,
their power is probably far
greater than you think.

82
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:58,980
Knowing that might help
you stay alive, if you're
going to confront one
directly.

83
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,780
Zanpakuto that have lost
their owners and are now
out of control...

84
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:11,346
This sounds particularly
dangerous, doesn't it,
Byakuya?

85
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:17,380
Those fiends caused a
great deal of damage
to the Kuchiki Manor!

86
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:19,946
Their actions are
unforgivable!

87
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,746
I absolutely agree!

88
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,613
Oh, give me a break, you
two were the ones who
destroyed most of the
mansion!

89
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,746
The bottom line is this:
How do we now capture the
Zanpakuto who escaped?

90
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,846
<i>Oh, there you are!</i>

91
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,680
I've been looking for
you!

92
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:40,413
Captain! You We need to
assign the next Seireitei
guard duties.

93
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,680
Yes, of course.

94
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,646
Rukia... For now, I'm
going to leave you in
charge of handling this
case.

95
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,513
Right!

96
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:52,346
I'm going to leave
Senbonzakura with you.
He is at your disposal.

97
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,613
Are you sure about that?

98
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:55,813
Absolutely.

99
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,913
I know exactly how we can
proceed. We will lure the
fiend out of hiding by
destroying one of the

100
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:09,446
barracks and getting the
attention of the entire
Seireitei.

101
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,113
We're trying to rebuild
around here! Causing
more destruction won't
help!

102
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:18,580
All right, then. I have a
better idea. How about we
freeze the entire town with
the fiend inside it?

103
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:21,180
The buildings will
easily thaw out.

104
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,580
Completely out of the
question!

105
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:27,480
These drastic solutions
are the best you can come
up with?!

106
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,580
Think of the trouble
you'll cause if we do
what you suggest!

107
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,346
You're saying it's a
problem?

108
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,280
All I'm hearing is, 'We
can't do this, we can't
do that'. It's not very
helpful.

109
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:38,913
What in the world
can we do?

110
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:40,913
Suggest something less
destructive!

111
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:45,146
I know just the thing,
but you have to promise
to keep an open mind.

112
00:10:52,446 --> 00:10:55,646
Everyone.. Thank you
all for your hard work!

113
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,113
Raise your glass!

114
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,280
All right!

115
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,913
Ahhh...

116
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:09,146
Impressive--You really
know how to make the
booze disappear.

117
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,446
We've had a bit of
practice!

118
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,046
But wow, I never thought
they day would come when
we'd actually be ordered
to throw a party!

119
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,980
Gosh, I'm so happy!

120
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:21,346
Me too! This is amazing,
it's awesome, really!

121
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,480
Hm?! Wait just a minute,
I never summoned you, why
are you here anyway?

122
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,546
Just what made you think
I was gonna miss this
party?

123
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,413
Come on, girl. It
really doesn't matter
what form she's in, does
it?

124
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:35,746
Now, who is ready for the
next round?

125
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:42,346
What is the meaning
of this... Rukia?

126
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,680
Um, this thing? Well,
you see...

127
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:48,046
It's... it's
a party, sir.

128
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,280
Thanks, I figured that
out. I received an
order yesterday to let
you use this area...

129
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:59,513
But... Nobody mentioned
that you were going to throw
a big party. Is this necessary?

130
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:03,680
The party is meant to
lure the out-of-control
Zanpakuto that escaped,
sir.

131
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:06,013
We... believe
it likes parties.

132
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:07,780
What?

133
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:11,313
The last time anyone saw
the fiend, it crashed a
garden party held by
the Kuchiki Clan.

134
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:13,113
So we're throwing
another.

135
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:15,246
That is your
justification?

136
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:20,813
Well, it seemed appropriate
at the time... sir.

137
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:23,646
<i>I hope you're prepared</i>
<i>to clean up this mess.</i>

138
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:40,432
Well, I don't see the
fiend showing up.

139
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:41,532
That's very odd.

140
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:44,365
'Very odd?'---Really?
You think this is odd?!

141
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:47,598
Under the circumstances,
I wonder if we didn't
party hard enough.

142
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:52,532
We partied more than
enough, believe me! I
hope this whole fiasco
wasn't just an excuse for

143
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:53,998
you to have some fun.

144
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:57,732
Now that you mention fun,
have either of you seen
Senbonzakura anywhere?

145
00:12:57,765 --> 00:13:00,832
I believe you'll find him
on his back, out in the
courtyard.

146
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:05,298
[mumbling]
You'd better be careful,
your mask is coming off.

147
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:08,365
What?! You mean he's
been drinking, as well?!

148
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:11,732
Rukia. Are you ready to
wrap this party up?

149
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:15,998
Captain Hitsugaya.. I'm
terribly sorry for any
trouble we caused.

150
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:20,098
Don't worry about it.
Ever since the Muramasa
incident, my squad's been
under a lot of

151
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,965
pressure. They did need
some time to unwind.

152
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,332
This will certainly give
them a breather.

153
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:31,398
Oh, there you are,
Captain! How 'bout a
little drinky-poo..!

154
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:33,898
No chance! And you've had
enough for one night!

155
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:38,432
Whhhaaaatt? What's a little
winky drinky between friends?

156
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:41,532
Rukia. You'll need to
take care of this mess.

157
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:43,265
Yes, understood, sir.

158
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:49,332
Wait for me, Captain! I'm
reporting for duty!

159
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,698
I'm very sorry about
this..

160
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:58,732
It sounded like a good
plan, but it didn't work
out quite the way I
thought it would.

161
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:05,498
Don't blame yourself. The
only thing that matters is
you did the best you could
under the circumstances.

162
00:14:05,532 --> 00:14:08,598
We were just unlucky this
time around.

163
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:11,865
Thank you, m'lady.

164
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:29,898
You know, I must say, it's
nice to be able to talk to
you like this every once
in a while.

165
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:33,332
Uh, something wrong?

166
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:38,098
Truth is, we Zanpakuto
are truly nothing but
weapons meant for
fighting...

167
00:14:38,132 --> 00:14:41,332
Maybe beneath it all, we
actually do lack heart.

168
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:43,765
Sodenoshirayuki...?

169
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:48,332
Don't you see? I always
prided myself on the
extent of my power.

170
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:53,065
The fact is, that's why
I was so anxious to act
on my own just one time!

171
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:56,698
That's how Muramasa was
able to worm his way into
my heart.

172
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:17,332
I was blinded by my ego.
I started thinking I
could do anything and
everything myself.

173
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:22,298
But the results of this
incident have made me sit
up and realize how
mistaken I was.

174
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:28,965
I really am only a weapon
with nothing to offer
except my power. Without
your heart to guide me,

175
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:33,065
I'm just a
simple tool of
destruction.

176
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,132
You're wrong about all of
that! Absolutely wrong!

177
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:40,932
You and I have always
been partners, right from
the beginning!

178
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:08,198
You watched over me
through difficult and
painful periods of my
life, through triumph and

179
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:13,698
tragedy. I couldn't
begin to count the number
of times your presence
has saved me.

180
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,465
In the end...

181
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:19,265
...I was able to stay
strong because of you.

182
00:16:19,932 --> 00:16:22,532
Don't ever believe you're
just a tool.

183
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:32,198
Lady Rukia...

184
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,898
Do you sense that?!

185
00:16:43,498 --> 00:16:44,232
Let's go!

186
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:45,198
Right!

187
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:49,698
[screaming and yelling]
Run, run!

188
00:16:55,465 --> 00:16:56,632
We have to capture him!

189
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:57,432
Yes!

190
00:16:58,098 --> 00:17:00,165
You! Stop
right there!

191
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:21,165
Lady Rukia!

192
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:37,598
Stay away from here.

193
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:10,832
<i>If I don't distance</i>
<i>myself, he's going to</i>
<i>destroy me!</i>

194
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:13,365
Hado Number Thirty-Three!

195
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:17,665
Sokatsui!

196
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:22,665
Lady Rukia!

197
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:34,732
Do it now, I'll
cover you!

198
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:35,932
Right!

199
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:41,265
Sokatsui!

200
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,098
Somenomai!

201
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:51,198
Tsukishiro!

202
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:11,665
Well, done, M'lady.

203
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,298
M'lady, you're injured!

204
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,665
Looks like we have
him cornered.

205
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:56,032
As you wish,
M'lady.

206
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:04,732
Let's go.

207
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:06,298
Right.

208
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:24,865
Tsuginomai... Hakuren.

209
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:59,698
I see... And what did
you do with the Zanpakuto
you captured?

210
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:03,398
I sent it to the
Department of Research
and Development.

211
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:08,298
[laughing]

212
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:10,965
Well, that was probably
the right thing to do.

213
00:21:10,998 --> 00:21:15,065
Captain Ukitake.. I
wanted to ask about that
Sword Beast...

214
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:18,998
Yes. That probably
won't be the last time
we'll see one.

215
00:21:19,465 --> 00:21:23,932
I've received several
reports of such incidents.
They're spreading.

216
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:25,698
I thought so.

217
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:29,165
And the Zanpakuto have
begun to manifest again.

218
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:33,532
I guess that means
we still haven't found an
effective solution to the
problem.

219
00:21:33,932 --> 00:21:40,298
It couldn't happen at a
worse time. We're forced to
rebuild the Seireitei as fast
as possible, and frankly...

220
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,465
...We may not pull it
off.

221
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:46,565
[giggling and yelling]

222
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:49,465
But it out, kids. We can't
hear ourselves over your
racket!

223
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:50,598
<i>Okay!</i>

224
00:21:53,998 --> 00:21:55,765
It will be all
right.

225
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:59,998
No matter what challenges
are facing us, we'll all do
what we can to help.

226
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:03,132
Yes, you're right. And
I'll be counting on you.

227
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:05,698
...Just as I have been,
all these years.

228
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:06,865
Right.

229
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,493
Why are the cherry
blossoms in full bloom at
this time of the year?

230
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:51,993
<i>Perhaps they're not</i>
<i>exactly what they seem.</i>

231
00:23:52,027 --> 00:23:54,493
It sounds like you know
something about this.

232
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:56,827
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>we had help from Sir</i>
<i>Senbonzakura...</i>

233
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,260
<i>Does that answer</i>
<i>your question?</i>

234
00:23:58,293 --> 00:23:59,927
No wonder there are so
many injured people
around here!
