00:01:57,855 --> 00:02:00,255
CHILD: He's scary.

4
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:03,188
What is he doing in our village?

5
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:06,155
[whispering]

6
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:13,422
-Did you do it again, Ikkaku?

7
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:16,422
You'll soon run out of
people who will fight you.

8
00:02:16,455 --> 00:02:18,622
-Then I'll have to leave
and go to another area.

9
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:21,955
-Hm.

10
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:23,855
Why don't you wipe your face?

11
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:25,088
You don't look very good.

12
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:28,755
IKKAKU: Impatience.

13
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:29,888
Irritability.

14
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:32,022
A short temper.

15
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:35,988
At the time, that defined
me, and all I was.

16
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:44,222
I didn't belong in
the Soul Society.

17
00:02:44,255 --> 00:02:45,622
I didn't belong anywhere.

18
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:48,888
Yah!

19
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:53,722
-We didn't mean it, I swear!

20
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:59,155
IKKAKU: Fighting
and pain, those were

21
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:01,355
the only things that
felt real to me.

22
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:14,822
Who wants to fight?

23
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:18,488
I need a good challenge!

24
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:22,955
There must at least one or
two of you who want to die?

25

-Hm?

28
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:29,388
Who's that?

29
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:39,122
What the--

30
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:41,188
-If you were smart, you'd leave.

31
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:44,755
Kenny's in a good mood today.

32
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:48,322
Unless you enjoy a lot
of pain, you should go.

33
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:49,155
-Yeah, right.

34
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,288
Your friend is in a good mood.

35
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:53,722
And that's reason to worry?

36
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:56,622
-You sure are stupid.

37
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:59,622
He loses all control when
he's feeling really good.

38
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:02,855
That's when he
ends up having fun.

39
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:04,455
-What's that?

40
00:04:04,488 --> 00:04:05,455
-Hey.

41
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:07,222
Don't even think about it.

42
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:19,488
Are you gonna run?

43
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:25,022
-No.

44
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:26,522
I'd prefer to stay.

45
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:30,755
My spirits are high, too.

46
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:32,255
So let's have a little fun!

47
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:49,522
[whispering]

48
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,522
-Ikkaku.

49
00:04:51,555 --> 00:04:53,588
-I don't want you to help.

50
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:56,122
-I know that.

51
00:04:56,155 --> 00:04:57,422
-You're strong.

52
00:04:57,455 --> 00:05:00,322
Or so it would seem.

53
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:01,588
-Yeah.

54
00:05:01,622 --> 00:05:03,822
-I am strong, as well.

55
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:04,422
-That's it.

56
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:05,355
No more talking.

57
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:10,355
Now fight.

58
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:29,455
-Who is this guy?

59
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:32,255
He's not only strong,
he's incredibly fast.

60
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,455
Now this is fun.

61
00:05:57,488 --> 00:06:01,188
In fact, this is the most fun
I've had since I came here!

62
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:04,788
-Ah.

63
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:05,488
Good for you.

64
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:19,955
-Who is this guy?

65
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:22,955
The strikes are so
fast, I can't see it.

66
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:23,522
YACHIRU: Look.

67
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:24,522
Kenny's smiling.

68
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:26,455
[giggle]

69
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:33,988
-It's a shame, really.

70
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:35,422
It's almost over.

71
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:52,288
-I really enjoyed that.

72
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:54,755
It's been awhile since
I've had so much fun.

73
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:00,788
-Yah!

74
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:07,288
Where are you going?

75
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:10,588
Finish me off!

76
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:12,122
-What do you know?

77
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:13,922
You're still alive.

78
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:16,188
What are you thinking?

79
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:18,688
You're obligated to kill me.

80
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:19,755
You won.

81
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:21,155
Do it!

82
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:22,522
-Sorry.

83
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,922
But I'm not here to put you down
like you were a sick animal.

84
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:29,755
I've got no obligation to
end all of your suffering.

85
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:30,722
-Hm?

86
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:32,122
-I'm a warrior.

87
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:33,722
I have my pride.

88
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:36,555
Kill me!

89
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:37,522
-Shut up.

90
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:38,888
If you like fighting
so much, then

91
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:41,822
stop moaning and whining
for me to kill you.

92
00:07:41,855 --> 00:07:44,788
Don't accept a loss
and wish for death.

93
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:47,655
Never admit defeat
until you're dead.

94
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:49,922
If you lose and
manage to live, then

95
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:52,122
consider it your lucky day.

96
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,888
When that happens, only
think about surviving.

97
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:57,922
After all, there's a
goal in your future.

98
00:07:57,955 --> 00:07:59,255
-What's that?

99
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,722
-Live, and dedicate
yourself to killing

100
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:03,088
the one who left you alive.

101
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:12,888
You know, I didn't hold back
while I was fighting with you.

102
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:17,388
You had plenty of luck, and
that's why you're alive.

103
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:19,622
Live.

104
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:22,288
And try and kill me another day.

105
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:23,455
See ya around.

106
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:33,388
-Wait!

107
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:34,955
Tell me your name!

108
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:36,955
Don't go.

109
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:39,255
Not until you tell
me what your name is!

110
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,055
-Kenpachi.

111
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:46,422
Kenpachi from Zaraki.

112
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:54,522
-Kenpachi from Zaraki?

113
00:08:57,088 --> 00:09:02,488
When my wounds finally healed,
I searched for him everywhere.

114
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:06,288
I had only one thing on my mind.

115
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:08,488
To fight him once more.

116
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:12,288
YUMICHIKA: Hello.

117
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:13,755
It's been a while.

118
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:14,488
How are you doing?

119
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:20,322
-Yumichika.

120
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,122
Yeah.

121
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:21,622
Fine.

122
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,888
Well, you brought
some news, or what?

123
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:30,888
-I've heard something
that's very interesting.

124
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,022
IKKAKU: The 13
Court Guard Squads?

125
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:39,188
-Hear and obey.

126
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:42,655
As a member of the 13
Court Guard Squads,

127
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:44,322
be aware of your duties.

128
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,622
YUMICHIKA: I heard Kenpachi
defeated the former captain

129
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:50,822
in a single blow and immediately
became the new captain.

130
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:53,788
Being a captain is probably
the best way for him

131
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:56,822
to fight as much as he wants.

132
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:57,988
-Hm.

133
00:09:58,022 --> 00:10:01,088
So he plants to protect
this disgusting world?

134
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:01,588
Kenpachi.

135
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:05,822
It can't be.

136
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,988
That's not his style.

137
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:13,955
-You want to go take a look?

138
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,622
-Nothing can stop me.

139
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:16,822
I'll track him down.

140
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:18,922
I'd go to the gates
of Hell to find him.

141
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,488
-I knew you'd say that.

142
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:34,688
-Oh.

143
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:36,622
They're all we have to
work with this time.

144
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:37,455
-Huh?

145
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:38,255
Oh.

146
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:40,188
What is a child doing here?

147
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,255
Now go on.

148
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:42,755
Get away.

149
00:10:42,788 --> 00:10:43,255
Huh?

150
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:49,822
I'm Lieutenant
Yachiru Kusajishi.

151
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:52,422
-Huh?

152
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:55,388
-Kenny!

153
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:55,855
-Hm.

154
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:04,222
-I'm the captain of Squad
11, Kenpachi Zaraki.

155
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:05,455
Listen carefully.

156
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:08,022
I don't care where you're
from, how old you are,

157
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:11,588
or about your personal life.

158
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:14,088
I'm not going to condemn
any of your viewpoints,

159
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:15,755
nor will I sanction them.

160
00:11:15,788 --> 00:11:16,755
-Huh?

161
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:17,522
MAN: Wait.

162
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:20,055
-There's something I want!

163
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,955
What I want is very simple.

164
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:23,322
Your strength.

165
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:25,222
Strength and will.

166
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:27,488
If you're strong and
know how to fight,

167
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:30,122
then you and I will
get along very well.

168
00:11:33,822 --> 00:11:35,055
IKKAKU: Sounds good to me.

169
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:44,022
Here I am, as you suggested.

00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:45,022
-Huh?

-Look!

174
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:05,655
It's a team of caterpillars!

175
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:06,622
-Lieutenant!

176
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:09,155
It's already slaughtered
15 Soul Reapers.

177
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:12,355
You mustn't underestimate it.

178
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:13,788
-But--

[roar]

180
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:18,555
-All right, then.

181
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:19,322
I'll go.

182
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:21,088
KENPACHI: Hold on.

183
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:22,155
-Captain.

184
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:24,688
-Get the men who fought
first to pull out.

185
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:26,755
They're only in the way.

186
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:27,255
-Yay!

187
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,755
Kenny!

188
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:29,755
Come on!

189
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:30,755
Give them a beating!

190
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:43,188
-5.

191
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,188

-He won!

194
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,155
Victory!

195
00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:57,655
Kenny!

196
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:02,155
-Hm.

197
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,622
[roar]

198
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:17,588
-This is bad.

199
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:28,788
-This is gonna be great.

200
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:30,355
There's more of them to kill.

201
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:31,322
IKKAKU: Hold on.

202
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:32,255
-Hm?

203
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:34,555
-That's very unfair, Captain.

204
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:36,322
-You're having all
the fun, while we

205
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,822
have to watch from
the sidelines.

206
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:40,388
-What do you think you're doing?

207
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:42,422
I told you to stay back.

208
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,355
-Contest time!

209
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:47,855
Hey, Kenny, we're
gonna have a contest!

210
00:13:47,888 --> 00:13:51,222
It's a contest to see who can
slice off the most caterpillar

211
00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:52,655
tails!

212
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:53,155
Contest!

213
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:54,122
Yay!

214
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:55,055
A contest!

215
00:13:55,088 --> 00:13:55,555
A contest!

216
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:01,422
-Let's do this.

217
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:03,155
I'll join ya.

218
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:04,422
Careful.

219
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:06,822
Get in the way, and
you'll be sliced.

220
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,722
Everyone got that straight?

221
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:09,855
-All right!

222
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,516
-Oh.

223
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,616
Good morning, Third
Seat Madarame.

224
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:33,683
-Yeah, yeah.

225
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:34,183
Huh?

226
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:38,716
And you are?

227
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:41,383
-Renji Abari, sir!

228
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,349
-Oh, yeah.

229
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,549
From Captain Aizen's
squad, right?

230
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,249
I heard about you.

231
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:48,549
As soon as you joined,
you got into a huge fight

232
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,849
and were thrown in
the punishment cell.

233
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:51,849
So what do you want?

234
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:53,383
-A request, sir.

235
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,516
Please, will you
teach me how to fight?

236
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:57,149
-Huh?

237
00:14:57,183 --> 00:14:58,349
-Would you please, sir?

238
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:02,783
-Hi-yah!

239
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,383
-Seven.

240
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:14,883
Eight.

241
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:26,149
That was 10.

242
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:27,649
You would have been
dead every time.

243
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:32,116
-Once more.

244
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:32,616
Can we?

245
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:48,783
-So tell me, why do you want
to become strong so badly?

246
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:53,516
Answer me.

247
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:58,649
-I need to surpass someone.

248
00:15:58,683 --> 00:15:59,183
-Hm?

249
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:32,816
This lesson is over.

250
00:16:32,849 --> 00:16:35,049
-Huh?

251
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,649
-You've learned enough.

252
00:16:36,683 --> 00:16:38,116
That's it.

253
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:40,049
-But I'm sure there's more.

254
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,483
-Figure out the rest yourself.

255
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:45,016
Unless you want
people to say you're

256
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:47,116
a copy of me for the
rest of your life.

257
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:55,983
-I've been waiting
to see your Bankai.

258
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,849
-Bankai?

259
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,083
RENJI: You can do it, right?

260
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:01,583
Why don't you use it?

261
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:03,083
Tell me.

262
00:17:03,116 --> 00:17:04,283
Are you hiding it?

263
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,883
-I have my reasons.

264
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:07,916
-What?

265
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:09,249
What do you mean, reasons?

266
00:17:15,683 --> 00:17:18,483
-I'm also chasing someone.

267
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:18,983
Desperately.

268
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,616
Now it's time for me to
tell you what my name is.

269
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:27,749
Ikkaku Madarame.

270
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:28,883
Remember that.

271
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:35,883
The next time we fight,
it'll be to the death.

272
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:40,349
Make no mistake, it will
be your final battle.

273
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:43,316
When you tell your name to
the one you plan to defeat,

274
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:46,349
that's when you show them
the greatest respect.

275
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:49,983
Someone who assumes he's
going to die in battle

276
00:17:50,016 --> 00:17:52,283
should always know
before he dies

277
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:54,283
the name of who defeated him.

278
00:17:59,783 --> 00:18:01,149
-Thank you very much!

279
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:14,349
MAN: Captain Aizen
joined the Hollows?

280
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:17,316
Is that true?

281
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:19,716
-You saw those Menos
Grande too, right?

282
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:20,916
-Yeah.

283
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:22,816
But there hasn't been any
formal explanation yet.

284
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,116
IKKAKU: The answer's no.

285
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,583
-Ah?

286
00:18:30,616 --> 00:18:31,349
-I'm sorry.

287
00:18:31,383 --> 00:18:32,883
Ask someone else.

288
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:33,783
-What?

289
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,083
-Hey, hold on a second, Ikkaku.

290
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:41,283
It has to be you!

291
00:18:41,316 --> 00:18:45,283
Aside from you, there's no other
lieutenant who can do a Bankai.

292
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:46,283
None of them.

293
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:47,716
I know it's
presumptuous, but there

294
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:50,049
is no other lieutenant
who's fit to be a captain.

295
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:50,983
Think for a minute.

296
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:53,016
Who else is there?

297
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,949
The first choice, last choice.

298
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:56,749
You're the only choice.

299
00:18:56,783 --> 00:18:59,149
Aizen is gone now,
and there's a void.

300
00:18:59,183 --> 00:19:00,049
Fill it!

301
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,616
Aid us and our captain.

302
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:05,216
Ikkaku!

303
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:06,316
-Fool.

304
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:08,549
I told you when I was
training you, aside

305
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,316
from you and Yumichika,
I have no intention

306
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:13,649
of telling anyone
about my Bankai.

307
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:16,149
When word gets out
that I can do Bankai,

308
00:19:16,183 --> 00:19:18,549
I'll be hounded
by fools like you.

309
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,816
I'll have no rest.

310
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:24,016
-Now is the time.

311
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:27,183
We need to find a new
captain as soon as possible.

312
00:19:27,216 --> 00:19:29,516
-Well, that isn't
something that concerns me.

313
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,916
I didn't intend on
becoming a captain.

314
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:42,183
There's a problem
with being a captain.

315
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:46,516
It would mean I can't
fight under Captain Zaraki.

316
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:50,649
You want to surpass
Byakuya Kuchiki.

317
00:19:50,683 --> 00:19:53,149
I have a dream, as well.

318
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:12,116
To fight and die as
Zaraki's subordinate.

319
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:13,116
End of discussion.

320
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,116
Don't ever ask me again.

321
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:52,883
Damn.

322
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:10,883
-Ikkaku Madarame.

323
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:21,783
I'm glad I asked
you for your name.

324
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:53,383
YUMICHIKA: I knew it.

325
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,583
I knew that you
were alive, Ikkaku.

326
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:03,383
-Of course I am.

327
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,649
I was lucky today.

328
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:08,216
Luckier than you can imagine.

MAN: Oh, no!

331
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,434
I can't cancel the funeral
service for Ikkaku.

332
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:50,634
IKKAKU: What?

got into preparing it,

which picture do you

00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,234
want to use for your funeral?
