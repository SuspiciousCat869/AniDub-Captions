00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:38,440
HITSUGAYA (OFFSCREEN): So
Aizen wasn't enough for you.

3
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,806
You couldn't be happy until
you'd hurt Momo as well.

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,640
You slid your lies into
her mind like a dagger

5
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:48,573
and twisted them until they were
so painful that her hands bled

6
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:50,473
from gripping her sword so hard.

7
00:01:50,506 --> 00:01:51,806
ICHIMARU (OFFSCREEN): I'm sorry.

8
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,173
I'm afraid I don't follow you.

9
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,306
HITSUGAYA (OFFSCREEN):
I gave you a warning.

10
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,973
I told you that if you ever hurt
Momo, I would kill you myself!

11
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:12,640
ICHIMARU (OFFSCREEN):
[laugh] This will never do.

12
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:18,973
If you insist on drawing your
sword in a place like this,

13
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:22,573
then afraid you leave me no
other choice than to stop you.

14
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:39,540
IZURU (OFFSCREEN):
But Captain Ichimaru--

15
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:44,673
-Better move back, Izuru,
unless you feel like dying.

16
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,373
-[gasps]

17
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:48,306
HITSUGAYA (OFFSCREEN):
Don't be stupid, Izuru.

18
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,473
Just moving back isn't
going to be enough.

19
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:53,040
In a few minutes, I
promise you, you're

20
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:56,440
not going to want to be within
10 square miles of this place.

21
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:58,940
So start running,
and don't look back.

22
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:04,506
Because if you stay here, you're
liable to get drawn into this.

23
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,640
And I can't guarantee I
won't kill you by mistake.

ICHIMARU (OFFSCREEN):
An opening.

26
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:50,006
Evidently, the rumors about
Squad 10's Captain Hitsugaya

27
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,540
are true-- a child
prodigy of the sword

28
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:55,406
that comes along only
once every few centuries.

29
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,240
How very dangerous you are.

30
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:06,740
You're really serious.

IZURU (VOICEOVER): Incredible.

33
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:20,540
The level of his spiritual
pressure is crushing.

34
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:24,473
-Now, die!

35
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:25,473
-Hm.

-Well, Squad Captain,
what do you think now?

39
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:00,473
Do you still like your chances?

40
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,240
I see.

41
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:19,406
I had better not underestimate
you, Toshiro Hitsugaya, or else

42
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,006
I may wind up regretting
it afterwards.

43
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,440
-No, you're wrong about that.

44
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:31,640
Because you're going to start
regretting this day right now.

45
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:36,673
Remember, it's you who
forced me to do this, Gin.

46
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:40,173
And now you're going to pay
for what you did to Momo!

47
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,640

Hyorinmaru!

51
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:19,640
IZURU (OFFSCREEN): So this is
Hyorinmaru, a dragon of water

52
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:22,706
and ice created by overflowing
spiritual pressure.

53
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,806
In fact, they say it can
even affect the weather.

54
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,806
I've never seen it
before, but there's

55
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,673
no mistaking what it is--
the released form of Captain

56
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:34,140
Hitsugaya's,
Zanpakuto, Hyorinmaru.

So much water!

00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,140
Such velocity.

60
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:52,106
I couldn't dodge it!

-Now you're done, Gin Ichimaru.

65
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:33,573
-It appears his flesh.

66
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:34,073
Shinso.

67
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:41,640
Really?

68
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:43,573
Are you sure you
want to dodge this?

69
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:46,073
If you do, she'll die.

70
00:07:46,106 --> 00:07:47,373
-[gasp] Momo!

71
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:56,373
Rangiku?

72
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,206
-Please forgive me, sir.

73
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,406
I was returning to my
quarters as you ordered.

74
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,773
But then I-- I felt
Hinamori's spiritual pressure

75
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:08,540
and thought you might need help.

76
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:14,406
Now, Captain Ichimaru,
please put away your sword.

77
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,273
If you refuse, then you're
going to have both of us

78
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:19,006
as your opponents.

79
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:25,873
-Hm.

80
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:26,873
[laugh]

81
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:48,006
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN):
Day is breaking.

82
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:54,406
Only two days remaining.

83
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,840
Ichigo is growing
with startling speed

84
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:59,273
compared to ordinary
Soul Reapers.

85
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,040
The rate of his progress
is hard to believe.

86
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:05,606
But only his combat
techniques have improved.

87
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,606
His spirit energy has
barely changed at all.

88
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:15,340
-All right.

89
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:16,473
Exercise is finished.

90
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:22,006
I wonder where Yoruichi
ran off to now.

91
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,540
It's about time to get started
with the day's training.

92
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:26,473
YORUICHI (VOICEOVER):
At the rate we're going.

93
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:28,173
I don't know if he's
going to make it.

94
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:31,573
Can he achieve the Bankai
release in only two more days?

95
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:33,806
Or should I extend his training?

96
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,340
According to the
information I gathered

97
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:40,840
after we entered the
city, the grace period

98
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:45,573
between Rukia's execution date
was supposed to be 25 days.

99
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:47,340
We've used up 21
of them already.

100
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:50,406
That would mean that after
Ichigo's three days of training

101
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,740
here, the execution would be
the following day, with no time

102
00:09:53,773 --> 00:09:54,240
to spare.

103
00:09:57,006 --> 00:09:59,273
It turned out we were
chased by that Cleaner

104
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:03,506
inside of the Senzaikyu, and the
time frame shifted in our favor

105
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,140
when we entered
the Soul Society.

106
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,806
In other words, even after
our three days of training,

107
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,673
we still have eight days left
before Rukia's execution.

108
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:18,773
So there's definitely time
to extend the training.

109
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:22,273
But the question is, should I?

110
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:25,740
This three-day program
was created by Kisuke

111
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:28,406
and tested using his own body.

112
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,940
In fact, he's the only one
who has ever succeeded.

113
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:34,906
No one else has ever made
it to Bankai this way.

114
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,140
-Hey, Yoruichi!

115
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:37,706
YORUICHI (VOICEOVER):
In the process,

116
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,240
Kisuke determined that three
days was both the minimum

117
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,206
and the maximum amount of time
needed to acquire the release,

118
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,006
and that it would be
dangerous to continue

119
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,440
any longer than that.

120
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,273
-Yoruichi, where are you?

121
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:52,140
YORUICHI (VOICEOVER):
I remember him saying--

122
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:53,273
-Don't worry.

123
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:55,773
Ichigo's abilities are
far superior to my own.

124
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:57,306
YORUICHI (VOICEOVER):
I believed him.

125
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,440
And here we are, fully
engaged in training.

126
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:01,573
-Hey, Yoruichi!

127
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:03,506
YORUICHI (VOICEOVER):
But there's no guarantee

128
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,273
that Ichigo's soul will
be able to withstand

129
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:08,106
an extended training period.

130
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,673
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Yoruichi, damn it!

131
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:10,973
Come on out here.

132
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:14,140
What are you, afraid of me
all of a sudden and ran away?

133
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,606
Quit playing games with
me and let's get started!

134
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,406
You hear me?

135
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,473
YORUICHI (VOICEOVER): I'll
give him an extra day.

136
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:25,106
And after that, if there's still
no change in his spirit energy,

137
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,640
then we'll just have to risk it.

138
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:37,273
-What did you say?

139
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:55,847
[gasp]

140
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,114
-Did you not hear
the first time?

141
00:11:59,147 --> 00:12:00,047
Very well.

142
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:01,914
I shall repeat
the pronouncement.

143
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:04,781
By executive order,
your execution date

144
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:06,914
has been changed once again.

145
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:11,714
Rukia Kuchiki, your execution
will be carried out tomorrow.

146
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,847
-If you hadn't shown up
there right when you did,

147
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:33,181
Momo would surely be dead now.

148
00:12:33,214 --> 00:12:35,781
Thank you, Rangiku.

149
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:36,447
-You're welcome.

150
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:43,047

-Hm.

153
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,114
-I'm not done with you yet!

154
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:06,881
-Instead of coming
after me, maybe you

155
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:09,181
should look after the
Squad Five lieutenant.

156
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:21,681
RANGIKU (VOICEOVER):
Once again, you

157
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:24,981
disappear without telling
me where you're going.

158
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:28,614
That's one thing about
you that's never changed.

00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:35,581
Gin, tell me, where
are you going now?

160
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:48,647
HITSUGAYA (VOICEOVER): That
letter of Captain Aizen's-- I

161
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:50,714
wish I knew how much
of it was forged.

162
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:56,647

HITSUGAYA (VOICEOVER):
The part in there

165
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:08,547
about using the power of Sokyoku
released by Rukia Kuchiki's

166
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,514
execution-- is that real?

167
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:13,547
Is thre really a plot
to use that power

168
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:15,947
to destroy all of
the Soul Society?

169
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,447
Could line have been true?

170
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:28,214
If it is true, if
that's Ichimaru's aim,

171
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:32,481
then I know what I have to do.

172
00:14:32,514 --> 00:14:35,081
-A hell butterfly?

173
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:36,914
The following is
an urgent message

174
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:40,481
for all squad captains
and their lieutenants.

175
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:44,347
A change has been made regarding
the execution of Rukia Kuchiki.

176
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:47,514
Be advised that this convicted
prisoner's execution is now

177
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:51,281
set for 29 hours from now.

178
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:53,781
This decision is
final and irrevocable.

179
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:56,981
There will be no further
changes to the execution date.

180
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:57,647
That is all.

181

182
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:05,314
-Captain?

183
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:08,947
-The execution and the
release of Sokyoku's power--

184
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:11,747
if Gin really is
the one behind this,

185
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:14,547
then there's no way I can
just stand by and let his plan

186
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,714
go forward.

187
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:16,847
Let's go, Rangiku.

188
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:20,347
You know what we have to
do-- stop the execution.

189
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:26,614
MAN (ON PA): The following is
an urgent message for all court

190
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:29,681
guard squad captains
and their lieutenants.

191
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:32,081
Another change has been
made regarding the execution

192
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:34,714
date of Rukia Kuchiki.

193
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,114
Be advised that the
prisoner's execution

194
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:40,814
is no set for 29 hour from now.

195
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:45,314
I repeat, the execution
of Rukia Kuchiki

196
00:15:45,347 --> 00:15:49,247
is set for 29 hours from now.

197
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,647
This decision is
final and irrevocable.

198
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:56,281
There will be no further
changes to the execution date.

199
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:56,947
That is all.

200
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:24,047
-There's no doubt.

201
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:26,714
That's his spiritual pressure.

YORUICHI (VOICEOVER): Ichigo's
making steady progress.

204
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:54,847
But still, I just
can't seem to shake

205
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:58,614
this uneasy feeling I have.

206
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:01,914
I'm sensing something out
there, something ominous

207
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:03,247
approaching this place.

208

-[gasp]

209
00:17:08,914 --> 00:17:10,314
RENJI (OFFSCREEN):
I was wondering

210
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:13,781
what you could be doing,
holed up in this place.

211
00:17:13,814 --> 00:17:16,747
I take it that's the true
form of your Zanpakuto there

212
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:17,247
with you.

213
00:17:22,014 --> 00:17:26,647
So, you're hiding out here and
secretly training for Bankai,

214
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:27,614
are you?

215
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,414
Looks like fun to me.

216
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:30,847
-[gasp]

217
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:37,014
-Let me train along with you.

218
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:38,981
-RENJI (OFFSCREEN).

219
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:41,847
-You seem to have that "what
are you doing here?" look.

220
00:17:41,881 --> 00:17:45,614
Hell, I guess I can't
blame you for wondering.

221
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,314
But the fact is, I'm not
here for any special reason.

222
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:51,381
It's just that we're
out of time now.

223
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:54,081
So I needed some place where
I could concentrate and train

224
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,681
in peace, just like you.

225
00:17:56,714 --> 00:18:00,181
-What do you mean
we're out of time?

226
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:01,814
What the hell are
you talking about?

227
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:08,314
-Well, all right.

228
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:11,747
I guess I can at least
tell you that much.

229
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:13,881
It's about Rukia's execution.

230
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:15,547
They've changed the time.

231
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:18,614
-Changed the time?

232
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:22,881
-They've announced it's going
to be at noon-- noon tomorrow.

-[gasp]

235
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:30,247
-And though I hate
to admit it, the fact

236
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:32,147
is, at my current level,
I'm not quite good

237
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:34,414
enough to save Rukia.

238
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:38,081
That's why I came
here-- to train.

239
00:18:38,114 --> 00:18:39,614
Don't worry about me.

240
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:41,247
I don't have any
intention of getting

241
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:43,847
in the way of your
Bankai training.

242
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:47,114
In fact, I'm close to achieving
the Bankai release myself.

243
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:50,047
I've already mastered
manifesting it, like this.

244
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:00,281
So, if it's OK
with you, I'm just

245
00:19:00,314 --> 00:19:01,581
going to do my own thing here.

246
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:11,814
-Noon tomorrow?

247
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:13,381
No way.

248
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:15,614
There's no way he can
reach Bankai that quickly.

249
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:19,481
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): What?

250
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:21,947
Are you just going to
give up on me then?

251
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:23,647
Come on, Yoruichi.

252
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:26,914
You're the one who started
me on this training program.

253
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:30,414
It was your idea, so you can't
be the first one to quit on it.

254
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:31,781
-Ichigo, no.

255
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:33,981
What if tomorrow comes and you
still can't achieve Bankai?

256
00:19:34,014 --> 00:19:35,947
-We can't waste time
worrying about what-ifs.

257
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:40,414
Failure is no longer an option.

258
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:45,181
If they have changed the
deadline to tomorrow,

259
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:48,681
then the only option there is
is to finish training today.

YORUICHI (VOICEOVER):

RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
So tomorrow I die.

263
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:27,181
I wonder if before
the execution,

264
00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:29,347
it would be worth begging
for Ichigo and the others

265
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:32,247
to be allowed to return to
the World of the Living.

266
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:35,347
I belong to the Kuchiki
clan, after all.

267
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:36,947
They might allow it.

268
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:44,381
It seems strange,
but even when I

269
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:50,281
heard that my execution was
set for tomorrow, I wasn't sad.

270
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:52,081
It must be because
of the dream I

271
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:57,647
had last night, that dream about
the night I can never forget.

You can't die on me.

RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Kaien, I'm afraid there

280
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:59,453
is nothing of me
that's worth saving.
