00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:58,647
-It's 9:00 already, boss man.

5
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:00,147
This is going to be bad.

00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,147
-What?

7
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:01,981
Nine o'clock?

Come on.

We gotta go, Bonnie. [whistling]

[grunting] Ha, that's
the way, Bonnie.

13
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,281
I can't play with you
right now, though.

Come on and give me

00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:38,147
Hey.

18
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,981
Come back here.

00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:42,847
-Oh, I'm not running away.

20
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,114
Just wait.

21
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:45,714
I'll be back here
again tomorrow.

We'll settle this
thing once and for all.

You just wait for
me, dandelion head.

that was a disaster.

-[snoring]

00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:45,514
CHAD (OFFSCREEN): Big
bodied men like him

38
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:47,347
have plenty of
stamina and strength.

39
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,914
I'm sure he'll be
fine before long.

00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:50,581
-Yeah, you're right.

41
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:52,914
It would take a lot to
permanently harm someone

42
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:54,747
as big and powerful as Jidanbo.

43
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:58,981
-The question now is who
exactly is this Kukaku

44
00:03:59,014 --> 00:04:02,147
Shiba we're supposed
to be looking for.

45
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:06,514
As usual, Yoruichi left
out a lot of the details.

46
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,914
It would have to be
someone Yoruichi thinks

47
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:10,581
can help us get
into the Seireitei

48
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:12,914
without going through the gates.

49
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:15,881
-Which would probably mean
someone with great skill.

50
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:17,214
-Wow.

51
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,281
I wonder if that means it's
a really smart purebred cat

52
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:21,214
with pedigree papers.

53
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:22,414
I hope so!

54
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:25,147
Or an American
shorthair type cat.

55
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,947
Or even a dalmatian.

00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:29,447
-Huh?

58
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,647
-Just because it's
someone Yoruichi knows

59
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:33,747
doesn't mean it'll be a cat.

60
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:37,814
And by the way, a
dalmatian is a dog.

61
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:40,247
-Are you sure?

62
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,814
-Judging from the
name Kukaku, I'd

63
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:44,881
say we're going to be dealing
with a well-built man, probably

64
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:46,481
a powerful samurai warrior.

65
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:48,281
CHAD (OFFSCREEN): No,
I think he'll be more

66
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:49,981
of a hermit type master.

67
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:50,481
-Aha!

68
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:56,814
Like this.

69
00:04:56,847 --> 00:04:58,281
And he'll have this.

70
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,114
Ta da.

71
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:06,981
A hermit type samurai
warrior master

72
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:09,014
with the ears and
tails of a cat.

73
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,647
-If he looks anything like
that, we're in trouble.

ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Aw.

75
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:15,714
How about if I draw him with
dalmatian spots instead?

76
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:17,181
URYU (OFFSCREEN):
Not bad, Orihime.

77
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:19,014
Except you forgot
to give him a cape.

78
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:22,514
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Oh,
I always forget something.

-What's the holdup
with Ichigo, anyway?

80
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:25,447
-He's inside.

81
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:26,947
Should I call him?

82
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:27,814
-That's OK.

83
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:30,914
I'll go get him.

84
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:32,714
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
Now I have to think up

85
00:05:32,747 --> 00:05:36,747
another version of Kukaku,
maybe with a bigger head.

86
00:05:36,781 --> 00:05:41,181
-Orihime, maybe you're
thinking too hard.

87
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:42,414
-Huh?

88
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,081
What do you mean, not going?

89
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:45,214
-That's what I said.

90
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:47,281
You three can just go
on ahead without me.

-That's not an option!

You're coming with us if
I have to drag you myself!

00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:57,481
Argh.

96
00:05:57,514 --> 00:05:59,514
-If I don't show up,
he'll think I'm a chicken!

97
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,214
-Who cares what he thinks?

98
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:01,714
-Hey.

99
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:02,647
What's up?

100
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:04,581
Aren't you two ready to go yet?

101
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,214
URYU (OFFSCREEN):
Get in here, Orihime.

102
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:09,947
Help me get him out of here.

103
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:10,947
-Leave me alone.

104
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:13,214
I'll beat that
boar-riding punk quick,

105
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:20,947
and catch up to you guys
before you know-- [screaming]

106

-What's wrong with you?

107
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:29,347
Have you forgotten why we
came here in the first place?

108
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:31,481
Lives are at stake.

109
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:34,081
Rukia's life in particular
is in your hands.

110
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:37,947
Surely you haven't
forgotten about that.

111
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,047
You don't have time to waste
on foolish grudge matches

112
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,847
with strangers.

113
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:47,214
Are you ready for
the task at hand?

114
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:49,147
[music playing]

115
00:06:58,381 --> 00:07:02,281
-What is it now, Renji?

116
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:06,481
Have they moved up
my execution date?

117
00:07:06,514 --> 00:07:07,414
RENJI (OFFSCREEN): Yes.

118
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:09,981
It's less than 14 days from now.

119
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,781
The use of the Sokyoku
has been approved.

120
00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:15,281
As a result of that,
we're here to transfer you

121
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:16,414
to the repentance cell.

122
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:29,014
-Ah, looks to me like
we're heading out

123
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:30,747
towards the empty countryside.

124
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:33,214
Are you sure this
the right way, Uryu?

125
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:34,014
Hey.

126
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:35,747
I'm talking to you!

127
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:36,914
-Just be quiet.

128
00:07:36,947 --> 00:07:38,247
I'm following the elders' map.

129
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:40,481
And according to this,
we're almost there now.

130
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:42,181
If you don't like the
way I'm guiding us,

131
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:44,547
then why don't you take
over, great leader.

132
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:46,114
-Don't get your
panties in a wad.

133
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:47,581
I was just wondering.

134
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:49,814
-Kukaku Shiba is probably
the type of master

135
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,214
who likes to keep his
identity secret by hiding

136
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:53,847
away out in the wilderness.

137
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:55,014
-That would make sense.

138
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:56,747
But it's not the case here.

139
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,447
Living in these
types of surroundings

140
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:00,247
is just Kukaku's
personal preference.

141
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:05,414
The fact is, Kukaku
moves frequently.

142
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:08,814
But the houses themselves
always look much the same.

143
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:12,347
I guarantee you'll know it's
the house when you see it.

144
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:13,847
-What's that supposed to mean?

145
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:15,647
-You'll see soon enough.

146
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,281
Just wait.

147
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:24,681
Ah.

148
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:25,847
It looks like we've arrived.

149
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:29,114
-Wha--

150
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:30,081
-No way.

151
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:30,647
-Oh!

152
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:32,581
It's fantastic.

153
00:08:32,614 --> 00:08:33,081
-Hmm?

154
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:39,481
-Like I said, you'll know it
when you see it. [chuckling]

155
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:42,314
-What kind of person would want
to live in a house like that?

156
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:43,247
-I don't know.

157
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:44,347
But whoever he is,
he sure doesn't

158
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:46,814
care about keeping
his identity a secret.

159
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,314
And building houses
like this one,

160
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:50,314
it's no wonder he doesn't
live in town anymore.

161
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:53,114
-I bet he's not allowed
to live in town anymore.

162
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:54,414
-Hm.

163
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,914
So this time the banner is
held up by giant human arms.

164
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:59,347
It's actually quite
clever, don't you think?

165
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:01,814
-That is one word
for it, I guess.

166
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:03,414
-But not the word
I was thinking of.

167
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:03,914
-Come on.

168
00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:04,647
Let's go.

169
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:06,114
-Yeah!

170
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:07,047
[giggling]

171
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:14,014
-(THINKING) I can't believe he
would actually take me to such

172
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:15,747
an embarrassing destination.

173
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:18,214
-(THINKING) I can't let anyone
see me walking into a house

174
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:19,181
that ridiculous.

175
00:09:19,214 --> 00:09:20,814
-What's the matter with you two?

176
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:22,014
Hurry up.

177
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:22,514
-All right.

178
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:27,247
Oh, and Uryu, you
better not tell

179
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:29,547
anyone I went int this
place, or you'll pay for it.

180
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:32,647
-Don't worry about that.

181
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:36,381
(THINKING) Hmm, strange.

182
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:40,881
That's an awfully big chimney
for such a small house.

183
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:41,681
Huh?

184
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,847
And the top is sealed shut.

185
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:45,681
I wonder why.

186
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:47,447
MALE SPEAKERS (OFFSCREEN):
Halt, strangers.

187
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:48,647
-Huh?

188
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,847
-Who dares trespass here?

189
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,681
-Foreigners, from
the looks of them.

190
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:55,214
And one of them
is a soul reaper.

191
00:09:58,747 --> 00:09:59,814
-Very suspicious.

192
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:01,047
I, Koganehiko--

193
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:02,647
-And I, Shiroganehiko--

194
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:06,947
-Can not allow you passage
inside this building.

195
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,147
-Be gone!

196
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:11,581
-Or advance, and be killed
now for your insolence.

197
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:13,781
-Crap, more gatekeepers.

198
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,681
This soul society is just
one annoyance after another.

199
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:21,214
-Master Yoruichi!

200
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:28,681
-A descending staircase
right from the front door?

201
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:30,481
Now that's just weird.

202
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:34,014
-It kind of makes you wonder how
they get to the upstairs, huh?

203
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:35,647
-A thousand apologies,
Master Yoruichi,

204
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:38,514
for not recognizing right
away that it was you.

205
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:40,881
We had no idea these
trespassers were your servants.

206
00:10:40,914 --> 00:10:42,447
-(THINKING) Now I'm a servant?

207
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:43,847
-It's my fault.

208
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:46,147
I should have sent word ahead
that my companions and I were

209
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:47,081
on our way here.

210
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,914
-[laughing] You're too kind.

211
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:52,481
Such generous words
from such a person.

212
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:56,347
Please wait here while
I announce your arrival.

213
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:58,014
Master, we have visitors.

214
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:03,681
Now, please enter.

215
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:17,514
-Well, it's been a long
time, hasn't it Yoruichi?

216
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,481
-Ku-Kukaku's a--

217
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:21,547
-A woman?

218
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,914
-You assumed it was a man.

219
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:24,781
But I never told you that.

220
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:25,481
-Hmm?

221
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:26,814
What's this?

222
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,514
You seem to have brought a
bunch of brats along with you.

223
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:31,447
-I shall explain that.

224
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:35,447
First, though, I have a
favor to ask of you, Kukaku.

225
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:38,047
-That is usually the case
when you look me up, Yoruichi.

226
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:45,447
Is it dangerous?

227
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:47,847
-Probably.

228
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,047
-Heh.

229
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:52,347
It's been a long time
since we talked like this.

230
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,481
Well, well my friend.

231
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,981
Lucky for you, I enjoy danger.

232
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,817
[music playing]

233
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:45,651
Right

234
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:49,317
-Can you see it, Rukia, there
at the edge of the cliff--

235
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,784
the instruments
of your execution.

236
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:52,284
Sokyoku.

237
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,317
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): A person

238
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:02,817
who is held here can stand
at the tower's window,

239
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:09,084
and gaze out at the Sokyoku
and perhaps repent his sins.

240
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:13,151
That is why this place is
called the repentance cell.

241
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:20,484
Now your hands I release.

242
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,784
Thank you for escorting the
prisoner here, lieutenant.

243
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:42,851
We must go now.

244
00:13:42,884 --> 00:13:43,351
-Fine.

245
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:49,884
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
We must lock the tower, sir.

246
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:50,384
-Huh?

247
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:03,151
-Lieutenant Abarai,
this is not permitted.

248
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:10,617
-I want to leave you with
some unconfirmed information.

249
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,717
They say that a
group of intruders

250
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,184
attempted to enter
the soul society

251
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:16,684
yesterday-- five of them.

252
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:19,417
Now my sources say one of
them carried a sword as long

253
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:22,617
as his body, a soul reaper
with orange colored hair.

254
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:27,884
-All right.

255
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:29,151
I think I get the picture.

256
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:37,851
Aw, what the hell.

257
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:39,084
I'll take the job.

258
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:40,551
-Excellent.

259
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:41,984
-I have some reservations.

260
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:46,351
But with Urahara involved,
how can I say no?

261
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:50,017
However, while I trust
you completely, Yoruichi,

262
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:53,017
I do not trust these
kids accompanying you.

263
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:54,684
So I'm going to
send and overseer

264
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:57,284
with you, just to keep
an eye on them for me.

265
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:58,417
-Overseer?

266
00:14:58,451 --> 00:14:59,517
-Yeah.

267
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:00,717
Well, I call him that.

268
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:02,584
But he's actually
my kid brother.

269
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:05,284
He's still kind of a doofus,
and not all that useful.

270
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:07,051
But he'll have to do.

271
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:08,017
Hey, in there.

272
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:08,851
Are you ready?

273
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:09,817
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, sis.

274
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:10,517
I'm ready.

275
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:11,217
-All right.

276
00:15:11,251 --> 00:15:11,951
I'm opening the door.

277
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:12,951
So behavior self.

278
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:16,351
GANJU (OFFSCREEN):
OK, I promise.

279
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:17,651
It's an honor to meet you.

280
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,117
My name is Ganju Shiba.

281
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:21,717
And I'm pleased
to be of service.

282
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:23,151
[gasps]

283
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:26,917
-Oh!

284
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:37,251
[shouting]

285
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:38,717
-You two already
know each other?

286
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:47,217
-(THINKING) How many days
has it been since I last saw

287
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:48,984
Rukia's face look so alive?

288
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,517
Unfortunately, it
was Gin Ichimaru

289
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:55,884
who met them at the gate.

290
00:15:55,917 --> 00:16:00,684
So the substitute soul reaper
is probably dead already.

291
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:04,151
It's probably a good thing
I didn't tell her that.

292
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:05,717
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN): Hey there.

293
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:07,251
-Huh?

294
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:09,984
-I haven't seen you
for a while, Renji.

295
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:10,717
-Captain Isshin?

296
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:17,351
-Do you happen to have
a minute to spare?

297
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:20,317
Well, it's been a long
time since you and I

298
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:22,117
had a talk, Renji.

299
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:24,117
-True.

300
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,551
-I haven't seen
you since you were

301
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,284
sent to Captain Zaraki's place.

302
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,684
Quite a few years
ago, wasn't it?

303
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:32,784
And now you're with
Squad Six, I hear.

304
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,351
-So what did you
want to talk about?

305
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:46,851
-Renji, would it
be accurate to say

306
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:49,851
that you are fairly close to
the prisoner, Rukia Kuchiki?

307
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,817
-Huh?

308
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:53,184
-You can tell me the truth.

309
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:55,651
Weren't the two of you good
friends in your younger days,

310
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:57,651
back in the Rukon district?

311
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,117
-Yes.

312
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:03,551
-In that case, I'll
get right to the point.

313
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:07,651
In your personal opinion,
does Rukia deserve to die?

314
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:13,051
-How, how can you
ask such a thing?

315
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:15,384
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN): Doesn't
it it seem a little strange?

316
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,417
Her crime was the unauthorized
transfer, and subsequent loss

317
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:22,751
of her spiritual powers,
and then refusing to return.

318
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,984
Serious offenses, to be sure.

319
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:27,584
But does this punishment
fit the crime?

320
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:31,517
The order for immediate return
and disposal of her Gigai,

321
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,451
the lessening of the grace
period from 35 to 25 days,

322
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:37,751
and the use of the
Sokyuku on a soul reaper

323
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:40,417
ranked lower than captain--
all these measures are

324
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:42,651
outside the norm.

325
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:45,317
I have a strong suspicion that
these things are happening

326
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:47,884
as the result of the
will of a single person.

327
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,484
-What are you
suggesting, captain?

328
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:50,451
You're not saying that--

329
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:51,651
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN):
I'm suggesting

330
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:54,084
only that you keep
your eyes open.

331
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:55,417
Be careful.

332
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:57,084
There's something not
right in all this.

333
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,451
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Attention all captains.

334
00:17:58,484 --> 00:17:59,651
Attention.

335
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:01,317
Please assemble and report
for an emergency meeting

336
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:02,517
immediately.

337
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:06,651
I repeat, all captains
are to report immediately.

338
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:10,384
[roaring]

339
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:27,051
[roaring and grunting]

340
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:27,917
-Die.

341
00:18:27,951 --> 00:18:29,117
[giggling]

342
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:35,751
-[screaming and laughing]
Take a hike, fat boy!

343
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:37,751
-Why you orange headed moron!

344
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,084
[grunting] You suck at fighting.

345
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:43,451
-You ought to know.

346
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:45,651
How do you like
these, pig straddler?

347
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:46,951
[shouting, grunting, squealing]

348
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:54,184
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Going
to rearrange your ugly face

349
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,351
for you!

350
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,017
GANJU (OFFSCREEN):
Take that, dandelion.

351
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:07,684
-[gasping] Why, you
little-- [shouting]

352
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:14,551
[screaming]

353
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:20,417
[explosion and screams]

354
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:28,417
-Did she have to wreck the
place just to stop them.

355
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:30,251
-At least now we
know why this lady

356
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:32,551
has to change houses so often.

357
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:34,084
-Extreme makeover.

358
00:19:34,117 --> 00:19:36,151
KUKAKU (OFFSCREEN): What's
the matter, you idiots?

359
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:39,384
I ought to rip you a new one
for being so damned stupid.

360
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:41,184
At this rate, you two
are going to screw up

361
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:43,351
this entire mission,
not to mention

362
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:45,151
you've already
destroyed my house!

363
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,251
I don't want to
hear any excuses.

364
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:49,384
You got something to say?

365
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:51,251
-Uh, no, nothing at all.

366
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:53,651
-(THINKING) What it
is with these two?

367
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:57,217
Brother and sister, and both
of them nutty as a fruit cake.

368
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:58,184
[gasp]

369
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:06,951
-Listen, you idiot.

370
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:09,251
You're in my house now.

371
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:11,351
If you don't like the
way I do things here,

372
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:12,651
then get the hell out.

373
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:13,451
Any questions?

374
00:20:13,484 --> 00:20:13,951
-Nope.

375
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:14,651
Nope.

376
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:15,884
I'm just fine with it.

377
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:17,417
-OK, then.

378
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:18,417
I'm glad you understand.

379
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:26,517
-Your sister's a
real piece of work.

380
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:28,117
-I know.

381
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:28,784
-All right.

382
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:29,984
Everyone on your feet.

383
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:30,917
-Yes, sir.

384
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:32,984
-Koganehiko, you
and Shiroganehiko

385
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:34,384
begin preparations outside.

386
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:35,651
-Understood.

387
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:37,584
-The rest of you,
gather up your crap.

388
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:38,484
And follow me.

389
00:20:41,017 --> 00:20:43,784
-How can it be so
bright down here?

390
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:46,351
I didn't notice any
generators anywhere.

391
00:20:46,384 --> 00:20:48,651
-Lots of firefly creeper vines.

392
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:51,051
I keep them growing along the
walls, and on the ceiling.

393
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,084
I

394
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,351
-Don't think I've
ever heard of that.

395
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:55,351
Is that some sort of
plant that only grows here

396
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:58,651
in the soul society?

397
00:20:58,684 --> 00:20:59,584
-All right, then.

398
00:20:59,617 --> 00:21:00,317
Here we are.

399
00:21:00,351 --> 00:21:01,517
-Hey.

400
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,017
-Open the door, Ganju.

401
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:05,651
-Yes, sir.

402
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:10,284
-I said-- [muffled shouting]
Get your hands off of me.

403
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:13,317
-Just keep cool, OK?

404
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:15,217
-[roaring]

405
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:24,684
-Oh!

406
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,451
-What is that thing?

407
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:27,384
-It's huge.

408
00:21:30,784 --> 00:21:33,551
-You can quit worrying about
getting through the wall.

409
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,384
With this launcher, I'll get
you all into the Seireitei

410
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:37,784
through the air.

411
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:40,084
-The air?

412
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:43,751
-Or my name's not Kukaku
Shiba, fireworks expert

413
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:44,917
of the Rukon district.

414
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:58,673
[music playing]

415
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:54,807
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): This is the
special little flower crane

416
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,207
cannon my sister,
Kukaku, invented

417
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,873
to break through the
barrier surrounding

418
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:00,240
the entire Seireitei, which
is made from the Sekkiseki,

419
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:02,640
a lethal and rare stone that
breaks down spiritual energy

420
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:03,473
completely.

421
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,640
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Uh.

422
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:06,207
Could you repeat that?

423
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,040
GANJU (OFFSCREEN):
Ugh, forget it.
