[theme music]

2
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,177
NARRATOR: Gyokaku
Kumoi had set a plot

3
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,310
to eliminate Princess
Rurichiyo into motion.

4
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:58,643
He gave the Bakkoto Saiga to his
trusted follower, Hanza Nukui,

5
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:03,010
and sent an assassination squad
to the World of the Living.

6
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:04,943
After splitting up
with his friends,

7
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:07,877
Ichigo was forced to
face Nukui one on one.

8
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,810
-Now trap them, Saiga!

9
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,210
-Not much of a variety,
considering I've

10
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:29,143
seen that attack already.

11
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:32,177
Now I guess it's my turn!

12
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,643
-[laugh]

13
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,877
-Not again!

14
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,843
What the hell?

15
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:45,377
-This isn't the kind
of inferior attack

16
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,110
that you can defend against by
simply turning and shielding

17
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:52,543
yourself from the light.

18
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:55,943
-[shout]

19
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:59,477
NARRATOR: Saiga, the sword Nukui
used in battle with Ichigo,

20
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,210
was the same weapon another
assassin had wielded.

21
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:06,910
But this time, it
possessed different powers.

22
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:10,543
A weapon whose powers can
change depending on the wielder

23
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:11,377
is known as Bakkoto.

24
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:16,277
-Keep dreaming.

25
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,610
I'm not rolling over for you.

26
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:24,977
-[grunting]

27
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,043
-What?

28
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:34,610
A crack in Saiga?

29
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:35,710
No!

30
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:38,643
-[shouting]

31
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,777
NARRATOR: However,
Nukui and his men

32
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,010
underestimated Ichigo
and his friend's strength

33
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:50,777
and were defeated.

34
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:01,610
NUKUI: Huh.

35
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:05,710
So it won't be as
easy as I thought.

36
00:04:05,743 --> 00:04:06,443
Well, then.

37
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:21,443
-[sigh] Huh?

38
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,877
Kumoi, what is it?

39
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,010
-Lord Kannogi, please pardon me.

40
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:38,143
I just wanted to see if you
are faring well in here.

41
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,277
-Yes, I'm all right.

42
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,277
But, well, the truth
of it is, I'm not

43
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,277
really sure what it is
I'm supposed to be doing.

44
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,943
I'm just wiling away the time.

45
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:51,510
-Yes, that is fine,
my young lord.

46
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:54,810
Rest assured, I will take care
of all the Kasumioji Clan's

47
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:55,943
affairs.

48
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:58,577
Now excuse me.

49
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,110
-What?

50
00:04:59,143 --> 00:05:00,977
That was it?

51
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,643
It feels like they're
always watching me.

52
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:05,277
Oh!

53
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,443
This is so boring!

54
00:05:07,477 --> 00:05:10,310
And Rurichiyo still
hasn't come back yet.

55
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,677
I don't have a great
feeling about this.

56
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:19,677
-Thankfully, Lord Kannogi
is such a simpleton,

57
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,910
it makes my job so easy.

58
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:26,877
Well, look who it is.

59
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,010
You have some nerve
showing your face here.

60
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:32,777
HANZA: Apologies, sir.

61
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,877
-No matter.

62
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,810
We underestimated that
substitute Soul Reaper.

63
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:39,910
It appears his
power is far greater

64
00:05:39,943 --> 00:05:42,843
than we assumed it to be.

65
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:45,777
So, what is your plan?

66
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,943
-Sir, if you will grant
me another opportunity,

67
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:51,577
I would gladly give my
own life to exterminate

68
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,610
him and the princess.

69
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:55,310
-Then show me your resolve.

70
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:57,077
Prove it to me.

71
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,877
-Yes, my lord.

72
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:14,143
[groaning]

73
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,243
-You have formed a bond with
the sword that cannot be broken.

74
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:37,477
Well, Hanza, do you understand
what you've just done?

75
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,143
-I am fully aware, my lord.

76
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:44,843
-You've proven yourself.

77
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:48,510
I, Gyokaku Kumoi, have
personally witnessed it.

78
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:51,277
Go, bring me to heads
of the substitute Soul

79
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,777
Reaper and the princess.

80
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,977
-Yes, my lord.

81
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,043
But sir, if I may
make a request?

82
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:01,343
-What is it?

83
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:04,977
-Sir, I wish to borrow
additional swords for my men.

84
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:13,110
-Jinnai Doko.

85
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:15,743
-And my name is Kuzu Ryu.

86
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:19,177
-I am called Genga.

87
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,877
KUMOI: These are your men?

88
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,243
-Yes, my lord.

89
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:25,477
They are, without exception,
the most ruthless and skilled

90
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,843
of the underworld.

91
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:28,343
-Then I ask them.

92
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:30,277
These weapons will
drain the life out

93
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,143
of anyone who wields them.

94
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:35,977
Knowing that, the lot of you
still dare to receive them?

95
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,577
-[laughs] Sounds fun.

96
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,943
-Why would we hesitate
over something like that?

97
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:44,077
-We're all pretty
confident we have

98
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,810
what it takes to handle
those blades of yours.

99
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,482
-Fine, then.

100
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,121
I seek only results.

101
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:52,441
Nothing less.

102
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,810
KENRYU: I reinforced
the barrier.

103
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:07,777
I've also put up an optical
barrier around the house,

104
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,077
so it won't be visible to
anyone looking from outside.

105
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,943
-What do you mean, not visible?

106
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:17,077
You're telling me the place
just looks like an empty lot?

107
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,643
-Huh?

108
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:20,110
What?

109
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:22,577
Rurichiyo's house is gone!

110
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,543
How did it disappear?

111
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:28,443
-Don't you think that's
going overboard a little bit?

112
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:30,910
-No amount of protection
is going overboard

113
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,977
when it comes to Lady Rurichiyo.

114
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,543
-All I'm saying
is you might cause

115
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:36,543
a panic in the neighborhood.

116
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:38,443
-Well, we don't have a choice.

117
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:42,577
After all, none of us even know
the full extent of their power.

118
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,510
-Mm.

119
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,743
-A Zanpakuto that feeds on
the wielder's spirit energy.

120
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:51,343
-Yoruichi has gone back
to the Soul Society

121
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:53,443
to try and gather
some more information.

122
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:56,043
I sure hope she's able to
take up something useful.

123
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:01,843
-Oh, my lady, is
something the matter?

124
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:02,477
Ah, yes.

125
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,510
I almost forgot.

126
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,177
We have some lovely
sweets here for you.

127
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,577
-Let me see.

128
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,943
Kenryu and Enryu are present, as
are Ichigo and all his friends.

129
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:12,477
Why all the security?

130
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:19,043
-Well, I-- it's, uh-- uh, it
seems the World of the Living

131
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:20,577
has many burglars.

132
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,710
And, well, we did
not want to cause you

133
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:25,310
any unnecessary
worry, Lady Rurichiyo.

134
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:27,743
I'm very sorry.
[laughs nervously]

135
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:28,277
-I see.

136
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,943
I shall retire to bed, then.

137
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:37,610
-Very well.

138
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,443
Goodnight, my lady.

139
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,443
-Oh, I've been so
busy lately, I let

140
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:50,977
all my household chores
pile up. [giggle]

141
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,310
[sigh]

142
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,810
-There's a lot more going on
here than what meets the eye.

143
00:10:05,277 --> 00:10:07,043
-Oh, well.

144
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:11,377
It looks like things will
be getting messy again soon.

145
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,843
[sigh]

146
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,110
ICHIGO: Thought you
were off to bed.

147
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:31,610
-Ichigo?

148
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:38,177
-What are you doing up here?

149
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,943
-Oh, I'm just gazing
up at the stars.

150
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:45,743
-I've never seen you
look like this before.

151
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:48,110
-And just what type
of comment is that?

152
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:52,343
-Uh, how can I put it?

153
00:10:52,377 --> 00:10:55,477
You look like you're
taking a breather.

154
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,343
-Like I'm breathing?

155
00:10:57,377 --> 00:10:59,410
[giggle] I see.

156
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:00,810
-What's so funny?

157
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:02,110
-That expression of yours.

158
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:05,677
Well, it makes it sound like
I am not usually breathing.

159
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,777
-You're right.

160
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,410
It is kind of a weird
expression, I guess.

161
00:11:10,443 --> 00:11:12,110
-It is nice here.

162
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:15,343
In my world, I would be scolded
for climbing onto the roof.

163
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:16,743
-Well, yeah.

164
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,177
But keep in mind, that's 'cause
you're an important princess.

165
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,010
And nobody wants you
to hurt yourself.

166
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:24,677
-I suppose so.

167
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,277
Whenever I get injured,
someone is always punished

168
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,710
for allowing it to happen, even
if it was just a little scrape.

169
00:11:31,743 --> 00:11:35,177
There are always so many
things that I want to explore,

170
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,043
but each time I have tried,
someone else ends up suffering.

171
00:11:39,077 --> 00:11:41,277
Like the time I tried
to learn archery.

172
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:45,943
Ah.

173
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,143
[gasp] [scream]

174
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,477
Oh!

175
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:14,577
[moaning]

176
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,977
-[scream]

177
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,110
-[nervous giggle]

178
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:23,077
-What if something terrible
had happened to the princess?

179
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,277
-Please forgive us, sir.

180
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,177
RURICHIYO: Thanks to me,
my archery tutor and maid

181
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,177
were reprimanded, and
the boar was hunted down.

182
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,010
And because I left
the grounds unseen,

183
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,910
the gatekeeper was
relieved of his duties.

184
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:39,443
I never noticed when I was a
little girl, but thinking back,

185
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:43,743
so many people must have been
punished because of my actions.

186
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:46,514
If I had known about
that at the time,

187
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:50,281
I promise I would
have behaved myself.

188
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:52,681
But no one told me.

189
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:55,714
Is that not mortifying?

190
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:59,514
-Watching innocent people
taking the blame-- that's rough.

191
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:02,214
-For as long as I can
remember, Kenryu and Enryu

192
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:04,781
have always covered
up my mistakes for me.

193
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:07,081
-And so, though a
flower may bloom,

194
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:11,014
we learn that it must also
someday wilt and fall to earth.

195
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:11,681
Next page.

196
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:23,481
[laughs] Amazing!

197
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:25,814
Such skill.

198
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,781
Huh?

199
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:30,314
[chirping]

200
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:01,681
-[gasp]

201
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:13,214
-Oh, Kenryu, I want
that entire store!

202
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,414
-That's impossible.

203
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:15,414
-Aw.

204
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:16,881
Buy it for me!

205
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:17,447
Buy it!

206
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,514
Buy it for me!

207
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:20,281
I want it, so you
have to get it for me.

208
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:21,347
Whatever I want, you get.

209
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:23,114
Now buy the whole store!

210
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:24,347
-Oh, what are you doing here?

211
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:25,081
-Uh, nothing.

212
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:25,714
Nevermind.

213
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:26,581
Please excuse us.

214
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:35,981
-[giggling]

215
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:49,314
Hm?

216
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,314
Oh?

217
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:52,781
I found you, Enryu.

218
00:14:56,281 --> 00:15:00,214
[laughter]

219
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:05,414
-I am grateful for
all they have done.

220
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:06,481
But still.

221
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,981
-What is it?

222
00:15:09,014 --> 00:15:09,481
-Nothing.

223
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:22,514
-[gasp]

224
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,814
-We've got company.

225
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:25,081
-Do you think it's them?

226
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:37,081
--[laugh] I shall
now get my revenge,

227
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:38,881
substitute Soul Reaper.

228
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,377
-[gasp]

229
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,310
-What is the matter?

230
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:50,677
-Let's head back.

231
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,610
-Did something happen?

232
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:53,744
-It's not a big deal.

233
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:56,044
You just shouldn't
go off on your own.

234
00:15:56,077 --> 00:15:58,644
So if you got a tea party
or something planned,

235
00:15:58,677 --> 00:16:02,444
sorry, but you're
gonna have to cancel.

236
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:04,977
-Lady Rurichiyo.

237
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,177
-Kenryu?

238
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,244
-My lady, you must not
leave my side for a while.

239
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:09,482
Understand?

240
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,144
-It'll be fine.

241
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:15,877
All of us are right
here with you.

242
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:23,644
-I want the head of the
substitute Soul Reaper.

243
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:25,944
You three can deal
with his friends.

244
00:16:25,977 --> 00:16:30,077
--[laughs] Is he really selling
someone you need to sully

245
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,610
your hands over?

246
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:32,844
-Indeed.

247
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:35,544
Shouldn't you leave the
substitute Soul Reaper to us

248
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,477
and go after the princess?

249
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,744
-No.

250
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:41,877
He owes me for putting that
crack in Saiga's mirror

251
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,477
the last time I faced him.

252
00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:50,577
Besides, he has intense
spiritual pressure.

253
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,677
And frankly, it's something
only I can handle.

254
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,477
-Heh.

255
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,744
Well, whatever you say, boss.

256
00:16:57,777 --> 00:17:01,277
I'm sure the other ones will be
all the entertainment we need.

257
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,377
-Don't get too cocky, Genga.

258
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,477
-I hear you, brother.

259
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,144
Don't worry.

260
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:08,477
-[laughs]

261
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,977
-Hm?

262
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,544
Several of them are on the move.

263
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:15,910
They may be luring us in.

264
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:16,744
-Hm.

265
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:17,944
Interesting.

266
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:21,110
In that case, I say
let them lure us.

267
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:22,610
Genga, let's go.

268
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:26,310
-I'll be right behind you.

269
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:28,110
-We'll move too.

270
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:31,444
-[laughs]

271
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:32,777
-Rukia!

272
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,444
Uryu and Chad went on ahead.

273
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:36,077
-They're setting up an ambush?

274
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,444
-Yes.

275
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:39,344
But it looks like the enemy
has followed our lead and split

276
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:40,310
up as well.

277
00:17:40,344 --> 00:17:42,210
-They must be quite confident.

278
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:43,544
-Yeah.

279
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:45,777
And I bet they brought along
those swords with them, too.

280
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:56,010
-A barrier?

281
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:57,977
They thought they could
outsmart us with this?

282
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:07,677
[shout]

283
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,110
[gasping]

284
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:30,977
-Ah!

285
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,944
-Lady Rurichiyo.

286
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:35,877
-Well, there goes the barrier.

287
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,777
-Ichigo.

288
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,277
-Right.

289
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,110
-Hey, Rukia, You better
stay with these guys.

290
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:45,344
-Good thinking.

291
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:46,677
-Ichigo.

292
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,377
-Sorry, my lady, but I'm afraid
you cannot leave my side.

293
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,510
-Wait, but--

294
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:51,910
-No buts about it.

295
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:53,744
You're going to stay
right here with Kenryu.

296
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:54,677
That's that.

297
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,077
HANZA: There he is, the
substitute Soul Reaper.

298
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:16,677
You saved me the trouble
of hunting you down.

299
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,177
-Bastard.

300
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:20,477
-My lady!

301
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,177
-Ichigo!

302
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,077
-Don't come out here.

303
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,844
-Lady Rurichiyo, please.

304
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:26,310
RURICHIYO: Ah, Kenryu, let go!

305
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:26,877
KENRYU: No, my lady.

306
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,577
Hurry inside.

307
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,877
RURICHIYO: Unhand me!

308
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,744
-What's the deal, big guy?

309
00:19:30,777 --> 00:19:33,010
I was under the impression
you're here for Rurichiyo.

310
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:33,510
-Hmph.

311
00:19:36,744 --> 00:19:37,744
RUKIA: Ichigo!

312
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:38,577
-Stay back, Rukia.

313
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,310
This guy's mine.

314
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:43,710
I don't exactly get it,
but for some reason,

315
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:45,110
he's challenging me.

316
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:45,777
-Ichigo!

317
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,244
-You must stay put.

318
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:50,177
My lady, it is very
dangerous out there.

319
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,810
-Perhaps. but Kenryu, you
cannot guarantee I am any safer

320
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:53,977
in here.

321
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,544
-I know, Lady Rurichiyo.

322
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:59,310
But still, if something should
happen to Ichigo Kurosaki,

323
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:00,377
I fear that--

324
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,977
-I am their next target.

325
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,410
Is that it?

326
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:05,210
-Well, you might be.

327
00:20:05,244 --> 00:20:08,110
-In other words, these
are the so-called burglars

328
00:20:08,144 --> 00:20:10,977
that you've been protecting
me from all this time.

329
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,344
-They are.

330
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,277
I apologize, my lady.

331
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,677
-[whimper]

332
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,644
-Care to change venues?

333
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,144
-Why not?

334
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:22,910
ICHIGO: Follow me.

335
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,277
-Huh?

336
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,610
Ichigo.

337
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,344
And Uryu and Chad, too.

338
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:40,310
-Ichigo.

339
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:49,210
JINNAI: [laughs]

340
00:20:49,244 --> 00:20:50,177
RUKIA: Who's there?

341
00:20:58,077 --> 00:21:00,944
-Rurichiyo Kasumioji, I presume?

342
00:21:04,444 --> 00:21:05,910
-[whimper]

343
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:27,777
-[sniff] I see.

344
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,844
You're the substitute
Soul Reaper's friend.

345
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:34,510
I can smell it on you,
the stench of blood.

346
00:21:39,477 --> 00:21:41,444
[shouting]

347
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:03,544
-Here, I come, Ichigo Kurosaki!

348
00:22:03,577 --> 00:22:04,618
-Hakai!

349
00:22:16,742 --> 00:22:21,176
[theme music]

350
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,076
ICHIGO: Those guys really
got the jump on us, huh?

351
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,610
URYU: But don't worry I
steal and plenty of time

352
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:54,776
to change my Quincy outfit.

353
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,276
ICHIGO: Doesn't
look that different.

354
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,710
URYU: Oh, it's
different all right.

355
00:23:57,743 --> 00:23:58,543
Specifically--

356
00:23:58,576 --> 00:23:59,610
-Nah, it's gonna take too long.

357
00:23:59,643 --> 00:24:01,576
Forget it.
