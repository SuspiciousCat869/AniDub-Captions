[menacing growls]

2
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:58,682
Damn it!
I Gotta do this again?!

3
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,426
[big roar]

4
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,463
Huaaahh!

5
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:13,580
I don't get it!
Why didn't that work?

6
00:02:13,614 --> 00:02:16,753
I released it just like
Getsuga Tenshou, but it's
power isn't even close!

7
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:18,123
Unh!

8
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:19,292
That's it!

9
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:24,202
This thing doesn't have a
blade I was initiating
my attacks way too soon.

10
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:27,309
If I charge it with more
Spirit Energy than
I did with Getsuga...

11
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:31,317
All right, let's do this!

12
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:35,326
Kyaaa!

13
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:42,373
Raaagh!

14
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,318
[hurt]
Aaagh!

15
00:02:55,167 --> 00:03:00,478
He learned how to produce that
much destructive power in such
a short time. Impressive.

16
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,221
Your training this time will
take place in this fish tank!

17
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:07,727
Now, I permit you.

18
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:22,224
[Jackie]
Welcome.

19
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:26,733
[Ichigo]
Oh, so it's you.
Not giving me a
plushie this time, huh?

20
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,472
That's 'cuz we figure
that you've moved
past fighting them.

21
00:03:30,976 --> 00:03:34,316
I haven't introduced myself to
you Have I?

22
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:38,391
I'm Jackie Tristan.
You ready?

23
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:42,366
Ichigo Kurosaki.

24
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,370
I sure as hell am!

25
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:48,245
Nice. I like your determination.

26
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:51,920
"Dirty Boots"!

27
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:08,654
Not bad.

28
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:12,930
I didn't think
you'd be able to
dodge that attack.

29
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:14,701
I didn't think
I would either.

30
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:17,306
Is that a joke?

31
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:20,279
You tell me, what's
with that outfit?

32
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,851
I didn't know there was a
Fullbring you could wear.

33
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,857
Well there is.

34
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,797
My Fullbring is
why I'm dressed
like this.

35
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:30,835
Gotcha.

36
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:34,543
So, this "Dirty
Boots" of yours.
What's its ability?

37
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:38,384
You really think I'd tell you?

38
00:04:38,984 --> 00:04:40,588
Hey, just thought I'd ask.

39
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,660
Coulda helped to know.

40
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:46,401
Oh well. Guess I'll
hafta find out myself.

41
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:48,672
Here we go!

42
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:00,363
Hnh.

43
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:02,067
Hey, where you going?

44
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,041
We need you to stay here
and watch, so you can
undo your "Dollhouse"
when they're done.

45
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:07,345
No!

46
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:08,547
Huh?!

47
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:17,399
I wanna say something
that's been on my
mind lately.

48
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,069
Save it, Yukio.

49
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:23,411
Oh yeah? Well Riruka's
attitude stinks.

50
00:05:23,746 --> 00:05:26,117
Y'know, you really
didn't have to say that.

51
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:27,687
What do you think?

52
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,522
[Giriko]
Me?

53
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:32,096
Well.
I don't mind her, really.

54
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:37,106
Hmmh.

55
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:46,059
I just hate having to look at
Jackie's Fullbring outfit!

56
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,905
Hunh!

57
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,119
How 'bout this!?

58
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:03,863
[gasp]

59
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:07,169
Hmm.

60
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:15,153
[sloshing]

61
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:25,074
Do you think he'll
be able to complete
his training?

62
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:27,045
Hard to say.

63
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:30,752
Haaaaaa!

64
00:06:30,786 --> 00:06:31,754
Eyagh!

65
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,047
One.

66
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,187
Raaagh!

67
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:50,627
That's two.

68
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:53,133
And three.

69
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:59,145
[panting]

70
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,626
So what now?

71
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:09,166
Aren't you going to
try to attack me?

72
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:12,173
Then it's my turn.

73
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,804
Haaaaaa!

74
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:29,543
Yah!

75
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:36,658
For this entire session,
you've been repeating
the same pattern.

76
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,536
You dodge, then my
kicks get to you.

77
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,209
Your fighting
instincts are good,

78
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:47,514
but you're being
way too cautious.

79
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:52,591
Here's what I think
you're trying to do.

80
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:56,065
You're still attempting
to get the hang of
Fullbring as you fight.

81
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:57,802
[grunt]

82
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:00,741
Well that's fine and all,
but you better do it fast.

83
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:03,547
Because the dirt here is
starting to turn into mud.

84
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:06,186
You see this?

85
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:12,566
My "Dirty Boots" are
about to get dirtier.

86
00:08:16,073 --> 00:08:16,875
Hyah!

87
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:26,228
She's getting serious now.

88
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:27,965
Yeah.

89
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:31,839
Do you think
Mister Kurosaki
will survive?

90
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,111
All we can do is
hope for the best.

91
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:43,264
[spits]
Ptoo!

92
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,270
Her kick got a
lot stronger.

93
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:48,942
So do you get it now?

94
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:52,683
As the name "Dirty
Boots" suggests,

95
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:58,696
The dirtier my boots get,
be it with sand, dirt,
mud, blood, rust,

96
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,604
No matter what the
substance, the
stronger I become.

97
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:08,282
I'm not sure if you've
noticed this, but I've
been slowly building up
strength until just now.

98
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:15,031
But from here on,
they'll get stronger at
an even faster rate!

99
00:09:15,364 --> 00:09:16,066
[gasp]

100
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:17,235
Haaaa!

101
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,118
Haaa!

102
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:30,897
[Riruka]
[relieved sigh]

103
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:34,304
Hmpf.

104
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:36,776
The dirtier they get,
the stronger she becomes?

105
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,914
What's with that?!
That's stupid!

106
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:41,686
Ugh, getting dirty is
totally disgusting!

107
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,154
Hm?

108
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:53,244
I never want to
end up dirty.

109
00:09:54,146 --> 00:09:56,383
I'll always be the
clean and cute one.

110
00:09:57,787 --> 00:09:58,922
Even when I die.

111
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:02,095
Will you buy it
for me next time?!

112
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:05,069
Sure, anything for you
princess. [Chuckle]

113
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:06,671
Yay Daddy!

114
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,372
Damn you, Ichigo.

115
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,242
Have you forgotten
why you're here?

116
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:25,812
C'mon, fight me!!

117
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:30,388
Don't you understand
this yet?!

118
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,393
You're fighting
with a mortal body!

119
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:34,730
Right now, you are
not a Soul Reaper!

120
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:40,342
What is it? Have you lost your
sense of reality from fighting
too long as a Spiritual Entity?!

121
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:44,151
You are flesh and blood.
And you can die here!!

122
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:53,337
Do you have a clue what'll
happen if you continue to
take more of my attacks
with your current body?

123
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:57,278
Your life will be
over much sooner
than you'd like!

124
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:01,988
Is that all you know how to do?!

125
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:05,829
That technique of yours
has nothing but flaws!

126
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,901
It's useless
in real combat!

127
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,838
Haven't you
realized that yet?!

128
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:14,447
Since you don't get it,
I'll have to show you!!

129
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:17,720
Your technique's too
inconsistent to be effective!

130
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:23,733
Depending on the level of your
concentration, the number of
blades on your weapon varies
from three to six!

131
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:27,474
Right now you only have
four blades and that
number's decreasing!

132
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:30,481
My kick can destroy
four blades or less!

133
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:37,395
Plus! After three consecutive
shots, that's when...

134
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:44,009
"That's when I become most
vulnerable." Is that it?

135
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,481
[gasp] He did that on purpose?!

136
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:48,820
Where'd he go!?

137
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:53,195
A Bringer Light...?!

138
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:54,130
Heh!

139
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:57,805
[Jackie]
Yeegh!

140
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:05,354
Amazing!

141
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:08,193
The flickering of the Bringer
Light indicates for certain,

142
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,233
that Ichigo executed
a high-speed jump
using fullbring!

143
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:14,573
It's a sign that he's
beginning to master it.

144
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,346
Now I'm impressed.

145
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:22,089
You realized the flaw of
your newly acquired ability,

146
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,296
then you quickly used
that flaw completely
to your advantage.

147
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:28,436
So, who taught
you how to fight?

148
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:38,323
All I was taught
were the basics.

149
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,427
But the rest,

150
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:47,542
Well,Ilearned
thatasIfought.

151
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,991
I was a Soul Reaper
for a short time.

152
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:59,000
But as for experience,
let's just say, I've
got plenty.

153
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,508
Experience, eh?

154
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:07,886
His mind's been unconsciously
sharpened by all those
battle she's fought.

155
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:11,425
And now, since he's
been forced to fight
without his powers,

156
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:14,432
his uncanny battle instincts
have been reawakened.

157
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:20,578
Not bad, Ichigo Kurosaki.

158
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:24,554
Ready?

159
00:13:26,324 --> 00:13:26,925
Yeah!

160
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:31,534
Haaaa!

161
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:33,439
Huaaah!

162
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:49,539
[microwave alarm]

163
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:52,011
Hm? Oh hey.

164
00:13:53,514 --> 00:13:54,483
[grunt]

165
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:56,954
Thank you so much,
Mister Sado.

166
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:57,656
Sure.

167
00:13:58,591 --> 00:13:59,961
Where's Ichigo?

168
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:00,963
He's in
there.

169
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,435
I see.
That's perfect.

170
00:14:04,103 --> 00:14:04,545
Huh?

171
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:07,251
I wanted to ask
you something.

172
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:10,390
That guy you warned
me about earlier.

173
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,962
Shukuro Tsukishima.

174
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,368
I want to know what
his ability is.

175
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:17,439
Hmm.

176
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:23,585
[Kugo]
I see.

177
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,195
So Orihime Inoue
said that, huh?

178
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,712
I'm sure I got cut.
But then when I came to,

179
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:40,320
there wasn't any blood
or any kind of wound.

180
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,194
And both of the guys who were
there with me had disappeared.

181
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:51,076
And when I saw, that both you,
and Ichigo had showed up to
see if I was okay,

182
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:54,750
I don't know why,
but for a second there,

183
00:14:57,489 --> 00:14:59,293
I thought of that
person as a "friend".

184
00:14:59,693 --> 00:15:02,466
I don't understand
what I'm trying to
say either.

185
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:06,742
But I was overcome with
this feeling that this
stranger was my friend.

186
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:13,255
It's not like I mistook him for
someone else, I mean after all,
he attacked me.

187
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,600
But how should I put it?
It felt like when I
thought about the past.

188
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:25,548
It suddenly seemed like
I knew who he was,
it was weird.

189
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:29,656
Based on her story, I've
got my own thoughts about
Tsukishima's ability.

190
00:15:30,592 --> 00:15:32,329
And what are they?

191
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:36,605
It's mental, I think.
like mind games.

192
00:15:37,473 --> 00:15:41,715
Do you happen to recall if
his Fullbring had the power
to alter people's memories?

193
00:15:42,684 --> 00:15:43,452
Hmmf.

194
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,322
Please tell me what you know.

195
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,794
There's no point in
keeping secrets.

196
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:48,630
Yahh!

197
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:58,851
Haaaaa!

198
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,342
Huh.

199
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:13,548
[pleased]
Hm. That's
much better.

200
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:14,551
At this pace--

201
00:16:14,585 --> 00:16:15,453
Ah!

202
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:16,287
Ichigo!

203
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:17,357
Huh?

204
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:20,530
My Combat Pass!!

205
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,739
[pain]
Eyaagh!

206
00:16:24,772 --> 00:16:26,743
GAHHHH!

207
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:32,221
You don't want
to answer?

208
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:34,125
No, it's not that.

209
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,562
Hm?

210
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,466
I'm a bit puzzled.

211
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:39,603
You're "Puzzled"?

212
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:46,217
If Tsukishima had the
ability you just described,
I would've definitely told
you about it at the start.

213
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:53,599
The Fullbring ability
that Tsukishima uses is
called "Book of the End".

214
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:56,138
It is an extremely
deadly weapon.

215
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:59,412
A sword, that can cut
through anything.

216
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:01,582
But that is all.

217
00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:04,422
That sword possesses no
other unique abilities.

218
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,625
Huh??

219
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:08,631
Waaauugh!

220
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:11,670
[gasp]

221
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:16,848
[panting]

222
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:20,756
Don't just stand there with
that look! Let's continue this!

223
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:24,898
We're stopping!

224
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:28,506
Unh?! What're you talking
about?!We're not done!

225
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,746
Your Fullbring is
out of control!

226
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:34,251
I've never seen
anything like that!

227
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,293
We've pushed the pace of
your training too hard!

228
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:39,829
We have to
stop now.

229
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:42,802
It's all right,
Let's keep going!

230
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:47,813
Riruka! Undo "Dollhouse"
right now!

231
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,722
Agh!

232
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:49,758
[yanking]
Yaagh!

233
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,834
I said, let's keep going!

234
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:58,309
Don't worry, my Fullbring
isn't out of control!

235
00:17:58,309 --> 00:17:59,010
[gasp]

236
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,449
This is exactly how
I've always done it!

237
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,589
My Combat Pass is talking to me.

238
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,729
I gotta hurry and regain
my Soul Reaper powers.

239
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:14,676
You need to listen to me!
I'm telling you it's dangerous!

240
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,483
Do you need to be completely
destroyed to understand?!

241
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:20,756
Could it be that his
ability has changed?

242
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:22,627
That couldn't be it.

243
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:25,599
Fullbring powers don't
change with time.

244
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:29,408
Then what about
my ability?

245
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,345
It's gone through
several changes!

246
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:34,051
In this case,
you are mistaken.

247
00:18:34,886 --> 00:18:38,894
As for your particular
situation, in the early
stages you were unaware.

248
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:42,769
It took you some time
just to discover your
Fullbring's innate ability.

249
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:47,913
Keep in mind that we've lived
with our Fullbring powers many
more years than you have.

250
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:51,421
We're well beyond the
stage you've just passed.

251
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:53,893
Then what was it that
happened to Orihime?

252
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:56,564
That's why I said
that I'm puzzled.

253
00:18:56,597 --> 00:19:00,740
As far as I know, what
happened wasn't done by
Tsukishima's ability.

254
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:04,781
Hmmh.

255
00:19:08,824 --> 00:19:10,928
What about
Uryu Ishida?

256
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:15,037
He was attacked by
Tsukishima as well, right?

257
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,778
Does Ishida's memory
seem to be affected?

258
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:23,821
[straining]

259
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:25,926
[straining]

260
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:27,764
Fine.

261
00:19:33,776 --> 00:19:36,081
Great, look how
dirty they are now!

262
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:42,093
Now I'll crush you
like you want me to!

263
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:44,565
Heh.

264
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:48,406
Haaaaaa!

265
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:50,845
Raaaaaa!

266
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:57,592
We need to be sure.

267
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:03,905
If Uryu Ishida's memory is
affected too, that's something
else we have to worry about.

268
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,745
But if his memories
haven't been affected,

269
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,649
What, Kugo?
What are you thinking?

270
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:16,432
That means it
wasn't Tsukishima,

271
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,404
who stabbed Orihime Inoue.

272
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:20,140
Mh!

273
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:25,417
[Tsukushima]
You sure about that?

274
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:26,921
[gasps]

275
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,564
[gasp]

276
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,785
Well now. It's been
a long time, Ginjo, hasn't it?

277
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:43,923
Tsukishima!

278
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:48,900
So this is him.

279
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:53,176
So, how have you all been?

280
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,884
Kutsuzawa, hope you haven't
been drinking too much.

281
00:20:57,852 --> 00:21:01,627
Yukio. Looks like you're still
hooked on playing video games.

282
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:05,802
That's not good. You should try
reading more books instead.

283
00:21:07,873 --> 00:21:09,209
And Riruka's not here?

284
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:12,182
Tsukishima!
Why did you
come here!?

285
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:14,520
Hm.

286
00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:16,892
I don't see Jackie
around here, either.

287
00:21:17,894 --> 00:21:19,230
Don't ignore me!

288
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:21,936
They in there?

289
00:21:22,704 --> 00:21:23,506
[gasp]

290
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,545
No, don't do it!!

291
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:40,274
What is this?!

292
00:21:49,628 --> 00:21:50,496
[gasp]

293
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:54,003
Ichigo.

294
00:21:58,012 --> 00:21:59,514
Hmm.

295
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:48,911
[phone rings]

296
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:52,017
[Kugo]
Huh? That you, Riruka?!
Listen, Tsukishima just--

297
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:54,136
[Riruka] [over phone]
Hey! I bought too much
stuff to carry back.

298
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:55,471
Can you come pick
me up in your car?

299
00:23:55,504 --> 00:23:57,673
[Kugo]
I don't have a car!
Forget that, Tsukishima, just--

300
00:23:57,706 --> 00:23:59,608
[Riruka]
What?! God, you're
so useless! [click]

301
00:23:59,608 --> 00:24:01,510
[Kugo]
You're the one who's useless!
