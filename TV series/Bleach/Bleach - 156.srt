NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

3
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,978
who was kidnapped
by the Arrancars,

4
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,678
Ichigo, Chad, Uryu,
Rukia, and Renji

5
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:58,245
have all snuck into Hueco
Mundo, the realm of the Hollows.

6
00:01:58,278 --> 00:02:00,778
The journey to Aizen's
fortress has been hard fought,

7
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:03,145
as our heroes have struggled
against endless attacks

8
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:04,978
from the Arrancar forces.

9
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,011
Upon breaking into the
fortress, the group

10
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:10,511
split up and took five different
paths in search of Orihime.

11
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:13,011
Each path was guarded by
members or fallen members

12
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:14,811
of the Espada, and
our heroes found

13
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,611
themselves locked
in desperate battles

14
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:18,311
against deadly opponents.

15
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,578
-Whirl, Giralda!

16
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,411
Come on!

17
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:23,511
The time is finally here.

18
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:24,811
Let the great battle commence.

19
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,745
Now, at full strength, fight!

20
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:28,545
Fight, nino!

21
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:34,311
-All right then.

22
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:47,445
-That wasn't even good enough
to be a warm up exercise.

23
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:56,845
-Hado number 73!

24
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:57,478
Soren Sokatsui!

25
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:05,178
-You blew your chance.

26
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:08,911
If you had the skills to hit
us directly with that Kido,

27
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:13,678
you might have easily
inflicted a serious injury.

28
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:18,278
-It was critically important
to me, and it proved my point.

29
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,145
I had to reassure myself that
you weren't actually Kaien.

30
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:26,078
Now that I know the truth,
I have no reservations

31
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:27,345
about this battle.

32
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:30,345
I can fight you without
holding back and destroy you.

33
00:03:41,778 --> 00:03:43,311
-It's the end game.

34
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:44,878
Allow me to demonstrate for you.

35
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:47,545
I'll show you what an Espada
sword release actually

36
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:49,045
looks like.

37
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:50,511
Devour her!

38
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:51,011
-Glotoneria!

39
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:10,078
-Damn it.

40
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:11,545
-Now watch this!

41
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:12,511
Spin around!

42
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,545
Aw, what's wrong?

43
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:26,345
You're not giving
up already, are you?

44
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:38,078
URYU (VOICEOVER):
I'm in trouble here.

45
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:45,878
-You can't keep that up forever.

46
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,145
You're just wasting your time.

47
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:56,045
-Damn.

48
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:16,111
-Oh hot dang.

49
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:18,645
I'm really in trouble now.

50
00:05:18,678 --> 00:05:20,178
PESCHE (VOICEOVER):
I should've known

51
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:23,945
it was a mistake to follow the
weakest looking of those five

52
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:24,945
intruders.

53
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:27,411
His opponent is so strong.

54
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:30,378
I don't think he has a chance.

55
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,211
What should I do?

56
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:35,545
There's no way he can survive
against this Arrancar.

57
00:05:35,578 --> 00:05:37,545
I guess I should save him.

58
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:38,545
Wait a minute.

59
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:40,711
I need to think
carefully about this.

60
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:42,378
What would I be able
to do out there?

61
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:44,578
Well, I can't let
him face her alone.

62
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,578
Maybe I can sneak up on
her before she sees me.

63
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:50,245
she's really hot
from this angle.

64
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:54,811
I can almost see her panties.

65
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,145
-Aw.

66
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:58,078
How does that feel,
Mr. Four-Eyes?

67
00:05:58,111 --> 00:05:59,545
Did you get a boo boo?

68
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:05,978
It appears to me you don't even
have the strength to respond.

69
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:10,111
It's time for the final-- Hm?

70
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:11,878
PESCHE (VOICEOVER):
I'm almost in position.

71
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,045
Just a little bit further.

72
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:22,045
-And who are you,
you little insect?

73
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:29,078
-Ow.

74
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:30,178
-Wait.

75
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:32,445
You're Pesche Gautiche,
if I remember correctly.

76
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:33,478
PESCHE (VOICEOVER): What?

77
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:35,445
Impossible.

78
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,978
I can't believe he
remembered my whole name.

79
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:39,945
He only head it once.

80
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:44,045
And-- And you're Uryu
Ushida, aren't you?

81
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:46,511
-Yeah, that's right.

82
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:48,945
PESCHE (VOICEOVER):
He's smiling at me.

83
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:52,478
Could it be?

84
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:54,145
You like me!

85
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:54,845
Don't you?

86
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:55,911
-What?

87
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:56,945
Where are you coming
up with this stuff?

88
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:58,011
I'm just trying
to get out of here

89
00:06:58,045 --> 00:06:59,478
without getting blown to bits!

90
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:01,478
-Will you both shut your mouths?

91
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:08,945
Ugh.

92
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:11,245
And what are you
supposed to be, goofball?

93
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:13,378
A big termite.

94
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:14,345
-How dare you?

95
00:07:14,378 --> 00:07:15,745
That is insulting.

96
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:18,645
At the very least, refer
to me as a stag beetle.

97
00:07:18,678 --> 00:07:20,178
-They're not really
that different.

98
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:22,545
-Termites are little, white
bugs who hide from the light.

99
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:24,678
Stag beetles are
shiny, black, and cool.

100
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,378
-Excuse me.

101
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,678
You're wearing white.

102
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:27,878
-Who are you to talk?

103
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:29,745
You're wearing more
white than I am.

104
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:32,011
You'd never make it
as a stag beetle.

105
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:33,911
-Hey, why are you
comparing me to an insect?

106
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,411
It doesn't matter
what color I wear.

107
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:36,478
I'm proud of your whites.

108
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:38,245
-You gotta be kidding.

109
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:40,245
You're proud of your whites?

110
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:44,745
You sound like some kind
of detergent commercial.

111
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,278
-Are you making fun of me?

112
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:48,711
-I told you both to
shut your mouths!

113
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:00,511
Ha.

114
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:02,245
Well, well, isn't that sweet?

115
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:05,611
you're friends
with that termite.

116
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:06,911
-You're way off base.

117
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:07,945
He's a Hollow.

118
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:09,478
He's no friend of mine.

119
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:11,378
-How can you be so cruel?

120
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:13,945
Just when we were starting
to get to know each other.

121
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:15,078
-Be quiet.

122
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:15,811
-A lover's spat?

123
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:20,345
-How could you
treat me like this?

124
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:21,678
You remembered my name?

125
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,478
-Are you stupid.

126
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:25,178
I said I wasn't
your friend in order

127
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:26,778
to keep her from attacking you.

128
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,645
I was trying to save your life.

129
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:30,078
-I appreciate your kindness.

130
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,178
It almost worked.

131
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,911
-It would've worked
if you would shut up!

132
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,345
I don't even
understand why you're

133
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:36,278
following me in the first place.

134
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:38,211
Ichigo told you all to go home.

135
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:39,811
-I'm glad you brought that up.

136
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,178
You've touched on a very
important point, Uryu.

137
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:44,511
-You're getting
pretty chummy, pal.

138
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:46,778
-The fact is, I'm
actually looking for Nel.

139
00:08:46,811 --> 00:08:49,778
After you guys ran away,
she went chasing after you,

140
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:52,078
screaming for that guy Ichigo.

141
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,378
I took off in the direction
I thought she had gone,

142
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:57,211
but I can't find her
or this Ichigo person.

143
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,045
Wait!

144
00:08:58,078 --> 00:08:59,111
I've got it.

145
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:01,311
Could it be that you
are actually Ichigo?

146
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:03,278
-I'm Uryu, you nut job.

147
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:06,545
You even called me Uryu
just a few minutes ago.

148
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:08,578
-Ichigo is the spiky
haired Soul Reaper.

149
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,011
Don't you remember?

150
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:11,011
-Spiky hair?

151
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:12,411
But there were two of those.

152
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:13,645
Which one was he?

153
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,045
-He was the orange one.

154
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,745
If you had paid attention,
you'd know who is who.

155
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:19,545
-What are you two
babbling about?

156
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:21,511
-Now look what you've done.

157
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:24,078
Because I was dealing with
you, she's caught up to us.

158
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:30,045
-No.

159
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:32,745
Leave this lady to me, Uryu.

160
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:34,145
-What are you talking about?

161
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:35,545
You'll never defeat
her in battle.

162
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:38,278
You don't have the power.

163
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,545
-I-It'll be all
right, my friend.

164
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:43,145
You don't know this, but
I have a special ability.

165
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:43,811
-Oh, yeah?

166
00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:45,011
And what would that be?

167
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:46,811
-I can create a fluid
that makes anything

168
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:48,445
it touches incredibly slimy.

169
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:49,978
-That's completely useless.

170
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:51,045
-All right.

171
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:52,678
You two are starting
to get on my nerves!

172
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:53,511
-Stop, Pesche.

173
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:54,478
She'll destroy you.

174
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,811
-She'll never get the chance.

175
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:03,511
-Look out!

176
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:04,745
She's aiming right for you!

177
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:12,845
-What?

178
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,978
-He did it.

179
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:18,178
-Ha ha ha ha ha!

180
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,178
Did you see that?

181
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:21,311
Your weapon had no effect on me.

182
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:23,178
You're not so
powerful after all.

183
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:25,111
You're just a cranky Arrancar.

184
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:28,011
I didn't want to see
your panties, anyway.

185
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:28,845
-What?

186
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,445
You were peeking, weren't you?

187
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:31,178
-Uh, no.

188
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:32,378
Not exactly.

189
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:34,045
I mean, I might have seen
what color they were,

190
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:35,478
but I couldn't
make out the brand.

191
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:39,545
Hey, and you should wear pants
if you're gonna attack people.

192
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:40,611
Wait.

193
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:42,178
What are you looking
at me like that for?

194
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:45,078
I told you, even if I wanted
to, I didn't get a good look.

195
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,578
-Oh, yeah?

196
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:47,645
-Come on.

197
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:48,911
You at least know I'm
telling the truth.

198
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:50,645
You have to back me up here.

199
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:51,745
-No, I don't.

200
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:52,911
-Excuse me?

201
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,178
I can hear you, you know?

202
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:56,111
Do you think I'm
deaf, or something?

203
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:01,545
-Oh, that hurts!

204
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,878
Now I'm mad.

205
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,678
You obviously haven't
learned your lesson

206
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:05,678
from my special attack.

207
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:06,478
-You want a lesson?

208
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,445
Try this!

209
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:11,845
Ah!

210
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:12,811
Huh?

211
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:13,311
Ah!

212
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:19,178
You save d life, Uryu.

213
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,711
I thank you for that.

214
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:22,378
-I don't need the thanks.

215
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:23,978
Just stop provoking her.

216
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,178
-All right.

217
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:28,011
But I must repay you for
your kindness in saving me.

218
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:30,245
I won't provoke her anymore.

219
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,278
I'll just defeat her, and that
way you and I will be even.

220
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:36,545
-I can see this isn't
going to go well.

221
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:38,511
-So you're going to
defeat me, are you?

222
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:40,345
-I would have done
it before, but I

223
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:42,545
was showing you some mercy.

224
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:43,845
-Hey, thanks for that.

225
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:46,278
You going to be firing
that strange liquid again?

226
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:47,478
-Don't you weren't warned.

227
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,211
-Is that all you've got?

228
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:57,145
I have no intention of getting
near that stuff, so spit away,

229
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:57,778
termite boy.

230
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:02,978
-Huh?

231
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:05,011
Ah!

232
00:12:05,045 --> 00:12:06,145
Oh!

233
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:06,645
Ow!

234
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:11,211
[crash]

235
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:12,411
-All right!

236
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:15,011
I can produce an infinite
amount of this fluid.

237
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:17,411
You made a big mistake
in underestimating me.

238
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,411
-Is that even possible?

239
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:20,811
PESCHE: Ha ha ha.

240
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:24,778
I call this liquid
Infinite Slick.

241
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,145
-OK, it works, and the
name is pretty cool.

242
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:30,045
What could be more annoying?

243
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,778
You know, you should run away
while you have the chance.

244
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:33,445
-Why?

245
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:34,645
URYU: Isn't it obvious?

246
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:36,711
You caught her by
surprise this time,

247
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:40,678
but she won't fall
for that trick again.

248
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:42,811
-Rip, Golondrina!

249
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:12,145
From the way you've
been reacting,

250
00:13:12,178 --> 00:13:14,045
you don't take me
very seriously.

251
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,845
You're the first enemy I've
encountered in a while,

252
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:19,711
so I was going to
take my time with you.

253
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:21,478
-Huh?

254
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:23,745
-But now I've change my mind.

255
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:25,211
You've irritated me.

256
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:29,245
I, Cirucci Sanderwicci,
Arrancar number 105,

257
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,145
am going to crush you.

258
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,478
Now, let me see.

259
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:37,045
Which one of you shall
I slice up first?

260
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:57,227
Now, let me see.

261
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,093
Which one of you shall
I slice up first?

262
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:02,560
-Ah!

263
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,627
-Wah!

264
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:13,827
-Hah!

265
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,427
You can run pretty fast
there, can't you, four eyes?

266
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,427
-Ah!

267
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,327
She's like a lumberjack
with a chainsaw!

268
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:26,493
-Ha ha ha!

269
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:27,727
What's your hurry, boys?

270
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,993
I'm not finished yet.

271
00:14:32,593 --> 00:14:34,927
-I'm not gonna run away
from her like this all day.

272
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,393
-Well then, let's join forces
and take her on together.

273
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,727
Are you just gonna stand
there and ignore me?

274
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,427
It's humiliating!

275
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,260
-Enough already!

276
00:14:43,293 --> 00:14:44,893
I'll make this quick.

277
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,827
I'm going to cut the two of
you into tiny little pieces

278
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,227
and feed you to your friends.

279
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,227
-She is one sick puppy.

280
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,560
You just figured that out?

281
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:53,560
-Good.

282
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,927
At least you're paying
attention to me.

283
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,827
Hey, wait!

284
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,693
-Hah!

285
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,560
Not so fast, four eyes.

286
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:00,127
Haven't started carving yet.

287
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:11,560
-I see.

288
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:13,860
Those wings are shielding
her from my attacks.

289
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:16,827
That explains the reverberation
I've been hearing.

290
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,293
Those feathers are all
vibrating at very high speeds.

291
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,393
-That weapon won't
work on me, you fool!

292
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,393
Get the picture?

293
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,093
Quit hiding, four eyes.

294
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:34,860
I've got something for you.

295
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:35,360
Hm?

296
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:41,693
I told you that
weapon won't work.

297
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:44,193
PESCHE: Hey, Uryu?

298
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:46,427
Just wanted to remind
you I'm still here!

299
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,060
-That's great.

300
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:48,127
But why?

301
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,727
I thought I told
you to run away.

302
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,860
-I think you've been
trying to protect me why.

303
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:53,493
Else would you keep
attacking this woman

304
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:54,760
even though it's hopeless?

305
00:15:54,793 --> 00:15:56,860
-Well, it won't be hopeless
if you stay out of my way.

306
00:15:56,893 --> 00:16:00,060
Now, get lost.

307
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,793
-Stop there, Cirucci.

308
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,660
-Huh?

309
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:06,093
-There's a saying that he
who chases after two hairs

310
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:07,227
catches neither.

311
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,127
You should quit chasing
after my friend here,

312
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,727
and focus your attention
on me, instead.

313
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,560
-You're an idiot!

314
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:15,560
-Fine, mean whatever you say.

315
00:16:15,593 --> 00:16:17,760
-Didn't she even want to
think about it for a minute?

316
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,260
Wait.

317
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:24,527
Why are you in the
line of fire, Uryu?

318
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,993
I'm trying to protect you,
in case you didn't notice.

319
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,327
-Try and follow what
I'm saying to you.

320
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,960
I don't want your protection.

321
00:16:30,993 --> 00:16:33,160
-The tone of your voice
tells me you don't mean that,

322
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,393
so I'll fight alongside you.

323
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,727
-Argh.

324
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,593
-If you morons have
finally got this settled,

325
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:40,193
I will now slice you
both into pieces!

326
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:50,027
-I have to do something
about those feathers.

327
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,393
-Do we have any strategy
in mind besides running?

328
00:16:53,427 --> 00:16:55,260
-Actually-- Pesche!

329
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:57,993
Get ready to use your
Infinite Slick again!

330
00:16:58,027 --> 00:16:59,460
-My infinite what?

331
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:00,827
What are you talking about?

332
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,393
-Infinite Slick, you idiot!

333
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:04,493
That's the weird
fluid from before.

334
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:06,527
That's the name you
gave it, remember?

335
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,560
-I have a lot of names in
my head, like Joe, or Sam.

336
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,127
You expect me to
remember 'em all?

337
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,560
-Just make some of it now,
or I'll make you make some!

338
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:15,460
-Heh, heh, heh.

339
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,560
Well, that proves my theory.

340
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:19,327
You're helpless without me.

341
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:19,960
OK.

342
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:20,693
Here we go.

343
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,627
Unfortunately, it
appears I'm all out.

344
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,627
-What do you mean?

345
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,793
Didn't you call
it Infinite Slick

346
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:34,360
because it would never run out?

347
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:36,027
-I may have exaggerated.

348
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,093
-You lied!

349
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:39,093
-Well, I wouldn't
exactly call it a lie.

350
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:40,727
I just wanted to
give the impression

351
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,093
that I could make endless
amounts of it if I needed to.

352
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:44,560
-You were lying!

353
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:45,460
-Yeah.

354
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:45,993
I lied.

355
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:46,827
Sorry.

356
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,960
URYU: Why would you lie to me?

357
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:49,627
PESCHE: You were
putting pressure on me,

358
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,393
and frankly, it
sounded a lot cooler!

359
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:53,427
URYU: How cool is it going
to be when we're dead?

360
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,727
-That's not fair!

361
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,593
Sometimes you make stuff up
just to go with the flow!

362
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:59,760
-The only thing that's going to
be flowing here is our blood!

363
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:02,160
-Ah-- wah!

364
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:03,927
-That's just great!

365
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,660
Now I've seen it all.

366
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:08,627
You've gone and attacked
yourself with your own weapon!

367
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,660
-Nice move.

368
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:11,593
Allow me to finish
what you've started.

369
00:18:11,627 --> 00:18:13,493
[shout]

370
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:20,793
[laughter]

371
00:18:20,827 --> 00:18:22,560
URYU: You should check
your name, Cirucci.

372
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:28,960
-Mm.

373
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:30,460
I know about that move.

374
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:32,827
It's called a Flash
Step, isn't it?

375
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,860
-Nice guess.

376
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,860
But mine is called Hirenkyaku.

377
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:38,827
-Ah.

378
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,960
Hirenkyaku, huh?

379
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:42,860
Interesting.

380
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:43,893
All right.

381
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:46,193
Let's see if I can
tell the difference.

382
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:48,427
[whimpering]

383
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:54,193
-He got away again.

384
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:55,460
Ha.

385
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:58,727
So, you seem to be pretty
good at running for cover.

386
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,793
But how long do you think
you can keep that up

387
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:02,327
while carrying that dead weight?

388
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,360
PESCHE (VOICEOVER): She may
be a nasty piece of work,

389
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:08,760
but she's telling the truth.

390
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:10,493
As long as Uryu
has me on his back,

391
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:13,693
he won't be able to attack her.

392
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:17,693
[laughter]

393
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:24,593
PESCHE (VOICEOVER): She's
becoming more accurate.

394
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:26,227
We can't keep on like this.

395
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,627
Oh, I think I'm a
burden to you, Uryu!

396
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,160
I can't let you lose the battle!

397
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:33,227
Use me as a shield
to create an opening!

398
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,593
Goodbye!

399
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:37,493
Go on, leave my corpse behind!

400
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:42,227
[crying]

401
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:42,893
-Now what?

402
00:19:42,927 --> 00:19:44,427
Why are you crying?

403
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,493
-Huh?

404
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:47,860
-You are the biggest
freak I've ever met.

405
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:49,193
-Shut up, you big bully.

406
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:51,660
I just got carried away with
the beauty of my sacrifice.

407
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:52,160
-Pesche.

408
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,260
-Yes?

409
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,993
-This may hurt you a
bit, but you'll be OK.

410
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,227
-What?

411
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,560
You're not actually planning
to use me as a shield

412
00:19:57,593 --> 00:20:00,927
and leave my corpse
behind, are you?

413
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,827
Wah!

414
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,327
Whoa!

415
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:08,460
Ah!

416
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:10,027
Whose side are you on?

417
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,327
Wah!

418
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,760
-Sorry about that, Pesche.

419
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:16,260
I had no choice.

420
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,860
Now I can concentrate
on winning this fight.

421
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:20,160
-Say goodnight, four eyes!

422
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:32,793
URYU (VOICEOVER): I see.

423
00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:35,593
The blades continue to
vibrate even after they've

424
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:37,060
separated from her body.

425
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,993
The blades easily reload
onto the frame of the wing.

426
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:49,993
As long as those
wings are operative,

427
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:52,493
I have no opening to
attack at close range.

428
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:58,660
It's apparent that my long
distance attacks will always

429
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:01,893
be deflected by her feathers
before they can impact.

430
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,893
-All right!

431
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:06,293
Let's see you get
away from this!

432
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:07,760
URYU (VOICEOVER):
I have no choice.

433
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:28,127
[gasp]

434
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,693
-What the hell?

435
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:36,660
What is that?

436
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,193
-It's too bad.

437
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:55,527
I was really hoping to
hold off on using this

438
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,127
until much later in the battle.

439
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,993
So, shall we continue?

440
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:26,502
[theme music]

441
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:48,352
PESCHE: Prepare
yourself, Cirucci!

442
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,152
We're about to unleash
our special combined

443
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:52,518
attack of friendship,
Infinite Pesche Quincy!

444
00:23:52,552 --> 00:23:53,618
CIRUCCI: Bring it on!

445
00:23:53,652 --> 00:23:55,418
I'll repel it with my
vibrating feathers!

446
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:57,118
URYU: Sorry to put
a damper on things,

447
00:23:57,152 --> 00:23:59,818
but not only is he not
going to fight you,

448
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:03,352
his attack technique
doesn't even exist.
