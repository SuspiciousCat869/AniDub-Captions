1
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,559
What's wrong?

2
00:01:57,592 --> 00:02:00,361
From this distance you
won't be able to cut me.

3
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:02,363
The fact that you're
waiting where you are,

4
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:04,432
means you understand
coming any closer would

5
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:06,568
put you well within
my range.

6
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:13,341
I must formulate
another plan...

7
00:02:13,374 --> 00:02:20,181
Did that move seem
meaningful to you?

8
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:22,450
How about this?

9
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:25,553
I don't believe I should
view either of them

10
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:28,756
as meaningless acts while
in this situation...

11
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:32,527
Oh...?

12
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,734
Scatter Senbonzakura!

13
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:46,774
(painful groans)

14
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:50,778
You don't have brains but
you've sure got a lot of guts!

15
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:55,950
Wait! We're not done! I
haven't lost this battle yet!

16
00:02:56,184 --> 00:03:02,657
Don't be stupid. Isn't it pointless
for you to die fighting like this?

17
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,927
But it's not pointless!

18
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,232
Right here and now! I'm read to
sacrifice my life for Mr. Tsukishima!

19
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:16,971
Are you serious? You think this Tsukishima
guy is really worth risking your life for?

20
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:19,941
What?! Uh, of course!
Mister Tsukishima's super

21
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:22,944
strong and smart, and I
would gladly die for him!

22
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,246
That's not what I
meant....

23
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,515
I want to know if
you really think

24
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:30,518
Tsukishima would give
up his life for yours.

25
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:34,756
Why the hell would someone like you care
what I think? Maybe he wouldn't die for me,

26
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,958
but I'd die for him
at any time!

27
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:41,195
Damn idiot! If you're risking
it all, he should do the same!

28
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:44,866
Boss, comrade, subordinate, it doesn't
matter! You should only die for

29
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:47,235
someone who'd do
the same for you!

30
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:51,372
Throwing your life away without thinking
is only something a kid would do!

31
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:57,445
Now I'll ask you again. If you died here
right now, do you honestly believe your

32
00:03:57,478 --> 00:04:04,919
buddy Mister Tsukishima would
risk his life to avenge you?

33
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,423
Aren't you going to share
this with Shishigawara?

34
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,391
It's not nice of
you to leave him out.

35
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:14,629
The truth is, I thought it would
be risky to increase his power.

36
00:04:14,662 --> 00:04:20,902
When this fight's finally over.
I want you to kill him.

37
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:22,236
(sigh)

38
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:28,276
That's too bad, I thought he
had an interesting ability.

39
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:33,681
If you still feel like you're
willing to die for him, attack me.

40
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:39,487
I'm gonna make this quick
and painless. That

41
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,293
way you won't have the
time for any regrets.

42
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,663
You do understand,
don't you?

43
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:55,436
You can't cut me like you did with
the others, or even get close to me.

44
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:03,311
You're wrong, as
you'll see...

45
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,279
And what was
that?

46
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:09,484
Just a trap I set.

47
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,885
When did you set it?

48
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:13,221
A long time ago...

49
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:16,791
I take it that means you have
visited this dimension before?

50
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:20,395
I know you're aware of the
powers that I have...

51
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:22,563
But allow me to
explain...

52
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:28,369
My Fullbring "Book of the End", inserts
my existence into my target's past.

53
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,938
When I cut the ground
earlier, that allowed

54
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:33,775
me to make it so that
I've been here before.

55
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:38,946
So this ability of yours works on
people as well as inanimate objects...

56
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:52,493
Perhaps a first hand demonstration
might help you understand...

57
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:55,496
I just inserted myself
into your Zanpakuto's

58
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:58,466
past. As a result, your
blade will never hit

59
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:00,268
me again...

60
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:06,808
By doing that, I've seen all of your sword
techniques so many times I'm bored by them.

61
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:12,880
Huh?

62
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,818
That moment of hesitation
sealed your fate...

63
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:19,487
You paused, and in that
second you briefly

64
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:22,223
wondered if I could
possibly know about your

65
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:25,293
Senbonzakura's safe
zone, didn't you?

66
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:29,630
In order to protect its user, your swords
unique attack method demanded that a

67
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:32,366
special characteristic
be built into it...

68
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,971
A safety feature so that there's an
area where the blades can never enter.

69
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:42,343
This area I'm alluding to encompasses
an 85-centimeter radius from its user.

70
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:45,346
Once you're centered
inside that zone, you

71
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:48,516
cannot be injured. A
"safe zone," as you came

72
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:50,485
to call it.

73
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:55,823
That safe zone even exists in its Bankai,
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi. With its tremendous

74
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:58,559
offensive force and its
impenetrable defensive

75
00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:00,661
capabilities, that
small empty space

76
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:04,765
is the only known weakness
that your weaponry possesses.

77
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:07,401
So when someone's
fighting against your

78
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:10,538
Senbonzakura, one must get
in close, not retreat.

79
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:12,707
But very few could
ever reach such a

80
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,476
conclusion on their own.
Not knowing about it

81
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,648
makes the idea of charging in to battle
you, a suicidal move. How wise you've only

82
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:23,885
shared this with some of
your closest relatives.

83
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,288
It's strange to hear you
say that Senbonzakura has

84
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,291
a weakness. And you say
you found it by facing

85
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:36,430
it countless times.
Hmph...

86
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:40,401
So tell me, who did you hear
the term "safe zone" from?

87
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:43,371
From you...

88
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:46,774
Have you already forgotten what's
happened here? Look at yourself!

89
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:51,612
I cut you just now!

90
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:54,549
I'd say your future looks
rather bleak, Byakuya.

91
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:57,185
After all, none of the
defensive or attack

92
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:02,323
techniques you've developed will work on
me. Because as things now exist, I was the

93
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,593
one who actually helped you
develop those techniques.

94
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:11,732
So that means that Senkei, and
Gokei won't work on you then.

95
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:21,742
Not even Hakuteiken
will work.

96
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:29,817
Not even Hakuteiken
will work.

97
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,621
I can't slash it!

98
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:36,891
Well, whatever kind of animal
this thing's supposed to be...

99
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:41,495
...I can't hurt something this cute!
I just can't do it!

100
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:50,705
Huh?

101
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:54,675
That's odd. I thought you said that
you couldn't hurt cute things.

102
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,246
Come on! Since when are big
pink armoires considered cute?!

103
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,482
Heh! Guess we have different
ideas about what's cute!

104
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:04,952
I should've filled that giant stuffed
animal with a bunch of rocks!

105
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:08,222
I see you finally came
out of hiding, huh?

106
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:12,193
Are you excited that you finally
get your chance to kill me?

107
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:17,465
A Soul Reaper's duty is to protect humans.
And I don't intend to kill you.

108
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:19,767
Hah! That's not even what I meant!
You don't

109
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,836
even know how to read
between the lines

110
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:25,606
or even get what I'm saying, do you?!
I think

111
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,743
you're so full of yourself!
Enjoy this!

112
00:09:28,743 --> 00:09:41,522
Oh, sure. Dodge it like its
nothing you cocky bitch!

113
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:47,361
Dance!
Sodenoshirayuki!

114
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:51,198
It doesn't matter how much you increase
your weapon's power, try what you will.

115
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:52,733
You can't win here.

116
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:54,702
Give up. Let's end this.
You can think of

117
00:09:54,702 --> 00:09:56,771
whatever you want of me.
But I'm telling you,

118
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:00,541
I have no intentions of killing
an ordinary human like you.

119
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:04,211
I'm a Fullbringer! Not
an ordinary human!

120
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:10,351
Addiction shot!

121
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:12,186
Huh? What is
this thing?

122
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:14,255
Rukia Kuchiki!

123
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:15,956
I hereby permit you!

124
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:26,200
Huh?!

125
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:37,878
Huh?!

126
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:42,216
Hmm...

127
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:47,221
What? How did I become
a stuffed animal?

128
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:50,524
Oh look, cute! But you
can't hold your Zanpakuto

129
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,294
looking like that,
can you Soul Reaper?

130
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:57,598
(chuckling)

131
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:00,768
Hey!

132
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:03,337
Hey come back here,
tiny devil!

133
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,573
Who are you calling tiny devil?
This stuffed

134
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:07,641
animal is a rabbit!
At least call me tiny

135
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,243
bunny instead!

136
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:12,580
That stuffed animal you're stuck in isn't
a rabbit, look at the tail, stupid!

137
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:14,348
It's a pink devil!

138
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:15,950
Don't you think you're
kinda pathetic for not

139
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,685
being able to chase
down a stuffed animal?

140
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,922
I mean really!

141
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:29,663
Huh?!

142
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:34,802
Wait a second! Was I just able to do Flash
Step? Well how 'bout that! I'm trapped

143
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:38,806
inside this stuffed plushie.
But, I'm still me!

144
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,510
And I haven't lost any
of my Spirit Energy!

145
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:43,210
Huh?!

146
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,545
Hado Number
Thirty-Three!

147
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,312
(gasp)

148
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:49,450
Sokatsui!

149
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:51,519
Uhh...

150
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,755
Uh-oh...

151
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:59,360
It exploded...
Inside the plushie...

152
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,333
Well, I'm not exactly sure what just
happened. But that sure was dumb!

153
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:10,604
You don't mind if we finish this, do you?
Now I guess you finally understand that

154
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:14,208
Fullbringers like me aren't anything
like ordinary humans, right?

155
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:18,813
Well, I have noticed that you're really
desperate to prove to people that you're

156
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:22,750
different from
ordinary humans.

157
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,289
Tell me this, is not being normal
really that important to you?

158
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:29,924
Of course it is.

159
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,727
We were able to meet Tsukishima
because we weren't normal.

160
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:36,897
Ginjo saved us because
we weren't normal.

161
00:12:36,897 --> 00:12:39,233
When most people are
asked what rule every

162
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,569
animal and human in this
world has to follow to

163
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:44,305
keep living, I'd bet
they say it's "survival

164
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,774
of the fittest". Everyone
for themselves...

165
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,243
Even in nature, there
are clear differences

166
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:51,645
between the strong and the weak.
But it's not

167
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,181
as simple as kill or be killed.
I'm sure you

168
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:56,350
think you know what
true survival of the

169
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,487
fittest is,
don't you?

170
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:05,659
Well it's not always that clear. My story
might just change how you think of things.

171
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:10,397
The story of us Fullbringers, shows how
survival of the fittest can end up

172
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:13,055
working in the
real world.

173
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,195
Riruka, let go!

174
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:26,098
No it's mine, Gina!
Why don't you let go!

175
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:31,703
Are you stupid? C'mon!
Don't be like that! Ow!

176
00:13:31,737 --> 00:13:35,107
Hmph!

177
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,746
Mommy! Riruka took my doll
and she hit me! Mommy!

178
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,081
Hmph!

179
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:45,617
When I was around five
years old, I found out

180
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,186
that I was born with
a special ability, a

181
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,492
power that no one
else had...

182
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:58,163
By the time I was six, I felt
like I was invincible...

183
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:02,100
When I was seven, I met a guy
who became my first crush.

184
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:05,737
He was a teenager who moved into our
neighborhood. He cursed a lot when he

185
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:10,242
talked, but he had a good heart. Whenever
he would see someone in trouble, he would

186
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:13,044
run over and
help them.

187
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:20,318
So without even thinking, I took him
and hid him away in my treasure box.

188
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:24,489
Everyday, I'd run home and we'd eat
together and I'd bring him candy.

189
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:30,629
I was thrilled because I thought he'd want
to stay with me and be mine forever...

190
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:35,467
But as it turned out,
that was not the case...

191
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:38,437
You see, the longer I
kept him in my treasure

192
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,039
box, the more and
more sad, desperate

193
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,341
and afraid of me
he became.

194
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:49,381
Eventually, I just couldn't stand to see
the sad way he looked at me anymore...

195
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:54,519
So I let him go. I didn't stop to think
what the consequences would be if he told

196
00:14:54,553 --> 00:15:06,431
anyone about my
power...

197
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:11,369
The phrase "Survival of the Fittest" is a
huge lie. It allows the weak to believe

198
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:14,473
that if they work hard enough
they will stop being the hunted.

199
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:16,808
But they don't get killed
because they're weak.

200
00:15:16,808 --> 00:15:19,377
They get killed because
they are in the minority.

201
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:24,416
Skills alone don't matter, because it's
always the loud, incompetent majority

202
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:28,420
who become the predators. You and
everyone else know this to be the truth,

203
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:30,489
but you choose to
ignore it.

204
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:37,562
When we were separate, each of
us was prey for the hunters...

205
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:41,066
One of us couldn't find any
value in her power, because she

206
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:47,439
wasn't able to
protect her family...

207
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:56,381
Another had parents who neglected him,
so his heart and powers became twisted.

208
00:15:56,414 --> 00:16:04,689
One of us even believed his power
made him the voice of God!

209
00:16:04,723 --> 00:16:08,193
And finally, one of us
ended up all alone,

210
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:11,630
because she chose to use
her power foolishly.

211
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:16,635
So you can imagine the hope we felt
when Ginjo came to us and said...

212
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:22,340
Why die quietly because you're the
minority? Take back you lives now!

213
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:27,178
In the past, whether it was royalty or
noble warriors, it was always the elite

214
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:29,681
minority who ruled!

215
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:41,259
You haven't done anything wrong. It's
just that this world rewards its morons.

216
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:49,501
Let's change all that. It's
time for us to become hunters!

217
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:53,071
So we joined him...

218
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:59,144
(gasp)

219
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:05,350
Somenomai Tsukishiro!

220
00:17:05,383 --> 00:17:07,319
Damn it!

221
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:12,357
I'll be honest. I sympathize with the
tragedy your people have experienced.

222
00:17:12,357 --> 00:17:16,761
However, I can't use that as an
excuse to abandon my friends!

223
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:20,198
Oh, your friends?! It's only the
majority that matters to you!

224
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:23,501
Just calm down and listen to me.
If I use Tsukishiro

225
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,538
one more time, your entire
body will be frozen.

226
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:31,443
You really think you
can take me down?!

227
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:33,244
Ah-Choo!

228
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:35,747
(disgusted grunt)

229
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:40,352
What the hell? How'd I get
out of that plushie?!

230
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:47,092
Ah!

231
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:50,328
I'm sorry, really. I
didn't want to use this

232
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:53,598
to end our fight, but
you left me no choice.

233
00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:58,470
Damn!

234
00:17:58,503 --> 00:18:08,513
She's gone...
Where'd she go?

235
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:14,552
She's gone...
Where'd she go?

236
00:18:14,586 --> 00:18:19,758
Your blade broke. That was wise of you,
disengaging your Shikai once you know I'd

237
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:22,193
discovered your
safe zone.

238
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:26,464
And your sword skills have really improved
since the last time we crossed blades.

239
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:32,437
But now that it's broken, you will
have to fight using Shikai again...

240
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:39,611
What's wrong? Are you unable to
use Shikai with a broken sword?

241
00:18:39,644 --> 00:18:47,252
Bankai...

242
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:51,723
Senbonzakura
Kageyoshi...

243
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:56,428
You're going straight into Bankai?
Too bad...

244
00:18:56,461 --> 00:19:05,236
Whether you're in Shikai or in Bankai, once
I'm in your safe zone. You're powerless!

245
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,338
There are blades
in the safe zone?!

246
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:14,179
You have revealed your
weakness too soon.

247
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:16,081
My weakness?!

248
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:20,785
The fact that you've figured out my safe
zone, means I can anticipate exactly

249
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:22,754
where you'll be
attacking me from...

250
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:27,559
If I set up my blades to be within
the safe zone, they can cut you.

251
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:32,197
I'm perplexed. I don't recall
you doing this in training.

252
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:36,201
Weren't you just saying the things
I've trained to do won't work on you?

253
00:19:36,234 --> 00:19:39,104
I get it. You're
that desperate.

254
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:49,347
Trying to attack me in this
manner is a ludicrous strategy!

255
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,085
You can manipulate Senbonzakura Kageyoshi
twice as fast as usual if you control

256
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,154
it with your
hands, right?

257
00:19:56,187 --> 00:20:00,091
It feels as if it's moving
even faster than that.

258
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,061
But you do realize what
that means, don't you?

259
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:06,731
The more you insist on speeding things
up, the narrower the safe zone that

260
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:16,775
protects you becomes.
It's a suicidal maneuver.

261
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:22,247
protects you becomes.
It's a suicidal maneuver.

262
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,184
See what happens when you lose even the
slightest control of your movement?

263
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:28,253
Your safe zone leaves
you an unforgivably

264
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:30,455
short response time, in
terms of dodging your

265
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:32,090
own blades.

266
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:36,094
So in making the ill advised decision to
narrow your safe zone and increase the

267
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:40,498
speed of your blades, you've given me the
chance to disrupt your timing and leave you

268
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:44,702
virtually no possibility of
surviving this unscathed.

269
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:47,806
All right then. Have I
made it clear enough?

270
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:55,046
No matter what you do it's a
fact, you can never defeat me.

271
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:02,353
You're using Kido now? Before you even
try that, I'll tell you something...

272
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:07,392
I know how to neutralize and counteract
every one of the Kido techniques

273
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:08,693
you possess...

274
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:12,197
But if you feel you
must, then go ahead...

275
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:22,240
Try one on me.

276
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:31,349
Try one on me.

277
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:34,152
How, did you...?

278
00:21:34,185 --> 00:21:38,723
Oh, I see. You grabbed your
own blades on purpose.

279
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:44,062
I never thought... You would
fight me that way...Remarkable.

280
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:49,167
I used to believe that battle was something
you trained for constantly, and went

281
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,402
into fully prepared.

282
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,806
But today, our battle
was quite different...

283
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,210
For the first time, I experienced the
ecstasy of being in that moment,

284
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:04,215
between life and death. Thank you,
I've thoroughly enjoyed this battle.

285
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:46,170
If what is hidden inside
your Combat Pass turns

286
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,973
out to be nothing more
than a horrible truth...

287
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:52,210
Then as your friend, I
will cover your eyes, I

288
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:55,913
will cover your ears, to
prevent you from learning

289
00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:57,915
what that truth is.
