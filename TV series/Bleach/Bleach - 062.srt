2
00:00:16,366 --> 00:01:35,233
[theme music]

3
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:51,647
-It's been quite a while since
the last time I saw your face.

4
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:54,314
What's brought about the
change of heart, Sajin?

5
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,847
Has something happened?

6
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:57,414
-Aizen.

7
00:01:57,447 --> 00:02:01,147
How dare you stand there
and smile like that, Aizen!

8
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:02,747
You betrayed everybody.

9
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:04,381
Every one of us!

10
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:06,114
You will not be forgiven.

11
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:08,747
Nor will you!

12
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:09,247
Kaname!

13
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:30,381
-I-- I beg your pardon.

14
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:33,181
I didn't think anyone was here.

15
00:02:33,214 --> 00:02:33,914
-Over here.

16
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:39,681
-That's odd.

17
00:02:39,714 --> 00:02:41,614
My apologies.

18
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:45,381
I wasn't able to
sense you over there.

19
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:47,114
I'm Kaname Tosen.

20
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:49,847
Pleased to meet you.

21
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:53,781
I have to say, you're extremely
good at making your presence.

22
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:55,514
You can see I'm blind,
but there was never

23
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:59,214
a time I couldn't sense
the presence of another.

24
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,914
Sajin?

25
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,814
Is that Sajin Komamura?

26
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:05,214
It's been quite a
while, hasn't it?

27
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:06,281
I see.

28
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:08,714
You joined the 13
court guard squads.

29
00:03:08,747 --> 00:03:10,447
Have you ever
considered becoming

30
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,847
a member of my squad, Sajin?

31
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,247
I have a great commander.

32
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:17,214
He'd appreciate you.

33
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,114
-You're Sajin Komamura?

34
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:20,447
Kaname has spoken of you.

35
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:24,614
It's a pleasure to meet you.

36
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:25,647
I'm Sosuke Aizen.

37
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:29,381
I'm the lieutenant of squad 5.

38
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:30,714
KANAME (OFFSCREEN): I'm curious.

39
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:33,547
Why was it that you
became a soul reaper?

40
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,814
SAJIN (OFFSCREEN): To
repay a debt of gratitude

41
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:37,947
toward the one
who saved my life.

42
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:39,381
-Sounds like you.

43
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:41,814
A debt of gratitude.

44
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,181
-And what about you, Kaname?

45
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:45,147
-Me?

46
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,147
Well, I--

47
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:05,947
-Kaname!

48
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:09,947
If you've got an explanation,
I need to hear it now!

49
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:11,514
That's it?

50
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:13,181
Nothing?

51
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:14,147
Too bad, Kaname.

52
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:17,514
Bankai.

53
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:24,481
(IN HEAD) Impossible.

54
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:29,714
He should be by Kaname's side.

55
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:32,214
-Hado number 90.

56
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:32,714
Kurohitsugi.

57
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:49,214
-(IN HEAD) In this battle
between two captains,

58
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:54,447
I can't believe I
could be so helpless.

59
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:58,247
-Kyoka Suigetsu's complete
hypnosis is flawless,

60
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,047
but even if there
were a flaw, it

61
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:02,214
would be impossible
to escape it.

62
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:05,114
-So, that's unspoken Hado 90.

63
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:06,647
Pretty scary stuff.

64
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,847
I take it you mastered
that little attack when

65
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:10,447
I wasn't looking.

66
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,047
-No.

67
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,581
It was a failure.

68
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:14,347
What you saw was
only about 1/3 of

69
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,814
its true destructive potential.

70
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:20,414
Number 90 is
difficult to control.

71
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:23,081
Now then.

72
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,314
Oh, sorry.

73
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:28,014
I hadn't finished explaining
things to you, had I?

74
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:30,281
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Ichigo!

75
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,214
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): No!

76
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,014
Go away!

77
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:43,014
-Rukia!

78
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:44,681
-Oh, no, no.

79
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:46,047
You shouldn't be moving.

80
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:52,447
-Orihime.

81
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:53,581
Uryu.

82
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:54,547
-Damn.

83
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:55,681
What incredible
spiritual pressure.

84
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:01,514
-Now, Rukia Kuchiki.

85
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:03,681
After I found you in
the world of the living,

86
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:06,814
do you know what the
first thing I did was?

87
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,281
I went in and eliminated
the central 46.

88
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:16,614
I imagine you've heard a
somewhat different story

89
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:17,814
from Isane.

90
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:20,781
She probably told you
Sosuke Aizen faked his death

91
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,447
and hid his whereabouts.

92
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:26,647
Afterwards, he
slaughtered central 46.

93
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:30,381
but that's not how
it happened at all.

94
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:33,247
I killed them as soon
as I discovered you,

95
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:36,447
then used my Kyoka Suigetsu on
the entire central underground

96
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:37,914
assembly hall.

97
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:42,014
To simplify matters, I made
it look as if central 46 was

98
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:44,714
still alive and
holding meetings.

99
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:47,147
In order to do that,
one of us remained

100
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:51,014
in the underground
assembly hall at all times.

101
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:54,914
Since then, we have taken over
the functions of central 46,

102
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:58,314
and we have been issuing
all of their orders.

103
00:06:58,347 --> 00:07:02,414
To make sure of your arrest,
I had those numbers of squad 6

104
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:03,747
take you in.

105
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:06,214
To separate you
from the humans, I

106
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:10,647
ordered the return and
destruction of your gigai.

107
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:16,114
To evaporate your soul and take
the hogyoku from inside you,

108
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:18,181
I decided the
simplest way would be

109
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:21,014
to have you executed
with the Sokyoku.

110
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:24,214
The only time we weren't in
the underground assembly hall

111
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:26,647
was the few hours surrounding
the two captains' meetings.

112
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:35,247
After that, I pretended to
die and hid underground.

113
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:37,814
Because I knew your Ryoka
friends might save you.

114
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:39,647
I knew the execution might fail.

115
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,347
When a foreign object has been
planted directly into a soul,

116
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:50,381
there are only two methods
by which to remove it.

117
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:54,247
You can use an intense thermal
disruption, like the Sokyoku,

118
00:07:54,281 --> 00:08:00,114
which evaporates the
soul around the object,

119
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,314
or some other method which
breaks down the soul's cohesion

120
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:04,647
and allows them to be separated.

121
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:11,647
In the unlikely event the
execution by Sokyoku failed,

122
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:15,814
I needed to find that other
method, which takes us back

123
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:17,247
to central 46.

124
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:18,747
You see, the
information I needed

125
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:21,014
could only be found in the
underground assembly hall's

126
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:23,714
Darai Shokairo.

127
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:27,881
I spent endless hours poring
over Kisuke Urahara's research.

128
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:30,347
He was the one who developed
the technique of implanting

129
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:32,181
a foreign object into a soul.

130
00:08:36,147 --> 00:08:39,747
So, I reasoned that the
answer to the question of how

131
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:43,647
to remove one was also
hidden in his research.

132
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:46,547
Yes.

133
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:49,014
This is that answer.

134
00:08:49,047 --> 00:08:49,514
-No!

135
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,947
-How fascinating.

136
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:13,347
I didn't expect
it to be so small.

137
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:14,081
The hogyoku.

138
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,281
Huh.

139
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:23,581
And no permanent
harm to the soul.

140
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:27,014
What an astounding technique.

141
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:33,481
It's too bad, but I just don't
have a use for you anymore.

142
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:34,747
Kill her, Gin.

143
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,014
-Well, if I must.

144
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,047
Shoot to kill, Shinso.

145
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:49,447
Huh?

146
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,114
-Oh no.

147
00:09:58,147 --> 00:09:58,614
Brother.

148
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,881
Byakuya!

149
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:10,114
Byakuya, why?

150
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:12,081
Why did you protect me?

151
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:20,814
-Hm?

152
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:22,781
-Let's go, Jidanbo!

153
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:24,247
-All right!

154
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:27,081
-Bones of beasts
scattered far and wide!

155
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:30,014
Stapled crimson
crystals, steel wheels!

156
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,981
Wind in action, and
the sky at rest.

157
00:10:33,014 --> 00:10:35,447
The sound of flying arrows.

158
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:36,914
Hado 63!

159
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:37,414
Raikoho!

160
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:43,714
-Kukaku!

161
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:44,247
-And Jidanbo!

162
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:53,681
-This is another face I haven't
seen for quite some time.

163
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:54,781
-Don't do it.

164
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:57,147
If you even move so
much as a muscle--

165
00:10:57,181 --> 00:11:00,281
-Then we're going to
cut off your head.

166
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:01,514
-Yes, I can see that.

167
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,547
-Kukaku.

168
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:07,881
-Hey, Yoruichi.

169
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:10,247
I had a little free
time on my hands.

170
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:13,481
So since I was out, I
thought I'd check in.

171
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:28,702
-Well, that sure was flashy.

172
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:32,168
What should I do?

173
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:33,202
-You shouldn't even move.

174
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:38,668
-Sorry, Captain Aizen.

175
00:11:38,702 --> 00:11:41,068
I got caught.

176
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:42,502
-Hm.

177
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,402
-This is the end.

178
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:45,102
-What?

179
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:46,168
Did you say something?

180
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:48,268
-Don't you understand, Aizen?

181
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:51,335
There is no place left for you.

182
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:53,402
No place you can escape to.

183
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:00,168
-Sosuke.

184
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:01,568
-Captain Aizen, how could you?

185
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:08,368
-It's over, Aizen.

186
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:13,502
-Heh.

187
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:15,868
-And just what's so funny?

188
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:19,002
-I'm sorry to do this,
but the time has come.

189
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,602
-Sui-Feng, get away from him!

190
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,502
-That's not-- it's impossible!

191
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,435
-It's Menos Grande.

192
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:47,368
-The Gillians?

193
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:49,002
How many of them
are coming through?

194
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,102
-No, wait.

195
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:51,902
It looks like there's
something else in there.

196
00:13:00,402 --> 00:13:03,368
-Well, that's a
bit of a letdown.

197
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:04,968
I was enjoying that.

198
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:07,902
I wouldn't have minded being
your captive a little longer.

199
00:13:07,935 --> 00:13:10,868
So long, Rangiku.

200
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:11,835
Maybe next time.

201
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:21,068
-You're just going to run away?

202
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:21,635
That's it?

203
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,868
-Stop!

204
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,835
-Head captain, sir!

205
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:27,868
-That light is a weapon
with the name of Negacion.

206
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:30,002
It's a technique
the Menos use when

207
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:32,902
they are rescuing
their fellow Hollows.

208
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:36,635
-Once enveloped by that light,
it is impossible for those

209
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:39,268
within and without to interact.

210
00:13:39,302 --> 00:13:42,168
It is an isolated
world inside the beams.

211
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:45,435
All those who have fought
the Menos know it well.

212
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:49,002
From the moment that light
fell on Sosuke Aizen,

213
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:55,135
it became completely
impossible for us to reach him.

214
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,035
-Kaname!

215
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:58,968
Come back, Kaname!

216
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:00,535
have you forgotten?

217
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:03,302
You once told me why you
became a soul reaper!

218
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:05,668
Wasn't it for your friend
who lost their life?

219
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:08,702
Wasn't it to carry
out your justice?

220
00:14:08,735 --> 00:14:10,568
Where is your sense
of justice now?

221
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:12,535
Because I don't see it.

222
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:14,602
-I thought I'd made
it clear to you.

223
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:17,002
My eyes can only see
one path, and that

224
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:19,568
is the path with the
least amount blood.

225
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:21,768
Justice is always there.

226
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:26,668
And the path I
follow is justice.

227
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:27,168
-Kaname.

228
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,602
-You've joined with the Menos.

229
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:41,568
Why would you want to do that?

230
00:14:41,602 --> 00:14:44,102
-I need to keep reaching higher.

231
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:46,068
-Have you become that corrupt?

232
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:48,102
Have you?

233
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:50,802
-You're blinded by your
self righteousness.

234
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:54,235
From the beginning, no one
has ever stood at the top.

235
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,802
Neither you nor
me, nor the gods.

236
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:01,868
But soon, that unattainable
vacancy at the top

237
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:02,702
will be filled.

238
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:13,535
From now on, I alone
will stand at the top.

239
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,668
Goodbye, soul reapers.

240
00:15:21,435 --> 00:15:26,935
And goodbye, Ryoka boy.

241
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:30,168
Even I have to admit that for a
human, you were quite amusing.

242
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:42,002
-Groups 2 and 3 care
for Captain Kuchiki!

243
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:46,002
Groups 7, 10, 11 and 13 all
help to heal Captain Komamura!

244
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:49,135
Lieutenant Abari is to
receive level six surgery.

245
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:51,068
Group 8 and 9,
prepare to move out.

246
00:15:51,102 --> 00:15:51,968
Let's go!

247
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:53,468
Come on, let's
move it, everyone!

248
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,635
These people are
seriously injured!

249
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:56,135
-Over here!

250
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:56,668
Hurry!

251
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:57,168
-Over here!

252
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:57,602
-Byakuya!

253
00:15:57,635 --> 00:15:59,335
Byakuya!

254
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:00,268
-Just stay back.

255
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:03,068
He's not healed yet.

256
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:04,268
-I'm all right.

257
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,668
Go take care of the others.

258
00:16:06,702 --> 00:16:09,102
-Careful, Captain Komamura.

259
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,168
-That's good.

260
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,168
Slowly, now.

261
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:12,402
-Excuse me.

262
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:15,302
Third Seat Iemura, where
would you like us to start?

263
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:18,202
-I want you to go and assist
in the healing of those Ryoka.

264
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:19,235
-Huh?

265
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:20,602
-Sir, but shouldn't we--

266
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:24,202
-You have been made aware of
their status, haven't you?

267
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:26,768
They are the saviors
of the Soul Society.

268
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:27,735
Go.

269
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:30,568
-Yes, sir.

270
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:32,268
-That Ryoka woman.

271
00:16:32,302 --> 00:16:34,968
She's intriguing.

272
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:35,735
Her healing spell.

273
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:42,702
Excellent!

274
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,835
Captain Unohana, any
change in the condition

275
00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:48,135
of Captain Hitsugaya
and Lieutenant Hinamori?

276
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:51,268
-All I have to report is
that they have escaped death.

277
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,102
From here on out, their
fate is in their own hands.

278
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:57,135
-As for all the others,
Isane is handling them.

279
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:59,535
So, what's the status here?

280
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:00,635
-Right.

281
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:05,202
There's Captain Kuchiki
and the young Ryoka.

282
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:07,168
-From what I can
see, it doesn't seem

283
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:08,635
as if we need to help the Ryoka.

284
00:17:08,668 --> 00:17:09,468
-Oh?

285
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:10,335
As you wish.

286
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:15,235
-Oh, Captain Kuchiki.

287
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,268
You were very reckless.

288
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:25,235
Rukia Kuchiki, come here.

289
00:17:25,268 --> 00:17:29,002
Captain Kuchiki wants
you by his side.

290
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:31,368
-Rukia, are you there?

291
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:36,402
-Yes.

292
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,202
I'm right here.

293
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:42,568
-There's something that's been
weighing heavily on my heart.

294
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:47,602
An old story from 50 years ago.

295
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:52,268
In that year, I lost my wife.

296
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:55,535
Before the first plum
blossoms bloomed.

297
00:17:55,568 --> 00:17:56,802
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): I know.

298
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:58,635
Lady Hisana.

299
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:02,802
People were always telling me
that I looked like your wife.

300
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:04,302
That's why you
took a liking to me

301
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:07,668
and welcomed me into the
family as your younger sister.

302
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:09,235
-Yes, Rukia.

303
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:12,835
I had instructed everyone in
the household to tell you that.

304
00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:15,568
But it was a lie.

305
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:18,502
-Huh?

306
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:23,235
-Hisana was your older sister.

307
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,702
Hisana told me that she'd died
in the world of the living,

308
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:30,668
and was sent with
you to Hanging Dog.

309
00:18:30,702 --> 00:18:35,068
Making a life was so
very difficult there.

310
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:37,368
Even though you
were just a baby,

311
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:39,035
she left you and ran away.

312
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:45,002
Hisana suffered
terribly for that.

313
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:48,535
Even after she became my
wife, she searched for you

314
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:50,235
practically every day.

315
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:57,868
Then, in our fifth
year together--

316
00:18:57,902 --> 00:19:01,768
-Byakuya, will you sea
for my younger sister?

317
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:04,435
And when you find
her, you must not

318
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:07,068
tell her that I'm
her older sister.

319
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,468
Please.

320
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:09,835
-Save your strength.

321
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:11,268
Don't talk anymore.

322
00:19:11,302 --> 00:19:12,735
-Please.

323
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,668
Don't let her know the truth.

324
00:19:14,702 --> 00:19:19,302
Just promise me you'll protect
her with all your strength.

325
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:23,135
I abandoned my younger sister.

326
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:25,368
-Hisana.

327
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:28,802
-I don't deserve to ever hear
her call me her older sister.

328
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,602
But I would like
her to have someone.

329
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:37,368
So I want her to be able to
call you her older brother.

330
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:38,968
-A plum blossom opened.

331
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:41,202
Look.

332
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:43,402
-I'm so sorry.

333
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:46,302
I've been such a burden to you.

334
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:51,502
I'm sorry I couldn't repay
the love you gave me.

335
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:54,902
These past five years
that we've spent together

336
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:58,968
have been like a
wonderful, beautiful dream.

337
00:19:59,002 --> 00:19:59,468
Byakuya.

338
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:12,002
BYAKUYA (OFFSCREEN): I found
you the following year.

339
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:14,435
I immediately welcomed
you into the family.

340
00:20:18,035 --> 00:20:20,502
It was the same as with Hisana.

341
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:24,335
The household objected, saying
to allow someone from the Rukon

342
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:27,535
district into a noble
home was against the law,

343
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:30,502
and would tarnish the
Kuchiki family name.

344
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:31,768
I didn't care.

345
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:34,368
I defied everyone.

346
00:20:34,402 --> 00:20:38,635
I'd given my word, and I was
willing to sacrifice anything

347
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:40,502
for that.

348
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:44,568
But it was true that I'd
gone against the law.

349
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:48,168
I make a vow in front
of my parents' grave

350
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:51,135
in order to admonish myself.

351
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:55,535
I vowed that this would be the
last time I ever broke a law.

352
00:20:55,568 --> 00:21:01,635
From then on, no matter
what, I would follow the law.

353
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:06,068
I was so intent on running
away from Hisana's memory

354
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:10,368
that I swore two vows
I should not have made.

355
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,835
When you were
sentenced to death,

356
00:21:12,868 --> 00:21:15,068
I didn't know what to do.

357
00:21:15,102 --> 00:21:18,335
My vow to my parents
to protect the law,

358
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:23,135
and my promise to Hisana to
protect her younger sister.

359
00:21:23,168 --> 00:21:25,268
I didn't know which
of the vows to keep.

360
00:21:32,502 --> 00:21:36,235
How could we expect to defend
our laws if we were not

361
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:39,002
even willing to follow them?

362
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:43,702
-Well, if I were
in your position,

363
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,668
I'd fight that law with
every bit of strength I had!

364
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,068
-Ichigo Kurosaki, I thank you.

365
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:00,335
Rukia.

366
00:22:09,368 --> 00:22:10,035
I'm sorry.

367
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:30,222
[theme music]

368
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:53,850
[theme music]

369
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,083
-Yoruichi, you let me
borrow all kinds of tools,

370
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:57,617
but I don't know
where you keep them.

371
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,483
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN):
My other form is a cat.

372
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:02,083
Not many people know this,
but we cats are marsupials.

373
00:23:02,117 --> 00:23:05,117
I've got this pocket that I can
fit pretty much anything in.

374
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:05,683
-Wow!

375
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,650
So that's it!

376
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:08,683
-You're not too bright, are you?
