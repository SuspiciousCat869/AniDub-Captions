may be, all of us,

In that case, I'll say this.

00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,001
-Wait, hold on, Kisuke.

166
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:22,101
That's not fair.

167
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:23,501
Orihime's our friend.

168
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:25,334
Don't forget that she
fought successfully

169
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,434
in the Soul Society, and battled
against the Bounts as well.

170
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,401
-Chad.

171
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:32,767
-If she says that she wants
to work on getting stronger,

172
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:36,067
then you can't just cast
her aside so easily.

173
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:38,867
-You should think
about this, Chad.

174
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:40,501
Do you want to get her killed?

175
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:41,667
-No.

176
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:43,734
She has defensive
and healing powers,

177
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:47,901
which are more important
than attacking abilities.

178
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:51,801
The defensive power of Santen
Kesshun is quite limited.

179
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:55,267
Most likely, they will be of
no use in the upcoming battle.

180
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:58,967
As for healing abilities,
we have squad four.

181
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:02,801
This time, captain Unohana
and Lieutenant Kotetsu's squad

182
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,667
members will be at
the front lines.

183
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:10,101
They will compensate many times
over for Orihime's absence.

184
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:11,101
-But I don't understand!

185
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:11,667
-No.

186
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:13,867
That's enough.

187
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:16,434
A warrior who has
lost her strength

188
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:18,601
will only end up
getting in our way.

189
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:20,267
-But Urahara.

190
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:22,634
ORIHIME: It's OK.

191
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,434
-Orihime.

192
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:25,734
-Thank you, Chad.

193
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:29,501
But really, it's OK.

194
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:31,434
And thank you, Mister Urahara.

195
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:32,934
I appreciate it.

196
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,201
I'm really glad that you've
been so honest with me.

197
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:41,734
Guess I'll be going, now.

198
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,201
-Orihime, wait!

199
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:45,767
Hey, what are you doing?

200
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:47,134
-Take it easy.

201
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,467
Kisuke is absolutely
right, you know.

202
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:53,634
While squad four does
specialize in healing,

203
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,567
they're also in
the 13 Court Guard,

204
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,967
which means they're
trained in combat.

205
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:00,934
And although Orihime has some
powers, you have to remember,

206
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:04,501
she's still just a human being.

207
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:06,301
Also, I got to say.

208
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:09,334
Her personality just
isn't suited for battle.

209
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:14,534
Right now may have been
the best time to tell her.

210
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,034
-I just hope you're right.

211
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:17,967
-Wow, she's gone.

212
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:18,934
-Poor little kid.

213
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:38,501
-Orihime, I-- what's wrong?

214
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:39,767
Why are you in such a rush?

215
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:45,301
-[sobbing] Oh, Rukia.

216
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:47,334
-Hey, what's the matter?

217
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,434
Orihime, what's wrong?

218
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:56,267
[orhime sobs]

219
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:57,734
-What?

220
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,901
Kisuke, I can't believe
he said that to you.

221
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,501
He won't get away with it.

222
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:04,701
-No, it's OK.

223
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:06,634
But you know what?

224
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:10,834
I've kind of calmed down since
you and I've been talking.

225
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:12,801
I think it's better this way.

226
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:14,067
I'm sure.

227
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,301
I mean, it's true that really
don't have enough power

228
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,534
to help us win against--

229
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,067
-It's not OK!

230
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:23,134
Haven't you fought by our
side all along up until now?

231
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,567
Aren't you furious at
him for casting you aside

232
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:28,567
so easily like that?

233
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:30,534
-No, I-- I'm not mad.

234
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,034
-Stop lying to me like that.

235
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,301
-I'm not lying, really.

236
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:37,534
I feel lonely, but not mad.

237
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:44,434
But being lonely isn't nearly
as bad as being in the way.

238
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:56,201
[orhime whimpers]

239
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,567
-I feel lonely.

240
00:12:57,601 --> 00:13:02,501
I guess while everyone else is
fighting, I'll be all alone.

241
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:05,334
But if I'm only going
to be a burden to Mister

242
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,334
Urahara and everyone
else, then maybe it's

243
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,001
better to just be
lonely instead.

244
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:18,567
-Orihime, listen.

245
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:21,067
In a battle, the ones
who get in the way

246
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,734
are not the ones
that lack power.

247
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,901
They're the ones
that lack resolve.

248
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:30,567
During our fight in
the Soul Society,

249
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,601
there wasn't a
single person that

250
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:35,234
became a burden to any of us.

251
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:39,367
Not Ichigo, not Chad, not Uryu.

252
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,201
And not you either, Orihime.

253
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:48,601
If any single one of
you weren't there,

254
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:51,801
then I wouldn't be here
today talking to you either.

255
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,667
I bet you we can find
something for you

256
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,967
to do that will help
us in this fight.

257
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,134
Let's work on it
together, Orihime.

258
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,001
-Thanks, Rukia.

259
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:08,334
[rukia and orihime gasp]

260
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:09,001
ORIHIME: Hiyori.

261
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,967
-You're coming with me.

262
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:16,134
Hachi wants to talk
to you right now.

263
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,134
-OK, but who's Hachi?

264
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,101
[orihime shrieks]

265
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:21,101
-Huh?

266
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:24,001
Who in the world was that girl?

267
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:39,828
-Ow, that hurts.

268
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:40,762
-Hey, Hachi.

269
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:42,795
I brought you the
one you wanted.

270
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,162
-Orihime?

271
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:45,495
-All right, that's it, Ichigo.

272
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:46,628
Your break is over.

273
00:14:46,662 --> 00:14:47,262
-Hey, wait.

274
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,562
Hold on a second.

275
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:49,862
What do you want with--

276
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:55,462
-I said that your break is over.

277
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:56,962
-All right, that's it.

278
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:07,695
-Hachi is just a nickname.

279
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:10,495
My real name is Hachigen Ushoda.

280
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:12,162
Nice to meet you.

281
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:14,662
-It's nice to meet you.

282
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:20,562
Um, so.

283
00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:23,028
What was it that you
wanted to see me about?

284
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:23,962
Huh?

285
00:15:23,995 --> 00:15:24,728
Ow, wait a minute!

286
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:26,028
What are you doing?

287
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:27,762
Please stop it, you're going
to pull my head right off

288
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:30,062
like that!

289
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,695
-Just as I thought.

290
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:35,362
These hairpins are the
real form of your power.

291
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:37,762
They're like a zanpakuto.

292
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:41,495
This is truly rare.

293
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:43,362
But this one is chipped.

294
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:45,995
I've been quite curious
about it ever since you

295
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,862
came here earlier to
speak with Ichigo.

296
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:50,095
-Yes.

297
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:53,395
But I'm afraid I can't fix
it, because a part of it

298
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:54,528
was shattered.

299
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:57,962
-Well, would you like
me to fix it for you?

300
00:15:57,995 --> 00:15:58,662
-What?

301
00:15:58,695 --> 00:15:59,828
Can you really do that?

302
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:00,795
-Why, of course.

303
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:01,728
-Oh, goodie!

304
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,095
Thank you, thank you so much!

305
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:07,095
-It's nothing, really.

306
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:09,628
-All right, you can
let go of her head now.

307
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:11,962
-I don't get it!

308
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:13,362
This makes no sense.

309
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:16,262
Why is Hachi so willing to go
and fix that girl's weapon?

310
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:18,695
And why'd he bring her
here all of a sudden?

311
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,395
She's annoying!

312
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:24,628
-Will you quit your yapping?

313
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:25,828
-This is so not fair.

314
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:28,362
-Well, I bet he's happy.

315
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:30,995
Yes, because we hardly
ever meet anyone

316
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:33,028
with powers similar to his own.

317
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:38,095
It's sort of makes me feel
like, well, it sort of makes

318
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:40,995
me feel like our
family is growing.

319
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:44,462
I bet Hachi feels that
way, and some others.

320
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:52,862
-Still not good enough.

321
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,228
-I see.

322
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:57,862
He was broken so that not even
a single splinter remained.

323
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:00,462
And you were unable to fix him?

324
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:02,528
And as a result
of that, you were

325
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:04,895
asked to stay out of
the upcoming battle.

326
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:06,928
Do I have the
situation correctly?

327
00:17:06,962 --> 00:17:08,828
-Um, not quite.

328
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,295
But since I've already
explained it like, five times?

329
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:13,362
Let's go with that.

330
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:16,162
-However, this is still strange.

331
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:18,928
From just looking at
your spiritual pressure,

332
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:22,295
you should have powers
very similar to mine.

333
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:24,728
But if that were the
case, you would still

334
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:27,295
be able to return him
to his original form,

335
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:28,962
even without a
shattered fragment.

336
00:17:31,728 --> 00:17:35,362
[poof]

337
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:36,062
-Huh?

338
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:37,295
What do you want, woman?

339
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:40,728
What's with that
look on your face?

340
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:42,028
-Tsubaki!

341
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,895
I'm so glad you're finally
back, I missed you so much!

342
00:17:44,928 --> 00:17:47,795
I can't thank you
enough for this, Hachi.

343
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:48,528
-Hmm.

344
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:49,862
ORIHIME: Oh, Tsubaki.

345
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:52,795
I just want to hug and squeeze
you and never let you go.

346
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:54,828
-Orihime.

347
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:57,895
I have now fixed
Tsubaki for you.

348
00:17:57,928 --> 00:18:02,928
And with this, you will be able
to return to the front lines.

349
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:05,495
However, I have to
agree with the others.

350
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:08,662
I cannot recommend that you
be allowed to fight alongside

351
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:10,228
them.

352
00:18:10,262 --> 00:18:13,195
If your powers are
anything like mine,

353
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:15,295
then you are
definitely not suited

354
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:20,928
for fighting-- especially when
your opponents are arrancars.

355
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:24,162
In spite of all that I've
told you, are you sure

356
00:18:24,195 --> 00:18:25,162
you still wish to fight?

357
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:29,328
-Yes.

358
00:18:29,362 --> 00:18:31,762
Yes, I still want to fight.

359
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,762
-Hmm.

360
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:38,028
Well, you'll just have
to get stronger, then.

361
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:42,395
You have not yet mastered
your own abilities, Orihime.

362
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:47,028
But surely there is a
means for you to fight.

363
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:49,995
Always keep this
thought in mind.

364
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:53,628
What's important is
not how you should be,

365
00:18:53,662 --> 00:18:57,162
but rather how you want to be.

366
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:58,128
-Got it.

367
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:12,462
Rukia.

368
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:14,928
Listen, Rukia, the truth
is, inside this place--

369
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:16,628
-Don't say anything.

370
00:19:16,662 --> 00:19:18,728
I don't need to know.

371
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:20,028
I came here.

372
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:22,895
And I felt a little bit of
Ichigo's spiritual pressure.

373
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,895
If he didn't say
anything, then he probably

374
00:19:25,928 --> 00:19:28,595
knows what he's doing.

375
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:33,928
It's enough just
knowing that he's safe.

376
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:34,795
Let's get going.

377
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:42,628
ORIHIME: Ichigo.

378
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:43,928
I'm weak.

379
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:47,728
And it always seems like I'm
looking back towards you.

380
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:50,862
But now, I'm going to go
forward and not look back,

381
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:53,828
so that the next
time I see you, I'll

382
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:57,328
be able to fight without
looking back at all.

383
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,795
All right, Rukia.

384
00:19:58,828 --> 00:19:59,795
Let's go.

385
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:21,128
[footsteps echoing]

386
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:26,628
[door creaks]

387
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:28,528
-Ulquiorra.

388
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:29,295
What do you want?

389
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:35,528
-You've healed.

390
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:38,728
It's a good thing that I decided
to bring your severed arm back

391
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:40,928
here, just in case.

392
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:41,928
-Bah.

393
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:43,495
This took too long.

394
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:45,828
My arm felt like it
was going to rot away.

395
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:49,495
You know, it would be nice if
our bodies healed on their own,

396
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:52,862
just like your eyeballs do.

397
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:54,795
-Stop complaining.

398
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:58,228
You're lucky to
have an arm at all.

399
00:20:58,262 --> 00:21:02,062
If it were completely
destroyed like Grimmjow's, you

400
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:06,062
would've been kicked
out of the Espada too.

401
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:08,728
-I guess you're right.

402
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:11,128
-I have completed the treatment.

403
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:11,628
-Oh?

404
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:18,228
-How is it?

405
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:20,095
Is the movement and
the responsiveness

406
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:21,728
the same as before
it was severed?

407
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:30,028
-Not good enough.

408
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:32,462
If it was in its
usual condition,

409
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:34,695
I would've split
her right in half.

410
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:36,395
-Idiot.

411
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:41,628
-Nevertheless, I know it'll
get better sooner or later.

412
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:45,328
Then when it does, I'll get my
revenge on that Soul Reaper.

413
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:06,328
-You have an interesting
ability, young lady.

414
00:22:13,146 --> 00:22:14,580
[MUSIC -- ORESKABAND,
"TSUMESAKI"]

415
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:45,696
-Captain, Rukia
Kuchiki called and said

416
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:47,963
she was going to return
temporarily to the Soul Society

417
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:48,696
with a friend.

418
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:49,529
-All right.

419
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:50,496
Let's prepare for their arrival.

420
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,129
-I've already mentioned
it to the squad

421
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,363
and suggested preparing
for a welcome back party.

422
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:55,796
-Don't forget to cook the rice.

423
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:56,896
-Yes, sir!

424
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:00,429
-Don't you guys have
anything better to do?
