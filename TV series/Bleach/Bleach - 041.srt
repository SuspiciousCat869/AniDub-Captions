THEME SONG: [SINGING
IN JAPANESE]

2
00:01:57,471 --> 00:02:00,404
-Uh.

3
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:01,640
Uh.

4
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,107
Where am I?

5
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,007
But I'm not dead, at
least I don't think I am.

6
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,740
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN):
Ah, you're finally awake.

7
00:02:10,774 --> 00:02:12,040
-Huh?

8
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:15,707
You're Yoruichi Ah.

9
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,474
It was you who saved
my life, wasn't it?

10
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:20,074
Thanks for doing that.

11
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,274
-Be thankful to your
strong life force.

12
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:25,240
Without it, you never would have
survived such serious wounds,

13
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:26,474
no matter what I did.

14
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:26,974
-Wounds?

15
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,774
That's right.

16
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:43,874
In fact, I thought
he'd killed me.

17
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:45,107
Huh?

18
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,640
Oh no!

19
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:53,040
Dammit! [grunting]

20
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:54,107
-Hold still, you fool.

21
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,474
You're going to open
up those wounds.

22
00:02:56,507 --> 00:02:59,507
Don't you realize how
badly you're hurt?

23
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,174
-I've got to go help Chad.

24
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:02,940
I think he's in danger.

25
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:03,674
Ah.

26
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:04,874
-Chad is OK.

27
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:06,574
Now just relax.

28
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:07,807
-Ah.

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,974
-Orihime and Uryu are fine, too.

30
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:11,340
-Huh?

31
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:13,674
-Chad was lucky to
fight who he did.

32
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,874
He left Chad wounded but alive.

33
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:18,540
Orihime and Uryu have
avoided confrontation

34
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,274
and so far haven't
gotten a scratch.

35
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:24,907
-That's good.

36
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,774
-So you just stay here in
the barrier and rest a while.

37
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,140
-Yeah, all right.

38
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:34,140
-Half of your organs
were crushed after all.

39
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:35,674
If it hadn't been
for this thing,

40
00:03:35,707 --> 00:03:37,707
you would have been
sliced in half.

41
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,540
Fortunately for you
it looks like it

42
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:42,307
absorbed much of the impact.

43
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,240
-That thing was on me?

44
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:48,040
-Yes, it was.

45
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:49,707
I was surprised to
find you were still

46
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,807
carrying this object around.

47
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,907
-Are are you sure that
I was carrying it?

48
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,140
-What do you mean?

49
00:03:57,174 --> 00:04:00,207
How could you have it
on you and not know it?

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,007
-Yeah, well, I um I had
it when I fought Renji,

51
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,174
and I think it saved my
life in that fight, too.

52
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,274
I figured that it was
a good luck charm,

53
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:11,040
and I should probably
hang onto it.

54
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:15,940
Hey, what are you
doing with that?

55
00:04:15,974 --> 00:04:17,207
-I'm throwing it away.

56
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,940
There's something really
evil about this, Ichigo.

57
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:22,274
Having it makes me
feel uncomfortable.

58
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:24,940
-But you said it probably
saved my life back there.

59
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,274
-Uh.

60
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,207
-Wouldn't it make sense to
hang on to something like that?

61
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,140
-No!

62
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:32,007
I don't care.

63
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,574
-No, don't!

64
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,240
Ah.

65
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:37,207
And that was that.

66
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,707
It sank like a stone
in the waterway.

67
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,774
What?

68
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,440
Oh, you're probably wondering
about this Hanataro guy.

69
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:47,107
He's from Squad
Four, but he's OK.

70
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,240
Technically, he's
the enemy, but he's

71
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:51,740
the one who healed my wounds.

72
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:54,574
It is pretty weird that
I still have this though.

73
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:58,907
I could have sworn
he got rid of it.

74
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,307
-Give it to me.

75
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,674
I'll take care of it.

76
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:02,440
-Huh?

77
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:03,540
No way.

78
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:05,474
This is mine, and
I'm gonna keep it.

79
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:06,907
-Hand it over!

80
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,207
End of discussion.

81
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,107
-Uh, yes, sir.

82
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,674
Please, please take it.

83
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:15,474
It's all yours.

84
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:16,374
-Hm.

85
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:18,707
It's probably not possible.

86
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,740
But all the same,
can't be too careful.

87
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:25,874
-Well, you certainly are strong.

88
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:27,140
It's surprising.

89
00:05:27,174 --> 00:05:29,340
-What do you mean by that?

90
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:33,107
You carried me all the way
here despite being so small.

91
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,307
-Oh, that.

92
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,040
Lifting things is no problem
for me, once I revert

93
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:38,574
to my original form.

94
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,240
-Ah, right.

95
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,507
Original form, I forgot.

96
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,240
Hm?

97
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:46,907
What do you mean, original form?

98
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,207
-Oh, that's right.

99
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,074
I've never actually shown you
and your friends my true form,

100
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:53,140
have I?

101
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:54,974
Having come this far,
there's no reason

102
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:56,274
to keep it hidden anymore.

103
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:59,174
-Huh?

104
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:03,207
-So behold, here is
what I really look like.

105
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:10,807
-Uh.

106
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:23,574
-Uh.

107
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:37,674
Uh-- uh-- you're a girl.

108
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:41,507
-Yeah, you're even more shocked
than I thought you would be.

109
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,940
Can't blame you.

110
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:45,240
I guess people always
assume I'm a man because

111
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,907
of the voice I use
when I'm in cat form.

112
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,107
-Eh.

113
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,007
-No matter how many times
I reveal my true form,

114
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,040
it's always fun to see
the reaction I get.

115
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:57,707
Though honestly,
I thought someone

116
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,940
like you would handle
it a bit better.

117
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:03,274
-But, but I-- I
thought you were a cat.

118
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:04,840
-Cats don't talk.

119
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:07,774
Use your head, Ichigo.

120
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:10,674
Anyway, I think that's
enough surprises for now.

121
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:12,607
Let's get back to
the business at hand,

122
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,974
and I'll show you how
I carried you here.

123
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:15,940
-Oh.

124
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:17,607
-First of all, I
used this device.

125
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,574
-Ah!

126
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:20,007
Will you please put
some clothes on?

127
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:23,807
-Oh, right.

128
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,474
Sorry about that.

129
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:29,674
It's been so long since I had
to wear clothes, I forgot.

130
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:31,374
Though I'm surprised at you.

131
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:33,907
You're more innocent
and naive than you look.

132
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,740
Was that the first time
you ever saw a girl naked?

133
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:37,240
Huh?

134
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:39,240
-Never mind.

135
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:40,674
-Do you want another look?

136
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:41,807
You never know.

137
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,240
Life is short, and you
might not get the chance

138
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:44,940
to see a hot young
girl like me again.

139
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:45,574
-Hey.

140
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:46,840
Shut up, will ya?

141
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:48,240
-Just kidding.

142
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:51,340
Oh, you have no sense of
humor, do you know that?

143
00:07:51,374 --> 00:07:52,974
You really ought
to take it easy,

144
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:56,007
or you're going to open up those
wounds of yours all over again.

145
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,240
-Would you please just shut
up and put some pants on?

146
00:07:59,274 --> 00:07:59,940
Dammit.

147
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:03,140
Now, I'm bleeding again.

148
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:04,974
-I had forgotten
how uncomfortable

149
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,640
it is having to wear clothes.

150
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:13,540
-So you put spirit energy in
this, and it allows you to fly?

151
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:14,707
-That's right.

152
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,007
There's not another
one like it anywhere,

153
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
not even here in
the Soul Society.

154
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:20,840
Impressive, wouldn't you say?

155
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:22,907
-Yeah, but I can't
help but wonder

156
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,774
how you got your paws on
such a valuable device.

157
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,407
-Hm?

158
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,607
-You can change forms and
do it so effortlessly.

159
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,240
And you have the
ability to heal wounds.

160
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:36,440
Now this.

161
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,574
Yoruichi, who are you?

162
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,307
-I am-- Ah.

163
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,774
-Eh.

164
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:48,207
That spiritual pressure.

165
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:57,007
It's him, again.

166
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,507
-It's coming from the Senzaikyu.

167
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,107
Stop, Ichigo.

168
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,307
-The tower is where I told
Ganju and Hanataro to go to.

169
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,374
I have to get there
and save them.

170
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:09,907
-What good do you think you
can do in your condition?

171
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,407
-Just who do think is going
to save them if I don't?

172
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,174
Fly.

173
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:27,674
Eh.

174
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,540
-Ichigo.

175
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:36,207
Uh.

176
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
You're such a fool.

177
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,307
-I sensed some faint,
spiritual pressure

178
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,940
moving toward the Shishinro.

179
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:53,640
And I thought it was some
powerful presence suppressing

180
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:56,340
its spiritual
pressure to hide it.

181
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:58,607
But it was only a big fat bug.

182
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,207
-Uh.

183
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,174
-Rukia, no.

184
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:06,440
Stay out of it.

185
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:07,540
-Ah.

186
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,774
I've got to stop this
or the Shiba clan's

187
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:11,674
going to lose another one.

188
00:10:11,707 --> 00:10:12,240
Oh.

189
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:14,340
-Oh, no, Rukia.

190
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:16,907
-All this time I've spent
in this Sekkiseki cell

191
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,407
has weakened my spiritual power.

192
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,174
I-- I can't even move.

193
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,674
-Dammit.

194
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:33,074
What incredible
spiritual pressure.

195
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:36,307
Just standing here,
facing him is taxing.

196
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,474
No measly little tricks
are going to do me any good

197
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:41,374
against a superior
power like his.

198
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:49,274
Huh.

199
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:50,374
Oh.

200
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:52,740
I'm just going to have
to take my chances.

201
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:55,374
Now, let's see how you
like my tears of blood.

202
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:55,874
-Huh?

203
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,974
Be gone.

204
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:02,874
My sword is not for
killing insignificant pests

205
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:05,340
such as you.

206
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:05,840
-Ah.

207
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:09,840
Ah.

208
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:10,807
-Ah.

209
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,307
-Ah.

210
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,506
-Ah.

211
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:23,006
Oh.

212
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:30,739
Where do you think you're going?

213
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:38,506
-Apparently, I didn't make
myself completely clear.

214
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:41,706
I spared you and
told you to be gone.

215
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:43,206
-Ha ha.

216
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,173
Maybe your noble
families have cowered

217
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:49,273
to run from a threat like that,
but no Sheba man ever would.

218
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:53,373
-I see.

219
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:57,206
You're from the
Shiba clan, are you?

220
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,839
-Oh, no.

221
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:00,939
-Forgive me for
taking it easy on you.

222
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:07,773
Now, I'll make sure you
don't leave here alive.

223
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:12,306
-Ah, what's this
from so far away?

224
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,039
-Brother, please, no.

225
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:15,306
-Scatter.

226
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:15,839
Senbonzakura.

227
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,973
-Ah, what the hell?

228
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,573
A blade just disappeared.

229
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:24,573
-Run away!

230
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:38,573
-Ah.

231
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,139
-Oh, Ganju.

232
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:00,106
-Brother, please stop.

233
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:08,373
Ah.

234
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:08,873
-Hm?

235
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,773
-Whew.

236
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:13,806
Close one.

237
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,139
Pretty dangerous.

238
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:18,373
Why don't we leave it at
that, Captain Kuchiki?

239
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:22,939
-Captain Ukitake.

240
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:24,639
-Hey there, Rukia.

241
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:26,039
It's good to see you.

242
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,506
Are you all right?

243
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:30,206
-What are you doing
here, Captain?

244
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,406
-Well, I could ask
you the same thing.

245
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:36,973
After all, releasing a
Zanpakuto on a place like this

246
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:40,739
is a first class offense,
even if it's to repel Ryoka.

247
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:42,639
What were you thinking, Kuchiki?

248
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:45,906
-The wartime exemption
allows the unrestricted use

249
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:47,573
of Zanpakuto.

250
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:49,206
-War exemption?

251
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:52,373
Has the Ryoka infiltration
gotten that bad?

252
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:54,306
Was it a Ryoka
that killed Aizen?

253
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,973
What spiritual pressure is this?

254
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,639
Clearly, it's at the
level of a captain,

255
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:06,306
but I don't
recognize him at all.

256
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:08,973
-That spiritual
pressure, impossible.

257
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:26,806
Ichigo.

258
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,106
(MUSIC LYRICS): If you
want to see some action,

259
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:33,006
gotta be the center
of attraction.

260
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,473
Make sure that they
got their eyes on you,

261
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:38,906
like the face that
they see on a magazine.

262
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,873
-It's it's-- huh?

263
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:51,773
-Are You OK, Hanataro?

264
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:53,306
I wouldn't have
sent you on ahead

265
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,406
if I'd known it was
going to be so rough.

266
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:57,339
-Thanks, but it's OK.

267
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:58,073
I'm fine.

268
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:07,139
Rukia, I've come to
get you out of here.

269
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,606
-Uh huh.

270
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,373
-Uh.

271
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:12,373
What kind of look is that?

272
00:15:12,406 --> 00:15:13,806
I've come here to save you.

273
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,473
You could at least try
to act like you're happy.

274
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:17,973
-Ah.

275
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:24,206
We should go now, brother.

276
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:31,939
Take even one step or try to
come after me, and I'll, I'll,

277
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,973
I will never ever forgive you.

278
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:39,739
You are going to die,
so why not stay put

279
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,339
and live a few seconds longer?

280
00:15:44,173 --> 00:15:47,473
You're a fool, Ichigo.

281
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:50,639
I told you never to
try and come after me.

282
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:55,406
I told you, I'd never
forgive you if you did.

283
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:59,206
Now, you're all cut up, and
there is worse yet to come.

284
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:05,839
-And maybe so.

285
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:08,773
Some other time
you can yell at me

286
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:17,406
all you want to about my coming
here, after I defeat him.

287
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:18,339
-Ichigo.

288
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:19,839
-What?

289
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:22,106
Don't tell me you actually
think I would give up

290
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,506
after I came all this way.

291
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:25,339
-It's just--

292
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:26,639
-'Cause I won't.

293
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:28,073
Don't even ask me.

294
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:30,873
I came here to save you, and
that's what I'm gonna do.

295
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,939
Oh, and from now on, I'm
ignoring all your opinions.

296
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:37,139
You're coming with me whether
you want to or not, dammit.

297
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:39,306
You got that, huh?

298
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:40,306
I'm the rescuer here.

299
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,173
You just shut up.

300
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:44,506
-What, what did you say?

301
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:47,406
Who do you think you are,
ordering me around like that?

302
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,839
A rescuer isn't supposed
to ignore the rescuee.

303
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:52,073
-Yeah?

304
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:54,406
And what kind of rescuee
complains about the rescue?

305
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:56,806
Why don't you just go sit
down and tremble in fear

306
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,906
and cry out, save me, save
me, like you're supposed to.

307
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:02,173
-Uh, I don't need to be saved.

308
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,439
And I do not tremble.

309
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:04,939
-Bluh.

310
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:11,306
-Hm.

311
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,439
You haven't changed a bit.

312
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:15,106
What's the use?

313
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:17,173
I might as well save
my breath, since you

314
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:19,373
don't listen to anything I say.

315
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,539
-Well, what do you expect?

316
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,406
All you ever do is worry
about me and scold me.

317
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,273
Maybe you should try worrying
about yourself for a change.

318
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,406
-Ichigo.

319
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:31,739
-Don't you worry.

320
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:33,539
I'm not dying today.

321
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:36,639
Fact is, I've gotten a lot
stronger while you were away.

322
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:47,606
Byakuya, what do you
know of this man?

323
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:50,273
-I know enough.

324
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:54,673
He has no relation to the
man you're thinking about.

325
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,173
This one here is nothing,
nothing but a Ryoka.

326
00:17:58,206 --> 00:18:02,206
I'll destroy him, and
this will all end.

327
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:05,306
He'll be dead, and this trifling
invasion of his will be over.

328
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:14,239
-Look at you, taking
everything so slow and casual.

329
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:16,206
All that time Rukia
and I were talking,

330
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,473
you could have been attacking.

331
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:19,539
But you just stood there.

332
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:22,206
-Who do you think
you're talking to?

333
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,173
Do you suppose that
I need an opening

334
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:26,639
to come after the likes of you?

335
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,973
You should know better
than to talk so big, boy.

336
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,873
-Eh.

337
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,306
-Uh.

338
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:40,706
Just stay down, and
you'll be OK, Hanataro.

339
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:41,206
-OK.

340
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:46,573
-Oh.

341
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:49,773
To be so unaffected by
the spiritual pressure,

342
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:53,639
you must have improved
a great deal indeed.

343
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:56,873
I don't know how you managed
to regain the powers of a Soul

344
00:18:56,906 --> 00:18:59,106
Reaper, but I can
tell you that you

345
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,973
should have stayed peacefully
in the world of the living.

346
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:05,773
Instead, you made the
mistake of coming here,

347
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:08,606
to throw away the life
I mercifully spared.

348
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:10,906
-I'm not going to
be throwing it away.

349
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:13,973
I'm gonna beat you
and then leave.

350
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:18,906
-I thought I warned you about
not talking so big, boy.

351
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:21,039
-He's gone.

352
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:21,773
-Flash step.

353
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:25,406
-Uh.

354
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:32,673
I saw your every
step, Byakuya Kuchiki.

355
00:19:41,073 --> 00:19:43,639
Well, what do you
think, Kuchiki?

356
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:45,339
A little surprised?

357
00:19:45,373 --> 00:19:48,439
Your movements were
all visible to me now.

358
00:19:48,473 --> 00:19:52,773
-Don't confuse skill with a
little luck, you daft fool.

359
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:58,039
-So maybe you'd like to find
out if it was just luck.

360
00:19:58,073 --> 00:20:00,473
Deh.

361
00:20:00,506 --> 00:20:02,473
Yeh.

362
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:02,973
Huh?

363
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:07,439
Tsu.

364
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:15,239
-Ah, amazing.

365
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:18,073
Somehow Ichigo's got Captain
Kuchiki battling against him

366
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,173
as an equal.

367
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:20,939
-It's true.

368
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:23,806
I can't believe how much
Ichigo's strength has grown.

369
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,806
The fact that he was able
to read Byakuya's flash step

370
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,406
is simply astounding.

371
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:31,839
Still, Byakuya's power
is much more than that.

372
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:34,839
The flash step is mere
child's play for him.

373
00:20:34,873 --> 00:20:37,106
I have to find a way
to stop this fight,

374
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:38,873
before he attacks in earnest.

375
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,839
Otherwise, Ichigo will be--

376
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:46,506
-Very well.

377
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:48,373
Obviously, you have
improved even more

378
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:51,173
than I would have
thought possible.

379
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:52,773
So you leave me no choice.

380
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,973
Before you become
too full of yourself,

381
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:57,573
I shall show you the
difference between us.

382
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:58,073
-Uh.

383
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:03,873
-The gap in power you
could never hope to bridge,

384
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:07,573
not even if you had
1,000 years of training.

385
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:09,806
-Run, Ichigo, run.

386
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,173
-Hm.

387
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:11,673
-Scatter.

388
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:20,773
-Hm.

389
00:21:20,806 --> 00:21:22,206
-Uh.

390
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,139
-Ah.

391
00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:25,006
-No way.

392
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,673
-It can't be.

393
00:21:27,706 --> 00:21:31,073
-Been a long time,
hasn't it, Byakuya.

394
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:46,651
THEME SONG: Happy people.

395
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:53,389
Happy people.

396
00:21:53,422 --> 00:21:55,322
Here we go.

397
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,222
Everybody stand up.

398
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:07,422
[singing japanese]

399
00:22:07,455 --> 00:22:12,689
Keep your head
right up to the sky.

400
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:17,122
[singing japanese] Oh yeah.
[singing japanese] Oh yeah.

401
00:22:17,155 --> 00:22:18,122
Just call me anytime.

402
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:19,622
Oh, yeah.

403
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:21,622
[singing japanese]

404
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:25,622
Happy people's in the house.

405
00:22:25,655 --> 00:22:34,089
[singing japanese] Happy
people's in the house.

406
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:39,089
[singing japanese]

407
00:22:39,122 --> 00:22:42,589
Happy people in the house.

408
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:43,589
All right.

409
00:22:43,622 --> 00:22:44,589
Happy people.

410
00:22:50,155 --> 00:22:52,655
-Yoruichi, how'd you
transform yourself into a cat?

411
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:54,955
-Yeah, did you use a
special Kido or something?

412
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:56,755
-No, I just wore a cat costume.

413
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:57,489
-I see.

414
00:22:57,522 --> 00:22:58,722
Is that really all it was?

415
00:22:58,755 --> 00:22:59,922
-Sure, that makes sense.

416
00:22:59,955 --> 00:23:01,622
If it was just a
costume, that'd be

417
00:23:01,655 --> 00:23:03,422
pretty easy to transform for--

418
00:23:03,455 --> 00:23:04,922
-What?
