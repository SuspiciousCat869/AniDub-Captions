2
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:00,446
SUI-FENG (VOICEOVER):
It seems odd

3
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,246
that so few people showed up.

4
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,646
Captains and lieutenants from
Squad One and our Squad Two

5
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,280
are here, plus
Kyoraku's Squad Eight.

6
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:10,980
It's no surprise Squads
Five, 11, and 12 are missing,

7
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:11,806
given their casualties.

8
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:13,606
And I think Zaraki's lost it.

9
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,006
But what about all the
rest of the officers?

10
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,839
I thought that at least
UNOHANA (OFFSCREEN):

11
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,072
would have wanted to be here.

12
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:27,939
-[gasp]

13
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:33,372
My brother.

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:49,372
-Rukia Kuchiki, it is time.

15
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:51,172
Any last words before
your execution?

16
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:57,572
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): Yes.

17
00:02:57,606 --> 00:02:58,072
Just one.

18
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:18,839
-The execution.

19
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:21,572
-Yeah, looks like
it finally started.

20
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,339
-It's begun!

21
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:33,072
-The execution.

22
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:34,539
Come on, let's go.

23
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:35,506
-Yes, sir.

24
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:44,406
-Kiyone, you moron,
the execution started.

25
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,372
Isn't the captain ready?

26
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:48,272
-Stop your yapping, idiot!

27
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:51,239
I'm only five feet away,
in case you hadn't noticed.

28
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,206
Captain!

29
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,506
Captain, are we ready to go?

30
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:57,306
-Now who's the one
yapping, you little weasel?

31
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:58,772
KIYONE: Captain, we're late.

32
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,272
Are you up?

33
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,739
They've started
Rukia's execution.

34
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,239
We've got to go!

35

Sir?

38
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:12,272
UKITAKE: Sorry to
keep you waiting.

39
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:15,872
Breaking the seal took a
bit longer than I thought.

40
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:18,806
But this should work.

41
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,639
Since our appeal to the
Central 46 was turned down,

42
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:25,839
this is the only
recourse we have left.

43
00:04:25,872 --> 00:04:26,706
Time to go.

44
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,939
Let's destroy the Sokyoku.

45
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:32,706
-[together] Right.

46
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:40,472
-What's that?

47
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:41,772
A fire?

48
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:43,739
-I think they've
started the execution.

[gasping]

50
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:46,372
-Then we had better get moving.

51
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:47,206
-You bet.

52
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:49,106
And I'll go first.

53
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,072
-Huh?

54
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:51,206
Why?

55
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,606
-Oh, it's nothing to do
with this executions.

56
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,306
But because it's Rukia,
there's a good chance

57
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,172
I'll find Ichi there.

58
00:04:57,206 --> 00:05:01,172
And I have to try to help Ichi.

59
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:03,306
-Oh, thanks so much.

60
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,072
-[giggle] You're so funny.

61
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:08,339
What makes you think
you should thank me?

62
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:10,872
It's only natural that
I try to help Ichi.

63
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:14,739
After all, Ichi is my
Kenny's new best friend.

64
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,706
-[together] Huh?

65
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:18,106
-Well, I'm off, guys.

66
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:20,539
I'll take out all the tough
ones when I get there, OK?

67
00:05:20,572 --> 00:05:21,939
You take out all the wimps.

68
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,106
-She's so fast.

69
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,106
GANJU (OFFSCREEN):
And so strange.

70
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:31,406
-Thank you, Yachiru.

71
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:37,606
-Agreed.

72
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,639
Your last request
will be honored.

73
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:44,006
After your execution, I shall
allow the Ryoka to return home,

74
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,272
unharmed.

75
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:48,439
-Thank you so
much, Head Captain.

76
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:49,739
-How cruel.

77
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:53,672
Why say that when he has no
intention of sparing them?

78
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:57,139
-It's actually not
cruelty, Isane.

79
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:58,472
It's kindness.

80
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:01,372
-What do you mean by that,
Captain UNOHANA (OFFSCREEN):?

81
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:02,706
-Her fate is unavoidable.

82
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:04,406
But now, with the head
captain's promise,

83
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,439
she won't need to worry
about her friends.

84
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,172
So she will at least die
with some peace of mind.

85
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:28,839

Relase the Sokyoku's seal.

00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:56,439
-Look.

-The seal-- it's been released.

89

RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Back at the bridge,

90
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,339
Gin sent my heart into turmoil.

91
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:27,806
But now, it is at peace again.

92
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,806
Is that because of the
head captain's promise?

93
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,872
Or could it be because while
my mind was in chaos, trying

94
00:07:35,906 --> 00:07:40,272
to think of a way to stay alive,
my brother acted so serenely,

95
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:43,239
not even turning to look my way.

96
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:02,806
-Thank you, brother.

97
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,306
Thank you.

98
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,606
KYORAKU (OFFSCREEN):
Come on, Nanao.

99
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,706
-Huh?

100
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:46,472
-Don't you go getting
all emotional on me now,

101
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:50,239
or else you know I'm
likely to come apart, too.

102
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:51,539
-Yes, sir.

103
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,572
But you needn't worry.

104
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:54,139
It's not sadness I'm feeling.

105
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:07,806
-Oh, what the hell is that?

106
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,706
Is that the release
of the Sokyoku?

107
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:21,439
-The spear-- it's
changing shape.

108
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,806
-What an amazing sight.

109

KYORAKU (OFFSCREEN): Ki-Kou-Ou.

112
00:09:48,272 --> 00:09:52,672
The spearhead of the Sokyoku
has taken on its true form

113
00:09:52,706 --> 00:09:55,739
in order to render the
ultimate punishment.

114
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:57,872
When the prisoner's
body has been pierced,

115
00:09:57,906 --> 00:10:00,306
the sentence will
have been carried out.

116
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:17,706
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
I am not afraid.

117
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:22,672
I have lived a good life.

118
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:26,206
I was blessed by meeting
Renji and all the others,

119
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:31,206
by brother Byakuya's adoption,
by the guidance of Kaien,

120
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:34,472
then finally by Ichigo's
attempt to rescue me.

121
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,939
This is not suffering.

122
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,939
This is not pain.

123
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:44,939
I have no regrets.

124
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:48,906
My heart leaves nothing behind.

125
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,906
Thank you.

126
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:53,372
Thank you.

-[gasp] Ichigo.

00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:27,000
[sigh] Idiot!

137
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,967
I said don't come back!

-Wha-- ah-- eh.

139
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:33,400
-What's it going to take
for you to finally realize

140
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:35,633
you can't defeat my brother?

141
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,900
He'll kill you for
sure this time.

142
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,867
I'm not asking you or
anyone to rescue me.

143
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,700
I'm resigned to my fate.

144
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:43,600
Go away!

145
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,233
-This can't be.

146
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,900
He stopped the spear.

147
00:13:56,933 --> 00:14:01,367
But the Sokyoku has the
power of a million Zanpakuto.

148
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,933
He couldn't have taken it on
with only a single Zanpakuto,

149
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:06,800
could he?

150
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,133
Just who is this guy?

151
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:12,500
-[gasp]

152
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:13,000
-Hm?

153
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:18,033
KYORAKU (OFFSCREEN):
Nanao, do you

154
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:22,067
think this could be the one the
other Ryoka was talking about?

155
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,267
-Yes.

156
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,500
His appearance certainly
matches all the captain's

157
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,567
reports we've received.

158
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,400
-I see.

159
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,100
I guess it figures
that in the end

160
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,067
it was the Ryoka
who saved the day.

-Backing out to prepare
for a second attack, huh?

00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:49,667
Go ahead.

165
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,800
