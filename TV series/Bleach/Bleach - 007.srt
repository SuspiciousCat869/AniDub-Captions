RUKIA NARRATING: Last
time, Ichigo swallowed

3
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:48,074
a Gikongan that pushed
his soul out of his body.

4
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:50,374
And this opportunist
took over his body,

5
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:52,207
and he's wreaking havoc.

6
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:56,007
Actually, this guy is a Mod-Soul
whose motivation is to survive.

7
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,141
We've got to catch him so Ichigo
can reclaim his body while it's

00:01:59,174 --> 00:01:59,807
still intact.

what's done is done.

-Hmm?

-I, um, I am so sorry.

00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,774
I know this is all my fault.

do it on purpose.

Do you have any idea what

You see, once you have

that means he is finished.

00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:52,441
-All right, then.

170
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:53,441
Show me.

171
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,874
Where's this bleeding
student you saw?

172
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,641
Let's see him.

173
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:57,241
-He really was here, honest.

174
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:58,707
-Since you haven't
shown me anyone,

175
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:00,941
you'll have to stay after
school again tomorrow.

176
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:01,774
Hmph.

177
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,674
-Huh?

178
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:07,107
[boys whining]

179
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,274
-Why did you save those three?

180
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:14,907
I thought you said
you hated them.

181
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:16,307
-It's hard to explain.

182
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:18,641
If I hadn't helped those kids,
they would have been killed.

183
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:21,707
No one should have the
right to kill anyone.

184
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:24,507
[grunt]

185
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:29,207
-Right after I was created, the
Soul Society sent out an order.

186
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,607
They made an announcement
that all Mod-Souls

187
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,874
should be destroyed immediately.

188
00:08:33,907 --> 00:08:35,441
So the very day
after I was born,

189
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:38,807
the Society gave me
a death sentence.

190
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:39,774
I waited.

191
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:47,207
I trembled with fear inside
that pill, just waiting to die.

192
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:49,107
Day after day, I
watched helplessly

193
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:52,674
as the others were disposed of.

194
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:53,874
Then I got lucky.

195
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:56,807
I got shipped out with a
load of goods by mistake.

196
00:08:56,841 --> 00:09:01,907
But I always expected to be
discovered and destroyed.

197
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,241
I was alone for what
seemed like years.

198
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:09,474
I had quite a while to think
about how things should be.

199
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,241
And you know what I feel?

200
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:14,641
I decided no one has the right
to take someone's life away.

201
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:16,274
I exist, and I
should have the right

202
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:18,807
to live my life for
as long as I want to.

203
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,541
Like humans, I deserve that.

204
00:09:20,574 --> 00:09:24,307
So I refuse to take a life.

205
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:27,274
That's the reason why I will
never kill any living creature.

206
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:36,207
-Well, look who we have here.

207
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,141
So finally we find you.

208
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:39,374
And what a picture.

209
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:41,741
You're all beat up and worn
out, on all that trouble

210
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:42,507
for nothing.

211
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,007
-Huh?

212
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:51,307
-Huh?

213
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:03,307
KISUKE (OFFSCREEN):
Mission accomplished.

214
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:04,607
We're done.

215
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:05,374
Let's go home.

216
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:05,874
-What?

217
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:07,174
Come on.

218
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,474
I came here to have a real
fight, and that's all I get?

219
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:10,641
-Hey, hold it.

220
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:13,341
What are you going to do
with that Mod-Soul now?

221
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:15,541
-No choice.

222
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:16,841
I've got to destroy him.

223
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:18,107
-You see me.

224
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:20,274
How can that be?

225
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:22,174
Just who are you guys, anyway?

226
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:24,041
-I'm not sure how to
answer that question.

227
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:24,874
Huh?

228
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:26,174
-I believe that's mine, thanks.

229
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:28,407
-Miss Kuchiki, you
can't have that.

230
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,341
-And why can't I
have it, Kisuke?

231
00:10:30,374 --> 00:10:31,874
Are you saying that
it's your policy

232
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:33,841
to seize goods that your
customers have already

233
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:34,774
paid for?

234
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:36,374
-Hey, I'll give
you a full refund.

235
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:38,307
How does that sound to you?

236
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:39,341
-That's OK.

237
00:10:39,374 --> 00:10:41,807
I'm completely satisfied
with my purchase.

238
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,241
Besides, I know and
you know that you're

239
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:46,374
operating outside the law.

240
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:50,807
And I also know it's not your
job to recall this Mod-Soul.

241
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:53,174
-I just hope you know what
you're getting involved in.

242
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:56,141
So don't blame me if
you get into trouble.

243
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:57,507
-I won't.

244
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,674
I've already dealt with a lot
of trouble since I've been here.

245
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:04,474
Here.

246
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:05,741
Come on, let's go.

247
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:07,707
-Uh-- hmm.

248
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:28,121
[grumbling]

249
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,454
-You're really feeling it.

250
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:30,421
-Sure am.

251
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:32,154
That Mod-Soul
really took my body

252
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:35,087
for a pretty rough test drive.

253
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:37,387
You tried to wreck me.

254
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:39,087
Hey, are you even
listening to me?

255
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:41,054
-I must say, you look
awfully silly yelling

256
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:42,254
at a pill in public.

257
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:45,354
-[grumbling] I still want
to tell him how I feel.

258
00:11:45,387 --> 00:11:46,687
Help me out here.

259
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:48,454
Is there a way I
can give this damn

260
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,554
Mod-Soul what's coming to him?

261
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:53,887
-You need to insert him into
a body, a dead body or one

262
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,921
that doesn't have a soul.

263
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:55,421
-Aha!

264
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:56,421
I gotcha.

265
00:11:56,454 --> 00:11:58,221
I'm looking hard
for a dead body.

266
00:11:58,254 --> 00:12:00,354
And when I find it,
bam, is he gonna get it!

267
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,587
-Just be quiet.

268
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,454
-Oh, what do we have here?

269
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,454
So let me get this straight.

270
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:10,221
You're saying a
non-living object

271
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:11,421
could work for this, right?

272
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:12,321
-Hold on.

273
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:14,621
That's not exactly how it works.

274
00:12:14,654 --> 00:12:16,187
(THINKING) Although
on second thought,

275
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:18,887
I'm in a body that's not
a real body, so I guess

276
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:20,187
it really could work.

277
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:21,254
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Rukia?

278
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:22,254
-Huh?

279
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:24,187
There's a possibility
it could work.

280
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:25,021
Let's try it.

281
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:25,987
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): You think?

282
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:26,621
All right.

283
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:27,887
So what do I do?

284
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,654
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): I would
imagine you would the pill

285
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:30,721
and put it in his mouth.

286
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:31,921
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
You mean like this?

287
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:32,421
There.

288
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:41,021
So you got any ideas
that might work?

289
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:43,654
-That should have worked.

290
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:45,154
-That hurts, nimrod!

291
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:46,687
Got it?

292
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:48,987
Ichigo Kurosaki, I
hereby challenge you

293
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,621
to a no holds barred duel!

294
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:51,421
-Count me in.

295
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:52,387
-Hey, wait!

296
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:53,554
When did you grow big?

297
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:54,554
Or did I somehow shrink?

298
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:55,954
What happened?

299
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:58,821
I'm in a super cute plush toy
with soft paws and no muscle.

300
00:12:58,854 --> 00:12:59,921
This isn't fair!

301
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:01,621
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Hey, Mod-Soul, relax.

302
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:02,954
-Huh?

303
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:05,254
-Time for some payback for
what you were doing in my body

304
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:05,754
earlier.

305
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:07,154
[squeak]

306
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:09,187
-Your little field trip could
have taken me out completely.

307
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,587
I need to make you understand.

308
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:13,521
-Guess I'm gonna have to mop the
floor with you just the way I

309
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:14,087
am!

310
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:16,587
[grunting]

00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,554
[shouting]

312
00:13:19,587 --> 00:13:21,787
[cock-a-doodle-doo]

313
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:23,521
-Hey, Ichigo, it's morning.

314
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:24,387
Get up.

315
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:26,154
Rise and shine!

316
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:29,254
Don't try to play dead with me,
you lazy Soul Reaper wannabe.

317
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:30,587
I know you!

318
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:32,487
I'm warning you, if you don't
get your butt out of bed,

319
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,687
I'll hide in your backpack
and go to school with you!

320
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:37,921
And all the girls will say, poor
Ichigo is a big baby because he

321
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:40,121
brings his widdle baby
teddy to school, and-- ow!

322
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,454
Hey!

323
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:45,021
Oh!

324
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:48,087
-I can't have you starting
the day that wound up.

325
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:52,821
Make like a real stuffed
animal and shut up, Kon.

326
00:13:52,854 --> 00:13:55,721
-And just where did you come
up with that name for me?

327
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:58,587
-We've named you Kon because
it's short for Mod-Konpaku.

328
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,787
That's another name for
a Mod-Soul like you.

329
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:03,454
-You're not the boss of me,
and I want a say in this!

330
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:04,821
Please call me Mod instead.

331
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:06,654
That sounds like a
cooler name, doesn't it?

332
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:07,721
Huh?

333
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,187
Plush Bod Mod, now
that's a snappy name?

334
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:10,321
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): No way.

335
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:11,021
-Oh why not?

336
00:14:11,054 --> 00:14:12,287
-Because you're right.

337
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:14,421
Mod does sound cool, but
there's nothing cool about you.

338
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,887
-[grumbling] You think you
can just tell me that I--

339
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:20,254
-I will not stand for
all this commotion.

340
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:22,321
I like getting dressed in peace.

341
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:23,154
KON (OFFSCREEN): Ow!

342
00:14:23,187 --> 00:14:24,754
[squeak]

343
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:27,154
-Hmm?

344
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:29,487
-I was just telling Ichigo
my name should be Mod.

345
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:30,587
Don't you agree?

346
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,921
It's better than Kon.
[shouting] My stuffing!

347
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,521
YUZU (OFFSCREEN):
Knock, knock, Ichigo.

348
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:35,421
I'm coming in.

349
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:36,354
-Huh?

350
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:37,787
-Huh?

351
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:40,187
-I thought you'd like to know
that your friends are down--

352
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:41,887
uh?

353
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,221
Like, what are you doing?

354
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:43,987
-Me?

355
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:44,654
What am I doing?

356
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:45,721
I-- I"m doing yoga.

357
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:46,721
You know, stretching
myself in new ways.

358
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:48,187
I saw this pose on a bus bench.

359
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,021
-I think the bus in your brain
has been gone for a long time.

360
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:53,587
By the way, Mizuiro and Keigo
are downstairs waiting for you.

361
00:14:53,621 --> 00:14:54,821
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): They are?

362
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:56,554
Wow, look at what time it is.

363
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:57,887
I gotta get going quick.

364
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:01,454
-Your breakfast is ready, so
you'd better get downstairs.

365
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:02,321
-Check it out, guys.

366
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:03,154
I just woke up.

367
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:03,921
Hang on.

368
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:05,954
I'll be right there.

369
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:06,921
-It's all good.

370
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:08,021
We'll see you in a minute.

371
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:09,421
-Yeah, take your time.

372
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:10,454
But hurry up.

373
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:10,921
-Yeah.

374
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,421
Hey.

375
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:15,821
[shout]

376
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:17,054
-What is it?

377
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:19,021
The memories of my classmates.

378
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:21,287
You erased them
again, didn't you?

379
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,387
-Of course I did.

380
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,954
Are you saying you'd
really want them

381
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:25,887
to remember what
happened yesterday?

382
00:15:25,921 --> 00:15:27,354
I don't think you would.

383
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:28,121
-No, you're right.

384
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:29,454
I wouldn't want that.

385
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:32,021
That was a day I
wish I could forget.

386
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:35,354
(THINKING) But I do feel like
I've forgotten something.

387
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:36,754
[gasp]

388
00:15:40,921 --> 00:15:41,921
-I'm leaving now, Ichigo.

389
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:44,587
I'll see you at school.

390
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,054
Ichigo?

391
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:47,354
What's wrong?

392
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:50,187
-Yeah, it's tomorrow.

393
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:50,687
-Ichigo?

394
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:54,554
MICHIRU (OFFSCREEN):
Excuse me, Tatsuki.

395
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,254
You take art class, don't you?

396
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:56,687
TATSUKI (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

397
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:58,054
Mm-hmm.

398
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:00,687
-So did you do our assignment,
the one that was on our future?

399
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:02,187
-How we see ourselves
in the future?

400
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:03,354
-Can I see yours?

401
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:05,154
I drew one, but
it's not very good.

402
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:07,387
-Oh, sure.

403
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:08,554
Here.

404
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:09,587
MICHIRU (OFFSCREEN): Wow.

405
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:10,621
You did a great job.

406
00:16:10,654 --> 00:16:11,921
-That's me.

407
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:14,187
It shows how I'm going to be
the first female vale tudo

408
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:14,921
champion.

409
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:15,954
-This is awesome.

410
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:17,487
My drawing looks so
lame, I don't even

411
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:18,721
want to show it to any of you.

412
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:21,454
So Orihime, can you
show me what you drew?

413
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:22,654
-I'd love to.

414
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:24,487
I'm glad you asked to see
it because secretly, I'm

415
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:26,121
very proud of what I did.

416
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:27,021
-Great.

417
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,254
I can't wait to see it.

418
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,087
You must have done--

419
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:29,587
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Ta-da!

420
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,721
-Uh?

421
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:32,954
-I'll have a velocity
of 240 miles per hour.

422
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:35,821
A 20,000 degree Celsius flame
will shoot from my mouth,

423
00:16:35,854 --> 00:16:37,654
and my eyes will project
destruction beams!

424
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:39,121
MICHIRU (OFFSCREEN):
Orihime, what have you done?

425
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:40,621
You'll get detention for that!

426
00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:41,487
You'll get suspended!

427
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:42,687
It's just too way out!

428
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:44,587
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Come
on, it's not that bad.

429
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:45,354
Oh.

430
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:46,554
Hey, good morning, Ichigo.

431
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:48,554
-Hmm?

432
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:50,887
Heh, hi, Orihime.

433
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:51,587
How's it going?

434
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:52,687
-What is up with Ichigo?

435
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,821
He never says hi or acts
friendly towards anyone.

436
00:16:54,854 --> 00:16:56,254
It's really kind of strange.

437
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:58,787
It's like he's in a good mood.

438
00:16:58,821 --> 00:16:59,721
Hmm?

439
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,654
Orihime?

440
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,587
-(ABSENTLY) Mm-hmm.

441
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,521
What's that?

442
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:07,454
-Michiru, what's the date today?

443
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:09,421
-Huh?

444
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,421
Oh, today, it's June 16.

445
00:17:11,454 --> 00:17:12,087
It is.

446
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:13,154
-I knew it.

447
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:14,487
[laughter]

448
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:16,321
TATSUKI (OFFSCREEN): Sometimes
Ichigo hides his feelings.

449
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:17,987
He's not in a good mood.

450
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:20,454
He's acting nice, but
he's really tense today.

451
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:24,787
-Tatsuki?

452
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:26,487
-It's nothing to worry about.

453
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:28,887
I know why he's
acting like this.

454
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:31,221
And I'll bet you
tomorrow, Ichigo's

455
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:32,721
going to skip school altogether.

456
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,921
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN):
I put a sign saying

457
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:38,287
we'll be closed tomorrow.

458
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:41,087
We apologize for any loss of
life our absence might cause.

459
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:42,421
Time for our meeting.

460
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:44,421
First order is to go over
everyone's jobs for tomorrow.

461
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:46,921
And as chairman, I have
final say in all decisions.

462
00:17:46,954 --> 00:17:48,254
-As if.

463
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,821
What kind of a meeting is this,
and who made you chairman?

464
00:17:50,854 --> 00:17:52,221
-Hey, hey.

465
00:17:52,254 --> 00:17:54,987
You must raise your hand if you
wish to speak, chief of staff.

466
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:55,887
-Hold on.

467
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:59,487
I'm chief of staff?

468
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:02,254
-Yuzu, you have been appointed
to be secretary of lunch.

469
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:03,354
-Aye-aye, chairman.

470
00:18:03,387 --> 00:18:05,454
-Karin, you will load our packs.

471
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:07,187
-I thought I was chief of staff.

472
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:08,221
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN): Did
I say chief of staff?

473
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,354
KARIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

474
00:18:09,387 --> 00:18:10,121
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN): I
meant chief of stuff.

475
00:18:10,154 --> 00:18:11,321
KARIN (OFFSCREEN): Stuff?

476
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:12,154
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN):
Stuffing our packs, that is.

477
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:12,987
KARIN (OFFSCREEN): Oh, come on

478
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:14,054
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN): Now to bed!

479
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:15,021
KARIN (OFFSCREEN):
I'm better than that.

480
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:16,087
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN):
That's an order!

481
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:16,582
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN):
That sounded like fun.

482
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:21,354
-What do you mean?

483
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:23,687
-I'm talking about that family
meeting you had with your dad.

484
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:25,421
So instead of going
to school tomorrow,

485
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,054
you're having a
family picnic, huh?

486
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:28,254
That sounds nice.

487
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:29,187
-Picnic?

488
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:30,954
What time should
I be ready to go--

489
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:31,587
-Rukia, listen.

490
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:32,987
-Hmm?

491
00:18:33,021 --> 00:18:35,554
-I know I have serious
responsibilities as a Soul

492
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:37,654
Reaper, but I was
wondering, could I maybe

493
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:39,021
take tomorrow off?

494
00:18:39,054 --> 00:18:40,521
-What?

495
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,621
Did you just ask
me for a day off?

496
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,487
Are you crazy?

497
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:44,787
There is no way.

498
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:47,821
You cat strange all day, and
now you spring this on me?

499
00:18:47,854 --> 00:18:48,754
What are you thinking?

500
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:49,654
-It's the anniversary.

501
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:55,821
The anniversary
of my mom's death.

502
00:18:55,854 --> 00:19:00,454
Well, actually, it's not
just the day she died.

503
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:05,054
It's when she was killed.

504
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,787
-[laughing] Hi, Orihime!

505
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:26,221
How's it going?

506
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:29,121
-Tomorrow, Ichigo's going
to skip school altogether.

507
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:37,654
-(THINKING) Why is it-- why is
it that the rain makes me want

508
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,121
to cry?

509
00:19:39,154 --> 00:19:42,221
Sometimes I wish I
were the rain so I

510
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:44,421
could touch people and
feel their feelings

511
00:19:44,454 --> 00:19:48,387
and maybe connect
with their hearts.

512
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:51,354
Maybe then I might
understand his pain.

513
00:19:59,287 --> 00:19:59,754
-Huh?

514
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:04,687
[gasp] No!

515
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,121
No, don't go!

516
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:10,621
I've got to save her!

517
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:11,587
-No!

518
00:20:11,621 --> 00:20:12,087
Ichigo!

519
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:19,987
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
I'll never forget

520
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:21,654
seeing my mother lying dead.

521
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:26,554
She died because of me.

522
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:43,454
[laughter]

523
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:44,121
-Go!

524
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:45,854
Knock that one out!

525
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:47,754
Go on, get him!

526
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:48,587
I lost!

527
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:49,754
BOY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, I did it!

528
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:51,121
GIRL (OFFSCREEN): Good job!

529
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:52,887
-Wait, one more time, OK?

530
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:54,554
I bet I don't lose this time.

531
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,987
[laughter]

532
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,454
-Is something the
matter, Mister?

533
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:03,487
-Uh, I forgot about something
I need to attend to.

534
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:04,254
-Aww.

535
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:05,654
-But we want to play more.

536
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:06,354
-This'll help.

537
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:07,321
[gasp]

538
00:21:07,354 --> 00:21:11,987
[laughter]

539
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,887
SOUL REAPER (OFFSCREEN): So
tell me, who is it today?

540
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:19,054
-Rukia Kuchiki, from Squad 13.

541
00:21:19,087 --> 00:21:20,821
-Kuchiki.

542
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:22,287
Heh.

543
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:25,121
What offense has that
young lady committed?

544
00:21:25,154 --> 00:21:28,421
-She has stayed for far too
long in the human world.

545
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,287
-Heh.

546
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,621
Is that all?

547
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:33,487
-I wouldn't be talking
to you if that were all.

548
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:36,121
There's something else
going on out there.

549
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:38,121
Find out what it is.

550
00:21:38,154 --> 00:21:41,221
-So are you saying I can
get rough if I have to?

551
00:21:41,254 --> 00:21:44,721
-Take care of it-- quickly.

552
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:49,454
-I will.

553
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:50,754
Rukia Kuchiki.

554
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:01,907
THEME SONG: Nobody
knows who I really am.

555
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:06,041
I never felt this empty before.

556
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:10,707
And if I ever need
someone to come along,

557
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:15,507
who's going to comfort
me and keep me strong?

558
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,441
[singing in japanese]

559
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:58,707
ISSHIN NARRATING: Next
time, don't wave bye-bye,

560
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:02,041
but say hello to Isshin
Kurosaki, dad of danger,

561
00:23:02,074 --> 00:23:03,874
as he cracks his
biggest case ever!

562
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:05,341
You'll be on the
edge of your stool

563
00:23:05,374 --> 00:23:07,641
as Isshin takes on a
wild wardrobe malfuction!

564
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:10,074
ICHIGO NARRATING: Dad, that's
not what the show's about.

565
00:23:10,107 --> 00:23:11,507
ISSHIN NARRATING:
Oops, I guess I goofed.
