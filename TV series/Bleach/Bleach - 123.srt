-Soul Reapers.

5
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:53,421
The spiritual guardians to
the world of the living.

6
00:01:53,454 --> 00:01:56,154
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

7
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:00,488
of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

8
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,154
Ichigo and Captain
Hitsugaya's troops

9
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:05,854
barely managed to
defeat the Arrancars

10
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:07,521
that Aizen had created.

11
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:09,588
But both sides had
suffered major damages.

12
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:16,654
Realizing that they could not
defeat the stronger Arrancars,

13
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:19,188
the Soul Reapers decided
to prepare themselves

14
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,988
for their next encounter
with the enemy.

15
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:29,554
Feeling useless,
Uryu and Chad also

16
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:31,721
began training to
become stronger,

17
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:36,321
so that they could fight
alongside their friends again.

18
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:39,054
Meanwhile, Ichigo,
sensing that he could not

19
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:41,354
suppress his inner
Hollow any longer,

20
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:43,154
decided to call
upon the Visoreds

21
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:44,754
for some greatly needed advice.

22
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:55,154
-Good job finding
this place, Ichigo.

23
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:05,021
The fact that
you're here tells me

24
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:10,521
that you finally decided
to come over to our side.

25
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,621
Am I right?

26
00:03:12,654 --> 00:03:13,121
-Huh.

27
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,454
I'm here to use you, Shinji.

28
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:20,354
I came here with
one purpose in mind,

29
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:22,488
and I'm not leaving
until I get it.

30
00:03:22,521 --> 00:03:26,954
I want to teach me how to
control the Hollow inside me.

31
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:29,454
Guess I'll beat it out of you.

[crashing noises]

33
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:51,988
-Hachi, are you sure
your barrier will hold?

34
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:54,654
-Actually, I'm not sure at all.

35
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:55,154
-Hm.

36
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:09,754
-Stop holding back.

37
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:12,521
You still don't get it, do you?

38
00:04:12,554 --> 00:04:15,488
What are you afraid of, Ichigo?

39
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,221
-I'm not afraid of you.

40
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:21,188
-I'm going to give
you a little tip.

41
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,888
Use your Bankai.

42
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,288
-Shut up.

43
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:25,588
-Just as I thought.

44
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:27,254
You're scared that
every time you're

45
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:29,154
forced to use your
Bankai against someone

46
00:04:29,188 --> 00:04:31,654
powerful like me, you're going
to lose control of your soul

47
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,388
to that frightening
inner Hollow of yours.

48
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:35,421
-I said shut up!

49
00:04:35,454 --> 00:04:38,088
-Dumb ass.

50
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:40,621
Just looking at your
face pisses me off.

51
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:43,154
You're so terrified
it's pathetic.

52
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:45,888
That's fine with me.

53
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:47,421
Fight scared if you want to.

54
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,888
You don't have to use
your Bankai or Hollowfy.

55
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:52,988
It'll save me some
effort while killing you.

56
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:53,488
Your choice.

57
00:04:57,721 --> 00:05:00,388
-Think.

58
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:02,621
How is she able to Hollowfy
without losing her sanity?

59
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:07,721
How can she just
take her mask off

60
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:09,954
and put it back on like that?

61
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:11,954
I have to pay more attention.

62
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:13,454
Watch her every move.

63
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:15,788
Find out how she does it.

64
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:18,688
That's why I came here.

65
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:20,988
I won't use my Bankai.

66
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,688
I'm not going to Hollowfy.

67
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:30,054
I refuse to let him
control my soul.

68
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:32,954
Never again!

-OK, that's enough.

73
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:21,488
Well, Hiyori?

74
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:22,554
Are you satisfied?

75
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,088
You understand now,
don't you, Ichigo?

76
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:33,588
Your Hollow can't be
suppressed just by simply

77
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:35,354
focusing your mind
on stopping it.

78
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:37,654
And it can't be stopped
with your body, either.

79
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:47,454
You pass.

80
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:49,121
We'll teach you control.

81
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:54,354
You'll learn how to deal with
that Hollow inside of you.

-Calm down.

85
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:05,054
Just relax.

86
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:06,388
I'm sure he's fine.

87
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:08,821
He'll come wondering back
after a day or two like nothing

88
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:09,921
happened.

89
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:11,754
-How can you be so calm
at a time like this?

90
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:14,188
He could have been
kidnapped, or in an accident.

91
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:15,654
Or even worse, murder!

92
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:20,221
-What's wrong with my baby girl?

93
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:21,954
Why is my little Yuzu crying?

94
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:23,554
I can't stand seeing you sad.

95
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:24,921
Hey, look at me!

96
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:27,688
This'll get her to stop crying,
it's a gag that never fails.

97
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:28,788
This used to have them
rolling in the aisles

98
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:29,821
back in the good old days.

99
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:30,788
Look at my funny beard!

100
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:36,721
-You always have a funny beard.

It's you.

105
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:54,288
Did you find my brother?

106
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:57,621
-Sorry, I didn't find him.

107
00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:00,021

I can't find any trace of

00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:17,688
Where did you go, Ichigo?

112
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:18,254
Where are you?

113
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:26,254
-Ichigo.

114
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:35,554
-How could you make this
poor kid cry, Ichigo?

115
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:38,421
What a worthless big brother
you turned out to be.

116

[heavy breathing]

117
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:49,188
-Where's Mashiro with lunch?

118
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:51,954
Hiyori, lunch is late
again, and I'm starving.

119
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:54,221
Make something to eat.

120
00:08:54,254 --> 00:08:55,488
-Yeah, dream on.

121
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:57,388
You'll starve to death waiting
for me to cook for you.

122
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:00,188
And even if I did cook a meal,
I wouldn't let you have any.

123
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:01,621
Dumb ass.

124
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:02,954
-Hey, Love.

125
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:04,988
Have you heard that new song
from the Prince of Darkness

126
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:06,054
that just came out?

127
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,688
It totally rocks.

128
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,754
-No, but have you read
the latest issue of

129
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:12,088
Shonen Jump magazine?

130
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,054
-How could I?

131
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:14,954
You never let anyone
read it but you.

132
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,954
-Hysterical!

133
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:21,621
-Lisa, I want you to keep a
sharp eye on that Soul Reaper

134
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:22,754
and look after him.

135
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:24,721
-Don't worry, I won't
let him out of my sight.

136
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:26,388
-Yeah, but you're
not watching him.

137
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:29,121
You're just sitting there,
looking at swimsuit catalogs.

138
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:29,954
-Can it.

139
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:32,054
I can see the Soul Reaper fine.

140
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,388
-That's not the point.

141
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:34,788
You're on duty
today, aren't you?

142
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,621
You're supposed to
be training him.

143
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:38,588
-Fine, have it your way.

144
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,054
One, two.

145
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:41,454
One, two.

146
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:42,754
One, two.

147
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:43,388
One, two.

148
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:44,288
-It sure is late.

149
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:45,621
-Stop talking about it.

150
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:49,088
You're already making us more
hungry than we already are.

151
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:49,654
-One, two.

152
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:50,621
One, two.

153
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,554

One--

156
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:59,221
-I can't take it anymore!

157
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:00,588
-What's the idea?

158
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:02,688
You try something like
that again, dumb ass,

159
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:03,788
and you're dead!

160
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:06,221
-I was, I was just going
to say that to him.

161
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:08,654
-I should be saying that to you!

162
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:11,121
You bragged about how you were
going to teach me control,

163
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:13,188
and how to suppress the
Hollow inside me forever.

164
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:16,621
So why the hell are you idiots
making me run all day long

165
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:19,088
on this cheap, homemade, poor
excuse for a cross country ski

machine?

167
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,121
Wait, scratch that.

168
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,121
You're not the idiots.

169
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,921
I'm the idiot for
listening to you.

170
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:27,188
-You are an idiot if you
think it's a cross-country ski

171
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:28,688
machine!

172
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:29,621
-Lunch is here!

173
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:31,888
-Ah, sounds good.

174
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:33,088
I'm starved.

175
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:34,854
---you whine about our
training methods, dumbass!

176
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:36,621
-Quit call me dumb
ass, snaggletooth!

177
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:38,954
And how the hell can you
consider this training?

178
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:41,421
-I'll call you dumb ass
any time I want, dumbass.

179
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:43,588
-Should I interrupt them
to tell them lunch is here?

180
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:44,421
It might get cold.

181
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:46,121
-Ah, don't bother.

182
00:10:46,154 --> 00:10:48,521
I'll eat theirs.

183
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:49,988
-They seem to be awfullly angry.

184
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,854
Why are they fighting?

185
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:56,821
-Well, he doesn't seem to
like the Hiyori super-trainer?

186
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:57,488
-What?

187
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:00,888
He was still on it?

188
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,121
-If you ask me, I don't
think Hiyori explained

189
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:05,388
the theory of the
training treadmill

190
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:07,854
very well, so I can see why
the Soul Reaper might be upset.

191
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:17,354
-I have to agree.

192
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:19,754
When giving orders,
she always leaves

193
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:21,954
out one or two key details.

194
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:22,454
-Hm.

195
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:29,254
-Quit complaining, and keep
running until you drop!

196
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:34,654
-Why you!

197
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:39,988
-Calm down, Ichigo.

198
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:42,121
The stupid Hiyori
treadmill trainer--

199
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:43,221
-It's super!

200
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:45,454
---is foundation for
your future training.

201
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:46,788
-Foundation?

202
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:49,254
-We determine the level of
your next training program

203
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:52,721
based on how long you
can run on the treadmill.

204
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,221
-What exactly do you
mean, when you say level?

205
00:11:56,254 --> 00:11:58,354
-Just listen to Hiyori, OK?

206
00:11:58,388 --> 00:11:59,821
Quit complaining,
and get back on

207
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:01,788
her senseless treadmill trainer.

208
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,754
-For the last time, it's the
Hiyori Super Trainer, dumb ass.

209
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:08,188
-After about three days, you'll
collapse from exhaustion.

210
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:10,754
First we break you down,
and then we build you up,

211
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:14,388
by teaching you how to control
your Hollow transformation.

212
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:15,121
-What?

213
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:16,621
That's a joke.

214
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,688
Well you can forget
about three days.

215
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:20,454
I can run on that
thing for almost a week

216
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:21,921
without getting tired.

217
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:23,621
I get it, OK?

218
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:25,854
That stupid machine is
designed to drain me

219
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:27,488
of all my spirit energy.

220
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:29,921
Well big deal!

221
00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:32,388
You want to measure my
maximum spirit energy output

222
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:37,088
by seeing how many days I
can run before I collapse.

223
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,154
You idiots.

224
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:39,588
With the spirit energy
I have right now,

225
00:12:39,621 --> 00:12:42,021
I can go at least five days
straight on that thing!

226
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:44,421
There's no point in
testing me like this.

227
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:47,721
Just teach me how to control
my Hollowfication, already!

228
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:50,288
I don't have time to waste
on this crap, damn it!

229
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:53,288
I cannot afford to lose any more
time playing around with you

230
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:54,121
Visords!

231
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:54,854
-Shut your mouth!

232
00:13:05,754 --> 00:13:07,421
You don't have time?

233
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,854
Oh, that's really
something, coming

234
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,854
from a guy who doesn't
even know how long it

235
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:12,488
takes for the Hogyoku to awaken.

236
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:15,688
-Wait a minute.

237
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:18,588
What did you just say?

238
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:20,454
-I said, stop blabbing,
when you don't really

239
00:13:20,488 --> 00:13:22,288
know anything about
the Hogyoku or anything

240
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:23,454
at all about Hollowfication.

241
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,554
-What is this?

242
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:27,788
How do you know about?

243
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:30,688
How is it possible you
know about the Hogyoku?

244
00:13:30,721 --> 00:13:33,121
-I know all about it.

245
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:38,988
The Hogyoku, the Arrancars,
even Sosuke Aizen.

246
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:42,121
I've known all about them
for many, many years.

247
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:52,621
Don't worry, I'll give you
all the details another day.

248
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:54,188
I thought it would
be a good idea

249
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:56,721
to take some time
at the beginning,

250
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:58,921
so you can get used to us.

251
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:01,688
But, now that I
think about it, you

252
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:04,388
can already turn
into a Soul Reaper.

253
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:07,654
You can use your Shikai.

254
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:11,554
And you have a Bankai.

255
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:14,688
-You know about all that, too?

256
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,421
-But I can see it would be
better if we just jumped right

257
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:20,321
into teaching you how
to control your Hollow.

258
00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:22,288
Just like you
originally asked us to.

259
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:23,654
Are you ready, Ichigo?

260
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:31,721
I hope you don't regret this.

261
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:41,888
Hachi, give us a two-layered
fault force field.

262
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,121
-All right, then.

263
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:05,388
-Can you hear me, Ichigo?

264
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:09,121
In a moment, you're going to
fully transform into a Hollow.

265
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:11,788
Don't let it consume you.

266
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:13,888
Consume it, instead.

267
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:17,654
If it eats you, it's all over.

268
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:32,688
Hey Hachi.

269
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:34,654
Throw up a force
field here, too.

270
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:35,854
-Whaaat?

271
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:36,754
-Don't whaaat?

272
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:37,888
Me.

273
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:39,054
You're standing there
with your mouth open,

274
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,988
looking like you're
trying to catch flies.

275
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:43,921
Just do it, OK?

276
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:46,588
And seal off Ichigo's
body as well.

277
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:47,121
-As you wish.

00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:01,096
But Zangetsu and I have
always been one and the same.

329
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:05,563
Together we're
your spirit energy.

330
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:07,996
I used to be part of him.

331
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,596
We share the same body.

332
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:18,763
But, as our relationship
began to change,

333
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:21,596
so too, did our
individual appearances.

334
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,230
When life is in control,
flesh covers the bones.

335
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:28,796
When death takes over,
the bones become exposed.

336
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,763
It's the same with
Zangetsu and I.

337
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,396
Over time, my power increased.

338
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,896
Control started to
switch over to death,

339
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,663
and Zangetsu became
a part of me.

340
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,896
The more you try draw
on Zangetsu's powers,

341
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,996
the easier it became for
me to dominate your soul.

342
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,296
-Is that so?

343
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,696
Then that means, if
I defeat you here,

344
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,263
then Zangetsu will
once again become

345
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:04,696
the center of my spirit energy.

346
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,063
-That makes sense.

347
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:08,563
In theory.

348
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,830
But you won't win.

349
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:15,463
-Is that right?

350
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:26,130
Don't be so sure about that.

351
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:30,896
I wonder how confident you'll
be, after you see this!

352
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,396
-You just don't
understand, do you?

353
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,763
It's not like you might beat me.

354
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,763
You can't beat me!

355
00:21:39,796 --> 00:21:40,763

-You there, in front of the TV!

Need some exercise?

00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:50,373
Now the Hiyori Super Trainer can
be yours, for a low, low price.

361
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:52,806
Buy it now, and get it
signed by Hiyori Sarugaki.

-Wait, didn't you break it
when you threw it at Ichigo?

363
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:55,939
-Quiet, dumbass.

364
00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:58,506
You're blowing my sales pitch.
