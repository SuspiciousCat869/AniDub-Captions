00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:41,888
UGAKI (OFFSCREEN): How nice.

3
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:44,655
Fresh targets.

4
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,155
-Ichigo.

5
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:52,055
-Zabimaru.

6
00:01:55,555 --> 00:01:58,022
-Hado Four.

7
00:01:58,055 --> 00:01:59,488
Byakurai.

8
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:00,488
-Rukia, look out.

9
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,388
-Stay out of the shadows.

10
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:16,788
The shadows are where
this doll emerges from.

11
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:17,788
-What the hell?

12
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:37,188
Ichigo, Renji, you
go on ahead of us.

13
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:37,955
-Let's go.

14
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:38,455
-Yeah.

15
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:38,988
All right.

16
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:25,022
-It's Yumichika.

17
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:27,555
-Renji, I think
something's coming.

18
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:37,922
-What the hell's that?

19
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:46,622
-Time to witness
the real Gesell.

20
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:13,788
-Yumichika!

21
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:32,388
-What the hell.

[roar]

23
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,322
-He's huge.

24
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:45,488
-Yeah, I noticed.

25
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:47,255
UGAKI (OFFSCREEN): I
wonder which of you I

26
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,422
should crush first.

27
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,922
Or perhaps, before we start,
I should return this to you.

28
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:57,522
-Put him down now.

29
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:07,722
-Renji, is he OK?

30
00:05:07,755 --> 00:05:08,388
-Hey, Yumichika.

31
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:13,722
-How'd I end up like this.

32
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:17,222
This is not the beautiful ending
I had imagined for myself,

33
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:18,588
not at all.

34
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:21,522
As one of Zaraki's
men, it is my duty

35
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,988
to lose only in
the act of dying.

36
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:26,722
Now, what do I tell him?

37
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:29,188
I can never face the
captain like this.

38
00:05:29,222 --> 00:05:32,022
UGAKI (OFFSCREEN): Ah, so
he's still breathing, is he?

39
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:33,855
You soul reapers are persistent.

40
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:35,055
I must admit.

41
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:36,188
-Coward.

42
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:38,655
Why don't you come
out here and face us?

43
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,188
Are you afraid?

44
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:44,588
[laughing]

45
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:45,688
-All right then.

46
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:47,155
If he won't come out
on his own, then we're

47
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:49,022
just going to have
to destroy his doll

48
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:50,388
and then drag him out here.

49
00:05:50,422 --> 00:05:53,888
-Hey, Ichigo, I'd like you
to stand aside and leave

50
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:55,955
this one to me.

51
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,855
Look, I have nothing
against battling as a team.

52
00:05:58,888 --> 00:06:01,555
Kisuke Urahara taught me
that solo attacks aren't

53
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:03,822
the only way to fight
an enemy, and I finally

54
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:05,288
understand that now.

55
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:07,022
Just the same, I've
been thinking lately

56
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:09,288
that all this teamwork
has made me soft.

57
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:11,688
I think that I may have begun
depending on others too much

58
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:13,155
and letting down my guard.

59
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:15,322
-What exactly are you saying?

60
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:18,622
-It's like Yumichika said,
the way of the soul reaper

61
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:21,122
is the one-on-one fight, and
the only good way to lose

62
00:06:21,155 --> 00:06:23,355
is to die in the end.

63
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:26,588
So if I'm going to die, then
I'm going to go all out.

64
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:28,555
-But Renji--

65
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,255
-I couldn't even save a
single child in that fight

66
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:33,888
the other day.

67
00:06:33,922 --> 00:06:36,055
While it was happening,
there was a moment

68
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:38,822
where I hesitating, thinking
that somehow one of you

69
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:40,588
might come along to help me.

70
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,688
As a result, I put
that kid in danger.

71
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:53,955
I could feel it.

72
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:56,122
Since coming here to
the world of the living,

73
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:57,588
I've only gotten softer.

74
00:06:57,622 --> 00:07:00,888
If I don't somehow get my spirit
back to where it was before,

75
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:03,888
then how can I return
to the soul society?

76
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:06,588
Besides, we know there
are other Bounts.

77
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:08,322
You're going to need
to save your stamina,

78
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:10,888
or else you won't have
anything left to finish this.

79
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:12,655
-Renji, wait.

80
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:14,888
I think that--

81
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:16,855
-A lieutenant of the
13 Court Guard Squads

82
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:18,622
is offering to fight
alone on your behalf.

83
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:21,255
Quit complaining.

84
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:21,755
-OK.

85
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:26,322
-All right, you.

86
00:07:26,355 --> 00:07:28,288
I'm going to take you on myself.

87
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,488
-You really want to
fight Gesell one-on-one?

88
00:07:31,522 --> 00:07:33,455
How reckless of you.

89
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:35,355
Gesell, crush him.

90
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:43,488
-Bankai.

91
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:11,855
Hihio Zabimaru.

92
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:32,088
-Renji, look out.

93
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:35,055
-Zabimaru!

94
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:37,555
I'm using my spiritual
pressure to hold

95
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:39,888
Zabimaru's blade
segments together.

96
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:43,022
As you can see, I am able to
separate or join them at will.

97
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,155
As a result, they're impervious
to your blade's attacks and you

98
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:47,055
cannot break them.

99
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:59,255
-Well, that's pretty
damn impressive.

100
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:03,455
-I suppose, but it's
lacking in beauty.

101
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:07,188
-I'll finish this
once and for all, now.

102
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:09,755
-It can't be helped.

103
00:09:09,788 --> 00:09:13,088
[roar]

104
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:14,255
-What the hell's this.

105
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,688
UGAKI (OFFSCREEN):
Perhaps fighting

106
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,155
this battle your way wasn't
such a good idea after all.

107
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:53,255
-Renji.

108
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:53,822
-No.

109
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:54,655
Don't interfere.

110
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:55,688
-Why not?

111
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:57,588
-Remember what he told you.

112
00:09:57,622 --> 00:09:59,355
Zaraki's style is one-on-one.

113
00:09:59,388 --> 00:10:02,155
-But Renji isn't even
a member of Squad 11.

114
00:10:02,188 --> 00:10:02,788
-Not now.

115
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:04,188
But he was once.

116
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:07,322
And anyone who's ever been a
member of Zaraki's Squad 11

117
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:10,522
carries that spirit with them,
even long after they leave.

118
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:11,755
-You've got to be kidding.

119
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:14,055
RENJI (OFFSCREEN): Ichigo!

120
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:15,855
Just shut up for a
change and watch.

121
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:17,688
Would you?

122
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:20,455
You get to see me turn this
whole damn thing around.

123
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:21,855
-Renji!

124
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,822
UGAKI (OFFSCREEN): Ah really?

125
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:25,955
But how?

126
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:28,655
You don't have many
options left now do you?

127
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:35,155
What's this?

128
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:37,622
Master Kariya, a
soul reaper has just

129
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:39,522
appeared before the Quincy.

130
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,688
-So they have arrived.

131
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:43,922
UGAKI (OFFSCREEN):
What should we do?

132
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:46,022
-This changes the situation.

133
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:48,922
Ugaki, you need to
finish your fight.

134
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:51,755
UGAKI (OFFSCREEN): I
understand, Master.

135
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:53,722
RENJI (OFFSCREEN): So
you've come out to play.

136
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:03,788
UGAKI (OFFSCREEN): Your fighting
spirit is quite impressive.

137
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:06,022
I didn't expect
you to confront me,

138
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:09,322
knowing it would
certainly mean your doom.

139
00:11:09,355 --> 00:11:11,488
But regardless of how
foolish it would seem

140
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:14,255
and how easy it will be
for me to finish you off,

141
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:16,422
if it is death you want,
soul reaper, then I

142
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:19,088
will respect your feelings
and use Gesell's power

143
00:11:19,122 --> 00:11:22,255
to destroy you and your snake.

144
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:24,022
I suggest you prepare to die.

145
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,755
Gesell, finish him off.

146
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:33,722
[roaring]

147
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:34,388
-All right.

148
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:35,388
Higa Zekko.

149
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:57,788
[painful screaming]

150
00:11:57,822 --> 00:12:00,655
-What has he done to Gesell?

151
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:01,522
Damn it.

152
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:02,522
Now I've got to retreat.

153
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:27,255
-Who is that?

154
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,088
UGAKI (OFFSCREEN):
Renji, there's the Bount.

155
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:31,322
The bastard was controlling
his doll from behind there

156
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:31,988
all this time.

157
00:12:37,655 --> 00:12:38,622
-Whoa.

158
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:40,222
How can this be?

159
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:40,722
Impossible.

160
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:44,855
-Ugaki, you have served me well.

161
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:46,522
UGAKI (OFFSCREEN): Master, help.

162
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:47,255
-I bid you adieu.

163
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:51,622
-Don't abandon me now.

164
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:53,055
Master, wait.

165
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:54,322
How dare you do this?

166
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:07,522
I've lost control of him.

167
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:17,555
Kariya, how could you turn your
back on me after all of this.

168
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,355
I fought this fight
perfectly just as you said.

169
00:13:20,388 --> 00:13:23,322
Gesell, stop!

170
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:24,788
Gesell, it's me.

171
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:25,788
What are you doing?

172
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:33,255
[screaming]

173
00:13:38,288 --> 00:13:39,022
-Renji.

174
00:13:39,055 --> 00:13:39,788
Damn.

175
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:41,122
-You go on ahead, Ichigo.

176
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:42,822
I'll stay and take
care of Renji.

177
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:43,655
-Wait.

178
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:45,655
What are you talking about now?

179
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:47,588
-As it happens, I
owe a debt to Renji,

180
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:51,022
and now is the time
for me to repay it.

181
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:52,322
Go quickly.

182
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:53,255
-Hey.

183
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:53,755
Wait.

184
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:17,652
-Renji, where are you!

185
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:19,319
Yumichika!

186
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:20,419
Renji!

187
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:20,919
Yumichika!

188
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:25,386
Where are they?

189
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:31,119
KARIYA (OFFSCREEN): Are
you the sole survivor then?

190
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,852
-You bastard.

191
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:53,552
-Just how many of my
precious and valuable Bounts

192
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:56,019
do you intend to destroy
before you're done?

193
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,619
We're a small tribe already.

194
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:00,052
Few in numbers.

195
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:02,819
-What's your point?

196
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:03,719
FEMALE WHISPER: Demon.

197
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:06,452
MALE WHISPER: Demon.

198
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:12,052
FEMALE WHISPER: Dream.

199
00:15:12,086 --> 00:15:12,886
MALE WHISPER: Dream.

200
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:18,786
FEMALE WHISPER: Evil.

201
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:19,552
MALE WHISPER: Evil.

202
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:25,319
FEMALE WHISPER: Fallen.

203
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:27,219
MALE WHISPER: Fallen.

204
00:15:27,252 --> 00:15:31,219
-I would have preferred that you
were buried along Gesell, but--

205
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:31,952
-What?

206
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:34,352
-No matter.

207
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:36,352
-You'll see you haven't
changed anything,

208
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:38,486
and I will still
get what I seek even

209
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,819
if it takes a little longer now.

210
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:44,652
-How can this be?

211
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:47,252
Impossible.

212
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:49,052
-You monster.

213
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:50,819
And I'll bet it was
you who deliberately

214
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:52,819
collapsed the wall
shielding him.

215
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,619
-No, I didn't.

216
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:57,352
I suspect the foundation
was weakened in the attack

217
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:58,986
by the red-headed soul reaper.

218
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:02,119
Believe what you like,
but the fact is the wall

219
00:16:02,152 --> 00:16:03,752
came down on its own.

220
00:16:03,786 --> 00:16:06,586
-And you call your
Bounts valuable.

221
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:08,486
How valuable can
they really be to you

222
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,852
when you used one of them
as a pathetic pawn just

223
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,819
to slow us down?

224
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:15,519
-Not part of the plan
I can assure you,

225
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:19,152
but events are moving
faster than anticipated.

226
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,752
My tribe and I must
begin making preparations

227
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:24,086
to leave the world
of the living.

228
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:26,419
-To leave the world
of the living?

229
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,152
So do you really
plan on connecting

230
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:29,586
this world with Hueco Mundo?

231
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:38,386
Could it be that you're--
you're in this with Aizen?

232
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:51,486
[laugh]

233
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,819
-I need assistance from no one.

234
00:16:53,852 --> 00:16:56,919
Begin preparations.

235
00:16:56,952 --> 00:17:08,719
-[speaking foreign language]

236
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,852
-What the hell is that?

237
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:20,286
KARIYA (OFFSCREEN):
It's our Senkaimon.

238
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,819
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Impossible.

239
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:22,519
-Oh.

240
00:17:22,552 --> 00:17:24,919
I think you understand.

241
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:26,586
Powerful Bounts
who have absorbed

242
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,019
a large number of souls are
able to manipulate space.

243
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:32,552
I, myself, have
long had this power.

244
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:36,152
-Shall I take over
the controls, Koga?

245
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:36,886
-Go ahead.

246
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,319
I wish now that I
had finished you

247
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,686
off when I had the opportunity.

248
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:45,286
-Oh yeah?

249
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,152
-Now, let's get started.

250
00:17:50,186 --> 00:17:51,752
From what I know
about you I think

251
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:54,152
you'll be a good
test for my powers.

252
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:54,652
-All right.

253
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:01,452
But I intend to destroy
you and your damn gate.

254
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:02,452
[laugh]

255
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:16,852
-No way.

256
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:42,186
[grunting]

257
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:52,086
-What's going on?

258
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,752
I could have sworn
that I made contact.

259
00:18:58,552 --> 00:19:00,452
He managed to block
Zangetsu unarmed.

260
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:06,119
-Mabashi.

261
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:07,519
-Huh?

262
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:11,219
-The next time you feel like
getting drunk off living souls,

263
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:14,319
you should remember what you
have just witnessed here.

264
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:17,786
That is the essence of a
Bount who has gained power.

265
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:18,286
-Ha.

266
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:28,119
-Are you finished?

267
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:32,586
[groaning]

268
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:38,252
-You've yet to
test my abilities,

269
00:20:38,286 --> 00:20:40,186
even in the slightest.

270
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:42,219
And what about your Bankai?

271
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:43,419
-What?

272
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:44,086
-Oh yes.

273
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,252
I know all about it.

274
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,786
I know that you are
the only one who

275
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:49,152
can use his Bankai in
the world of the living

276
00:20:49,186 --> 00:20:50,952
without restrictions.

277
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:54,819
That's why I thought you would
be a good test of my powers.

278
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:55,686
Get your Zanpakuto.

279
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:10,086

[grunting]

281
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,352
-I guess you're finished.

282
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:22,519
-You may think so.

283
00:21:22,552 --> 00:21:23,652
But you're wrong.

284
00:21:23,686 --> 00:21:25,719
-[laugh] I see.

285
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:27,252
Well, it would be
a shame for you

286
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,452
to die without knowing what
this was all about, so I suppose

287
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:32,886
there's no harm in
telling you what

288
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:35,219
the Bounts' true objectives are.

289
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,952
-Who cares?

290
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:39,119
-But Master, you can't.

291
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:44,352
-There's nothing to worry about.

292
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,886
As far as I can remember,
it's been out in the open

293
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,519
since the beginning.

294
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:52,119
Connecting the world of the
living with Hueco Mundo though,

295
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:54,586
that's just an explanation
the soul society came up

296
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,552
with on their own when
they couldn't figure out

297
00:21:56,586 --> 00:21:58,352
what was really going on.

298
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:00,586
What good would something
like that do anyway?

299
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:05,452
The Bounts are not
heading to Hueco Mundo.

300
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:08,286
I can guarantee you that.

301
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,552
We're going to the soul society.

302
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:11,519
-What?

303
00:22:11,552 --> 00:22:12,052
Why?

304
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:17,119
-To exact our revenge.

305
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:20,386
We're returning to the
soul society, where

306
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:22,219
all Bounts were first created.

it true that the Bounts

plan to go the soul society?

we've got to go back.

But I haven't even gone
shopping or sightseeing yet.

Ichigo, you have to tell me
about some interesting places
