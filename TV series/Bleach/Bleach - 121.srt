VOICEOVER: Soul Reapers.

3
00:01:50,815 --> 00:01:54,048
The spiritual guardians to
the world of the living.

4
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:56,782
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

5
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:59,715
of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

6
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:02,448
Sosuke Aizen, who
betrayed the Soul Society

7
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:06,648
and left the Seireitei in chaos
has set his plan into motion,

8
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:09,482
and the battle between the
Arrancars and the Soul Reapers

9
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:13,248
has finally begun
to manifest itself.

-Dance, Sode no Shirayuki.

11
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:17,215
Some no mai.

00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:20,515
Tsukishiro!

13
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:26,815
-Which one?

14
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:28,248
Which one of you
is the strongest?

15
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,448
Who's gonna take me on?

16
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:38,415
-Awaken, Snip Tijerita.

VOICEOVER: Captain
Hitsugaya, Renji, and Rangiku

18
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:50,282
found their abilities
challenged as they were forced

19
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:52,948
to face the formidable
power of the Arrancar,

20
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:55,315
and the sight of Rukia
being seriously injured

21
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:57,348
set Ichigo's blood afire.

22
00:02:57,382 --> 00:02:58,215
-You bastard.

00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:01,582

VOICEOVER: Feeling they were
equal to the task, Captain

25
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:10,782
Histugaya and Renji
through their best attacks

26
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,082
at their adversaries,
but the Arrancars

27
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,615
countered by releasing
their Zanpakutos, which

28
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:17,515
rendered the Soul
Reapers' attacks useless.

29
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:24,115
-Huh?

30

MAN (OVER RADIO): Squad 10.

31
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:26,682
Come in, Lieutenant Matsumoto.

32
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:28,648
The restriction removal
has been authorized.

33
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:37,182
-Message received.

34
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:38,082
Captain!

35
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:40,382

36
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:42,648
Gentai Kaijo has been approved.

37
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:46,048
Go full power.

38
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:49,782
-It's finally come.

39
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,382
-About damn time.

40
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:03,848
-What's this?

41
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,682
-Activating Gentei Kaijo.

42
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:11,348
-Activating Gentei Kaijo!

43
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:12,415
-Activating Gentei Kaijo.

44
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:26,282
-They've been
granted Gentei Kaijo?

45
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:27,215
-What is that?

46
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:01,348
-Gentei Kaijo.

47
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:07,215
We captains and lieutenants
of the 13 Court Guard Squads,

48
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:10,182
in order to avoid unnecessarily
influencing the spirits

49
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:11,615
in the world of the living--

50
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:14,482
-Must wear a Gentei Reign,
a spirit restriction seal

51
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,215
in the form of a
squad badge somewhere

52
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:18,048
on our bodies when we come here.

53
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:22,648
It severely restricts
our spiritual powers.

54
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:26,482
-And it can limit
our powers by 80%.

55
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:28,548
That means--

56
00:05:28,582 --> 00:05:30,404
-That now--

57
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:45,897
We're five times stronger!

58
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:58,148
-You're too slow.

59
00:05:58,182 --> 00:05:59,715
When you first came
here, it seemed

60
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:03,082
you were able to move much
faster than you're moving now.

61
00:06:03,115 --> 00:06:05,915
You'll need to be
that fast again.

62
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,782
What's that technique called?

63
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:09,282
-Heh.

64
00:06:15,748 --> 00:06:17,015
It's Sonido.

65
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:17,982
-I see.

66
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:25,782
We have our own technique,
and we call it Slash Step.

67

[groan]

68
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:31,448
-It's over, Shawlong Koufang.

69
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:41,882
-Growl, Haineko!

70
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:43,715
-Ryusenka!

71
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:44,348
-Hikotsu Taiho!

72
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:56,648
[scream]

73
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:02,848
-Enough!

74
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:04,282
We must retreat for now!

75
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:15,148
-It's too late.

76
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:55,582
RANGIKU: Captain!

77
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:56,082

00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,448
Orihime!

80
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,615
Get over here, quickly!

81
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:05,182
Please hurry!

82
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:14,382
-Dammit.

83
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:17,748
That was close.

84
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:19,882
I was lucky that the
Gentei Kaijo gave me

85
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:24,315
the element of surprise, and
I was able to find an opening.

86
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:26,315
If he'd been at full
strength from the beginning

87
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:28,515
of the fight, I might not
have been so fortunate.

88
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,182
I sure as hell hope
all the other Arrancars

89
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:35,615
aren't as powerful
as those two were.

90
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,748
Because if that's true,
we've got trouble.

91
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:39,248
Ichigo--

92
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,182
-Argh!

93
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:02,648
Come on, jerk!

94
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:04,348
What's that idiot doing?

95
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:06,982
I'm gonna crush his balls
when he gets back here.

96
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:10,382
KEIGO: Hey.

97
00:09:10,415 --> 00:09:13,215
I'm back.

98
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:14,615
-I'm back?

99
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:16,015
Keigo, you jerk!

100
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:18,315
How long's it take to get some
juice from a vending machine?

101
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:20,415
You have to squeeze the-- huh?

102
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:22,982
-Well, you see, it's like this.

103
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:46,248
[moaning]

104
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:53,982
-See, um-- well, uh-- here's
what kind of happened, sis.

105
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:56,182
I was going to buy the
juice, and I saw these guys

106
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:57,582
just lying there in the road.

107
00:09:57,615 --> 00:10:00,448
And when I rescued them, I kind
of forgot about buying juice.

108
00:10:00,482 --> 00:10:01,915
And then I guess
I told them they

109
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:04,115
could stay at our
house for a while.

110
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:05,215
Ah!

111
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,615
But if you're absolutely
not cool with that,

112
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,182
I suppose I could try to suck up
enough birth to tell these guys

113
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:11,348
that there's no roo, and
I'll just to-- ha ha--

114
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:15,315
-Why, you-- you did an
incredibly good deed!

115
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,282
-Don't kill me!

116
00:10:19,682 --> 00:10:21,082
-Oh!

117
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,115
Wow!

118
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:23,482
You're gonna let them
both stay with us?

119
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:25,915
Well, you know me, I'm
totally cool with that!

120
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:26,682
-Wait a minute.

121
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:28,548
Have you lost it?

122
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:30,515
-What?

123
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,015
-That's not what I meant.

124
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:35,382
I meant, shouldn't we
check with Mom and Dad?

125
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:38,715
I mean, they might
not-- you know--

126
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:40,048
-Well, hello.

127
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:41,615
I'm Keigo's sister, Mizuho.

128
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:43,682
-We ne talk!

129
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:45,882
-You need to calm yourself
down and put a cork in it.

130
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:48,248
After all, you're the one who
brought 'em here, remember?

131
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,448
-Yeah, but you
see-- I was counting

132
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:52,182
on you being the bad
guy and telling them

133
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:54,048
they couldn't stay, 'cause
I didn't have the guts!

134
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:56,348
I knew once they got a look
at you, you'd scare 'em off,

135
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:58,782
and I wouldn't have to
worry about 'em anymore.

136
00:10:58,815 --> 00:10:59,282
-Oh.

137
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:01,115
I see.

138
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:02,015
Too bad.

139
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:03,848
I'm fine with them here.

140
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:05,182
-How can you be fine with that?

141
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:06,415
They're complete strangers!

142
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:11,215
They might be fugitives
from prison, or something!

143
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:13,415
-Don't worry.

144
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:15,948
I want to be the kind of
sister who trusts her brother's

145
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:17,715
judgement, even if
he chooses to bring

146
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:19,682
a total stranger into my home.

147
00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:22,182
That's the kind of sister
I truly want to become.

148
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,582
-Cut that out!

149
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:25,982
Don't give me that stuff about
the sister you want to become.

150
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:27,315
That's a bunch of nonsense!

151
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:30,048
-The truth is I love
guys with shaved heads.

152
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:30,815
-A-ha!

153
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:32,248
The real truth comes out!

154
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:34,482
And by the way, he doesn't
have a shaved head.

155
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:35,448
The guy's bald!

156
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,482
-Who says I'm bald?

157
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:46,048
-What?

158
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:47,715
Did I say that?

159
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,848
You're not bald.

160
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,082
-Argh!

161
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:13,548
Dammit.

162
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:28,182
What is this guy?

163
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:37,615
[groan]

164
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:03,048
-Yah!

165
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,366

[laughter]

168
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:47,251
-Is that all there
is to your Bankai?

169
00:15:47,284 --> 00:15:51,184
I gotta say, you've turned out
to be a real disappointment.

170
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:55,851
You used your Bankai, and all
it gives you is average speed?

171
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:56,351
Huh?

172
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:05,017
-Getsuga Tensho!

173
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:20,884
-Damn.

174
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,484
What was that?

175
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:24,651
Ulquiorra didn't mention
that move in his report

176
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,684
about your attacks, Soul Repaer.

177
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,784
Not a word.

178
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:30,817
-So maybe I won't be
disappointing after all,

179
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:31,317
Arrancar.

180
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:37,884
-Guess I might have
been wrong about you.

181
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:42,451
It may turn out that you're
worth killing after all.

182

VOICE: Ichigo.

183
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,751
What are you smirking about?

184
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:52,251
You're acting awfully confident.

185
00:16:52,284 --> 00:16:54,084
Huh?

186
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:55,717
-Hold on.

187
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:57,917
Just a little longer.

188
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:01,784
-Do you really think you
can handle this alone?

189
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:02,784
ICHIGO: Dammit.

190
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:04,817
He barely has a scratch.

191
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:07,184
He took the full force
of my Getsuga Tensho,

192
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:08,951
and he acts like it was nothing.

193
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:12,417
The Black Getsuga
Tensho is his technique.

194
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:16,184
If I use it, it might allow
him to control more quickly.

195
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:19,051
But the reality is I can only
use it two or three more times

196
00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:21,184
before he'll take
control, anyway.

197
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:23,817
What do I do?

198
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:25,751
-Hey, Soul Reaper.

199
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:29,717
Just how long are you
gonna stand there?

200
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:30,217
-Ichigo.

201
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:40,917
-All right, then.

202
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:41,751
Now it's my turn.

203
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:54,617
-Put your sword away, Grimmjow.

204
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:57,017
-Tosen?

205
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:58,551
-Tosen?

206
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:01,651
He's the captain who
defected with Aizen.

207
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:04,651
-You want to explain
to me why you're here?

208
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:07,651
-You ask why?

209
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:10,484
You can't be serious.

210
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:13,751
You chose to invade the world
of the living on your own,

211
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:17,417
and you took five Arrancars
without permission.

212
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:20,284
Then you lost them in battle.

213
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:22,484
You have disobeyed orders.

214
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:26,384
You understand that
much, don't you?

215
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,717
Lord Aizen is quite
upset with you, Grimmjow.

216
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,417
Come.

217
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:35,984
Your punishment for these acts
will be decided in Hueco Mundo.

218
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:39,651
-Fine, then.

219
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,784
Let's go.

220
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:42,417
-Hey, you!

221
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:43,517
Hold on!

222
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:46,051
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

223
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,451
-Shut up, Soul Reaper.

224
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:49,584
I'm going home.

225
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:51,384
Back home to Hueco Mundo.

226
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,384
-No, you're not!

227
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:56,651
You come here and you attack
us, and then you just leave?

228
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:58,517
You gotta be kidding me!

229
00:18:58,551 --> 00:18:59,884
Get back down here!

230
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:02,884
This fight isn't over
until I say it is, dammit!

231
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,284
-Get over it!

232
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:07,184
The only reason why you're still
alive is because I'm leaving.

233
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:10,551
Consider yourself lucky.

234
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,817
That attack you
just used obviously

235
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,484
took its toll as well.

236
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:17,651
I can see it in your face.

237
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:21,151
I'd say you have about two
or three attacks left in you.

238
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:26,684
But still, even if you were able
to do it a hundred more times,

239
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:30,184
you wouldn't stand a chance of
beating me in my release mode.

240
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:31,051
-Release mode?

241
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:32,717
What the hell's that?

242
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:35,084
-Don't forget my
name, Soul Reaper.

243
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:39,351
And you'd better pray that
you never hear it again.

244

Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez.

245
00:19:42,017 --> 00:19:45,284
Because the next time you hear
my name, you'll be a dead man.

246
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,084
I promise.

247
00:20:12,184 --> 00:20:14,351
-Where did the Arrancar go?

248
00:20:14,384 --> 00:20:15,184
Back to Hueco Mundo?

249
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:21,417
Did you win?

250
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:27,651
-I lost.

251
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:31,984
-You stupid idiot.

252
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:34,151
The fact that you're still
alive means that you won.

253
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:40,651
-You know that's not true.

254
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:43,617
If you were me, you'd
feel the same way.

255
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:51,917
Truth is, I haven't been
able to protect anyone.

256
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,384
I couldn't defeat our enemies.

257
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,784
I was useless.

258
00:20:56,817 --> 00:20:57,717
I lost.

259
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:03,584
Grimmjow.

260
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,851
-Kisuke.

261
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:28,284
Kisuke.

262
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:30,117
-It's go be OK, Ururu.

263
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:05,684
-Welcome back, Grimmjow.

GRIMMJOW: The Arrancar used
some sort of nerve radar

266
00:23:49,534 --> 00:23:52,267
called Pesquisa to search
out spiritual pressure.

267
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,234
Just think, Ichigo.

268
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,934
If you had something
like that, you'd

269
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,400
be able to find where we are.

270
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,600
ICHIGO: Shut up.

271
00:23:57,634 --> 00:23:59,234
I won't need that to find
where you're hiding out.

272
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:02,800
GRIMMJOW: We'll have a warm
welcome waiting for you.

KON: Illustrated
Guide to Soul Reapers.

275
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:17,267
-Stop beating me like a drum!

276
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,034
-No matter how you slice
it, when your sword cuts us,

277
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:22,200
it makes our wounds
heal instantly!

278
00:24:22,234 --> 00:24:22,700
Ha ha!

279
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:25,500
-Yah!

280
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:26,867
Ah?

281
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,400
Allow me to explain.

282
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:31,534
Every time Hisagomaru heals a
wound or cut, a red gauge on it

283
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:32,600
rises like a thermometer.

284
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:34,634
And when it is
completely full, it

285
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:37,334
changes automatically into
the Vermilion Hisagomaru.

286
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:39,034
Then it has the
amazing attack power

287
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:41,134
of spitting out all the
injuries it's absorbed.

288
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:42,667
-Yeah.
