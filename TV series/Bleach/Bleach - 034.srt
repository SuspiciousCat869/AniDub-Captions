2
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:48,687
[groaning]

3
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:06,621
-Ichigo!

4
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:08,887
[panting]

5
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,921
-This doesn't look good!

6
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:13,054
Ichigo, answer me.

7
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:14,354
Hey!

8
00:02:14,387 --> 00:02:15,021
Damn it, Ichigo.

9
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:22,954
-[gasp]

10
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:28,754
Someone's coming.

11
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:31,587
Looks like three-- or
maybe even more-- of them.

12
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:32,754
-Then let's get out of here.

13
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:34,621
This is no time for a fight.

14
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,954
-Right.

15
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:40,454
[grunt]

16
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:54,354
-Orioka?

17
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:55,787
-That's Lieutenant Abarai!

18
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:58,254
-[gasp]

19
00:02:58,287 --> 00:02:59,721
-Lieutenant Abarai!

20
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:01,021
Sir, are you all right?

21
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:02,954
Sir!

22
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,487
IZURU (VOICEOVER):
This can't be!

23
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:07,354
Surely Abarai could
not have been defeated.

24
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,587
-Whoever did this
can't be far off.

25
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,687
Should we begin a search?

26
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:13,087
-No.

27
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:16,154
Our first priority here must be
to take care of the lieutenant.

28
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:17,921
Call for a stretcher quickly.

29
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:21,154
Let's get back to the barracks.

30
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:22,721
GANJU: You're going
to heal him, huh?

31
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:25,054
And just how do you
plan to do that.

32
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:26,987
You have no instruments
and no medicine.

33
00:03:27,021 --> 00:03:28,087
Actually,

34
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:29,221
HANATARO: Actually,
the other Soul Reapers

35
00:03:29,254 --> 00:03:31,554
can only use their
spirit energy for combat.

36
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,521
But we members of Squad
Four can use ours to heal.

37
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:35,987
It's practically are only power.

38
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:41,721
[laugh] It's a good thing, too,
since we certainly are much

39
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,654
use when it comes to fighting.

40
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:46,387
-Get started then.

41
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,621
Because if you ask me, those
wounds of his look pretty bad.

42
00:03:53,187 --> 00:03:55,687
HANATARO: They are,
as one would expect.

43
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:57,954
After all, he took direct
hits from the Zanpakuto

44
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,087
of the Soul Reaper lieutenant.

45
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:03,121
By all rights, he
should be dead.

46
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:04,954
His will to live is incredible.

47
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:09,054
Don't worry, though.

48
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:11,287
I believe I still have
a chance to heal him.

49
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:12,954
I just need one night to do it.

50
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:17,787
MOMO: It's Renji!

51
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:19,954
-When I found him,
he was unconscious.

52
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:22,554
If only I'd gotten there in
time to fight alongside him,

53
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:25,821
then this never
would have happened.

54
00:04:25,854 --> 00:04:28,687
-[whimper] Don't
blame yourself, Izuru.

55
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:31,254
None of this is your fault.

56
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:35,387
-At any rate, the main thing
now is to take care of him.

57
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:38,521
I'll go make the call for
the emergency relief team.

58
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:39,821
-That is out of the question.

59
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:43,821
-Huh?

60
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:45,421
-Huh?

61
00:04:45,454 --> 00:04:46,487
Captain Kuchiki.

62
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:49,021
-I want Renji taken to prison.

63
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:51,421
But Captain, Renji's
been badly hurting

64
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:52,921
fighting Ryoka by himself.

65
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:53,887
Without treatment, he--

66
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:55,987
-Then I'm afraid he'll die.

67
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:58,654
It was his choice to
enter that fight alone.

68
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:01,721
In such a situation,
a defeat is forbidden.

69
00:05:01,754 --> 00:05:05,487
I have no use for a fool who
does not understand that.

70
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:08,921
The very sight of him
still breathing offends me.

71
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:10,654
Take him away!

72
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:12,921
MOMO: [gasp] How dare you!

73
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:15,354
Is that how you treat your men?

74
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:16,287
Renji's been--

75
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:16,787
-Momo!

76
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:17,287
-Izuru?

77
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:22,654
-Oh, a thousand pardon't
Captain Kuchiki.

78
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:25,787
She didn't mean it.

79
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:28,754
-[whimper] I didn't
mean it Captain.

80
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:29,787
Please forgive me.

81
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:43,654
-I'm so sorry, but we
have to follow orders.

82
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:45,687
We must take Renji to prison.

83
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,354
-But he could die!

84
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:48,987
ICHIMARU: He's cold
as ice, isn't he?

85
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:51,954
-[gasp] Captain Ichimaru!

86
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:55,321
-Makes you wonder if he's
even got a heart inside him.

87
00:05:55,354 --> 00:06:01,387
He is one scary guy for sure,
that captain of Squad Six.

88
00:06:01,421 --> 00:06:03,554
But don't worry about Renji.

89
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:06,254
I'll call in Squad Four so
you won't get in trouble.

90
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:08,887
-Would you do that, really?

91
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:10,054
-Absolutely.

92
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:11,587
It's no problem.

93
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,887
Come on, Izuru.

94
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:15,187
-Yes, sir.

95
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:16,521
-Thank you, Captain Ichimaru.

96
00:06:21,054 --> 00:06:21,521
-Wow!

97
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:22,221
-[gasp]

98
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:23,721
-Renji is in bad shape.

99
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:24,921
What a mess.

100
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:26,187
Toshiro!

101
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:26,921
-Hey, hey.

102
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,454
Mind your manners now.

103
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,754
You still have to address
me as a captain, you know.

104
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:32,454
-Oh, you can forget about that!

105
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:34,554
What is it with you captains
always creeping around

106
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:35,821
silently?

107
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,887
And what were you doing
sneaking up behind me, anyway?

108
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:39,321
Wait a sec.

109
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:40,687
What are you doing
here, Toshiro?

110
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:42,954
Where's your lieutenant.

111
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:45,687
-I have come here to warn you.

112
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,421
-About what?

113
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,787
-Be careful dealing
with Squad Three.

114
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:53,021
-What does that mean?

115
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:54,654
You mean Izuru?

116
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:56,821
-Actually, what I
mean was Ichimaru.

117
00:06:56,854 --> 00:06:59,954
But watch Izuru, too.

118
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,054
-Saved by the security alert.

119
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,454
Convenient timing,
hey, Ichimaru?

120
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:08,221
-Why don't you just
come out and say it.

121
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:12,087
You're not making much sense.

122
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:15,821
-You don't really think you'll
get away with this, do you?

123
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:19,187
Just remember, don't
underestimate me, Ichimaru.

124
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:25,654
-It's strange.

125
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:27,454
I wish that I can give
you more specifics.

126
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:32,954
Just be careful.

127
00:07:39,587 --> 00:07:41,954
YAMAMOTO: The situation
has become critical.

128
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:45,787
As a result of recent events,
the 13 court guard squads

129
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:48,321
are now short by one lieutenant.

130
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:50,821
Obviously, we can
no longer afford

131
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:53,487
to leave these matters in the
hands of lower-ranked officers

132
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:54,454
and members.

133
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:56,921
Subsequently, no
disciplinary measures

134
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:59,387
will be taken against
Ichimaru for his earlier,

135
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,821
independent actions.

136
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:03,821
-Thank you, sir.

137
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:06,087
YAMAMOTO: Furthermore,
senior officers,

138
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:08,387
including lieutenants,
shall hereby

139
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,521
be allowed to carry the
Zanpakuto at all times,

140
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:14,421
with full war-time
usage of their powers.

141
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:18,121
-They're allowed to carry
the Zanpakuto at all times?

142
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:20,821
Full release as in wartime, hey?

143
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:23,387
I couldn't be happier.

144
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,554
-Ha.

145
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,621
If someone hadn't allowed
the Ryoka to escape

146
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:28,454
in the first place,
none of these measures

147
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,187
would be necessary.

148
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:31,187
-Now, now.

149
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:33,187
What's the use of
talking like that?

150
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,987
-Anyway, he's fair game
now, just the way I want it.

151
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:43,154
[laughs]

152
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:43,654
-Everyone!

153
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:49,321
Let us declare all-out
war on these Ryoka!

154
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:07,321
-[groan]

155
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:09,821
-Hey, it's going to see
you're finally awake.

156
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:11,387
It's been awhile.

157
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:14,354
-Hanataro, where am I?

158
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,554
-We're back underground,
and we're safe.

159
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:19,387
Try not to move too much, or
you'll open up your wounds.

160
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:21,387
-Wounds?

161
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:23,821
Oh yeah, that's right.

162
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:27,287
I fought Renji.

163
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:29,587
-Ichigo, lie down!

164
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:32,021
-Thanks, Hanataro,
but I'll be fine now.

165
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:33,187
I've really go to get going.

166
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:34,154
-Are you crazy?

167
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:35,921
You're nowhere near healed.

168
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:39,021
-Chad and the others don't
know where Rukia's being held.

169
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:40,421
I've got to go and find them.

170
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,554
-Ichigo, no!

171
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:44,021
You have to get some rest!

172
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:45,787
-[gasp]

173
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:46,621
-You see?

174
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:48,354
You're not well enough yet.

175
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,154
Give those wounds
a chance to close.

176
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:52,554
You won't even last an
hour in that condition.

177
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:54,421
Ichigo, listen to me!

178
00:09:57,421 --> 00:10:00,854
-[grunt]

179
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:01,854
-Ha!

180
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:03,654
Obviously, he wasn't
ready yet if I

181
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,454
could knock him out that easily.

182
00:10:05,487 --> 00:10:06,687
All right, you idiot.

183
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,387
Sleep until you're healed.

184
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:09,854
-Ganju, no!

185
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:12,654
Oh, that's great.

186
00:10:12,687 --> 00:10:15,654
Another wound I have to heal.

187
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:18,187
Did you have to be
so rough, Ganju?

188
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:20,754
-Hey, you wanted him to
stop, and I stopped him.

189
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,821
Don't complain
about how I did it.

190
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:25,687
HANATARO (VOICEOVER):
It's strange.

191
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:27,887
I thought the wound in his
left shoulder and chest

192
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:30,421
would be much deeper than that.

193
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:32,621
At first, it looked
like a fatal wound.

194
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:39,221
I wonder if the mask I found
inside [? hishiaksu ?] absorbed

195
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:40,354
some of the blow.

196
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,621
Something that could withstand
a direct slash from Lieutenant

197
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:10,521
Abarai's Zanpakuto-- I
wonder what it could be.

198
00:11:10,554 --> 00:11:14,321
It looks too much like
the face of a Hollow.

199
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:15,921
What does it mean, Ichigo?

200
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:24,854
RUKIA: Excuse me, guards.

201
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:25,887
-Hm?

202
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:28,254
-If it's not too much
trouble, could you

203
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,654
tell me a little about
what's going on in the city?

204
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,221
Have you heard any recent news?

205
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:37,387
-Uh, well, we don't
know any of the details.

206
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:39,521
But they say that
Lieutenant Abarai

207
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:41,654
was defeated and badly hurt.

208
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:43,621
-[gasp] Oh, Renji.

209
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:01,502
-[groans]

210
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,268
-That's all I can
do for him for now.

211
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:11,302
I'll be back to check
on him tomorrow.

212
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:12,602
-Thank you very much.

213
00:12:26,802 --> 00:12:27,668
Oh, Renji.

214
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:37,102
MOMO (VOICEOVER): Why did you
attack the Ryoka all alone?

215
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:38,935
I don't understand.

216
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,402
Does it have to do with Rukia?

217
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:53,002
-[grunt] [laugh]

218
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:54,435
-[gasp]

219
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,435
Ow!

220
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:06,402
Hey, why do you have to be
so serious all the time?

221
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:09,935
We're not supposed to hurt each
other in practice, you know.

222
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:11,702
-Ah, if you don't
take it seriously,

223
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,202
then you're not learning.

224
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:15,935
OK, now pay attention this time.

225
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:18,902
IZURU: Why not practice
against me instead?

226
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:20,235
-You, Izuru?

227
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:22,935
-It'll be more of a challenge
than beating up on a girl.

228
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,768
-Oh, is that so?

229
00:13:24,802 --> 00:13:26,968
You come here,
and say that, pal!

230
00:13:27,002 --> 00:13:27,802
-No, wait!

231
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,602
That's not what I meant, Momo.

232
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:32,302
-Oh, quit acting so embarrassed.

233
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:34,435
Well, I actually
never thought of you

234
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:36,068
as a sparring partner before.

235
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:38,902
But I supposed it would
be better than nothing.

236
00:13:38,935 --> 00:13:40,302
-Oh, just wait.

237
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:42,268
I think you're going
to be surprised.

238
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:46,068
[grunting]

239
00:13:57,768 --> 00:13:59,435
-Very good, Renji.

240
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:01,235
You have improved.

241
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:02,802
-Well, thanks.

242
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:04,835
I'd say you're much
better now yourself.

243
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:09,435
Huh?

244
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:12,768
Uh, wait here just a second.

245
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,102
Rukia!

246
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:16,202
-Wait, what's all this about?

247
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:16,702
-Huh?

248
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:29,035
MOMO (VOICEOVER): Oh, Renji.

249
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:34,868
-Lieutenant Hinamori, you
are to report immediately

250
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:37,602
to receive special
wartime orders.

251
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:39,835
-What wartime orders?

252
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:44,235
[shouting]

253
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:51,602
-One, all senior-level
officers, including lieutenants,

254
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:54,135
are permitted to wear their
swords within the court.

255
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:57,535
Two, full wartime usage
of one's Zanpakuto

256
00:14:57,568 --> 00:15:02,235
is now permitted, as decreed
by the captain of Squad One

257
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,302
and head captain of the 13
court guard squads, Shigekuni

258
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:06,068
Yamamoto Genryusai.

259
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:09,268
-Yes.

260
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:19,035
MOMO (VOICEOVER):
Wartime orders.

261
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:23,268
Permission to carry swords
and use deadly force.

262
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,635
Why did it have to come to this?

263
00:15:25,668 --> 00:15:28,035
This is not the answer.

264
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:31,268
It certainly won't
bring about peace.

265
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:32,402
[gasp]

266
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:36,702
I can't stop thinking
about Toshiro's warning.

267
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,535
-Be careful dealing
with Squad Three.

268
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:43,435
Just be caeful.

269
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:46,402
MOMO (VOICEOVER): Captain Aizen
may know what it all means.

270
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:58,968
AIZEN: What's the matter, Momo?

271
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:02,302
Are you all right?

272
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,702
-I know it's late.

273
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:07,235
-It's either very late
or it's very early,

274
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:09,235
since it's almost daybreak now.

275
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,735
-I know this is
incredibly rude of me,

276
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:15,468
but can I talk to you for
little while about some things?

277
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:22,702
If you say no, I'll understand.

278
00:16:22,735 --> 00:16:26,568
But I don't know
who else to go to.

279
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:29,935
-Momo, do you really think that
I could possibly turn you away?

280
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:32,035
-Well, I--

281
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:36,468
-Surely you don't think I'm that
heartless, even at this hour?

282
00:16:36,502 --> 00:16:39,368
-No, that's why I came here.

283
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:41,135
-Why don't you come inside?

284
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,602
Today was a difficult
day for everybody.

285
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,068
You can tell me all about it
to your heart's content, Momo.

286
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:56,035
[grunting]

287
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:57,635
-Oh, man, that hurts.

288
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:01,868
-I'm glad you're finally awake.

289
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:03,002
How do you feel?

290
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:05,602
-Damn that Ganju
and his left hook.

291
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:06,268
-I see.

292
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:07,435
So you remember that?

293
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:09,935
-The nerve of that big,
clumsy bastard sucker

294
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:11,402
punching an injured man.

295
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:13,268
You better believe
I remember it.

296
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:14,868
-But just the same,
it's a good thing

297
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:17,168
he stopped you from
going out, Ichigo.

298
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,202
You could have reopened
all your wounds.

299
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:21,335
-Yeah, I guess you're right.

300
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:24,302
Patience has never been
one of my strong suits.

301
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,568
-Actually, Ichigo, you really
ought to rest a little longer.

302
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:29,735
I guarantee you
we're safe down here.

303
00:17:29,768 --> 00:17:33,502
No one's going to come after us.

304
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,102
-I wonder about that.

305
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:37,535
What do you suppose happened
to Renji after the battle?

306
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:39,802
-Uh, well, we didn't
stick around to see.

307
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:42,168
But if he was still
alive, then Squad Four

308
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:46,002
would have been called the
take him for emergency aid.

309
00:17:46,035 --> 00:17:46,702
-Really?

310
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:47,202
-Yes.

311
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:52,368
-Hm.

312
00:17:59,735 --> 00:18:01,468
AIZEN: So what is it, Momo?

313
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:04,335
Wasn't there something specific
you wanted to talk about?

314
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:05,302
-Yes.

315
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,535
I was--

316
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:09,568
-How is Lieutenant Abarai's
recovery coming along?

317
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:13,902
-Oh, um, he's stable and
not in danger anymore.

318
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:16,068
-That's good to hear.

319
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:17,435
You're probably
worried about what

320
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:19,368
was decided at the
meeting, aren't you?

321
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,768
Captain Kuchiki wanted
Renji discharged.

322
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:24,302
But then he backed down
when there were objections.

323
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,535
So Renji will be allowed
to return to his post

324
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:28,268
once he's finally recovered.

325
00:18:28,302 --> 00:18:29,668
-I'm so glad!

326
00:18:29,702 --> 00:18:33,368
And I bet you were the one who
objected, weren't you, Captain?

327
00:18:33,402 --> 00:18:34,735
-I wasn't alone.

328
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:38,002
And most everyone recognizes
that he's an excellent officer.

329
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,802
Despite their
differences, no one

330
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:41,835
in all the 13 court
guard squads would

331
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:44,368
rejoice in Renji's dismissal.

332
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,335
-Good!

333
00:18:46,368 --> 00:18:50,735
-[laugh]

334
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:53,102
-Can I ask a favor?

335
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:55,168
-What is it?

336
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:58,802
-If it wouldn't bother you--
and I promise no more questions,

337
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:01,968
I'll just sit hear
and watch-- could I

338
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:04,302
stay with you awhile longer?

339
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:08,002
-Stay as long as you like, Momo.

340
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:09,002
-Thank you.

341
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:44,435
Oh, dear!

342
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:45,802
I'm sorry, Captain.

343
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:47,968
I was so tired I feel asleep!

344
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:48,535
Captain?

345
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:49,935
[bell ringing]

346
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:50,935
-[gasp]

347
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:53,902
[bell ringing]

348
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:55,868
-[gasp] 10 o'clock!

349
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:58,368
Look at how late I am!

350
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,835
I wish the captain would have
woken me up before he left.

351
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:08,802
I don't know how I'm
going to ever make it

352
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:10,768
to the meeting on time!

353
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:25,668
I'll take the shortcut.

354
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:40,735
I actually made it.

355
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:56,002
[gasp] [scream]

356
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:58,202
-[together] Huh?

357
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:00,602
-Who in the hell
was that screaming?

358
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,135
-I think it was coming
from the eastern wall.

359
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:04,502
-That sounded like it was Momo.

360
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:08,502
Momo!

361
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:09,968
What is it, Momo?

362
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,535
Please, tell me what happened!

363
00:21:11,568 --> 00:21:12,435
Momo, please!

364
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:24,268
[gasp] That's impossible!

365
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:26,635
-[gasp] He was murdered?

366
00:21:31,002 --> 00:21:32,302
MOMO: (SCREAMING) Captain Aizen!

367
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:49,049
[theme music]

368
00:22:49,445 --> 00:22:50,545
ICHIGO: Thank you, Hanataro.

369
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,145
I think I"m finally
recovered now.

370
00:22:52,178 --> 00:22:54,178
HANATARO: It's about the
only thing I'm good for.

371
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:55,778
-As long as we have
Hanataro with us,

372
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:58,611
you can go get yourself cut up
in battle all you want, Ichigo.

373
00:22:58,645 --> 00:22:59,845
ICHIGO: Absolutely not.

374
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,345
GANJU: Oh, don't
be such a pansy.

375
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:02,045
Go for it!

376
00:23:02,078 --> 00:23:02,878
ICHIGO: No, thanks.

377
00:23:02,911 --> 00:23:04,778
GANJU: I said, go get cut up!
