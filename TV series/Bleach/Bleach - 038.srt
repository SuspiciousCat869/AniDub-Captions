you so unreasonable?

What's your purpose?

4
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,775
Why did you come here
in the first place?

5
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:52,675
-I've come to save the
life of Rukia Kuchiki.

00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,008
-Oh, come on.

00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:57,008
Hm, you mean Rukia
the soul reaper

who went missing in the world
of the living a few months ago?

00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:02,942
That's not enough time
for a true friendship.

10
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:04,842
A relationship like
that can't be worth

11
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,608
risking your life over.

12
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:08,508

I don't know very
much about Rukia.

That's not the point.

I might not risk my
life for her but Ichigo

16
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:19,708
wants to save her life.

And that's all I need to know.

What may seem like an
unworthy cause to you

19
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:29,742
is more than enough
reason for me.

-Well, I tried.

00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:34,908
But if you're that determined
it would be insulting

22
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:38,975
for me to ask you to back down.

23
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:40,442
I guess it can't be avoided.

24
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:45,675
Unfortunately, it
means now I'm going

The only reason I
couldn't cut him

86
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,242
is that I'm overwhelmed
by his spiritual pressure.

That's the problem.

If I calm down and sharpen
my spiritual pressure,

00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:54,975
then I should be
able to cut him.

me that his final attack

was that powerful.

What's it about?

120
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:21,008
-It's about Captain Aizen.

121
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,675
He was found dead this morning.

122
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,342
-Hm?

123
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,542
-The cause of death was the
removal of his soul chain

124
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:31,942
and soul sleep and destruction
of his heart by Zanpakuto.

So far, there are no suspects.

It's being investigated
as a murder.

This Ryoka-- it isn't dead yet.

Shall I administer
the killing blow?

145

ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Chad!

146
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:10,196
-Shall I administer
the killing blow?

147
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,763
-Leave him be, Nanao.

148
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,729
That is my responsibility.

-But Captain!

151
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:19,329
One of these same
Ryoka was probably

152
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:22,163
responsible for the
murder of Captain Aizen!

153
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:24,429
-Hm, perhaps.

154
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:27,063
But then again,
maybe they weren't.

155

-Huh?

156
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:29,863
-I'm just saying.

00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:32,429
We don't really know for sure.

Anything is possible.

159
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:37,396
Anyway, there's no need
to kill so unnecessarily.

160
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:39,029
Let's call the
rescue squad and have

161
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:40,863
him put in a cell somewhere.

162
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:44,329
If he or one of his friends is
the killer, all the more reason

163
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:46,563
to keep him alive to find out.

164
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:47,029
Understand?

165
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:51,096
-Yes, Captain.

166
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:52,696
I understand.

167
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:55,529
I'll make the arrangements
with Squad Four at once.

168
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:58,596
My apologies, sir,
for trying to meddle.

169
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:00,829
-Hm.

170
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:02,829
Things seem to be getting
rather complicated.

171
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,063
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Chad!

172
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:13,963
He's alive!

173
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:18,729
It's faint but I can still
feel his spiritual pressure.

174
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,863
So then.

175
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:23,196
What am I waiting for?

176
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:25,263
I have to win this fight.

177
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:35,829
Because if I lose now then Chad
and Orihime and Uryu and Ganju

178
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:40,163
and Hanatoro and
Yoruichi-- all the people

179
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:43,496
who've lent me their
strength-- they'll all die!

180
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,763
I can't be afraid!

181
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:54,229
I don't have the time!

182
00:12:54,263 --> 00:13:02,763
[jingling]

183
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:06,763
-So I see you decided to
stand your ground at last.

184
00:13:06,796 --> 00:13:11,229
Does this mean that you are
prepared to die like a warrior,

185
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:13,296
or does it just mean
you've given up?

186
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,929
-The answer is neither one!

187
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:29,629
[yells]

188
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:32,496
-(IN HEAD) Wait for me Chad.

189
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:35,363
I'll beat this guy.

190
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:38,596
And then I'll save you!

191
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:39,596
[slash] Promise!

192
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:56,763
-Sorry to say, but I don't
feel like dying just yet.

193
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:59,629
Because if I die, then
everyone who is counting on me

194
00:13:59,663 --> 00:14:00,563
will be destroyed too.

195
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:08,029
-(IN HEAD) I can cut him.

196
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:11,229
And if I can cut him,
then I can beat him.

197
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:13,163
I know it now.

198
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:14,396
I know I can win!

199
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:18,796
-What is this?

200
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:21,296
You're thinking you can
beat me now, aren't you?

201
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:30,329
Don't let your guard down yet.

202
00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:34,129
Stay like that, razor sharp.

203
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:38,196
You see, this is
where the fun begins.

204
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:40,763
Now, Ichigo Kurosaki!

205
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:50,096
[giggles]

206
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:52,096
-Kenny looks so happy!

207
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:58,563
[laughing]

208
00:14:58,596 --> 00:14:59,529
[grunts]

209
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:07,496
[yells]

210
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:13,596
-Sosuke Aizen, Captain of
Squad Five, has passed away.

211
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:15,163
When he was taken
down from the wall,

212
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:16,696
his breathing had
already stopped

213
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,429
and nothing more could be done.

214
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:19,996
No Gigai?

215
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,563
Are you certain one wasn't used?

216
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:23,729
-Yes.

217
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:26,396
I investigated every
conceivable angle,

218
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,229
including the
possibility that someone

219
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:30,363
might have used a
substitution body to deceive

220
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,263
other eyes at the
scene of the crime.

221
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:36,129
But in the end, all
of that only served

222
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:40,296
to confirm the reality
of Captain Aizen's death.

223
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:42,629
Of course once all of
this chaos and fighting

224
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:45,729
is finally resolved, a
new Squad Five Captain

225
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:51,663
will be selected by the Central
46 and the other squad leaders.

226
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:56,429
Squad Seven Captain Komamura,
Squad Nine Captain Tosen,

227
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:57,796
thank you for coming.

228
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:59,829
Now please return
to your commands

229
00:15:59,863 --> 00:16:02,496
and rest assured I will soon
pay a visit to the front lines

230
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:02,996
myself.

231
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,296
-It was good of you could
come Captain Tosen and Captain

232
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:21,796
Komamura.

233
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:23,129
How is Captain Aizen?

234
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:27,129
I see.

235
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:30,463
What did Captain Unohana
say, if I may ask?

236
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:34,396
-Only that Captain
Aizen had passed away.

237
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,363
It seems to me that
if we want to get

238
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,929
to the truth behind
Captain Aizen's death,

239
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:41,696
the quickest way will be
first to put an end to all

240
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:44,196
this fighting and confusion.

241
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:47,729
-And by that do you mean--

242
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:51,329
-Ah, unfortunately yes.

243
00:16:51,363 --> 00:16:54,729
I'm going to have to enter this
fight whether I like it or not.

244
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,363
Abstaining from
battle is always best,

245
00:16:56,396 --> 00:16:59,963
but it seems things aren't
going to be so easy this time.

246
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:02,563
Ah, if it weren't
for fighting we

247
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:05,129
could avoid so many
misunderstandings,

248
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:07,896
so many ugly emotions
brought to the surface,

249
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,696
so many ugly tragedies.

250
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:14,763
-(IN HEAD) Finally the
time has come for Captain

251
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:17,196
Tozen's Suzumushi
to be released.

252
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:21,163
-I loathe fighting
with all my heart.

253
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:35,963
[screams]

254
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:49,729
[gasps]

255
00:17:49,763 --> 00:17:55,196
[jingling]

256
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:56,696
-That's good.

257
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:57,396
Good reaction.

258
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,596
Your concentration is improving.

259
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:09,729
Unlike earlier, you can actually
hear my bells ringing now.

260
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:11,729
I only wear the bells
and this eye patch

261
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:14,163
to make things harder so
I get more enjoyment out

262
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:16,029
of my battles.

263
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:17,929
I'm glad you're taking
advantage of them.

264
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:21,129
Because otherwise they
don't serve any purpose.

265
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:23,396
-Damnit.

266
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:25,263
You take me for a fool?

267
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:26,796
I suppose that's
also the reason you

268
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,496
won't call on your Zanpakuto.

269
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:28,996
-Hm?

270
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,996
-Ha!

271
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:31,129
You see?

272
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:33,696
Because we both know my
sword can cut you now,

273
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:35,229
so if you let your guard down--

274
00:18:35,263 --> 00:18:39,229
-My Zanpakuto
doesn't have a name.

275
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:41,529
My sword is completely
out in the open.

276
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:45,763
It has never had a sealed form.

277
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:48,563
What you see here is the
true form of my Zanpakuto.

278
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:52,829
-Is that so?

279
00:18:52,863 --> 00:18:55,729
Well you probably shouldn't
have revealed that.

280
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:57,496
Because that tells
me your sword isn't

281
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:00,563
going to get any more
powerful than it is right now.

282
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:03,629
And in that case!

283
00:19:03,663 --> 00:19:05,396
-In that case what?

284
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:07,829
In that case you were
going to be able to win?

285
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:10,229
Is that what you were thinking?

286
00:19:10,263 --> 00:19:12,563
Now you're the one who's
taking me for a fool.

287
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:13,929
You should have
thought to ask me

288
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:16,396
why I don't seal my Zanpakuto.

289
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:18,296
It's my spiritual pressure.

290
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:21,196
It's so huge that even
if I use all of my might,

291
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:22,296
I can't seal it.

292
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,496
So when I fight, I
make sure to hold back.

293
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:28,796
I never swing my sword
with my full strength.

294
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:29,896
Do you see why?

295
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,929
If I didn't do that,
my enemies are so weak,

296
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,763
the battle wouldn't last long
enough for me to enjoy it.

297
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:44,929
[gasp]

298
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:49,963
-Didn't I tell you not to let
up on your spiritual pressure?

299
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:53,163
Relaxing just because you
found a glimmer or two of hope

300
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:53,729
for victory?

301
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:05,496
[gasping for breath]

302
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:08,863
-What a boring way
for this to end.

303
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:15,996
[crash]

304
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:17,196
-Tah.

305
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:19,329
And I had been waiting
such a long time for this,

306
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:22,063
to come up against someone
who could have killed me,

307
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,563
someone who at least heard
my bells during battle.

308
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:31,463
[gasping for breath]

309
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:32,363
-No more, huh?

310
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:38,429
That was no fun at all.

311
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:40,396
-(IN HEAD) Damnit!

312
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:43,396
[gasp] Damn!

313
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:44,396
Damn!

314
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:45,363
Damn!

315
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:47,363
I don't want to die.

316
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:48,729
I can't die!

317
00:20:48,763 --> 00:20:50,296
Not here.

318
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:52,729
Not in a place like this.

319
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:54,229
I can't.

320
00:20:54,263 --> 00:20:56,196
I can't afford to die yet!

321
00:20:59,696 --> 00:21:01,163
Move!

322
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:03,196
Move, body!

323
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:06,096
Got to stop the bleeding.

324
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:10,996
You have to let me
fight one more time!

325
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:15,896
[gasp] I have to save Rukia!

326
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:46,459
[theme music]

327
00:22:48,988 --> 00:22:50,521
-Did you see that Ichigo?

328
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:52,054
That's the strength
of our Captain.
