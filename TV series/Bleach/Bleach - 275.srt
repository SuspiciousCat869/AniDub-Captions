Hmph!

[yelling]

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Are you prepared to die?

00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:22,400
[grunting]

7
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,767
Cascada...

8
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:17,934
Ryusenka!

9
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:29,467

[yelling]

11
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:57,101
I hold within me the
resolve of those that
have fallen before me.

12
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:09,434
I'm resolved as well.
Resolved to stop you.

13
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:13,134
I suffered a great deal
of damage, but I can
still fight.

14
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:19,667
Yes, but it's a waste of
time. You won't be able to
operate at full strength.

15
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:26,201
I'll trust that what
strength I have left,
will be enough to keep
you from victory.

16
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,767
Such wasted effort.

17
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:06,834
What's going on?

18
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:17,701
My Hyorinmaru is the
strongest ice and snow
type Zanpakuto.

19
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:21,901
It allows me to weaponize
all kinds of water, from
any source.

20
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:27,001
The entire sky
is always...

21
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,234
... under
my control.

22
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:33,134
Cero.

23
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,534
[gasping]

24
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:42,901
Not too bad!

25
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:44,634
You're quick, too.

26
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:49,234
I have to say, that Cero
of yours is faster and
much bigger than the
ones I've heard about.

27
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:54,267
It's pretty tough to avoid
getting hit by something
with such speed and
intensity.

28
00:04:54,301 --> 00:05:00,401
That right? Well, you
know, I just demonstrated
my Cero for you...

29
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,634
How about letting me see
a bit of what you've
got, Captain?

30
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:15,867
All your hopping and
skipping around makes
you look silly...

31
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,767
Especially with your
outfit.

32
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:19,834
Cero.

33
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,401
He fired without a
gesture!!

34
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,934
Stop running
away--

35
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:29,801
Huh?

36
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:34,434
What the hell? Where
did this cloud come
from?!

37
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:43,534
What is... he doing?

38
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:50,201
Tenso Jurin. The ability
to subjugate weather.

39
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:54,901
Although it is one
of the basic uses of
Hyorinmaru, it is also
the most powerful.

40
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:03,634
My powers are still
unrefined. I know that
better than anyone else
would.

41
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:08,567
That is why I didn't
want to use this power
in a Bankai state.

42
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,934
Actually,
I couldn't...

43
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:17,234
I wasn't confident that
I could fully control it.

44
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:24,634
But since half my ice
flowers are gone and my
Bankai is in a weaker state,

45
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:28,101
you could say, I'm in
the perfect position
to use it.

46
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:34,301
Allow me to ask your
name, Espada.

47
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:43,001
I am Espada number
three. Tier Halibel.

48
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:47,767
I'm captain of Squad
Ten, Toshiro Hitsugaya.

49
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,501
You ready...?

50
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:56,534
[yelling]

51
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,734
This Spirit Energy.
It's filling the entire
sky.

52
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,767
Come on,
Captain Hitsugaya!

53
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:11,567
Don't be stupid. Start
running and don't look
back.

54
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:15,067
If you're not more than
ten miles away from here,

55
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,501
you're liable to get
drawn into this.

56
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:20,967
And I can't guarantee
I won't kill you by
mistake!

57
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:40,634
Hyoten Hyakkaso!

58
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,163
Cascada!

59
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:21,430
[gasping]

60
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:31,163
Hirvi--!

61
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:34,530
[gasping]

62
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,530
What is this?!

63
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:45,363
Hyoten Hyakkaso.

64
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:52,096
Anything that snow comes
in contact with, freezes
instantly into the shape
of a flower.

65
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,296
By the time these hundred
frozen flowers have
blossomed...

66
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,396
... your life will
have disappeared.

67
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,030
Sorry for that.

68
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,796
But I can't let you
avenge your subordinates.

69
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:31,363
Toshiro...

70
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:32,463
He did it!

71
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,563
Lieutenant Kira...
continue to heal them!

72
00:09:35,596 --> 00:09:36,530
Yes, sir!

73
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:41,830
And so now, there are
only two Espadas left.

74
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:48,063
Whatever it takes, we
must eliminate them all,
before those three enter
into battle with us.

75
00:09:59,796 --> 00:10:02,430
Hmph. That Halibel.

76
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:05,496
What a disgrace. Losing
to such an opponent.

77
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:11,963
Hmm?

78
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,496
Oh man! Such
destructive power!

79
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,930
What the hell's with
this guy?! Not only does
he have outrageous power,

80
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:37,430
but he's also got enough
speed to dodge your
attack, Captain!

81
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,596
I sure hope I don't
have to go up against
him.

82
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,496
There's no need
for you to worry.

83
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,930
Huh!? What?

84
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:48,063
I'm not expecting any
help from you, Marechiyo,
so just stay here.

85
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:50,330
What?! Don't you think
I wanna fight, too?!

86
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,630
Come on, look at
me! I kick ass!

87
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:55,896
Aw, the truth is, I
have no confidence at all!

88
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:02,430
How did he dodge
that kick?

89
00:11:08,163 --> 00:11:10,496
I have to try it
again to find out.

90
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,096
Go get him, Captain!

91
00:11:16,196 --> 00:11:17,730
It happened again!

92
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:21,663
When I get within
striking distance, the
speed of my kick suddenly
slows down!

93
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:25,263
Damn!

94
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:29,363
Captain!!

95
00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:31,763
Calm down.

96
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:33,963
How can I calm
down?! I must help
you!

97
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:38,596
Shut up, I'm fine.
Just keep your big,
sweaty ass away from me!

98
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,296
What's going on?

99
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:47,096
My attacks aren't
slowing down because
his Spiritual Pressure
intimidates me.

100
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,630
It's as if my movements
themselves are somehow
slowing down!

101
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:53,130
Is he controlling
gravity?

102
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:58,330
Or does he have the
ability to directly
influence my body's
muscles and coordination?

103
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:00,330
Hard to figure?

104
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:03,130
You seem to be confused
by what you've seen.

105
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:06,563
The nature of my power
is difficult to understand.

106
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,363
Do you recall what I told
you earlier about the
individual abilities
of each Espada?

107
00:12:15,096 --> 00:12:18,663
They each denote an
aspect that colors
their abilities.

108
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,696
It also relates strongly
to their embodiment, and
even why they exist.

109
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:28,963
The aspect of death I
signify is Senescence.
A product of time.

110
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:32,496
It stands right in the
way of all things that
exist.

111
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:37,396
Its absolute inevitability
is the most powerful aspect
of death.

112
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,330
Uh!

113
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,263
You see?

114
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:44,063
How did he do that?!

115
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:49,163
When I touch you just
once, that alone is
enough to make it
happen.

116
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,163
Now your bones
will age quickly.

117
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:57,096
[gasping]

118
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:59,496
My arm's broken!

119
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,763
But that's...
impossible!

120
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,730
Can't understand
it, can you?

121
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:08,163
Death is the same way,
it can't be comprehended.

122
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:14,396
And from this point
on... your mind will
most likely be unable to
comprehend anything that

123
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,463
happens in the course of
events, until this battle
comes to an end.

124
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,263
[gasping]

125
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:21,130
What?!

126
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:23,830
Are you prepared to die?

127
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,563
[grunting]

128
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:38,684
Are you prepared to die?

00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,118
[grunting]

130
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:41,484
Hmm?

131
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:43,718
What impudence!

132
00:13:49,118 --> 00:13:54,618
Heh-heh. The Captain is
not your only opponent, you
bastard! I'm here, too!

133
00:13:54,651 --> 00:13:59,184
My... such brave
talk coming from
a lieutenant.

134
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:02,184
But your words don't
sound very convincing.

135
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:03,518
Shut up, old man!!

136
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:07,751
He's right! There's
no damn way I could take
him on head to head!

137
00:14:08,218 --> 00:14:11,651
Captain! I've got your
back, so you don't have
to worry at all!

138
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,751
Cut the act.

139
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:13,651
What?!

140
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:15,718
I'm aware of what
you're really thinking.

141
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:19,218
You're thinking that
if you happen to take
a position outside his
range,

142
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:22,251
you'll be in a safe
spot where there's
no danger.

143
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:26,551
And your total lack of
strength would leave me
open to being attacked
from behind.

144
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:29,651
How did you even think to
say such a thing about
me?!!

145
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:32,451
I'll do it! I'll show you
what I've got!

146
00:14:32,484 --> 00:14:35,618
After all, you know I am
the lieutenant of Squad 2.

147
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:38,551
I see. Well, then
I have a plan.

148
00:14:38,584 --> 00:14:40,151
A plan...?

149
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:41,984
<i>All right now...</i>

150
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:49,018
When I touch you just
once, that alone is
enough to make it
happen.

151
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:52,418
Now your bones
will age quickly.

152
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:57,851
That's what he said. So
if we can attack him in a
way where he isn't able
to touch us or fix his

153
00:14:57,884 --> 00:15:04,151
aim on us, we'll
have a much greater
chance of defeating him.

154
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:05,018
Marechiyo.

155
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:06,751
Uh--- yes, ma'am?

156
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:09,684
Listen up, I want
you to stay at my
back.

157
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:12,884
And be certain that
you don't get in my way.

158
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:14,884
Sure, I know that!

159
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:19,951
Are you two done
discussing your fight
strategy?

160
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:23,851
Please try to make it
entertaining for me this
time.

161
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:24,784
Go.

162
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:27,418
[yelling]

163
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:28,251
Hmph!

164
00:15:29,984 --> 00:15:31,551
From above, eh?

165
00:15:32,784 --> 00:15:34,451
[yelling]

166
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:36,184
Ha.

167
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:39,084
I'm not letting you
grab me that easily!

168
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:43,018
From behind? This
one's the decoy.

169
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:45,018
Ah ha! From below!

170
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:50,651
How simple-minded!
You thought I wouldn't
guess your subordinate
was a decoy to distract

171
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:53,251
me, so you can deliver
the finishing blow?!

172
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:56,251
Hmm?

173
00:15:56,284 --> 00:16:04,651
[yelling]

174
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:13,718
[screaming]

175
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:15,651
You idiot-- uh!

176
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:16,851
Heh.

177
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:18,918
That one's pathetic.

178
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:21,384
[screaming]

179
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:29,151
[grunting]

180
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:34,584
You used your
second-in-command to have
him deliver the final
attack instead of you...

181
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,584
Interesting. In fact,
quite a fine idea.

182
00:16:38,884 --> 00:16:40,384
However...

183
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:44,818
He wasn't quite fully
committed in going all
the way with your plan...

184
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:50,451
If he had been willing to
die trying, at least he
might have had a chance
to succeed.

185
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,551
Ah! Forgive
me, Captain!

186
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:58,451
Expecting anything from
you, makes me the biggest
fool here.

187
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:03,284
<i>Get going. Run with</i>
<i>everything you've got.</i>

188
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:09,951
[trembling]

189
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:15,951
[grunting]

190
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,384
Uh!

191
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:53,751
[grunting]

192
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:56,884
Is that it for you?
Are you giving up?

193
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:10,684
[grunting]

194
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:14,784
[yelling]

195
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:16,484
[screaming]

196
00:18:16,518 --> 00:18:18,184
You fool! Get back!

197
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:28,318
Are... are you
all right, Captain?

198
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:30,918
Why didn't you
run away like I
told you?

199
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:35,718
How can you be asking me
that? As I said before,
I'm the lieutenant of
Squad 2!

200
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:39,584
And even though you told
me to run, it's my duty
to assist you Captain!

201
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:44,884
[panting]

202
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:47,518
Just keep that big,
sweaty ass of yours
away from me.

203
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:48,518
Huh?

204
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:51,018
You're really disgusting
when we're in a battle.

205
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:53,318
[chuckling]
Hmm?

206
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:56,351
Hey! My sweaty ass
shouldn't matter
right now!

207
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:57,351
Hmph.

208
00:18:57,384 --> 00:19:00,151
So each one of you came
within my range...

209
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:04,484
Since you both did
that, it clearly means
you're looking to die.

210
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,984
It's about time that I
put an end to all of this.

211
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:12,118
I will show you the
meaning of fear.

212
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,784
Rot... Arrogante.

213
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,318
[gasping]
What is that?

214
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:01,118
What now? What's
that form?!

215
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:13,718
[gasping]
Look at that! Everything
he's touching is completely
rotting away!

216
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:19,151
As I told you earlier...
I govern Senescence.

217
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:24,251
Everything around
me ages and dies.

218
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:29,518
[gasping]

219
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:33,084
That old bastard! What's
he up to, now? Huh!

220
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,884
What're you doing?!
Stop it, Marechiyo!

221
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:37,684
Damn it!

222
00:20:38,018 --> 00:20:41,184
[yelling]

223
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:42,284
Captain??

224
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:45,184
You fool! You're no
match for someone this
powerful!

225
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:46,384
Huh?!

226
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:48,751
Neither are you,
Captain.

227
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:52,784
Suffer the breath
of death!

228
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,018
Respira.

229
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:58,084
[gasping]

230
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,918
[gasping]

231
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:04,651
Ah!

232
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:14,651
[gasping]

233
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:21,518
[screaming]

234
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:22,584
Marechiyo!

235
00:21:22,618 --> 00:21:23,751
Marechiyo!

236
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:26,284
Cut off my arm right now!

237
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,351
But Captain--

238
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:30,218
Hurry up! Are you going
to let your Captain die?

239
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:32,684
[gasping]

240
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:34,384
Marechiyo!

241
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:41,051
Damn it!

242
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:47,918
Hmph!

243
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:55,084
[panting]

244
00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:57,118
How amusing.

245
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:02,518
It seems that even Soul
Reapers are afraid of
death.

246
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,508
Barragan, I have
a question.

247
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:49,908
I've been told body fat
decreases with age.

248
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:50,908
<i>Yes, and?</i>

249
00:23:50,942 --> 00:23:53,775
Then could you age
Marechiyo's ass?

250
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:54,942
<i>Uh, Captain?!?</i>

251
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,375
<i>I can guarantee him a</i>
<i>loss of 40 pounds.</i>

252
00:23:58,408 --> 00:24:00,075
<i>NO!</i>
