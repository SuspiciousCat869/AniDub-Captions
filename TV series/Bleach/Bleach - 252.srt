1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,733
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,666
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,233
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:29,433
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper...
And dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:32,500
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:27,753
Byakuya!

7
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:29,786
Brother! Be careful!

8
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:39,186
A silvery-white
windflower silk scarf
and a Kenseikan...

9
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:41,819
You're from the Kuchiki
Clan, aren't you?

10
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:47,653
I'm Byakuya Kuchiki,
the head of the Clan.
Twenty-eighth generation.

11
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:53,219
The leader of the
twenty-eighth generation.
Well, well...

12
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:57,619
Obviously, a great deal
of time has passed since
I was sealed away.

13
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,519
So, I assume by now
Ginrei finally died.

14
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:05,419
How dare you refer to my
ancestor's passing so
flippantly.

15
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:09,186
You personally ruined the
reputation of the Kuchiki Clan.

16
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:13,553
Because of that, you will
never have the right to
utter the name of my
Grandfather.

17
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:15,786
You bastard!

18
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:22,153
Byakuya, I don't
understand...

19
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:25,853
What's going on here? I
thought you were on their
side!

20
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:31,219
You must observe quietly.
This fight is his alone.
He's upholding the Kuchiki
Clan's honor.

21
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,586
I'm confused...

22
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:35,786
This makes no sense! I
thought your mind was
controlled by Muramasa!

23
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,786
No. There was a time when
Muramasa did try to influence
me. However...

24
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:11,353
Master...

25
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:16,886
So you have returned to
your senses, Senbonzakura.
Can you tell me what happened?

26
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:22,486
I don't know. I suddenly
heard a voice coming from
within my mind.

27
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:27,286
It told me to release my
soul and follow my instincts.

28
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,886
I see. As I feared.

29
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:41,486
Byakuya was aware of the
Zanpakuto, Muramasa, and
its master, Koga. His
Grandfather, Ginrei,

30
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,353
told him that Koga had
been sealed away.

31
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:52,553
You need to know this, my
boy. If by chance the
seal is broken and that
man escapes,

32
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:58,186
it will be your duty, as
head of the Kuchiki Clan,
to hunt him down and slay
him.

33
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:01,853
I pass this responsibility
to you.

34
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:06,019
The world must never be
exposed to his warped,
evil power again.

35
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:11,719
On my sacred honor as
head of the Kuchiki Clan,
I swear to do this.

36
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:18,753
Byakuya went to the
archives to search for
any clues as to where Koga
had been sealed away. But--

37
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:26,186
As he feared, there was
no record of Koga's
whereabouts. All he came
away with was the further

38
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:30,553
realization that it was
best to keep this to
himself.

39
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:37,453
So you're saying that
the Soul Reaper over
there, was connected
to the Kuchiki Clan?

40
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:44,319
So tell us then! For
what reason was this
whole thing hidden
from us?!

41
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:48,653
It was all for the sake
of learned where Koga had
been sealed away!

42
00:05:48,686 --> 00:05:51,419
Destroying Muramasa
alone would be meaningless.

43
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:54,153
The one who had to be
defeated was Koga!

44
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,353
In order to continue our
investigation, I acted as
though I was still brainwashed.

45
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:04,586
But it wasn't easy to
discover where Koga had
been sealed away.

46
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:08,719
That's why Byakuya stayed
by Muramasa's side.

47
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:13,119
Even if it meant that his
friends would think that
he betrayed them.

48
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,419
<i>He was willing to risk</i>
<i>his own death?</i>

49
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:20,853
He had to stay true to
his duty as head of the
Kuchiki Clan.

50
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:24,153
Byakuya...

51
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:32,486
Tell me this, head of the
Kuchiki Clan... Do you intend
to seal me away as well?

52
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:38,353
I do not. I cannot allow
you to remain alive any
longer.

53
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:43,153
All your actions have been
a disgrace to the Kuchiki Clan.

54
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,853
Now, I will kill
you for that.

55
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:52,119
How predictable. Spoken
with all the arrogance I
would expect from the
Kuchiki Clan.

56
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,453
So be it.

57
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:57,419
If you're truly the head
of the Kuchiki Clan...

58
00:06:57,453 --> 00:07:01,353
That's ample reason to
fight you. With or without
your threats.

59
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:11,353
Koga. Use me. I will
still fight for you.

60
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:12,386
Hmph.

61
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:19,286
Your power and mine are
one. My power belongs
to you.

62
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:43,186
But, w-why?!

63
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:51,153
You've become nothing
more than a hindrance to
me. I don't need to use a
pathetic, unstable sword

64
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:54,519
like you. My power
alone's enough.

65
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:00,019
Damn you! Have you no
loyalty and or respect
for your own Zanpakuto?!

66
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:05,286
A Zanpakuto is merely a
tool. There are countless
replacements.

67
00:08:21,386 --> 00:08:22,886
Muramasa!

68
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:30,086
Is his despair so
powerful that it's
impossible for him to
control his Spirit Energy?!

69
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:37,319
Koga--

70
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:44,819
What!?

71
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:50,553
I can't believe what I'm
seeing. He collected Menos
inside of him!

72
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:52,719
I'm wasting time.

73
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,686
Ichigo...

74
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:06,486
Byakuya, I get it. You've
only been pretending to
betray us.

75
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,453
Your first duty is to
preserve your Clan's
honor.

76
00:09:09,786 --> 00:09:14,719
That being said... Why not
let us take care of this,
and you focus on defeating
Koga.

77
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:16,419
<i>He's right.</i>

78
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:26,053
Ichigo, let's do it!

79
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:26,986
Right!

80
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,319
Getsugatensho!

81
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:36,453
Soren Sokatsui!

82
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:41,286
Senbonzakura...

83
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:44,019
Let's go.

84
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:44,753
Yes.

85
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:03,686
What is that supposed to
be?

86
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,086
You mean this?

87
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:08,953
Don't you remember? I
said I could find a
replacement weapon.

88
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:12,853
So, are you ready,
Kuchiki Clan leader?

89
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:07,719
I must admit, you do seem
to possess the skill of a
Kuchiki Clan leader.

90
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:11,519
Let's see how you do now
with Kido!

91
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:13,453
Kongo baku!

92
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:18,253
Hado Number Thirty-Three
Sokatsui!

93
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:23,819
Gakirek-ko!

94
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:31,386
Hado Number Four
Byakurai!

95
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:37,619
Hyogaseiran!

96
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:42,053
Hado Number Eighty-One.
Danku.

97
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,519
Byakuya!

98
00:12:13,153 --> 00:12:18,153
Your Kido's no match for
my Senbonzakura. It's
mere child's play.

99
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:20,319
You'll have to do
better than that.

100
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:23,319
Watch your mouth,
youngster--Don't be
so smug!

101
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:37,219
I've captured your shadow.
You are no longer able to
move. Not even a single
finger.

102
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:42,853
Scatter! Senbonzakura.

103
00:12:57,553 --> 00:12:58,919
It ends here.

104
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:15,419
You left yourself wide
open... Kuchiki-Clan
leader.

105
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:28,494
You're not getting away!

106
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:48,560
What have you done?
How did this happen?

107
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,860
Muramasa was able to
control the Zanpakuto's
minds...

108
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:57,994
...He got inside them.
His ability to do that
came from my power.

109
00:13:58,027 --> 00:14:04,094
By sending Spirit Energy
into my adversary, I am
able to confuse all of
his five senses.

110
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:10,760
Your body's senses are
already right in the palm
of my hand.

111
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,927
You can't even tell for
sure if this is actually
me standing here before
you.

112
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,394
An illusion?

113
00:14:17,427 --> 00:14:19,994
Hardly. That's far
too simplistic!

114
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,360
In your present state,
your perception is off.
Your eyes can't tell when
something's coming at

115
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:36,360
you, nor when to swing
your sword. Nothing
matches up, so you can no
longer fight effectively.

116
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:38,694
You made it easy...

117
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:41,594
If you had attacked while
closing off your mind to me,

118
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:46,560
the way like Ginrei
Genryusai did, I wouldn't
have been able to use this
skill.

119
00:14:47,494 --> 00:14:51,927
When I snapped Muramasa,
I surprised you---You let
your guard down for a
moment.

120
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,560
<i>You're wrong.</i>

121
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:54,194
What?!

122
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:58,927
Actually, I challenged you
with my mind completely
wide open, in order to
kill you.

123
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:05,060
If I had closed my heart, I
might have been able to seal
you away, but I wouldn't have
been able to destroy you.

124
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:10,060
Considering your
situation, you've got a
lot of nerve to speak to
me like that.

125
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,960
Oh, no you don't!

126
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:20,927
What?!

127
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,894
Hyogaseiran!

128
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:31,594
Danku.

129
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:34,560
Hey, aren't you all
turned around?!

130
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:40,760
[chuckling]
What a pathetic sight!

131
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,960
Without your Zanpakuto,
it looks like you're
powerless, youngster.

132
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:54,294
My enemy's skills are so
irrelevant. Everyone falls
to their knees before me!

133
00:15:55,394 --> 00:16:01,494
Yes! And it's all
because of my own power!
I don't need anything
from a Zanpakuto.

134
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,994
I'm the most powerful Soul
Reaper to ever live!

135
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,694
Let's make this your last
day as the Kuchiki Clan
leader!

136
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,827
What the hell?!

137
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,294
Impossible!

138
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:42,594
It did Shikai by itself?!

139
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,894
Senbonzakura...

140
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:53,160
Yes, Master. I know your
senses and body have been
shut down...

141
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,127
I will fight as your eyes
and limbs. Instruct me
to do as you wish.

142
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,260
I'm going to control the
senses of both that sword
and you together!

143
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:13,560
I don't think so.

144
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:21,494
Bankai.

145
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:40,094
Senkei. Senbonzakura
Kageyoshi.

146
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:47,427
This is the true form
of my Senbonzakura...

147
00:17:48,427 --> 00:17:53,460
...A space that focuses
offensive energy for the
sole purpose of defeating
an enemy.

148
00:17:56,327 --> 00:18:01,394
There is no need here
for defensive power. And
confused senses will
not help you.

149
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:07,127
...For without fail, this
blade will be able to find
you, wherever you are.

150
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,894
Ha-ha. Wherever I
am, you say.

151
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:14,027
Then let's test the
precision of its guidance.

152
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:21,027
Damn you! How is it that
you possess so much power?

153
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:27,494
Because we fight together.
That's what gives us power.

154
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,427
A Soul Reaper and a
Zanpakuto combine to
make one.

155
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,860
We are only able to
display our true powers
when our souls are in
harmony with one another.

156
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,594
Your pride caused you to
abandon the one you need
right now.

157
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:42,960
Alone, you cannot
defeat us.

158
00:19:43,494 --> 00:19:47,960
Shut up! You don't know
enough about me to judge
me like that!

159
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:52,660
No one acknowledged what
I did, despite all my
successes.

160
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:57,727
Instead, they branded me
a traitor and tried to seal
me away! If that was going
to be the case,

161
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,027
I had to create a place
for myself somewhere!

162
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:03,760
Order is created by
power!

163
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:08,027
With my power, I am going
to become king of a new
world!

164
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:10,660
Such foolishness...

165
00:20:10,694 --> 00:20:12,760
What was that?!

166
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:17,860
The real tragedy is that
you fail to recognize the
true nature of power.

167
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:22,227
The power you need is to
be able to relate...

168
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:28,094
... to others. And also,
to connect to your Zanpakuto
in a synergistic way.

169
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,660
You sound like such
a complete idiot!

170
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:33,660
That has never been the
kind of power I've needed!

171
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:37,160
My power is like no
other!

172
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:42,094
Absolute power that has
equal. Not here or anywhere
else in the universe!

173
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,894
It seems there is no use
discussing this.

174
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:51,960
Blame your own immaturity
for not being able to
recognize that your confidence
is nothing but arrogance.

175
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,294
Koga...

176
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:59,627
I will now complete my
duty, as head of the
Kuchiki Clan, as I have
foresworn to do...

177
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,460
...Honoring my the wishes
of my predecessors.

178
00:21:10,494 --> 00:21:15,960
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.
Shukei Hakuteiken.

179
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,160
You are more than I
expected. In a long line
of Kuchiki-Clan leaders,

180
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:25,027
few, if any, were as
powerful as you.

181
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:29,660
Because you were once a
member of the Kuchiki
Clan,

182
00:21:29,694 --> 00:21:33,860
I will pay my final
respects by using this
ultimate technique.

183
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:38,827
I will defeat you. And in
doing so, end this curse of
ever having been part of the

184
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,060
Kuchiki Clan once
and for all!

185
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:54,436
I was strict with Koga,
but that backfired. I let
Byakuya have his own way,
but he grew up to be

186
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:57,869
obstinate. I must say,
raising children is
difficult.

187
00:23:57,902 --> 00:24:00,536
<i>The World Of the Living</i>
<i>has lots of how-to books.</i>

188
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,569
<i>Do not give him</i>
<i>any ideas.</i>
