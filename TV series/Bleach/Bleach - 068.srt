00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,366
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Ever since
the powers of the Soul Reaper

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,866
were thrust upon me, my
whole world is changed.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,833
Now, I'm Ichigo Kurosaki,
substitute Soul Reaper.

4
00:00:13,866 --> 00:00:16,266
And I'm combining my
powerful spirit energy

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,866
with this blade in order
to protect my friends!

00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,833
[theme music]

7
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,434
ICHIGO: So now what, guys?

8
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,301
What do we do now?

9
00:01:59,334 --> 00:02:00,834
What do we do?

10
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:01,667
What?

11
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:03,034
-I know.

12
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,234
How about you stop repeating
the same thing over and over?

13
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:06,234
It sucks.

14
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:07,467
ICHIGO: What did you say?

15
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,267
-I said, quit your yammering.

16
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,467
Say something meaningful,
or else shut up!

17
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:14,101
-I'll say whatever I
want to say, you freak.

18
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,501
Unless you think
you could stop me.

19
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:17,867
-Yeah, I'll stop you.

20
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:19,434
-I'd like to see you try.

21
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:20,067
-Oh, please.

22
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:21,534
Stop it, you two.

23
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,567
-You're acting like a
couple of five-year-olds.

24
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,801
[grunting]

25
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:25,701
-Hmph.

26
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:27,001
-Hmph.

27
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:30,067
-Orihime, do you remember
anything about your kidnappers?

28
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:33,467
We need a clue,
something to go on.

29
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:34,534
-Hm.

30
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,501
Hey, there is one thing
I just remembered.

31
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:37,134
-[together] Hm?

32
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:39,367
-We had some tea.

33
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:40,467
-They gave you tea?

34
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,201
-And that's not all.

35
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:43,467
There were muffins, too.

36
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,334
-Orihime, that isn't gonna help.

37
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:46,801
-Mm, sorry.

38
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,401
-How can we rescue
Chad if we don't

39
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,867
know who these people are.

40
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,934
-We know they're
Mod-Souls, just like me.

41
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:53,167
They make us look stupid.

42
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:55,001
And they're driving me
up the frickin' wall.

43
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:57,134
-It worries me that we
still haven't heard back

44
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:58,134
from Urahara.

45
00:02:58,167 --> 00:02:59,767
And what got Yoruichi
in such a panic?

46
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:02,101
What the hell's
going on around here?

47
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:03,367
-Hey, are you listening to me?

48
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,534
Nobody ignores me.

49
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:05,734
You should be listening
to everything I-- [squeak]

50
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:06,801
-Shut up, you.

51
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:08,401
-What gets me are
these games of theirs.

52
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:10,101
Why don't they get
to the point, instead

53
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:11,934
of making us waste our
time running around?

54
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:16,867
ICHIGO: There's a
lot we don't know.

55
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:25,867
HITSUGAYA: What about Sui-Feng?

56
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:28,201
-She went off somewhere
alone, apparently right

57
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:29,834
before the gate was sealed shut.

58
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,334
-She didn't take
anyone with her?

59
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:33,767
No one from the
Punishment Force?

60
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:34,867
-That's right.

61
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,301
That's what Omaeda just told me.

62
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:39,701
What exactly is
going on, Captain?

63
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:42,767
-It's all part of a plan that
Yoruichi Shihoin and Ukitake

64
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:43,901
put together.

65
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:46,301
It's nothing you need to
concern yourself with.

66
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:48,701
Oh, and by the way,
what were you doing out

67
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:51,601
talking to Omaeda
the first place?

68
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:55,767
I seem to recall you had a whole
day's worth of paperwork to do.

69
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,067
-Uh, I did.

70
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:59,801
But I got it all finished
much faster than I expected.

71
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,534
-Interesting, Rangiku.

72
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,834
Then I suppose that mountain
of files hidden over there

73
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:05,801
behind the sofa is
just my imagination.

74
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:08,867
Rangiku!

75
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,401
-Where do you
think you're going?

76
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:19,201
-There's no point in
hanging around here.

77
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:21,834
I'm going to head back to
Urahara's shop and wait.

78
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:24,501
-But what about Chad and all
the kids from our school?

79
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:27,201
-Actually, they're probably
not in any real danger.

80
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,067
Whatever these guys
are up to, they

81
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,234
do seem to follow
the game's rules.

82
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:33,301
I think it's safe to assume
that the worst they'll

83
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:35,701
do to Chad and the others is
to give them some challenges.

84
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,534
-Hey, what's going on?

85
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:48,267
-What is it?

86
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:50,067
ICHIGO: It says,
"You have 30 minutes

87
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,501
to destroy the gate-- Ririn."

88
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:53,501
What gate?

89
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:54,501
-Something's coming!

90
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,767
-Whoa, look at that.

91
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:11,234
It's huge!

92
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,634
-Yeah, it's too freaking
huge to even be real.

93
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,167
It's got to be
another hallucination.

94
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:20,234
URYU: It's opening.

95
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,634
[gasping]

96
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:23,601
-Damn it.

97
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:28,901
-Ichigo, what about your body?

98
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:30,167
-We'll to get it later.

99
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:30,734
Let's go.

100
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:38,967
YORUICHI: Hurry!

101
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:39,634
SUI-FENG: Right.

102
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:47,234
YORUICHI: Look at this.

103
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,634
-Hm.

104
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,134
It looks like--

105
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,434
YORUICHI: --reishi residue.

106
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,434
Obviously, the
intruder's a lot faster

107
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:56,867
than I expected him to be.

108
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:59,534
-I'll send this data to the
Soul Society right away.

109
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,367
YORUICHI: Good.

110
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,801
Ukitake should be standing by.

111
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:15,367
HITSUGAYA: I thought I might
find you here, Shunsui.

112
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:16,101
-Hey, look.

113
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:18,034
It's the boy genius.

114
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,301
Care for a drink?

115
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:21,201
-I think I'll pass.

116
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:22,701
Am I interrupting?

117
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:23,901
-Welcome, captain.

118
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:26,734
HITSUGAYA: What are you
two old men up to anyway?

119
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,867
-It's a bit of an investigation.

120
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:31,567
We're receiving some data
right now from Sui-Feng

121
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:33,867
in the World of the Living.

122
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:35,267
-Then that must
be the reason you

123
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,001
needed to have the gates sealed.

124
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:38,367
KYORAKU: Exactly.

125
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:41,001
It's much easier to isolate
intruders and collect accurate

126
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,401
data on them when we don't
have other souls passing

127
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:44,401
back and forth.

128
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:45,301
-Intruders?

129
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:46,534
-Right.

130
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:49,701
We're trying, but so far
we haven't identified them.

131
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:53,967
-Is all this related in some
way to the Aizen incident?

132
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,567
-It is possible.

133
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:57,634
So far, it's too soon to tell.

134
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,401
ANALYST: I have the data.

135
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:01,567
What Sui-Feng sent us
was a reishi sample,

136
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,834
so I ran it through
the analyzer.

137
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:06,034
-Something's wrong!

138
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:08,434
There's no way to
identify this reishi.

139
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:09,401
It's blank.

140
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:10,901
You must have entered it wrong.

141
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:11,634
Try again.

142
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:12,367
ANALYST: Yes, sir.

143
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:13,201
-What do you think?

144
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:16,334
-I think it's strange.

145
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:17,567
KYORAKU: You got that right.

146
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,267
It's going to take
another bottle of sake

147
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:20,534
for me to get through this.

148
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:29,767
RENJI: It looks pretty
damn solid to be

149
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,801
just a hallucination.

150
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:35,767
[giggling]

151
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:37,734
-Over there!

152
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:39,201
GIRL: Well, what do you think?

153
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:41,001
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

154
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:43,867
-Cut out the stupid small
talk and tell us what's up.

155
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:46,201
I want to know right now why
the hell you're doing this.

156
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:49,001
-Aw, it wouldn't be any
fun if I told you that.

157
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,967
We haven't even gotten started
with the final battle yet.

158
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:54,901
I'll tell you everything
once it's all over.

159
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:56,101
[grunting]

160
00:07:56,134 --> 00:07:57,601
URYU: Everyone,
hold onto something!

161
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:02,301
-So strong.

162
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:04,201
This is no illusion.

163
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:08,601
Get 'em!

164
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:12,401
--[shout] You didn't sew
me together very well!

165
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:14,901
--[giggle] I guess this part of
the game is mostly over now,

166
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:15,834
isn't it?

167
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:17,201
But what else can they do?

168
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:18,134
They should give up.

169
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,801
-Of course you're right.

170
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,034
Well, how about it down there?

171
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:24,101
Are you ready to
admit your defeat yet?

172
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:25,067
-Hell, no.

173
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:27,367
We'll fight, and
we'll beat you, too.

174
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:28,067
-Yeah?

175
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:29,234
Do you recognize this?

176
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:30,767
-I don't believe it.

177
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,767
It's Urahara's hat?

178
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:33,767
-Oh, well.

179
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:35,234
You should have surrendered.

180
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:40,034
-No, Uryu!

181
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:42,034
-Ichigo, help!

182
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,534
Please, help!

[scream]

184
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,534
-Orihime!

-Ichigo!

[grunting]

188
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,401
-It's too strong!

189
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:59,901
-Renji, take care of Orihime!

190
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:01,934
There's only one way
out of this freak show.

191
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:03,834
-What do you think
you're doing, idiot?

192
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:11,534
-[grunt]

193
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,834
-You can't use your Bankai
here, or the whole town

194
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,534
will be destroyed, Ichigo!

195
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:19,367
-If I don't, the town will
get sucked in along with us!

196
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:25,667
[grunt] Ban-- huh?

197
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:27,801
-What's the matter, Ichigo?

198
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,167
-No, Ichigo!

199
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,167
-[gasp]

[shouting]

201
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:48,767
ORIHIME: What-- what happened?

202
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,067
-[grunt] Huh?

203
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:51,267
How did I--?

204
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:54,934
Oh, Orihime, can it be
that you came to save me?

205
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:55,534
ORIHIME: Uryu!

206
00:09:58,867 --> 00:09:59,701
-Where are we?

207
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:00,634
-Who knows?

208
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,034
We went through the gate.

209
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,434
That's all I can remember.

210
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,701
-Yeah, me too.

211
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:06,401
Orihime!

212
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:07,167
Uryu!

213
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:08,867
URYU: Over here!

214
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,334
ORIHIME: Oh, Ichigo, Renji.

215
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:12,201
I'm so glad you
two are all right.

216
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:13,134
-Yeah.

217
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:14,367
It looks like all
four of us are.

218
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,901
-You mean all five!

219
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:16,834
Thanks a lot.

220
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,767
-Yeah, but where
have we ended up?

221
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:21,101
-Is this the alternate dimension
you were talking about?

222
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,401
-I don't know.

223
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:25,901
[giggling]

224
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:32,367
-What a surprise to see
all of you still alive.

225
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:33,634
-Come on down.

226
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,701
You won't laughing for long.

227
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,101
-Better be nice.

228
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:38,934
Look who we have.

229
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:40,334
-They've got Chad!

230
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:43,634
GIRL: Since you've all
managed to survive this long,

231
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,034
I'll give you a bonus round.

232
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:46,901
Welcome to the Challenge Stage!

233
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,101
-What is this?

234
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:54,834
-And to make it even
more fun, Noba and Kurodo

235
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:55,634
will join in, too.

236
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:56,734
-A grand idea.

237
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:58,134
That will give us a
chance to finally show

238
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,667
our new friends our true powers.

239
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,301
Right, Noba?

240
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:01,301
-Huh?

241
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:02,267
I suppose.

242
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:03,434
-Oh, come on.

243
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:05,234
Would it kill you to
show a little enthusiasm?

244
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,467
You're so boring!

245
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:07,467
-That's enough, Kurodo.

246
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,801
It isn't important.

247
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,201
What is important is that
they only have five minutes.

248
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:12,834
-[gasp]

249
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,201
-That's right, ha!

250
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:16,667
Find a way to save your friend
within that time, or else--

251
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:22,101
well, you can probably figure
out what will happen. [giggle]

252
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:24,567
-[gasp] An hourglass?

253
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:28,034
-[giggle] Of death.

254
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,001
All right.

255
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:31,001
Let the Challenge Stage begin!

256
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:43,065
Now the Challenge
Stage has begun!

257
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:44,598
-[laughs]

258
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:46,998
-Uryu, stay here
and protect Orihime.

259
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:48,498
-OK, will do.

260
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:50,731
-Hey, you can ask me
to help too, you know.

261
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:56,331
KURODO: [laughs] Now
the real fun's starting,

262
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:57,765
-[gasp]

[fighting noises]

264
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:06,031
-That guy's turned himself
into a perfect copy of Ichigo.

265
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:07,298
-Which one is the real one?

266
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:09,831
-You've got some
nerve copying me.

267
00:12:09,865 --> 00:12:10,698
-Yeah, right.

268
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:11,798
Look who's talking, you phony.

269
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:17,531
-Roar, Zabimaru!

270
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:18,898
Oh, no you don't!

271
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:24,231
Huh?

272
00:12:30,531 --> 00:12:31,965
-What just happened there?

273
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:34,398
-It looks like he
sucked up Renji's attack

274
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,131
and then used it against him.

275
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:37,831
-That's a sneaky power to have.

276
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:40,265
-Uh, uh, uh.

277
00:12:40,298 --> 00:12:43,065
-Why you-- [grunt]

278
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:49,298
-You better find a way to beat
me, or that friend of yours

279
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:51,698
is gonna be breathing sand!

Damn it!

284
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:03,065
-We're close now.

285
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:05,398
-Right.

286
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:07,131
-Be careful.

287
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:10,565
[hypnotic singing]

288
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:33,931
-What is that?

289
00:13:33,965 --> 00:13:34,631
-I'll find out.

290
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:36,365
Send the data.

291
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,165
-Hm?

292
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,798
-We're receiving a
video transmission.

293
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:44,265
-That looks like--

294
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:50,765
-You shouldn't interrupt
two consenting adults.

295
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:54,031
-Did he consent to you
sucking out his soul?

296
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:56,398
Who the hell are you, anyway?

297
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:58,831
--[laugh] You'll
know soon enough.

298
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:03,698
SUI-FENG: Shall I chase her?

299
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:04,631
YORUICHI: No.

300
00:14:04,665 --> 00:14:07,331
She looks skilled
at running away.

301
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:08,965
Did you send the data?

302
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:09,765
-Yes.

303
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:11,565
Do you know that person?

304
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:13,198
YORUICHI: Yes, but
it's the first time

305
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:15,298
I've seen her in that form.

306
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:17,498
Sui-Feng, I want you to
go back now and report

307
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:19,565
the details of this to Ukitake.

308
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:21,198
-Right.

309
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:23,498
-Sentaro, are you there?

310
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:25,298
-Yes, sir.

311
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,498
-The investigation's done.

312
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:30,498
I want you remove the seal
from the gate right away.

313
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:31,198
-Right.

314
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:33,665
Consider it done, sir.

00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:36,498
KYORAKU: There goes another
perfectly good evening wasted.

Goodnight.

-Goodnight, Shunsui.

318
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:40,765
Captain Hitsugaya, can you
assist me with something?

319
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,231
-If I can, sure.

320
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:44,298
What is it?

00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:46,298
-Yes, well.

Are you all right?

-I'm fine.

RIRIN: [giggle] Did you
forget there's a time limit?

330
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:12,198
It's almost up.

331
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:13,665
-Chad, no!

332
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:15,198
-I thought you were
kidding at first,

333
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:17,298
but I see that you're
seriously trying to defeat us

334
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:21,031
with these slow-motion
attacks! [laughs]

335
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:26,898
-And now, for the
final stage. [shout]

336
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,865
[shouting]

337
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:31,531
-Ichigo!

338
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:33,131
-Use your Bankai, Ichigo!

339
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,731
It's our only chance!

340
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:38,198
-All right.

341
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:42,165
[shout]

342
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:50,998
-Not again.

343
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,798
It broke!

344
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:01,465
-Huh?

345
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:02,565
What happened to it?

346
00:16:02,598 --> 00:16:03,531
-[squeak] Who knows?

347
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:11,331
-Chad!

348
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:14,931
Chad!

349
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:15,931
Chad, are you all right.

350
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:17,031
-Think so.

351
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:18,265
-I'll get those ropes off.

352
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,565
-It's OK.

353
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:22,098
They came lose somehow.

354
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,431
-Huh?

355
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:23,998
ORIHIME: Chad!

356
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,765
It looks like you're all right.

357
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:30,198
-Yes.

358
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:31,731
-Chad, do you
remember anything that

359
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:33,331
happened while
you were captured?

360
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:35,265
-Hm.

361
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,165
There was tea.

362
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:37,098
-You see?

363
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:38,098
I told you.

364
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,498
You laughed, but
there really was tea.

365
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:40,998
-Hm.

366
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:47,865
Heh.

367
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:48,965
-What is it?

368
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:51,465
-Ichigo?

369
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:52,565
-Now I get it.

370
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:54,631
It all makes sense.

371
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:56,065
All right, Urahara.

372
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,898
I know you're here somewhere.

373
00:16:57,931 --> 00:16:58,998
-[together] Huh?

374
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:00,598
ICHIGO: This is all
your doing, isn't it?

375
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:01,731
Come out and show yourself.

376
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:09,931
-[gasp]

377
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:13,165
-That didn't take you
long to figure out.

378
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,598
What was it that tipped you off?

379
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:16,698
-It was your hat.

380
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,931
When I saw it on the
ground just now, I knew.

381
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:19,965
-You see?

382
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,065
I told Ririn here
the whole hat thing

383
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:23,298
was laying it on too thick.

384
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:27,265
-He's smarter than I gave
him credit for. [giggle]

385
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:28,631
-Hm.

386
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,731
I should have figured it out,
because you never finished us

387
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:32,998
off or hurt us when
you had the chance.

388
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,765
You kept pushing us into
tighter and tighter situations,

389
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:37,798
but you always let us slip away.

390
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:39,665
We should have noticed that.

391
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:42,265
Chad was never in any
real danger, was he?

392
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:43,531
-Uh-uh.

393
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,898
In fact, most of the time
we spent playing checkers.

394
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,465
-She beat me every single game.

395
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:51,298
-I still don't understand
why you did this.

396
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,731
-If you give me back my hat,
I'll explain everything.

397
00:17:56,498 --> 00:17:58,265
I have found that
certain games can

398
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:01,265
be very useful for
training purposes.

399
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:03,398
They can improve a
number of disciplines,

400
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:06,465
including stamina,
intellect, teamwork, making

401
00:18:06,498 --> 00:18:09,198
quick judgments, and
coping with adversity.

402
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:12,465
They even strengthen the
bond between friends.

403
00:18:12,498 --> 00:18:15,298
Perhaps most important of all,
they provide a chance for you

404
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:17,165
to each take a good
look at yourself.

405
00:18:17,198 --> 00:18:19,798
-Do you really
think we need that?

406
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:21,898
-Yeah.

407
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:25,498
For instance, your Bankai
doesn't work, does it?

408
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:25,998
[gasping]

409
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:26,898
-No way.

410
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:27,931
Is that true?

411
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:29,798
-Ichigo.

412
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:33,565
URAHARA: Remember, you are a
substitute Soul Reaper, not

413
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:35,298
quite a Soul Reaper.

414
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:37,531
You may have been able
to use your Bankai freely

415
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:39,431
while you were in
the Soul Society,

416
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:41,331
but things are not
quite the same now

417
00:18:41,365 --> 00:18:43,465
that you've returned home.

418
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,331
You mustn't start thinking that
every time things get tough,

419
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:49,231
all you have to do
is use your Bankai.

420
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:54,731
Try to remember
it's not that easy.

421
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:55,865
Hm.

422
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:58,298
That aside, did you know
that Yoruichi was here

423
00:18:58,331 --> 00:18:59,831
conducting an investigation?

424
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:01,365
-Yeah?

425
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:03,931
I was wondering what
had her so concerned.

426
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:05,531
URAHARA: I don't
know all the details.

427
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:08,465
But an unexplained phenomenon
has everyone concerned.

428
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:10,465
-What sort of phenomenon?

429
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:13,398
-So far, all I know is
that it was serious enough

430
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:15,565
to justify the Soul
Society closing

431
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:17,531
the passage to the
World of the Living.

432
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:18,865
-I know.

433
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:20,598
I bet it's got something to
do with the Aizen incident,

434
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:21,698
doesn't it?

435
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:24,331
-Doubt it Aizen got
away with the Hogyoku,

436
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:26,065
but he's still going
to need a lot of time

437
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,598
before he can mature it enough
to utilize its full power.

438
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:32,198
He probably won't surface
or make a move for awhile.

439
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:33,698
Which is good,
because right now,

440
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:37,265
you're too weak to counter him.

441
00:19:37,298 --> 00:19:38,831
But Ichigo?

442
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:40,998
-What is it?

443
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:44,165
-Soon enough, the issue of
the Hogyoku will return,

444
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:47,598
and we will not be able to deal
with it without your Bankai.

445
00:19:47,631 --> 00:19:50,165
Will you try to learn
to use it again?

446
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:51,998
I'm asking you to
do this for me.

447
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:58,165
-All right.

448
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:58,898
I'll do it, but--

449
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,031
-An excellent decision!

450
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,231
Thanks so much.

451
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:02,431
ICHIGO: Huh?

452
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:04,631
-That guy could sell a
refrigerator to an Eskimo.

453
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:05,631
-All right, then.

454
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:07,031
Ichigo, why don't
we get right to it

455
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:09,531
and start cultivating
your situational analysis

456
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:11,265
and critical judgment skills?

457
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:12,398
-Uh--

458
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:14,698
-Ichigo, you really need
to use your head more.

459
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,631
You let your opponents
take advantage of your

460
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:17,831
far too often.

461
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:18,798
-Uh.

462
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:20,398
-Ironically, the
member of your group

463
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,398
who's best at that kind
of critical thinking

464
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:24,765
is actually Uryu, the
one who doesn't even

465
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,265
have any powers anymore.

466
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:27,865
-Huh?

467
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:28,831
-It's true.

468
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:29,398
Right, Uryu?

469
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,498
URYU: Yes, I lost
my Quincy powers

470
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:39,498
while fighting in
the Soul Society.

471
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,965
-Why the hell
didn't you tell us?

472
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:43,498
-All those times you didn't use
your powers were because you

473
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:44,298
couldn't?

474
00:20:44,331 --> 00:20:45,998
-Is this really true, Uryu?

475
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:46,765
-Huh?

476
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:48,465
-You freakin' idiot.

477
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,665
-What'd you say?

478
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:53,031
-By doing that, you put
every one of us in danger.

479
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,031
I'm not trying to say
that you endangered us

480
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:56,931
by not having any powers.

481
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,531
Fighting as a team, we all have
different things we contribute.

482
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:01,965
And you were a huge help
there in the Soul Society.

483
00:21:01,998 --> 00:21:03,331
But if you lost
your powers, that

484
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:05,131
isn't something you
should have kept secret

485
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:06,398
from the rest of us.

486
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,931
We would have been a stronger
team if we had known.

487
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:11,598
Hey, you have to
trust you friends

488
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:13,365
enough to tell them the truth.

489
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,865
You know that.

490
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:17,665
-Ichigo.

491
00:21:17,698 --> 00:21:20,631
--[clap] Well, that concludes
the lesson for today.

492
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:22,598
Let's go up and have
something to eat?

493
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:23,998
-Hm?

494
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:26,398
-I'm guessing by now, Tessai has
whipped us up something tasty.

495
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:28,431
-But an entire town
just got destroyed.

496
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,065
What are you going
to do about that?

497
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:32,831
--[giggle] You should know we
would never do something like

498
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:33,665
that.

499
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:35,598
That was just a big hologram.

500
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:38,831
-Well, then, where did all those
kids from our school end up?

501
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,298
-They're probably waking up now?

502
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:44,231
-[groan] Where are we?

503
00:21:44,265 --> 00:21:46,298
-How did we get here?

504
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:47,365
-What just happened?

505
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:50,831
-Well, it's about time
everybody woke up.

506
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:52,031
-Ms. Ochi?

507
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:53,565
How did we end up way out
here in the mountains?

508
00:21:53,598 --> 00:21:54,831
-Who knows?

509
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:57,065
But as long as we're here,
it's a perfect time for us

510
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:57,865
to learn something.

511
00:21:57,898 --> 00:21:59,798
[groaning]

512
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:00,731
-Big dipper.

513
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:02,198
Little dipper.

514
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:04,431
How fun!

515
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:05,298
-No kidding.

516
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:07,631
-Can we go home?

517
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:09,098
-You're annoying!

518
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:10,565
YORUICHI: Kisuke!

519
00:22:10,598 --> 00:22:11,065
-Huh?

520
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:17,698
-What-- Yoruichi!

521
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:23,098
-I have something to tell you.

522
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,731
-Yeah, what is it?

523
00:22:25,765 --> 00:22:27,765
-The intruder is a Bount.

524

525
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:07,576
KON: What do you mean,
a new type Mod-Soul?

526
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,876
And supposedly, they've got
all sorts of bizarre powers.

527
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,976
Well, I don't care.

528
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,543
There's no way they can
match my popularity.

529
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:15,343
URAHARA: I wouldn't
be so sure about that.

530
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:18,343
Something incredible is going
to happen in the next episode.

531
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:18,910
ICHIGO: What?

532
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:19,943
Kon disappears?

533
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:20,676
KON: Huh?

YORUICHI: Golden.

537
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:37,376
Wearing clothes
is so comfortable.

538
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,243
Hm?

539
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,610
Sui-Feng!

540
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:41,543
What are you still doing here?

541
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:43,710
I thought I told
you to go on home.

542
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:47,843
-It's just now that we're in
the World of the Living, I--

543
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:49,310
-What's wrong?

544
00:24:49,343 --> 00:24:51,610
- --wanted to do
something nice for you.

545
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:56,443
So, um, I, uh-- take this!

546
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:56,943
-Chocolate?

547
00:24:56,976 --> 00:24:58,443
No thanks.

548
00:24:58,476 --> 00:25:01,976
