1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,266
-I don't know.

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,433
Is this one too loud?

3
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:21,500
But since I never get a
chance to go to the beach,

4
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,800
maybe I should just be daring.

5
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,700
No, I couldn't take
the embarrassment

6
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,700
of showing my belly button.

7
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,866
-I don't know what
you're so worried about.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,133
You haven't got anything up
here to fill the suit out.

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,600
So what difference does it make?

10
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:35,800
-Would you leave me alone?

11
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:40,033
-Mmm, this is exactly what
I've been looking for.

12
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:42,166
-Lady Yoruichi is so wonderful.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Even picking out swimwear,
she has such elegance.

14
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:48,633
I forgot.

15
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,300
I have to find a
bathing suit for myself.

16
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:55,633
-Soifon, I think this swimsuit
would look adorable on you.

17
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,066
What do you think?

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,600
-No, it's hideous.

19
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:02,800
What's she thinking?

20
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,000
I wouldn't make a
five-year-old wear that thing.

21
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:05,566
No.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,833
Wait a minute.

23
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,400
There's no way Lady Yoruichi's
choice would be wrong.

24
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:12,700
Still, am I supposed to just
accept whatever she says?

25
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:15,166
Even if she is Lady
Yoruichi, there

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,966
are times when I have
to stand my ground.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,900
Thanks.

28
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:20,100
If you don't mind,
I already have

29
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:21,966
my heart set on this yellow one.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,166
-We'll take this one.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,466
-Excellent choice, ma'am.

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,333
-Lady Yoruichi.

33
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:29,533
-I'm so jealous.

34
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,666
Captain Sui-feng has such
a petite little body,

35
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,200
she looks good in any swimsuit.

36
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,000
I hate it that they
never make any cute

37
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:38,566
swimsuits for
girls as big as me.

38
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,866
-Hey, sis.

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,733
You're never going
to believe what

40
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:45,200
I found for you, the
perfect swimsuit.

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,500
-What were you thinking?

42
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:52,433
There's no way.

43
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,666
I can't wear
something like that.

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,366
-It's lovely.

45
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,800
It'll look great on you.

46
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,266
I've decided on this one.

47
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,233
What do you think?

48
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,633
This is a good opportunity
for you to loosen up a little.

49
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,466
Choose that one.

50
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,100
-But-- but Captain.

51
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:12,266
-Choose that one, Isane.

52
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,100
[bell toll]

53
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,366
-Oh, yes, of course, Captain.

54
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:21,366
[theme song]

55
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,321
-That's all there is to it.

56
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:07,088
The Women's Soul
Reapers Association

57
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:17,154
decided to come here
for a little R&R.

58
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:46,054
decided to come here
for a little R&R.

59
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:48,488
-You don't really expect
me to believe that story.

60
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:49,388
-I'm sorry.

61
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:52,321
Allow me to explain.

62
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:54,788
The fact of the matter is
that the Women's Soul Reapers

63
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:57,521
Association had been secretly
building a pool for some time.

64
00:04:57,554 --> 00:04:59,654
And unfortunately, it was
discovered and destroyed.

65
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,054
-Scatter.

66
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:06,554
[inaudible]

67
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:20,354
-Oh, damn.

68
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:22,921
Why'd he have to
go and destroy it?

69
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:24,821
-[inaudible] is such a meanie.

70
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:25,754
All

71
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:27,154
-The reason we
were discovered is

72
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:29,054
because you built it in
the middle of the yard

73
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:31,021
where the entire
world could see it.

74
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:32,421
-I accept full responsibility.

75
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:34,288
Next time, I will make
sure to equip the pool

76
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:36,888
with a device that will
intercept Captain Kuchiki

77
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:38,421
before he can get to it.

78
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,588
-That is not what I meant.

79
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,754
-But shouldn't we be discussing
what we're going to do now?

80
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:46,321
-Why don't we just build another
pool in a different location?

81
00:05:46,354 --> 00:05:48,721
-Yeah, but the
question is where?

82
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:49,221
-Hm.

83
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:56,688
-I think I may have a
solution to your problem.

84
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:57,721
-Captain.

85
00:05:57,754 --> 00:05:58,721
-During meetings,
you will address me

86
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:01,621
as Executive Chairwoman.

87
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:02,521
-Yes, ma'am.

88
00:06:02,554 --> 00:06:04,488
-So, you say you
have a solution?

89
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:05,621
-Why, yes.

90
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:07,954
I was thinking that we
all deserve a little R&R

91
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:11,154
at one of those lovely beaches
in the world of the living.

92
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:11,821
-What?

93
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:12,454
-All right, yippee.

94
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:21,321
-Do you understand now?

95
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:23,388
-I think you all ought to
get your heads examined.

96
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:25,288
-I don't know what
you're so upset about.

97
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:27,088
You get to spend all
this time at the beach

98
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,321
with beautiful women
wearing next to nothing.

99
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:30,388
You should be grateful.

100
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:31,154
-She's right.

101
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:32,521
It's a good opportunity.

102
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:34,754
You can finally show your
gratitude to all the people

103
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:37,288
who've helped you over
the years, even Byakuya.

104
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:38,388
He's here too.

105
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:39,654
-Are you kidding me?

106
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:42,288
How did they ever convince
you to come to the beach?

107
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,154
-They wanted to
apologize for building

108
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:45,721
a swimming pool on my property.

109
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:49,988
So they offered to bring me
here for some fun in the sun.

110
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:51,521
-Now that you're
here, I hope you'll

111
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:56,354
enjoy everything the world
of the living has to offer.

112
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:58,921
-And how exactly
is this an apology?

113
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:01,221
-Don't waste too much energy
trying to figure it out

114
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,154
or you won't have enough
left to enjoy the day.

115
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:06,221
-Jushiro, you're here too?

116
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:09,021
-I took the liberty to invite
Captain Ukitake as well.

117
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,354
I thought he might like a
little fresh air and some time

118
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:12,954
away from the Soul Society.

119
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:13,954
-That's right.

120
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:15,421
And then Rangiku
invited us to come along

121
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:17,821
cause she knew that we would
liven things up around here.

122
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,954
-And we had nothing
else going on.

123
00:07:19,988 --> 00:07:21,388
-Well, I figured, why not?

124
00:07:21,421 --> 00:07:23,121
And I've been feeling
much better lately

125
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:25,554
and I thought this might
be a nice change of pace.

126
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:27,454
I have to admit,
soaking up the rays

127
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,854
feels pretty good,
the sun on my head.

128
00:07:30,888 --> 00:07:32,188
-Jushiro.

129
00:07:32,221 --> 00:07:33,554
-Captain.

130
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:35,154
-I'm sorry, I feel
a little dizzy.

131
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:43,354
-Coming here may not have been
such a good idea after all.

132
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:45,088
-If he's had too
much sun, maybe we

133
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:46,921
should get some ice
to cool them down.

134
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:48,421
-That's a good idea.

135
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:50,621
-There's a snack bar up
the beach a little ways.

136
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:51,454
Would you mind?

137
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:52,721
I'm sure they'll have some.

138
00:07:52,754 --> 00:07:54,121
-Yeah, I know
where the place is.

139
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:55,088
I'll go get it.

140
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:58,221
-I'll go along with you.

141
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:02,688
-Excuse me, could you
guys spare a little ice.

142
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:03,888
-Sure.

143
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,588
-Orihime.

144
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:06,354
-Hey there, Ichigo.

145
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:07,654
How's it going?

146
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,388
-I don't mean to be rude,
but what are you doing here?

147
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:10,721
-Working part time.

148
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:11,821
-You mind keeping it down?

149
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:13,688
I'm trying to concentrate.

150
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:14,454
-Uryu?

151
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:16,721
-Chad's working here too.

152
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:17,554
-I don't get it.

153
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:18,388
Why are you all--

154
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:20,054
-Nobody told you anything, huh?

155
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:21,954
Captain Unohana hired
them to help out

156
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:24,754
while we're on vacation.

157
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:26,888
-I know that soul
reapers are my enemy,

158
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:28,588
but when Unohana asked
me for this favor,

159
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:29,821
I couldn't refuse her.

160
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:31,788
-She's very persuasive.

161
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:33,321
-She just thought
it would be easier

162
00:08:33,354 --> 00:08:35,621
if we rented out the
entire beach today.

163
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:37,888
We don't feel like we can
spread our wings with humans

164
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:39,688
running around all
over the place.

165
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:42,488
-You just rented out
the entire beach?

166
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:44,788
-I almost forgot,
Ichigo, did you want ice?

167
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:46,354
-Oh, yeah.

168
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:48,988
-Jushiro got too much sun and
fainted back on the beach.

169
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:51,088
So we need some ice
to cool him off.

170
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:54,021
-Of course, I'll get
some for you right away.

171
00:08:54,054 --> 00:08:54,988
Wake up, Toshiro.

172
00:08:55,021 --> 00:08:56,454
We need some ice, please.

173
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:58,088
-Give me a break.

174
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,988
I told him this would
happen if he overdid it.

175
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:03,154
-Toshiro, what the hell
are you doing here?

176
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,521
And how come you're
not out there

177
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:06,021
on the beach with everyone else?

178
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:08,654
-I'm not real big on all
that sunshine and heat.

179
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:10,888
-When he saw us working at
the snack bar on the beach,

180
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:15,821
Toshiro said he'd help us out by
making ice with his Hyorinmaru.

181
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:16,821
-Wait a minute.

182
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:18,121
Are you allowed to
use your zanpakuto

183
00:09:18,154 --> 00:09:19,421
for something like that?

184
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:21,954
-Hey, did you come here to
ask questions or to get ice?

185
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:23,021
-Oh, right.

186
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:26,254
Could you make us some ice?

187
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,454
-Rain over the frosted
heavens, Hyorinmaru.

188
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:34,021
It's all yours.

189
00:09:34,054 --> 00:09:35,054
-It's kind of big.

190
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:36,821
-Well, if you're not
going to use it all,

191
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:38,654
then can I take half?

192
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:40,988
I thought up a recipe for
a curry mitsumame frappe

193
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:43,488
and I can't wait to try it out.

194
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:45,721
I'll make sure there's
enough for everyone.

195
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:47,821
-What a recipe, sounds lethal.

196
00:09:57,688 --> 00:09:59,354
-It's good to see
you on your feet.

197
00:09:59,388 --> 00:10:01,321
Are you feeling better,
Captain Ukitake?

198
00:10:01,354 --> 00:10:02,854
-Sorry to have worried you.

199
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:05,488
Thanks to all of you, I'm
feeling much better now.

200
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:05,988
See?

201
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:12,088
-Maybe you should take it easy.

202
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,288
-Of course.

203
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,221
-Jushiro, you said you had
an announcement to make.

204
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,688
-Right, I had forgotten.

205
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:22,388
-The first annual
beach art competition?

206
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,954
-We'll see who can build the
most creative sculpture using

207
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:27,621
sand and other objects
from around the beach.

208
00:10:27,654 --> 00:10:29,821
-And I will be judging
the competition.

209
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:31,088
-That's pretty much it.

210
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:33,121
So break up into groups
of two or three people

211
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:34,521
and start creating.

212
00:10:34,554 --> 00:10:37,288
-So we came all the way to the
ocean just to play in the sand.

213
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:41,221
-What about a test of courage or
smashing watermelons, anything?

214
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:42,688
-The winner of the
competition will

215
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:46,821
receive an envelope filled with
cash from the head captain.

216
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,788
-Let's get started.

217
00:10:51,188 --> 00:10:53,988
--[laughing] It's
all about the money.

218
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:54,754
-What do you think?

219
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,154
Shall we give it a try?

220
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,588
-Unlike the others, the prize
money holds no interest for me.

221
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:02,854
However, I do find this
challenge of artistic ability

222
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:04,621
intriguing.

223
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:06,088
Rukia, let's go.

224
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:08,988
-Right.

225
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:11,354
-You're not going to win this
competition standing around

226
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:12,554
with us.

227
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,588
-I think I'd prefer to
watch, if you don't mind.

228
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:16,788
I'm not good at this
sort of thing either.

229
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:19,921
-I wonder where Soifon and
Yoruichi have gotten of to.

230
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:22,688
-I saw them heading for the
water right after we arrived.

231
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:24,488
They said they wanted
to go diving for fish.

232
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:26,321
And I haven't seen them since.

233
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:28,554
You think there's
any need to worry?

234
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:32,521
-I think the only ones we need
to worry about are the fish.

235
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:35,421
-Hey, have you seen
a bucket anywhere?

236
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:37,621
We'll need water
to wet the sand.

237
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:38,721
-Bucket?

238
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:41,421
You and I don't need a
bucket to carry water.

239
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:42,788
-Hm?

240
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:45,321
-What do you think
these are for?

241
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:46,954
All we have to do is
make some cleavage

242
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:48,521
by pushing our boobs
together, and we

243
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,488
can carry all the water we need.

244
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:51,488
-You're so smart.

245
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:53,054
-Here, let me show
you how it's done.

246
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,754
Just grab your boobs like this.

247
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:55,621
-It's broad daylight.

248
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:56,921
What do you think you're doing?

249
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:57,488
-Hm?

250
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:59,088
-Booby buckets.

251
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:00,288
-Disallowed.

252
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:01,188
-Huh?

253
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,221
But why?

254
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,554
-This behavior is
hardly appropriate.

255
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:06,454
-Oh, who cares about that?

256
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:07,821
I get it.

257
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:10,021
You're just jealous because
you don't have enough upstairs

258
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:11,488
to make your own booby buckets.

259
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:13,121
-That has nothing to do with it.

260
00:12:13,154 --> 00:12:15,288
-Huh?

261
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:17,654
Were your boobs always that big?

262
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:18,321
-Why do you ask?

263
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,021
-Don't be so shy.

264
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:26,488
-[inaudible], what's the matter?

265
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:27,854
-Look what we got.

266
00:12:27,888 --> 00:12:29,821
She's wearing pads.

267
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:32,754
-Just leave me along.

268
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:34,721
-OK, looks done to me.

269
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,788
-Oh no.

270
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,388
This baby's not done
until the first guy

271
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,521
digs a secret passageway inside.

272
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:40,388
-I got this.

273
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:41,788
-Knock yourselves out.

274
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:44,788
I stopped playing those kind of
kiddie games a long time ago.

275
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,154
-Kiddie games?

276
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:48,421
That sounds like
an excuse to me.

277
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:52,521
I think someone's
afraid of losing.

278
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,688
-All right then,
you're going down.

279
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:56,621
-Yeah, I don't think so.

280
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:58,554
-You two turkeys
don't stand a chance.

281
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:17,821
-No, no, no, get it off,
get it off. [shouting]

282
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:19,154
-Ikkaku, what happened?

283
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:21,588
-No, Ikkaku's been buried alive.

284
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:23,021
-We've got to dig
him out of there.

285
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:25,188
Don't worry, Ikkaku.

286
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,621
-Just the way I planned.

287
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:30,154
-They're acting like
rowdy idiots over there.

288
00:13:30,188 --> 00:13:32,821
Why can't they work
quietly like everyone else?

289
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,221
-Rukia, they're of
no concern to you.

290
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:39,188
Ignore the distractions
and focus on your own work.

291
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:41,121
-Yes, I apologize, Byakuya.

292
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:41,888
I'll try to focus.

293
00:13:47,854 --> 00:13:49,654
Not bad, if I do say so myself.

294
00:13:58,521 --> 00:14:00,754
-Huh, perhaps adding
some muscle definition

295
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:03,221
would make a bolder statement.

296
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:06,054
-Oh, my big brother
has such talent.

297
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:09,154
His aesthetic sense
is so polished.

298
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:12,388
I knew I'd never be able
to hold a candle to him.

299
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:15,254
At the very least, I must try
to complement his artistry

300
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,288
and not distract from it.

301
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:20,654
-Brother and sister?

302
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:22,588
Maybe not, but they're
still two peas in a pod.

303
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:48,976
-Oh dear.

304
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:49,909
It's so hot.

305
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:51,742
If I don't take
it easy, I'm going

306
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:54,776
to collapse again and
spoil everyone's day.

307
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:57,542
I think I'm going to lie
down a while, [inaudible].

308
00:14:57,576 --> 00:14:59,142
Wake me when it's
time for the judging.

309
00:14:59,176 --> 00:14:59,642
-Yes, sir.

310
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:16,642
-You'd think they could at least
put flush toilets at that snack

311
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:19,042
bar.

312
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:20,876
-Kiyone, try not to
make so much noise.

313
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:22,209
-Hey, what are you doing anyway?

314
00:15:22,242 --> 00:15:23,609
-What are you, blind?

315
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:25,976
I'm building a wall of sand so
the sea breeze doesn't disturb

316
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,976
the Captain while he's sleeping.

317
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:28,742
-What?

318
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:29,876
You're such an idiot.

319
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:32,109
You need to keep the sun
off him, not the wind.

320
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:34,042
Did you think he was
going to blow away?

321
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:35,242
I'll go pick some flowers.

322
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:36,976
The petals will block
the rays of the sun

323
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,209
without overheating him.

324
00:15:38,242 --> 00:15:40,509
-Yeah, well then I'm going
to light some incense

325
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,542
so the Captain'll
sleep more comfortably

326
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:45,076
and have sweet dreams.

327
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:46,309
-I don't get it.

328
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:47,276
What is this?

329
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:56,509
-I'm not sure why, but it
somehow touches my heart

330
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,509
in a way I can't explain.

331
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,242
-If you ask me, it looks like
someone's pulling a bad joke.

332
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:03,609
-Lunch is here.

333
00:16:03,642 --> 00:16:05,176
I hope everyone's
got a good appetite.

334
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:07,776
-There's fried noodles and
rice balls, specially prepared

335
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:10,242
at the seaside snack
bar by yours truly.

336
00:16:10,276 --> 00:16:12,776
-And we've got drinks too.

337
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,342
-Did they have to
set it up there?

338
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,142
-Looks like a funerary
offering, doesn't it?

339
00:16:20,176 --> 00:16:22,742
-I must say, when you
consider all these elements,

340
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:25,642
Captain Ukitake's team
is the obviously winner.

341
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:32,476
-Was Captain Ukitake
even in the competition?

342
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:34,342
-Oh, I just assumed he was.

343
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:36,109
-I'm not sure.

344
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:38,376
-Hey, Ikkaku, are you all right?

345
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:39,076
-That damn crab.

346
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:40,776
-I'll bury you bastards.

347
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:41,709
-It's ruined.

348
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:42,642
[screaming]

349
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:44,609
-What the hell?

350
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:46,909
[screaming]

351
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:48,276
-Something's got
the lieutenants.

352
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:50,776
What the hell is that thing?

353
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:57,042
[screaming]

354
00:16:57,076 --> 00:17:00,409
-Watch where you're
putting that tentacle.

355
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,342
-Get that spine
out of my swimsuit.

356
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:05,042
-Oh damn, why didn't I
bring my camera today?

357
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:07,442
I could have sold that shot
for a nice chunk of change.

358
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:10,309
-I can't believe you would
say something like that.

359
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:12,076
-I never believed it
would actually appear.

360
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,009
-Hey, what's going on?

361
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:15,009
You know what that thing is?

362
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:16,676
-There were rumors
that a strange Hollow

363
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,142
with immense spiritual pressure
had appeared at this beach.

364
00:17:19,176 --> 00:17:22,609
But I just figured it
wouldn't be much of a problem.

365
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:23,876
-Looks like you figured wrong.

366
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,809
But why would you rent
out this entire beach

367
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:28,142
if there was a chance something
like that might show up?

368
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:29,676
-Ichigo, forget about that.

369
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,476
We've got to rescue
the lieutenants.

370
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,076
-You're right.

371
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:37,209
That thing's dangerous.

372
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:37,709
Be careful.

373
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:47,542
[shouting]

374
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:48,942
-What the hell?

375
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:51,509
-Spirit energy attacks
have no effect on it.

376
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:53,042
-How is that possible?

377
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:54,809
-The vines of that
Hollow have the power

378
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,509
to absorb radiated
spirit energy.

379
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:01,876
The only possible way to inflict
damage is with a direct attack.

380
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:03,909
-You mean we can cut that
thing with a zanpakuto?

381
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:07,576
Dammit, I don't have my
substitute soul reaper combat

382
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:09,776
pass or any right now.

383
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:11,376
Rangiku, Rukia--

384
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:12,909
-We came here for
a day at the beach.

385
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:14,742
If we brought our
zanpakuto, they

386
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:16,242
would have just got in the way.

387
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:17,376
-I'm sorry, Ichigo.

388
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:19,009
I also left [inaudible]
inside the snack bar.

389
00:18:23,476 --> 00:18:24,642
-Renji.

390
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:26,742
-Heh, I figured something
like this might happen.

391
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:30,176
So I brought Zabimaru
along just in case.

392
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,776
Roar, Zabimaru!

393
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:38,009
[screaming]

394
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:38,809
-Renji.

395
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:42,042
-Ichigo, look out.

396
00:18:42,076 --> 00:18:43,409
-Where's Byakuya?

397
00:18:43,442 --> 00:18:45,276
-I haven't seen him since we
were working on our sculptures

398
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:46,376
together.

399
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:48,276
-How could he disappear
at a time like this?

400
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:49,409
And where's Jushiro?

401
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,176
-Our captain is taking a nap.

402
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:52,742
-Remember, no
matter what happens,

403
00:18:52,776 --> 00:18:55,376
it's our duty to protect
the captain at all cost.

404
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:56,742
-I know that, you idiot.

405
00:18:56,776 --> 00:18:59,042
-Looks like we're going to have
to take care of this monster

406
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:00,609
ourselves.

407
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:01,609
[screaming]

408
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:02,109
-Orihime.

409
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:06,542
-Ichigo.

410
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:07,542
-Orihime.

411
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:08,576
[screaming]

412
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:10,042
-Chad and I'll keep
it busy until you

413
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:11,742
can get your substitute
soul reaper pass.

414
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,576
-Yeah.

415
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,709
-That's a good idea, thanks.

416
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:21,176
What the?

417
00:19:24,642 --> 00:19:25,109
Dammit.

418
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:33,842
-Sting all enemies to
death, [speaking japanese].

419
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:45,376
-You should have been
trying to help instead

420
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:47,176
of standing around
doing nothing.

421
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:48,642
-Well, yeah, but I was--

422
00:19:48,676 --> 00:19:50,542
-We were going after
sharks in the ocean, when

423
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:52,942
all of a sudden Renji
dropped in out of nowhere.

424
00:19:52,976 --> 00:19:54,409
We figured something
must be wrong.

425
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,342
So we raced back here.

426
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:58,509
What is going on around here?

427
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,909
And where did that
monster come from?

428
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:04,142
-[yawn] Nice nap.

429
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:05,376
-Captain.

430
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:07,209
-He slept through all of
that screaming and fighting,

431
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:08,842
but now that it's
quiet, he wakes up?

432
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,109
-I don't know.

433
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,309
Sometimes I wonder
about that guy.

434
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:16,576
-Oh, I see you've started the
watermelon smashing already.

435
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:18,342
-Watermelon?

436
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:19,276
-He's right.

437
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:21,776
You It does taste
like watermelon.

438
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:23,909
-It's about time
you figured it out.

439
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:26,509
-Byakuya, I still don't
know what's going on.

440
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:27,909
-Sorry for the confusion.

441
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:30,042
Allow me to explain.

442
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:32,742
The other captains and I thought
you all deserved some fun.

443
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:34,409
So we put our heads
together and came up

444
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,609
with this watermelon
smashing event.

445
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:38,642
-We thought you'd enjoy it.

446
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:39,476
-Huh?

447
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:41,076
What about that story earlier?

448
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,676
-I just made that
up because I thought

449
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,876
it would add to the excitement.

450
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:48,409
-The truth is it's a very
special watermelon recently

451
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:50,709
developed by the Department
of Research and Development

452
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:52,176
for use against Hollows.

453
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,976
-She has to be joking
with us, right?

454
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,776
-How can a watermelon
stop a Hollow?

455
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:00,276
-It's not a day at the beach
without watermelon smashing.

456
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:02,842
So I put a request in to the
acting assistant chairwoman,

457
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:03,976
and guess what?

458
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,109
-Fortunately, I was able
to fill that request.

459
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:07,442
-Excellent.

460
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,842
-So you any other captains
went to all this trouble just

461
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,209
to throw a surprise for us?

462
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:12,342
-That's right.

463
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:14,576
I hope you all enjoyed
it as much as we did.

464
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:17,642
-We were supposed to enjoy this?

465
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,909
-Captain.

466
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:22,109
-Hey, Ichi, want to
eat some watermelon?

467
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:24,609
-What, you mean you
can really eat that?

468
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:25,642
-That's not all.

469
00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:27,809
There are still more
surprises to come.

470
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:29,809
-Huh?

471
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:31,809
[screaming]

472
00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:33,809
[giggling]

473
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:38,309
-We've prepared one
watermelon for each of you.

474
00:21:38,342 --> 00:21:39,976
-This way, no one's left out.

475
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:42,076
Now you can all enjoy
smashing watermelons

476
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:43,409
to your heart's content.

477
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:46,309
-Wait, hold on a minute.

478
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:49,076
-Ha, what are we waiting for?

479
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:50,676
Let's smash.

480
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,209
Ichigo: I don't even
like watermelon.

481
00:21:59,009 --> 00:21:59,509
-Huh?

482
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:00,476
So here you are.

483
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:02,376
-Give me a break.

484
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:04,709
If you think I'm going to go
out and sweat in that heat,

485
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:05,276
you're crazy.

488
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:47,921
-You guys are such
a bunch of losers.

489
00:23:47,954 --> 00:23:49,154
You'd think at least
one of you would

490
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:51,121
have the manners to complement
us on our swimsuits.

491
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:53,187
-You're giving them
way too much credit.

492
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:54,954
-Maybe they'll notice
if we take them off.

493
00:23:54,987 --> 00:23:56,454
--[inaudible], what
are you doing?

494
00:23:56,487 --> 00:23:57,554
-Let go of me.

495
00:23:57,587 --> 00:23:58,854
If that's what they
want, I'll take it off.

496
00:23:58,887 --> 00:23:59,621
Let go.

497
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:03,154
-You're drunk, aren't you?
