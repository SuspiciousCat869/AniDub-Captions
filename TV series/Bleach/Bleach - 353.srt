1
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:54,572
[Kugo]
I see.

2
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:58,676
So Orihime Inoue
said that, huh?

3
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,485
[Chad] Based on her story, I've got my
own thoughts about Tsukishima's ability.

4
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,554
It'smental.

5
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,989
I think.
Like mind games.

6
00:02:12,957 --> 00:02:17,128
Do you happen to recall if his Fullbring
had the power to alter people's memories?

7
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,163
Hmmh.

8
00:02:19,197 --> 00:02:23,101
Please tell me what you know. There's
no point in keeping secrets.

9
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:24,502
Eyyah!

10
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,978
Haaaa!

11
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:49,827
[pleased] Hm. That's much getting better.
At this pace--

12
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:50,828
Uh!

13
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:51,696
Ichigo!

14
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:52,864
Huh?

15
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,867
What the?! My Combat Pass...!!

16
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:59,804
Eaurrgh!

17
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:01,839
GRAAGHHH!!

18
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:05,009
What about
Uryu Ishida?

19
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,544
Huh?

20
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,881
He was attacked by
Tsukishima as well, right?

21
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:12,884
Does Ishida's memory
seem to be affected?

22
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:17,021
If Uryu Ishida's memory
is affected too,

23
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:19,891
that's something else
we have to worry about.

24
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,527
But if his memories
haven't been affected,

25
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,428
What, Kugo?
What are you thinking?

26
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:28,065
That means it
wasn't Tsukishima,

27
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,835
who stabbed Orihime Inoue.

28
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:32,036
Mh!

29
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,741
[Tsukishima]
You sure about that?

30
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:38,876
[gasps]

31
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,447
[gasp]

32
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,558
Well now. It's been a long time, Ginjo.
Hasn't it?

33
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:55,927
Tsukishima!

34
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,765
So this is him.

35
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:05,002
So, how have
you all been?

36
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,873
Kutsuzawa,hope you haven't
been drinking too much.

37
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,211
Yukio. Looks like you're still
hooked on playing video games.

38
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:17,615
That's not good. You should try
reading more books instead.

39
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:21,519
And Riruka's
not here?

40
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,488
Tsukishima! Why did
you come here!?

41
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,157
[bored]
Hmmh.

42
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:28,726
I don't see Jackie
around here either.

43
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,128
Don't ignore me!

44
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:33,631
They in there?

45
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,734
No, don't do it!!

46
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:50,748
What is this?!

47
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:04,028
Ichigo...

48
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,467
Hmm.

49
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:15,973
Ngh... Ahh...

50
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:23,948
[labored breathing]

51
00:05:31,155 --> 00:05:33,124
[labored breathing]

52
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:40,698
Ichigo...

53
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,011
[gasp]

54
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,548
[gasp]

55
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,492
Your clothes!
That's a...

56
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,863
A Shihakusho!
Can it be...

57
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:16,000
...that his Soul Reaper
powers have returned?

58
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,870
No. That's not it.
Something's different.

59
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:23,207
It's a...
Clad-Type Fullbring!

60
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:27,078
[Chad] So then, is this is the
true form of Ichigo's Fullbring?!

61
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,147
Of course!

62
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,617
Itwasthesameway
withIchigo'sBankai.

63
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:38,155
Not only did his sword change, but
his Shihakusho changed as well.

64
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:41,459
Heeven said that it was
a part of his Bankai.

65
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:45,596
It was a Bankai that
he actually wore.

66
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:50,000
For Ichigo, wearing his
power is his true form.

67
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:55,806
Hmf. Didn't you know?

68
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:59,143
When Riruka's "Dollhouse"
container is destroyed,

69
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:01,879
whatever's inside is
automatically set free.

70
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:07,184
So your new friends had you training
in that little fishtank, did they?

71
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:13,758
And it looks like your Fullbring is
already starting to take its shape.

72
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,961
You could've let me know instead
of keeping me out of the loop.

73
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:21,599
Huh.

74
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:24,068
You again.
Who are you?

75
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,209
What do you want with me?
Why're you here?

76
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:35,479
Well. That's a
rather odd question.

77
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:37,748
So no one has told
you about me yet?

78
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,483
This is bad!

79
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:42,586
[Chad] Ichigo isn't ready
to engage him in battle.

80
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,890
I'm Shukuro Tsukishima.

81
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,559
Everyone else
already knows me.

82
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:50,895
Hraaah!

83
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:52,496
Chad! Hold it!!

84
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,864
Raaagh!

85
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:03,874
Idiot! Why would he pull
something like that in here?

86
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:05,142
[resident]
Hey! What was that?!

87
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:06,577
It felt like an explosion!
But from where?!

88
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,845
There must've
been a gas leak!

89
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:10,214
Someone call the fire
department! Hurry!

90
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:13,918
What the hell
was that?!

91
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:17,755
Perfect. Now every idiot is
losing their mind today.

92
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:20,891
I will take care of
dealing with the

93
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:23,127
neighbors, the fire
department and the police.

94
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:27,031
Oh man. Who do you think'll have
to pay to fix all this damage?

95
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:31,869
Hey! Who the hell blew a hole in the
wall anyway?! Who was it?!! Chad?!

96
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,504
huh?

97
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:36,140
He's gone!

98
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:38,142
Ginjo!!

99
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:43,747
Gone too. Will someone please
explain what's going on?!

100
00:08:49,053 --> 00:08:49,987
What the hell was that?!

101
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:53,023
Don't go making things
worse than they are.

102
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:56,727
Ichigo has finally
activated his Fullbring.

103
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,697
I think it's time for us to
tell him about Tsukishima.

104
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:06,604
No. We still don't have any idea how
powerful Ichigo's Fullbring really is.

105
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:10,474
We also don't know if he
has full control over it.

106
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,445
Here's the
other thing.

107
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:16,814
Letting Ichigo know that
Tsukishima was the one

108
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:19,016
who attacked Orihime
will be very dangerous!

109
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:21,619
[Ichigo]
I see.

110
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:22,186
Ah!

111
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:24,021
He's the one who did it...

112
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,022
[gasp]

113
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:27,625
Ichigo!

114
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,533
I had no idea, that you guys were so
concerned about me, and what I'd do.

115
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:41,906
[Tsukishima]
You must have a bad temper.

116
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:47,978
You attacked my
friend Orihime.

117
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:50,481
Were you also the one
who cut down Uryu?

118
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,150
What do you think?

119
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:55,686
Rrrgh!

120
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,593
[amused]
Hmm.

121
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:07,097
So I take it this
is your Fullbring?

122
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:09,099
Huuaahh!

123
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:14,138
I'll grant you this much;
you're strong.

124
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:15,940
Yaaah!

125
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,618
Heh.

126
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:28,619
Damn!

127
00:10:31,522 --> 00:10:34,558
The hell's going on?! Ichigo's
moves aren't reaching him!

128
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,528
Even though all his attacks
and timing look dead on!

129
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:39,797
Look at
Tsukishima's feet.

130
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:44,001
It's a Bringer Light!

131
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:47,204
Right at the moment when those
attacks are about to reach him...

132
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:50,841
Tsukishima's using the Bringer
Light technique to continue making

133
00:10:50,874 --> 00:10:53,944
a high-speed move that's keeping
him just out of harm's way.

134
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:04,722
Humh.

135
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,056
Ichigo!

136
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,024
Hold on!

137
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,159
What is that?

138
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:11,895
Yah! Hah! Hyaahh!

139
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:15,633
You know, you'll never be able
to hit me with such attacks.

140
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,668
Yahhh!

141
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:19,603
You'll never
touch me.

142
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:23,107
[slight gasp]

143
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:30,047
That was fast.

144
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:31,882
Yahhhh!

145
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:35,019
Well well!

146
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,487
See that?!

147
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,057
I did. When did he learn
to use Bringer Light?

148
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:43,994
Impressive!

149
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:54,471
He used Fullbring against the
concrete to really boost his jump.

150
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,573
Huaaahh!

151
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,543
You should know, your
Fullbring's still not enough.

152
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:01,879
Yaahhhh!

153
00:12:01,912 --> 00:12:02,680
[gasp]

154
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:06,984
Amazing.

155
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:09,753
[Chad] It was very slight,
but during his jump

156
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:12,890
he applied Fullbring to the
air to accelerate himself!

157
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:17,528
He's already mastered Fullbring
enough to use it to that extent?

158
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,966
I take it back!

159
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,570
Looks like you're more capable
than I'd originally anticipated.

160
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:28,038
And yet...

161
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,111
It's a shame.

162
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,016
Your Fullbring power
is still not complete.

163
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,150
Huh?!

164
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,620
[gasp]

165
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:52,463
You still have a
long way to go.

166
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,835
Huagh!

167
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,705
If you concentrate on your
right arm, the Fullbring

168
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:03,607
on your left arm can become
undone quite easily.

169
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:08,145
For example, you were unable to break
your fall just now. Isn't that right?

170
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:12,616
Damn it.

171
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:15,152
[gasp]

172
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:27,498
That's far enough.

173
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:32,703
Sorry, but I'd say it's still too
early for Ichigo to be fighting you.

174
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:35,139
Really?

175
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,494
I've come back! Hey!

176
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,597
Man, talk about crazy!
You won't believe this:

177
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,200
I guess they said on TV
that honey was good for

178
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,536
you, and now it's getting
sold out everywhere!

179
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,440
So I rode my bike to the next, next town,
went to fifteen different stores to--

180
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,607
Hnh!?

181
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,142
Hello?

182
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,246
Mr. Tsukishima?

183
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,717
You in the bathroom, sir?

184
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,053
Hmm...

185
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,991
Are ya taking a dump?

186
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,667
Why are you
interfering, Ginjo?

187
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,170
We see things differently.

188
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,640
Because to me, you're the one
who's doing the interfering here.

189
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,013
[Ichigo]
Ginjo.

190
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:41,614
Hm?!

191
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,552
Get outta my way!

192
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,290
Not gonna happen.

193
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,258
[gasp]

194
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,597
I mean it. Move, so
I can take him out.

195
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,033
Aulp!

196
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,635
[gasp for air]

197
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,640
[coughing]

198
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,575
You just don't
get it, do you?

199
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,644
I'm saying you're
in the way here.

200
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:18,117
You don't fall onto concrete from
that high up and not really feel it.

201
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,355
Now that mortal body of yours
is struggling just to breathe.

202
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:27,994
We can't afford to have you die.
So just shut up and stay down.

203
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,730
Damn you.

204
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:39,672
You're serious about this? If you
fight me you'll die. You know that.

205
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,140
Hmh.

206
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,343
We really don't see things
the same way, do we?

207
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:49,715
I am serious about this. And
you're the one who's gonna die.

208
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:54,720
Hrrgh!

209
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,712
Get out of there Ginjo!!
I can still...!

210
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,283
What is it?

211
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,452
Don't do it, Ichigo.

212
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,388
You feel that your
power's weaker, right?

213
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,558
In your condition, it'd be
impossible to beat him!

214
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,601
That's what a battle between
true Fullbringers looks like.

215
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,639
So you expect me to just
stand here and watch this?!

216
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:50,743
You'd let the guy who attacked Uryu and
Orihime get away with what he did?!

217
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,578
I never said that!

218
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:56,115
All I'm saying is that it's still
too early for you to fight him.

219
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,063
Haahh!

220
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,035
Something isn't right.

221
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,505
I can tell from his attacks that
Tsukishima isn't holding back.

222
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,275
He's definitely trying to inflict
the most possible damage.

223
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,076
And yet...

224
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,082
he doesn't seem to
have lethal intent.

225
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:35,721
Ginjo.

226
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,324
Hrrrahhh!

227
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,998
What the hell
is he thinking?

228
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,004
Hmh.

229
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,042
Ngh! Damn you.

230
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,643
Hraah!

231
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,296
Hm?

232
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,733
HaaaaaAAAAAAA!

233
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,538
RAAAGHHH!

234
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,180
Huh?!

235
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,053
[Yukio] Ugh. What've
they done now!?

236
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,455
I bet something
stupid.

237
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,524
- Oh! - I hope everyone's okay!
- What happened?

238
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,159
Hmm!

239
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,296
- See the dust! - It came from over
that way! - I'm not sure what it was!

240
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:55,334
- No police yet. - I heard it! It's
no fire! - I dunno, I just got here!!

241
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:59,005
So ya think that's an
explosion or a fire?

242
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,140
Must have been really big!

243
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,477
Their fighting is starting
to draw too much attention.

244
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,412
It's best that we act quickly.

245
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:16,722
Agh!

246
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,427
Ginjo!

247
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:22,561
No, don't!

248
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:23,763
Let go of me!

249
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,631
Ichigo!

250
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,640
That was careless. You just
destroyed a whole building.

251
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,742
What if there were
people inside there?

252
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:43,115
Not to worry. When I jumped you, I made
sure to choose an abandoned building.

253
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:48,354
I see. Well, since that's the
case, guess I'll let loose too.

254
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,457
Hyaah!

255
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,460
Yaggh!

256
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,466
Yahh!

257
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,743
I'm not done with you!

258
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,049
Ichigo's changed
his fighting style.

259
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,685
Has he learned to control
his Fullbring even more

260
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,121
just by watching how
Ginjo was fighting?

261
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,026
Incredible!

262
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,600
It certainly appears that
your Fullbring's improved.

263
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,007
But no matter, your sort of
attack still has no effect on me.

264
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,176
Huaaaaggh!

265
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,583
How dense are you?
Don't you see?

266
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,651
Your Fullbring is
still incomplete.

267
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,991
Haaaaaa!

268
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,002
Ichigo!

269
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:11,470
[gasp]

270
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:25,184
That's a big difference
from a few seconds ago.

271
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,319
Not bad.

272
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,455
The power you just displayed,

273
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,626
It's a lot closer to the power
that you once possessed.

274
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,060
[gasp]

275
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,365
GYAAHHHH!

276
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,067
"Invaders Must Die."

277
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,103
Mh?

278
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,304
The hell's this?!

279
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,439
[bleep bloop]

280
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,479
I get it.

281
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,383
You don't want me coming
in contact with Ichigo

282
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,285
Kurosaki when his powers
are still incomplete.

283
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,455
Especially since he is so very
close to perfecting them.

284
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,728
That right, Yukio?

285
00:23:46,814 --> 00:23:49,717
[Yukio] I feel like we're really
forgetting something here.

286
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,820
[Riruka] Well aside from the fact that
Ginjo and Chad owe me an explanation,

287
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:54,355
what else is there?!

288
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:57,057
[Yukio] It's not about your stupid
issue, it's something else.

289
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:58,993
[Jackie] You've all
forgotten that this story's

290
00:23:59,026 --> 00:24:00,961
moving forward without
anyone coming to help me!
