inside her?!

but I don't have the time.
I'm on a tight schedule.

14
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:45,738
The more pressing question you
should be asking yourself is,
why did I summon you here?

15
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:50,672
You're here so I
can erase you.

16
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:55,538
Erase my existence?
Why am I your target?

Exactly what
I said.

All of a sudden his

vanished.

However, you lack the
destructive force to defeat
me with a single attack.

And as long as the attack
you use is Nigeki Kessatsu,

Despite that, your
Spirit Energy is
gradually weakening.

earlier, I wouldn't be able

to fight as a Soul Reaper!

160
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,056
That isn't going
to be possible.

161
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:58,322
Why not?

162
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:01,456
The Head Captain's fate...

163
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:04,656
<i>is about to be sealed.</i>

164
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:08,556
[raspy panting]

165
00:16:10,156 --> 00:16:13,889
Come, Master Genryusai.
Let's put an end to this,
shall we?

166
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:16,856
It's just too bad,
Old Man Yama.

167
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:24,889
<i>[Soi Fon]</i>
<i>You must've noticed it.</i>

168
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:29,156
<i>The Head Captain's</i>
<i>Spiritual Pressure</i>
<i>is becoming weaker.</i>

169
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:33,456
And he's not the only
one getting weaker.

170
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:39,756
Kenpachi Zaraki,
Toshiro Hitsugaya
and Byakuya Kuchiki.

171
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:45,989
<i>None of those real</i>
<i>captains will survive,</i>
<i>and have the opportunity</i>
<i>to reach Kageroza.</i>

172
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,789
All you Reigai
underestimate our
Head Captain.

173
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:50,756
What?

174
00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:54,789
<i>[Komamura]</i>
<i>For the past thousand years,</i>
<i>Sir Genryusai has remained</i>

175
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:57,556
<i>as the most powerful</i>
<i>Soul Reaper that lives.</i>

176
00:17:08,822 --> 00:17:09,822
<i>[gasps]</i>

177
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:12,956
Huh?

178
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:18,656
Oh damn!

179
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:28,089
Feel my Ennetsu Jigoku!
Resist until you are ashes!

180
00:17:56,056 --> 00:17:59,156
It appears you no
longer have your
strength or speed.

181
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:04,022
You don't appear to be
able to move, either.

182
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:05,289
True.

183
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:08,689
I don't seem to
have much Spirit
Energy left.

184
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:12,556
Captain Soi Fon,
why is it that
you fight?

185
00:18:13,622 --> 00:18:17,356
Heh. Because it is
my duty to fight.

186
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:23,189
I see. That's exactly
the kind of answer
I'd expect from you.

187
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:27,489
But that can't be
the only reason.

188
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:28,022
What?!

189
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:34,322
Someone who rises to the
rank of captain can't
increase their powers
without bearing some burden.

190
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:38,722
There must be something more.
Another reason for you to fight.

191
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,689
Ngh.

192
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:48,289
I sense you have
another reason.

193
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:51,722
We all possess something
inside us that we
cannot compromise.

194
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:56,289
It's that inner passion
that gives us the strength
and courage to fight.

195
00:18:57,356 --> 00:18:58,789
Well, let's settle this!

196
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:01,422
Bankai!

197
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:05,256
Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh!

198
00:19:21,922 --> 00:19:26,756
In your weakened condition,
you no longer have any means
of avoiding my attacks.

199
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:31,956
Don't be so sure.
I too have my last
resort move ready.

200
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:39,489
We will see. For a warrior like
me, the thing I desire most of
all is a contest of strength!

201
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:42,656
Bankai!
Jakuho Raikouben!

202
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:56,789
This goes against my pride,
but I must win.

203
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:58,256
Ugh.

204
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,456
[crowd gasps]

205
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:47,389
Sir Genryusai. I'm on--

206
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:02,722
Ahh. Another large
Spiritual Pressure is gone.

207
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:05,889
Captain Zaraki,
Captain Komamura,

208
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:08,289
And even Head
Captain Yamamoto.

209
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:13,756
Not one of them was
able to find their way
here and reach me.

210
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:18,689
Soon the remaining captains
will be gone, like the others.

211
00:21:27,256 --> 00:21:29,856
You can't fight me any
more with your wounds.

212
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:35,556
Yet you still
won't give up.

213
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:39,489
There's only one head
of the Kuchiki clan.

214
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:40,922
There can't be two.

215
00:21:43,356 --> 00:21:44,356
Bankai.

216
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:50,389
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

217
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:55,689
Bankai.
Senbonzakura
Kageyoshi.

218
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:48,549
<i>[Nozomi]</i>
<i>Are the captains</i>

219
