ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
It turned out

3
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:40,303
that Urahara himself was
behind the three Mod-Souls who

4
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:41,836
had been running
us all over town,

5
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,436
trying to make us
stronger as a team.

6
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,003
Meanwhile, there were reports
of people having their souls

7
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:49,836
sucked out by strange
intruders known as Bounts.

8
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,936
The three Mod-Souls,
Ririn, Kurodo, and Noba,

9
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:54,769
concealed themselves
inside stuffed dolls

10
00:01:54,803 --> 00:01:55,769
so they could assist us.

11
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:57,403
It was their
investigation that led

12
00:01:57,436 --> 00:02:00,703
us to cross paths
with the Bounts.

13
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:01,669
-Damn.

14
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:03,469
I don't know where to cut it.

RUKIA: What are you
doing, you fool?

20
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:37,036
What's wrong with you, Ichigo?

21
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,103
You rusty?

I want you to destroy them.

-Destroy?

27
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:54,569
I understand.

28
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:57,069
-I have never seen this power.

-My, my, Yoshino.

00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:32,003
How naughty, wandering
around without my permission.

34
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:32,703
-All right.

35
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,803
Who the hell are you?

36
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:36,303
Are you another Bount?

37
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,703
-He's a noisy one, isn't he?

38
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:40,969
-Ichigo, be careful!

39
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:45,803
-You know, where I come,
from food doesn't talk.

40
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:47,569
-What's that supposed to mean?

41
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,003
-Hm.

You give me no choice, then.

-Hm.

49
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:18,969
I suggest you try not to
struggle so much, my dear.

50
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:21,503
Fried here has a bit of an
anger management problem

51
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:23,236
and doesn't always
do what I say.

52
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:27,203
-What?

53
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:29,636
Aren't the two of you
supposed to be on same side?

54
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,236
Quiet, you insignificant bu.

55
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:33,969
You're giving me a headache.

-Noisy Soul Reaper.

57
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:47,003
-How did you do that?

58
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,969
What kind of powers
do Bounts have?

59
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:50,969
-If you will excuse us.

60
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:53,336
As you should know,
nobility and pigs

61
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:54,936
never share the same table.

00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:10,436
-What where does two?

00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:13,069

-Orihime, Chad,
where'd you come from?

00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:22,569
-Ichigo, the guy
that was just here.

-Yeah, do you know him?

00:05:24,936 --> 00:05:29,069
-No, but I've seen
what he can do.

I can't believe it.

74
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,503
The virginal,
unexplored territory

75
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:39,669
of Rukia's small
but welcoming chest.

76
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:44,269
It'll be rock climbing
a cushy, vertical wall.

You little pervert.

80
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:48,236
Just pay for that.

81
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:49,203
ORIHIME: Oh, Rukia!

82
00:05:49,236 --> 00:05:50,703
Welcome back! [giggle]

83
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:52,136
-Thanks.

84
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:57,069
-I didn't expect to
see you again so soon.

85
00:05:57,103 --> 00:05:59,503
Isn't this great?

86
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:00,569
-Yeah.

87
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:02,936
-Oh, and you look so
good in that dress.

88
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:04,903
Uryu's love really
shines through,

89
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:08,103
and I bet he'll be so
happy-- uh, I mean-- I mean,

90
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:09,803
there's a new special
at the cafe called

91
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,769
Mate Pasta with Green Tea Sauce.

92
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:14,636
I think we should all go there
to celebrate your return.

93
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:15,403
You want to?

94
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:16,269
-Uh.

95
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:17,569
-What do you say, Rukia?

96
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:18,436
It'll be fun.

97
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:19,369
-Well, sure.

98
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:21,269
I'd be happy to
do that with you.

99
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:22,036
Why not?

100
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:22,969
ORIHIME: [giggle] Yeah!

101
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:24,736
I promise you'll love it.

102
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:26,969
First of all, we have to
order the seafood appetizer.

103
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:28,203
It's fantastic!

104
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:30,936
And then we will have to
order the curry frappuccino.

105
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:33,936
It's--

106
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:36,336
-And then I was given
orders to return here

107
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:38,703
and again rid this
town of Hollows.

108
00:06:38,736 --> 00:06:41,203
It wasn't what I was expecting,
or even what I wanted.

109
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:43,936
I had hoped that I would
return to training.

110
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,903
But I was in no position
to question the order.

111
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:48,503
-I guess it figures.

112
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:50,903
I rescued you, and now
I'm stuck with you again.

113
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:52,003
-Hey, wait a minute.

114
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,403
That's my line.

115
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:54,236
-Hm?

116
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:55,469
-Ichigo, who is this person?

117
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:56,036
-Ah!

118
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:57,036
What is that?

119
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:58,469
Why is that ugly
stuffed doll talking?

120
00:06:58,503 --> 00:06:59,036
-Oh, right.

121
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:00,169
Pick on me.

122
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,836
Make fun of the poor,
helpless, ugly old doll.

123
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:04,269
I'm here to assist Ichigo.

124
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:07,603
I didn't get to choose
my own body. [cries]

125
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,536
RUKIA: To assist you how?

126
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,103
-Urahara told me
that I'd need her

127
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:15,436
to locate those Bount
characters we saw earlier.

128
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,236
-Hm.

129
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,003
I don't think I understand.

130
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,303
-Huh.

131
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:20,969
Well, if you judge everything
you see by its appearance,

132
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:22,136
then you'll be sorry.

133
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:23,803
KURODO: She meant she
doesn't understand

134
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:27,203
what the Bounts are
doing here, Ririn.

135
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:28,203
-Huh.

136
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:29,169
I can't even tell
if they're allies,

137
00:07:29,203 --> 00:07:31,036
or if they could be enemies.

138
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,703
KURODO: Yes, they
are hard to read.

139
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:33,503
That's for sure.

140
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,836
And they are dangerous.

141
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:37,769
But as for their objectives,
I don't know, I don't know,

142
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:38,903
I don't know.

143
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:40,769
Hello there, my
pretty young lady.

144
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:43,536
-[gasp] What is this?

145
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:44,036
-Huh?

146
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:44,703
Oh.

147
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:46,069
His name is Kurodo.

148
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:47,869
Urahara gave him to
me as an assistant.

149
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:51,969
And right over there is Noba,
who's here to assist Chad.

150
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:52,469
-Hm.

151
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:54,669
Hello.

152
00:07:54,703 --> 00:07:56,803
-He's so-- so cute.

153
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:58,236
-Hm?

154
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,036
-Oh, I just love him.

155
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:01,969
He looks just like my Chappy.

156
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:02,969
-Hey, hey, hey.

157
00:08:03,003 --> 00:08:04,269
What's the big idea?

158
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:06,069
I thought I was the
one you loved the best.

159
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:07,769
How can love be so cruel?

160
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:09,703
-You mean a lot to me Rukia.

161
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:12,936
But as much as I'd like to,
I can't give you Kurodo.

162
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:13,669
Oh!

163
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:15,003
We both want the same man.

164
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,536
It's a love triangle.

165
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,603
KON: I want to be in
the love triangle, too!

166
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:21,503
Here I was sure I was the
fluffy, comforting character,

167
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:22,836
when suddenly disaster strikes!

168
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,903
I've been tossed out like an
old shoe, kicked to the curb,

169
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:27,836
sen to sleep with the fishes.

170
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:28,803
No!

171
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:30,736
[cries]

172
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:54,236
-After you.

173
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:05,169
-It's beautiful, isn't it?

174
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:14,303
It's the kind of view
only available to those

175
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,103
completely shrouded in darkness.

176
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,103
-Jin.

177
00:09:23,136 --> 00:09:25,203
-I do enjoy looking out at them.

178
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:30,236
But you and could never become
bright lights, could we?

179
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,003
-[whimper]

180
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:37,569
-Did you eat a proper meal?

181
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:39,703
It's important you
keep your strength up.

182
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:44,669
And what of this bruise?

183
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,903
Have you been giving Uragawa
a difficult time again?

184
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,469
Has something
happened to upset you?

185
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:59,336
-I'm afraid that Yoshino
still doesn't fully

186
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:02,569
understand her position
and responsibilities here.

187
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,669
Her actions are
difficult to defend.

188
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:06,736
-My position?

189
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,536
Just what does that mean?

190
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:10,536
-You know exactly what
it means, unless you're

191
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,103
even more naive than I thought.

192
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:14,869
-Now, now, Uragawa.

193
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:17,436
No need to be so
unkind to Yoshino.

194
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:18,569
-Yes, sir.

195
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:20,403
My apologies.

196
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:24,003
-All the same, Yoshino, I cannot
completely forgive your many

197
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:25,936
transgressions here of late.

198
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:27,603
-No matter, because
I've done nothing

199
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:30,369
for which I need
your forgiveness.

200
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:31,569
-Huh?

201
00:10:31,603 --> 00:10:34,836
-I won't be ordered around
by you or anyone else.

202
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:36,903
-That's fine with me.

203
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,703
But you worry me a
great deal, Yoshino.

204
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:42,236
You are too weak and
foolish, I'm afraid.

205
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:43,603
I am sorry.

206
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:46,369
You forced me to take action
to protect you from yourself.

207
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:52,803
Don't do it.

208
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:56,069
I have no wish to cause
you any further pain.

209
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:26,253
-Sorry to be
visiting you so late.

210
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:28,987
We've decided to spend the
evening studying all together

211
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,687
at the last minute
for our exam tomorrow,

212
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,753
as young students so often do.

213
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:33,987
-Oh, no problem.

214
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,087
Make yourselves right at home.

215
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,987
-Thank you Mr. Kurosaki.

216
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,887
-Hm.

217
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,520
-Dad, I know what you're
thinking, but forget it.

218
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:45,287
No coming in my
room with cookies

219
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,320
or any other lame excuse
just to see those girls.

220
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,787
[grunt] My head.

221
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,720
-Sweet dreams.

222
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:54,887
-Oh, Ichigo, are you all right?

223
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,520
-If this was real, that
would have hurt. [laughs]

224
00:11:56,553 --> 00:11:58,487
-What in the world
are you talking about?

225
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,753
-Obviously this has to
be a delicious dream

226
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,053
that I'm having.

227
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,220
There's no way Ichigo could
have ever gotten not one,

228
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,687
but two pretty
girls to come over.

229
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,187
So I know none of this is real.

230
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,753
I mean, come on.

231
00:12:08,787 --> 00:12:09,653
[shout]

232
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,453
-How's that?

233
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:11,520
Does that feel real to you?

234
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:14,553
-Oh, that feels so good, Rukia.

235
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:15,253
-Look at him.

236
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:16,553
Not a care in the world.

237
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:17,520
Must be nice.

238
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:18,620
-So what do we do?

239
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:20,553
Anyone have any suggestions?

240
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:23,320
-Well, we have these three guys
to help us locate the Bounts.

241
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:25,820
But even if that works, I'm
not sure the Bounts will

242
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:30,287
sit down and talk with us,
never mind capturing them.

243
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,553
-Hm.

244
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:34,253
-Aside from trickery, what
power did the Bounts have?

245
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,653
-Hm.

246
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,320
Well, like us, the enemies seem
to have different powers that

247
00:12:37,353 --> 00:12:40,020
vary from one individual to
the next, which is a headache.

248
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:41,953
It's hard to know
what will work.

249
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:43,720
-That's for sure.

250
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:47,187
My Zanpakuto had no effect
on that fire monster, Goethe.

251
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,553
And the other guy's
a complete mystery.

252
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:51,287
We need to learn a
hell of a lot more,

253
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,787
or we won't have a clue
how fight these guys.

254
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,620
-Whatever we do,
we've got to do fast,

255
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:58,087
before anybody else gets
their soul sucked out.

256
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,353
-I know that.

257
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:02,053
Believe me, I'm open to
suggestions if you got 'em.

258
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:03,387
-Hm.

259
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,920
-What about the Soul Society?

260
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:07,187
-Didn't they give you any
information on these Bounts?

261
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,587
-Huh?

262
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,520
-Well, you were sent here about
the same time they showed up.

263
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:13,187
They must have
told you something.

264
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,787
-No, I'd never
even heard of them

265
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,220
until that first encounter.

266
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,653
The Soul Society may know
something about them,

267
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:21,020
but they certainly
didn't tell me.

268
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:22,553
-Well, that sucks.

269
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:23,153
Now what?

270
00:13:23,187 --> 00:13:24,053
[beeping]

271
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:26,587
-Huh?

272
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,287
-Hello?

273
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,087
RENJI (ON PHONE): Rukia!

274
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,487
Is that really you?

275
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,353
I just heard from the captain
that you got reassigned here.

276
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:32,053
That's great!

277
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:33,487
I'm coming right over.

278
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,687
-Coming over?

279
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,187
Renji--

280
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,320
[shouting]

281
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:37,953
ICHIGO'S DAD: Who the
hell are you, intruder?

282
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:40,053
[grunt]

283
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,053
-Oh, no.

284
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:41,587
Dad!

285
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:45,553
ICHIGO'S DAD: Oh, man.

286
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:46,353
-Hey!

287
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:47,520
Hi, Rukia!

288
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:49,753
-Oh, don't stop, Rukia.

289
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,053
-Uh, OK.

290
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:52,587
Where was I again?

291
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,520
There are these guys called
Bounts who've been showing up.

292
00:13:57,553 --> 00:14:00,687
[clears throat] We don't
know what they're up to,

293
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,287
or what powers they have.

294
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,553
But there's no doubt about it.

295
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:06,287
These Bounts are very dangerous.

296
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,287
-What are you, an idiot?

297
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,487
You're telling me
that in your opinion,

298
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,320
these Bounts are
probably dangerous.

299
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,387
After fighting them,
that's all you figured out?

300
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,320
-Hey!

301
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:17,653
I don't listen to
people who don't

302
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,420
know the difference between
a window and the front door!

303
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:20,887
-Quit trying to
change the subject.

304
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,187
This isn't about me.

305
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,320
-I'm not changing
anything, you blockhead.

306
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:25,287
RENJI: Oh, yes you are.

307
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,987
You're changing--

308
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,620
-This is odd.

309
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:27,853
-Hm?

310
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:28,420
RENJI: --the subject because
you know you're wrong,

311
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:28,987
and I'm right.

312
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,353
-What's so odd?

313
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:33,220
-Normally, the ratio used would
be one Soul Reaper sent out

314
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:35,387
for every 50,000 humans.

315
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,153
But including the Substitute,
there are three of us here.

316
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:41,587
I think it's apparent we
were sent here as a response

317
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,653
to this problem.

318
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,653
And we're going to
have to deal with it.

319
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:50,220
-So, uh, you guys come up
with a plan for tomorrow?

320
00:14:50,253 --> 00:14:52,420
-I think we're going to
wing it, as you would say.

321
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:56,753
Hello, guys.

322
00:14:56,787 --> 00:14:58,020
So, what's going on today?

323
00:14:58,053 --> 00:14:59,720
-You're looking really
good today, Rukia.

324
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:01,520
-Yeah, you both look nice.

325
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:04,053
-Hello, hello, my honeys!

326
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:06,453
-Who do you think
you're calling honeys?

327
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:08,553
Huh?

328
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:09,920
[whimpering]

329
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:12,287
-As lovely as they are, the
fact is, I see them ever day.

330
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,653
Today, somehow, I'm more
interested in Rukia's

331
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,953
subtle charms.

332
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:18,353
--[laughs awkwardly] I'm not
exactly sure what you mean

333
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:20,920
by that, but I'll take
it as a compliment.

334
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,087
Thanks, Chizuru.

335
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,820
-[gasp] Hey, hey, hey.

336
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:27,553
Hold on a sec.

337
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:28,687
-Huh?

338
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,587
-What the hell did you
do to those kids, Rukia.

339
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,053
-What's the problem?

340
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:34,287
-Why are they all acting
like we just parted yesterday

341
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,253
and we're seeing each
other again today?

342
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:39,753
-That's because we did part
yesterday and meet again today.

343
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:40,853
Look at this.

344
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:42,287
This is a Kekonshinki Deluxe.

345
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,687
-[groan]

346
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,320
RUKIA: It allows me to change
or replace anyone's memories.

347
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:47,753
That's why in those
kids' memories,

348
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:50,853
now I'm just Rukia Kuchiki,
the new student who transferred

349
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:52,753
here not long ago,
and who is finally

350
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,220
starting to make
friends and really

351
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,687
get into the swing of things.

352
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,453
-Yeah, right.

353
00:15:56,487 --> 00:15:58,420
Whatever you say.

354
00:15:58,453 --> 00:16:00,653
URYU: Rukia?

355
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:01,487
Why are you here?

356
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,020
What's going on?

357
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:04,587
-Huh?

358
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,487
What's up, Uryu?

359
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,320
You got a crush on someone?

360
00:16:07,353 --> 00:16:09,720
-Uh.

361
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:10,720
No.

362
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:11,787
-Oh, yeah.

363
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,453
I forgot to tell him
that you were back.

364
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,753
ORIHIME: You guys, try these
pudding-filled rice balls

365
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:17,853
I made.

366
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:19,220
I think you're really
going to like them.

367
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:22,287
I brought enough for everyone,
so please, help yourselves!

368
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,020
-Sounds good, but
I'm still on a diet.

369
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:25,553
So I think I'll
stick with salad.

370
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:26,387
-Oh, wow.

371
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,753
This is really delicious.

372
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,520
It's kinda like those
cream-filled donuts,

373
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,353
except it's not cream
and it isn't a donut.

374
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:33,187
You should have
your own restaurant.

375
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,553
-Talking about Don Kunochi's new
show, "Karukura Superheroes"?

376
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:38,753
You've really got two
tickets to the show?

377
00:16:38,787 --> 00:16:40,453
-Yeah, but I got a date.

378
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:43,053
Do you think you could find
someone else to go with you?

379
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:43,887
-Pssh.

380
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,787
Chad will go, won't you buddy?

381
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
We'll have a blast! [laughs]

382
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:48,320
-Hm.

383
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:59,020
[sigh] It's almost like the
Soul Society never even existed.

384
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:01,453
-Oh, I wouldn't say
that if I were you!

385
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,420
It's here now.

386
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:04,220
-[together] Huh?

387
00:17:04,253 --> 00:17:05,120
-Ichigo?

388
00:17:05,153 --> 00:17:06,253
ICHIGO: I forgot something!

389
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:08,120
I'll be back!

390
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:08,653
-Huh?

391
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:09,853
What's this?

392
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,820
I can understand and Chad,
but Orihime and Rukia?

393
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,253
What's going on?

394
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:14,953
-You better stay here, Uryu!

395
00:17:14,987 --> 00:17:17,253
-[grunt]

396
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,887
-Nice to see you all.

397
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,253
Have a great day.

398
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:22,353
-No!

399
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:24,520
Why do I always get
left out of all the fun?

400
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:26,987
-I think it's probably
because they don't like you.

401
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,387
RUKIA: Everyone
likes me, Mizuiro.

402
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,853
If they didn't, I'd
be the last to know.

403
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:31,353
-Orihime.

404
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:34,853
-Which way?

405
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,687
-That way!

406
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,520
-Which one of them is it?

407
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:38,087
-Hm.

408
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,853
It's the man.

409
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:40,987
ICHIGO: Why is he here now?

410
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,820
I thought Bounts were
only active after dark.

411
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,487
-Obviously not always,
since this one is

412
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,687
is definitely here now.

413
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,487
Our detection capabilities
are very good. [laughs]

414
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,587
MAN: What is this,
some kind of joke?

415
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,687
HANATARO: It's money, sir.

416
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,053
Is it not acceptable here?

417
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:57,053
MAN: That's no money
I've ever seen.

418
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:58,887
You trying to make
a fool out of me?

419
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Get out of here--

420
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,587
-[shout]

421
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,887
MAN: --and stay out!

422
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,187
--[groan] Ugh, he's just
as bad as Squad 11.

423
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,453
Huh?

424
00:18:11,487 --> 00:18:12,753
Hey, aren't you--

425
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:15,153
-That guy-- anybody
besides me think

426
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:16,287
he looked kind of familiar?

427
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,220
-Forget him and focus!

428
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:19,253
-All right, all right.

429
00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:29,987
-[whimper]

430
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,653
-Have no fear.

431
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:35,320
Your body will feel
no pain I assure you.

432
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:37,187
ICHIGO: Hold it!

433
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,487
Let her go!

434
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,187
-You again.

435
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:47,520
ICHIGO: There's something
I want to ask you.

436
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:49,120
-What is it?

437
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:50,353
-Don't try to lie.

438
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:53,020
You are known as a
Bount, aren't you?

439
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:54,220
-Why, yes.

440
00:18:54,253 --> 00:18:56,253
ICHIGO: Where's the
girl from yesterday?

441
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:57,820
-No comment.

442
00:18:57,853 --> 00:18:59,820
ICHIGO: What did
you come here for?

443
00:18:59,853 --> 00:19:02,453
-No comment.

444
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:04,120
-So you're involved
in some scheme

445
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:06,153
that you refuse to reveal?

446
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,920
-I won't comment on that either.

447
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:10,553
Since we're
conducting interviews,

448
00:19:10,587 --> 00:19:12,187
do you mind if I
ask you a question?

449
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:19,420
The soul of a human being
or that of a Soul Reaper--

450
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:21,287
which do you suppose
tastes better?

451
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:27,253
Zeige dich, Fried!

452
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:38,253
-So your real power
is in that weird whip?

453
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:42,453
-Oh, this is just the beginning.

454
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:46,587
Ah, Fried, are you ready
to go again so soon?

455
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,453
-Oh, yes.

456
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:48,920
It was easy.

457
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:52,020
-Then go now, and show
them your power, my dear.

458
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:52,520
-Yes.

459
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:58,253
-Watch the ground!

460
00:19:58,287 --> 00:19:58,787
ICHIGO: Uryu.

461
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:05,620
-Where'd this come from?

462
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:09,020
-His direct attack on you was
just a diversion, that's all.

463
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:11,787
He pretended to be chasing
you while he laid this trap.

464
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,320
It appears that everything the
whip touches turns to snakes.

465
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:18,687
-Touching or not touching
has nothing to do with it.

466
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,087
Anything Ryo turns his thoughts
to will become a snake.

467
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,053
For example--

468
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:25,520
-[shout]

469
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:26,487
-What's this?

470
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,087
Suddenly there are
snakes everywhere,

471
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,320
and I do not like snakes.

472
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,087
Do you hear me?

473
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,187
I do not like them at all.

474
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,020
Get it off me.

475
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,020
Get it off me!

476
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:34,987
-Quit your whining, will you?

477
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,453
Let's go!

478
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:37,953
-Sure, easy for you to say.

479
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,787
-Santen Kesshun.

480
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,753
I reject.

481
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,053
-Don't you have any
special powers, friend?

482
00:21:09,787 --> 00:21:10,253
Hm.

483
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,720
I see.

484
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:16,753
This is interesting,
to say the least.

485
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:18,753
To think I would
encounter one here.

486
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,120
-Stay away from Uryu.

487
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,987
-I'm afraid that's impossible.

488
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,353
-Why's that?

489
00:21:31,387 --> 00:21:34,753
-He is easily the weakest and
most defenseless among you.

Striking at your opponent's
weakness is a given, is it not?

491
00:21:39,387 --> 00:21:42,453
Besides that, I'm
curious to find out

492
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:45,220
exactly what a Quincy's
soul tastes like.

493
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,553
-Where do you think
you can run to?

494
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:12,787
How naive.

495
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,253
Hm.

496
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:17,187
This town is surely so much
more beautiful and alive

497
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,953
when it is cloaked by the dark.

KON: Kon's "Bleach"

00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:03,517
The doll used by a Bount is like
the Zanpakuto of a Soul Reaper.

501
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:05,151
And his abilities
differ depending

502
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:06,217
on which doll is used.

503
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:08,217
ICHIGO: A doll is a
stuffed animal, right?

504
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:09,851
There are all sorts
of stuffed animals.

505
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:12,351
But none of ours are
worth much, if you ask me.

HANATARO: Golden.

510
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:28,984
My name is Hanataro Yamada.

511
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:30,184
Let's see.

512
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:32,684
The reason I'm applying
here is, uh-- what company

513
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:34,051
is this again?

514
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:35,317
Rejected!

515
00:24:35,351 --> 00:24:37,617
Well, I'm very good at
disappearing without a trace.

516
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:40,151
Uh, Hanataro is an
easy name to remember?

517
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:41,917
Oh.

518
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:45,084
Captain Unohana sent me here
to investigate this world.

519
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,817
But I can't get
anyone to hire me.

520
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:48,684
And at this rate, I'm
afraid it won't be long

521
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:50,651
before I starve to death.

522
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:55,084
-What?
