00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:51,848
NARRATOR: Patros, the
Arrancar, reveals his disdain

3
00:01:51,882 --> 00:01:55,148
for Sosuke Aizen for making
himself ruler of the Hollows,

4
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:59,115
so he stole the Hogyoku and left
Hueco Mundo with two Arrancars

5
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:01,482
that he persuaded to join him.

6
00:02:01,515 --> 00:02:03,315
In the world of the
living, they searched

7
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:05,915
for someone who knew
how to use the Hogyoku.

8
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:08,515
They sought out Kisuke
and attacked his shop,

9
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:10,882
hoping to find him.

10
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:13,915
Then, a fierce battle
broke out with Renji,

11
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:18,682
who was left in charge
of Urahara's shop.

12
00:02:18,715 --> 00:02:22,782
-Apparently you didn't
understand what I said.

13
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:24,715
So let's up the ante.

14
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:25,715
Level two!

15
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:37,182
Not bad, but it's still
just the beginning.

[footsteps]

17
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:00,515
-Shatter, Kyoka Suigetsu.

18
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:19,682
GIN: What an elaborate scheme
you cooked up, Captain Aizen.

19
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:21,582
AIZEN: Gin.

20
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:24,248
-Even if they did collaborate
and were obviously up

21
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:29,115
to no good, making them believe
that they had killed Ulquiorra,

22
00:03:29,148 --> 00:03:33,315
and letting them
take the Hogyoku.

23
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:36,482
There was no need to do this
in such a roundabout way.

24
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:37,948
You should have
just had Ulquiorra

25
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:39,282
kill them immediately.

26
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:41,415
What were you thinking?

27
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:43,148
-Don't worry about Ulquiorra.

28
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,682
I have something else
I need him to do.

29
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:48,482
-If you prefer, I would be
happy to kill them for you

30
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:50,282
if you just give the word.

31
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:53,948
-Thanks for the offer,
but that would be boring.

32
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:54,448
-Oh.

33
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:11,482
-What are you doing, Ururu?

34
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:17,282
-Jinta Home Run!

35
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:24,148
-Jinta!

36
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,148
-I'm getting very
tired of waiting.

37
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,248
When will a person who knows
about the Hodyoku return?

38
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,448
This whole thing is
beginning to bore me.

39
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:37,848
-The owner of the
shop will come back

40
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:41,315
when you're dead,
you filthy Arrancar.

41
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,015
-Renji.

42
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,515
-Moocher, good.

43
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:44,682
Are you all right?

44
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:45,615
-Ha.

45
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:47,682
Relatively speaking.

46
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:49,048
-You again.

47
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:53,348
Oh, well, I guess this time I'll
just have to finish the job.

48
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:55,648
-You two, go and get Kisuke now.

49
00:04:55,682 --> 00:04:57,415
-No, we can't!

50
00:04:57,448 --> 00:04:59,382
-I said go!

51
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,182
-If you say so.

52
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:03,082
-All right.

53
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:05,148
We better go, Jinta.

54
00:05:05,182 --> 00:05:06,515
-Damn.

55
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:08,682
Don't die, moocher, all right?

56
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:15,382
-Thank you for sending
them off to find

57
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,782
the person with the
information I need.

58
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:19,915
Now only one question remains.

59
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:22,182
Will you be alive to greet them?

60
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:24,382
Time for level three.

61
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:26,482
-Ah, shut up.

62
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:29,515
You keep going up one
little level at a time.

63
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:32,848
What's the matter, tough guy?

64
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:34,915
You act like you have all
the time in the world.

65
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,248
You're sadly mistaken.

66
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:38,648
Gentei Kaijo!

67
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:39,148

Hihio Zabimaru.

69
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:54,615
-Oh ho.

70
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:58,682
I haven't seen a
Bankai in a while.

71
00:05:58,715 --> 00:05:59,648
-Roar!

72
00:05:59,682 --> 00:06:00,148
Zabimaru!

73
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:06,948
Hi-yah!

74
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:15,815
-Not possible.

75
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,515
-OK, get up.

76
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:27,148
Unless you're already dead.

77
00:06:32,915 --> 00:06:35,948
-This is a very interesting
shop you have here.

78
00:06:35,982 --> 00:06:38,082
-I'm glad you like it.

79
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:41,015
We don't have to
hold back out here.

80
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:41,748
let's go.

81
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:52,182
-Captain.

82
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:55,215
-You're already out of breath?

83
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,648
-Shut up.

84
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:57,715
-Honestly.

85
00:06:57,748 --> 00:07:00,615
You guys defeated
five Arrancars?

86
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:01,515
Boy.

87
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:02,415
How pathetic!

88
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:05,548
-Rangiku!

89
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:10,015
-Come on, come on, come on.

90
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:10,848
What's wrong?

91
00:07:10,882 --> 00:07:13,582
Can't take it?

92
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:15,915
-Rain over the frosted
heavens, Hyorinmaru!

93
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:24,782
I can't waste anymore
time on an Arrancar

94
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:27,548
that's not even an Espada.

95
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:29,882
-Don't get too cocky
with your weak attack.

96
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:54,082
-No matter how many
times you keep trying,

97
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:56,548
you still can't defeat me!

98
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:58,215
-I wouldn't brag if I were you.

99
00:07:58,248 --> 00:08:01,248
Your only attack is hurling
yourself at your enemy.

100
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:04,448
How truly pathetic.

101
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:05,148
-Get ready.

102
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:06,882
I'm blowing you away next.

103
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:08,848
IKKAKU: Don't turn
your back on me!

104
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:09,615
Huh?

105
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:11,648
IKKAKU: I'm your opponent!

106
00:08:11,682 --> 00:08:12,682
-You can't get through.

107
00:08:19,648 --> 00:08:22,282
-And for the record,
I just got through.

108
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:28,482
-Let's try level 10.

109
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,882
[scream]

110
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:41,082
-What is this?

111
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:42,215
-Heh.

112
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:45,015
I haven't even gotten
serious with you yet.

113
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:47,348
If this is all you've
got on level 10,

114
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:50,648
you're not really as
strong as you say, are you?

115
00:08:50,682 --> 00:08:52,882
-Lowly little soul reaper.

116
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:55,982
Don't get carried
away with yourself.

117
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:57,582
You might be under
the impression

118
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:00,215
that you're a worthy
opponent, but we've

119
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,048
been wiping out Soul
Reapers like you

120
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:04,548
since long before you were born.

121
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:09,015
Despite that, we allowed
someone like him.

122
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:12,682
-Yeah?

123
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:13,748
Despite what?

124
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:14,915
Go on.

125
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:16,048
-Nothing.

126
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:18,882
It's of no concern to your kind.

127
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:21,615
-But apart from that,
you said something

128
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:24,948
earlier that I find it
difficult to ignore.

129
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,382
-What would that be?

130
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:28,815
-You called me a
lowly Soul Reaper.

131
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,848
Don't underestimate us.

132
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:34,448
We Soul Reapers
are very powerful.

133
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:35,448
-Fine, then.

134
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:36,948
Out of respect for
your fearlessness

135
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:39,848
in the face of death,
I'll reward you

136
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:44,115
by showing you my
most powerful form.

137
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,548
Defile, Gerifalte!

138
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:56,148
This is my maximum level.

139
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:04,882
-I fell asleep!

140
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:06,882
-Ririn, rather than
falling asleep,

141
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,915
I think the correct term
is losing consciousness.

142
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,682
-Shut up!

143
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:14,648
Renji.

144
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,515
Has he already been defeated?

145
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:17,648
-Now, now.

146
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:19,548
Such negative thinking
won't get us anywhere.

147
00:10:19,582 --> 00:10:21,982
-I sense spiritual pressure
coming from the basement.

148
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:22,915
Let's go.

149
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:23,882
-What?

150
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:24,948
We're going there?

151
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:26,382
-Of course we are.

152
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:45,048
-My apologies.

153
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:49,115
I simply can't control my own
strength when I'm in this form.

154
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,748
-What are you talking about?

155
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:54,048
-Meaning my next blow
will be my most powerful.

156
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:56,115
Sorry to end the fun so soon.

157
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:01,015
-Bring it on, then.

158
00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:02,582
-Here I come, Soul Reaper.

159
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:28,163
URURU: Please hurry.

160
00:11:28,196 --> 00:11:29,396
CHAD: How's Renji?

161
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:30,529
-He'll be all right.

162
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:33,196
He won't be defeated
that easily.

163
00:11:33,229 --> 00:11:35,729
-I'm more worried about
the store than the moocher.

164
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:39,363
-Ah!

165
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:57,729
-You sacrificed your own
weapon to protect yourself.

166
00:11:57,763 --> 00:11:59,029
-That's right.

167
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:00,863
It's not over yet.

168
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:02,496
-So it seems.

169
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:05,696
So it seems.

170
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:07,663
-Whoa.

171
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:08,563
-Renji.

172
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:09,963
-He can't go on much longer.

173
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,829
-I want to ask you one thing.

174
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:16,696
-What is it?

175
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:20,329
-What do you plan to
do with the Hogyoku?

176
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:22,863
-Control the whole world.

177
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,663
RENJI: You mean the Arrancars
are rebelling against Aizen?

178
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:26,596
-Ha!

179
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,763
We don't accept
him as our leader.

180
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:30,196
-Oh, really?

181
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,929
You're saying you're not
totally united under him?

182
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:34,363
-Are you kidding?

183
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:36,863
A lowly Soul Reaper
must never be

184
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,663
allowed to become the
ruler of Hueco Mundo.

185
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:49,929
What happened to you?

186
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:51,696
-Shut your mouth.

187
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,729
Forget me.

188
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:57,596
-Our pursuers will
be here any minute.

189
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:02,263
Did you find out how
to use the Hogyoku?

190
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:04,396
-Pursuers?

191
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:05,796
-You don't know yet?

192
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:07,329
-Know what?

193
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:12,496
-You've been wasting your
time on someone like this?

194
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:13,663
Impossible.

195
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:14,563
No.

196
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:17,496
It can't--

197
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,463
[scream]

198
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:22,496
-This is terrible.

199
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:29,896
Patros, I wish I never took you
up on your-- on your-- offer.

200
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,063
-You monster.

201
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:36,863
You knew you were
sacrificing them, didn't you?

202
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:37,963
-Yes.

203
00:13:37,996 --> 00:13:40,296
Sadly, it couldn't be helped.

204
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:43,763
Besides, anyone who could
be beaten by a Soul Reaper

205
00:13:43,796 --> 00:13:47,363
wouldn't have been any help
in furthering my goals.

206
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:48,363
-You're sick.

207
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:51,363
-I did it all for the Hogyoku.

208
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,096
And to defeat Aizen.

209
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:57,329
Consequently, I cannot and
will not lose to you here.

210
00:13:57,363 --> 00:14:02,196
-The same goes for me, so we'll
just have to fight it out now.

211
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:03,629
-Let's finish this.

212
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:04,563
-OK.

213
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:06,863
Let's go.

214
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:08,429
Now roar, Zabimaru!

215
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,129
RIRIN (VOICEOVER): Oh, no!

216
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:20,563
[scream]

217
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:23,263
RENJI: Damn!

218
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,029
-I should commend you.

219
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:27,796
Because of your efforts, I
have slightly more respect

220
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:29,629
for Soul Reapers.

221
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:33,429
But I think we've now
reached the end of the line.

222
00:14:33,463 --> 00:14:36,929
-It won't be that easy.

223
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:41,229
-I believe there are times
when one must accept defeat.

224
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:44,129
Any last words?

225
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:46,396
None, huh?

226
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,396
So be it.

227
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:48,896
Huh?

228
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:53,729
-Roar, Zabimaru!

229
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:55,196
-Roar, Zabimaru!

230
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,863
-Roar, Zabimaru!

231
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:58,629
-Another illusion?

232
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:05,929
-This isn't only an illusion!

233
00:15:05,963 --> 00:15:07,429
-Damn you!

234
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,396
[laughter]

235
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:11,396
-You dare to mock me?

236
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:12,363
-Renji!

237
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:14,863
Are you OK?

238
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:16,496
-You followed me again?

239
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:18,363
You guys shouldn't
be messing with him.

240
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:20,629
-Well, we can't leave
you alone, either.

241
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:21,463
-Would you go away?

242
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:21,963
-Here!

243
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:22,429
-Here!

244
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:22,904
-Here!

245
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:23,437
-Here!

246
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,437
-Here!

247
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,670
-You weaklings are in my way!

248
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,570
-Ah!

249
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:33,070
-Ah!

250
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:40,904
-Heh.

251
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,270
-You idiots.

252
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:50,604
I thought I told you
to get out of here.

253
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,037
-Don't you worry.

254
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,970
We're fine.

255
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:54,437
And guess what?

256
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,737
I think I found his weakness.

257
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:56,970
Wait and see.

258
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:58,070
-What is it?

259
00:15:58,104 --> 00:15:58,570
-Kurodo.

260
00:15:58,604 --> 00:15:59,504
Noba.

261
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:01,370
You know what to do.

262
00:16:01,404 --> 00:16:02,270
-Right.

263
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:04,070
-Got it.

264
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:05,537
-Oh, my hip!

265
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,304
-Renji, the three
of us are gonna

266
00:16:07,337 --> 00:16:09,004
go out there and distract him.

267
00:16:09,037 --> 00:16:11,937
And then you can hit him
with a really big attack.

268
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,437
-No.

269
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,570
Don't!

270
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:16,037
Even the three of you
are no match for him.

271
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,037
-Quiet.

272
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,604
You have to understand,
we're modified

273
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:21,537
souls that were originally
created for battle.

274
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,204
We can't quit just because
we're up against an opponent

275
00:16:24,237 --> 00:16:25,904
that we can't defeat.

276
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:29,337
And besides, Renji, you can't
just let it all end like this,

277
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,837
can you?

278
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,837
-Fine.

279
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,937
Do what you have to.

280
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,470
And try not to die.

281
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:34,970
-Right.

282
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:36,104
-Right.

283
00:16:36,137 --> 00:16:37,570
-What's wrong?

284
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:40,337
How long are you
going to stay hidden?

285
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,204
RIRIN: We're not really hiding.

286
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:43,170
-Huh?

287
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:47,104
-We see right
through your attacks.

288
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:48,070
-Heh.

289
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:50,037
Ha ha ha ha ha!

290
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,704
I was wondering who
was interfering,

291
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:54,837
but it was just some
small fry using illusions.

292
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,637
-Hey!

293
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,304
Who you callin' a small fry?

294
00:16:57,337 --> 00:17:00,204
At least I don't just use
the same stupid attack

295
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:02,104
over and over again
the way you do.

296
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:02,604
-What?

297
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,070
-I told you!

298
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:06,970
We can see right through
that attack of yours.

299
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:10,037
You better use something else,
if you really want to win.

300
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,170
-Ha!

301
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:13,104
If you're going to stand
there and challenge me,

302
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:16,370
I guess I have no choice
but to eliminate you.

303
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:17,837
-He fell for it.

304
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,970
Here I go!

305
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:20,470
Ha!

306
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:26,037
-So stupid.

307
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:31,237
Burst, Gerifalte!

308
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,070
-No!

309
00:17:38,104 --> 00:17:38,570
-Fools.

310
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:43,804
What?

311
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:48,404
Impossible.

312
00:17:48,437 --> 00:17:49,404
RIRIN: What do you think?

313
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:51,904
You're the only
one who can fight?

314
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,337
You're the foolish one!

315
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,204
Whenever you draw your
sword, you immediately

316
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:58,037
put it back into its sheath.

317
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,670
We knew that you storing
energy in your sheath

318
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,670
and using your sword as a
trigger to release that energy.

319
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:06,804
As as long as you're unable
to put away your sword,

320
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:10,070
then there's no way
you can attack us.

321
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:13,504
And not only that,
we also noticed

322
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:17,104
the larger your movements
were, the stronger your attacks

323
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:17,604
became.

324
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,937
Struggle all you want, but as
long as we keep your sword away

325
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,904
from your sheath, we
can avoid your attacks.

326
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:35,170
Renji!

327
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:36,170
Do it now!

328
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:38,870
-OK!

329
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:39,404
-Huh?

330
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:40,304
-Hikotsu Taiho!

331
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:52,404
-Dammit.

332
00:18:52,437 --> 00:18:54,170
It can't end like this!

333
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:03,670
-Ririn!

334
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:05,604
-Yes, you did it!

335
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:10,770
Renji-- Kisuke?

336
00:19:10,804 --> 00:19:12,070
-Well, hello there.

337
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:15,370
I'm sorry I'm late.

338
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,237
-Kisuke, what the--

339
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,037
-Hey, I just made it back here.

340
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,237
How's it goin'?

341
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,770
-Ah!

342
00:19:22,804 --> 00:19:23,237
-Kurodo.

343
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,004
Noba.

344
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,070
-Nice.

345
00:19:25,104 --> 00:19:29,004
I'm very proud of
the job you guys did.

346
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,104
-I was nothing.

347
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:32,604
We just got beat up
a little, that's all.

348
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:33,470
-Noba.

349
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:35,037
We got beat up a lot.

350
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,804
-Renji, are you all right?

351
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:38,470
-Captain Hitsugaya.

352
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:39,204
Yes.

353
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:40,104
We're fine.

354
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,437
-Oh, my.

355
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,504
It looks like you had
some trouble too, huh?

356
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:45,770
-Where's the enemy.

357
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:47,804
-It seems they're dead.

358
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:49,537
Aizen was toying with them.

359
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,170
-Aizen?

360
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:51,270
What do you mean?

361
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:52,837
-Is that the Hogyoku
they brought with them

362
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,537
from Hueco Mundo?

363
00:19:57,704 --> 00:19:59,204
-What happened?

364
00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:02,104
-Aizen probably let
them have a fake.

365
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:04,770
But I was the one who
originally made the device,

366
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,537
so you could believe
me when I tell you

367
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,537
it wouldn't break that easily.

368
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,237
I'm guessing that Aizen
probably tricked them.

369
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,070
Most likely with
his Kyoka Suigetsu.

370
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:23,037
There's no way
that could happen.

371
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,570
Aizen would never allow them
to steal the Hogyoku from him

372
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:26,670
so easily.

373
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:28,970
-But he did allow them
to take a fake one.

374
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:32,104
Why would you do that?

375
00:20:32,137 --> 00:20:33,870
-I'm not sure that
we'll ever find out.

376
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:38,804
Why have you come here?

377
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,937
To fight us?

378
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,404
-I have no intention
of fighting any of you.

379
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,137
KISUKE: Maybe Aizen was
after something else,

380
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,470
and he needed these Arrancars
to create a distraction

381
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:02,804
so that he and his cohorts
wouldn't get caught themselves.

382
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:04,804
Otherwise there wouldn't
be a need for someone

383
00:21:04,837 --> 00:21:07,504
to follow them back here
to the world of the living.

384
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:09,637
He knew that he would
have taken care of them

385
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,670
one way or another.

386
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:14,404
Purging his ranks of dissidents
in a little act like this

387
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:16,270
would prove more entertaining.

388
00:21:16,304 --> 00:21:18,537
That's just the type of
man he is, I suppose.

389
00:21:25,037 --> 00:21:26,170
-Well?

390
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:28,370
-There are traces of
that past incident.

391
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:42,104
At the time, most of it
was just simple guesswork.

392
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:44,537
But upon further
investigation, I've

393
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,570
deciphered the basis behind
her actual abilities.

394
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:50,370
-So what do you think?

395
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:53,104
-I think she possesses a
power that you can definitely

396
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:54,737
benefit from.

397
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,837
-I see.

398
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,137
So, where is she right now?

399
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,137
-I'm not sure, but
she's probably not

400
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,770
in the world of the living.

401
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:03,570
-Good work, Ulquiorra.

402
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:04,337
-My please.

403
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,954

MAN: Hiyori, how long can
Ichigo maintain Hollowfication?

He finally surpassed 10 minutes.
