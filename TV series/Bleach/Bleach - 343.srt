1
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:21,486
[Yuzu]
It's morning!
Rise and shine,
Ichigo!!

2
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:26,698
Time to get up!!

3
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:40,465
[yawn]

4
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:49,688
I'm tired...

5
00:02:45,637 --> 00:02:47,910
Hee hee hee!
Ta-da!

6
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:54,425
Oh. Today's your first
day of school, right.

7
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:59,370
Karin, pass
the soy sauce.

8
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:02,912
Here! Your soy sauce!!

9
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,791
Hey, what're you
so angry about?

10
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,529
I am not angry!

11
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:15,610
I'm just disappointed that my
stupid big brother doesn't
even notice that I'm wearing
my new school uniform!

12
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:18,918
Especially when it's my
first day at my new school!

13
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:23,563
Just for that, I'm not
leaving you the crispy tasty
scorched part of the rice!

14
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:26,536
Your skirt's unzipped.

15
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,506
Yaah!

16
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,310
Ya see? I noticed.

17
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,616
Dummy! You were born
with a dirty mind!

18
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,556
Ooo!!

19
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,025
Huh?

20
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:35,993
Yaaaagh!

21
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:37,630
You wrecked
my glasses!

22
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,835
Hm?! What's up, Karin?

23
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,308
Nothing.

24
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:43,512
[Isshin]
Yuzu!

25
00:03:44,714 --> 00:03:47,588
Help me out. How's this suit
look on your dear old daddy?!

26
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:50,997
Which matches better,
this bowtie or this necktie?
Whaddya think?

27
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,839
Hm?
They both look okay.
Doesn't matter.

28
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:55,975
It doesn't matter?!

29
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:59,617
Yuzu! Don't be like that
to your dad, C'mon!

30
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,522
Take a look and
help me decide!

31
00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:04,396
Hey, why don'tcha just
wear both? Whatever.

32
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:06,868
Just "whatever"?!
Augghh!

33
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,004
Later guys.

34
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:16,759
[Ichigo]
It's been a little over a year,
just seventeen months, since
the battle with Aizen.

35
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:19,800
Now, I'm in my last
year of high school.

36
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:25,680
From what I know, Chad and
Orihime told everyone about
my Soul Reaper powers.

37
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,559
And they said everyone believed
them pretty much right away.

38
00:04:58,193 --> 00:05:04,676
Of course, seeing stuff
like that happen right
before your eyes doesn't
leave much room for doubt.

39
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,130
I'm glad that they accepted it
without asking any questions.

40
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:14,433
Mornin', Ichigo!

41
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,572
So now,

42
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:19,912
I no longer possess any
of my Soul Reaper powers.

43
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:25,192
Around the time I lost my
powers, Karin's Spirit Energy
started growing stronger.

44
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:28,099
Bye, Ichigo!
Have a good day!

45
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:30,472
Thanks! The same to you.

46
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:35,986
Nowadays, the high-level
spirit medium abilities of
our family belong to Karin.

47
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,898
I know she's not too thrilled
about it, but she doesn't
come to me for advice.

48
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:43,571
It seems like she's working
her way through it.

49
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:46,478
[Ichigo]
Let's go, Mizuiro.

50
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:47,213
[Mizuiro]
Alright.

51
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:54,798
I-chi-go!

52
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,102
Yo.

53
00:05:56,937 --> 00:05:57,972
[choke]

54
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,615
Bye! See you guys later.

55
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:04,922
Oh yeah. I guess we'll
see you at lunch later!

56
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:08,164
Ichigo! Ichigo dude!
I'm tapping!
I'm tapping ow-out!

57
00:06:08,632 --> 00:06:09,133
Hm!?

58
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,739
Good morning!

59
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:12,508
Hey.

60
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:14,947
Ichigo, You bring
that game I lent you?

61
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:18,756
The new version's coming
out soon, so I need it
back to trade it in.

62
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:21,163
Yeah. I've got it right here.

63
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:22,966
Hm?!

64
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:29,148
What?!
You forgot it?

65
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,958
Shut up!
I said I had it!
Here you go.

66
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:40,643
[Ichigo]
Ever since I lost my Soul
Reaper powers, my Combat
Pass has also stopped.

67
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:46,792
The visual barrier is gone,
and the Hollow alarm
doesn't go off anymore.

68
00:06:47,226 --> 00:06:49,599
It's just become nothing
but a piece of wood.

69
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:54,142
I even forgot that I'd
left it in my school bag.

70
00:06:54,711 --> 00:07:00,024
Still, this carved piece of
wood is the only evidence I have
left of my Soul Reaper past.

71
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:04,701
[teacher] [distant]
Ishida! Where do you
think you're going?!

72
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:06,273
[Ishida]
To the nurse's
office, sir!

73
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:14,593
[Ichigo]
Now it's Uryu who's taken over
exterminating the Hollows
that I used to handle.

74
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:19,738
We were hoping he could
just let Imoyama do it,

75
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,882
but it's turned out that
Imoyama's a lot less
capable than we expected.

76
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:29,362
I hope Uryu doesn't
overdo things and upset
the Soul Society.

77
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,939
Speaking of the Soul Society,

78
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:40,121
Ever since our last goodbye,
Rukia hasn't come to visit
Karakura Town even once.

79
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:51,916
[Keigo]
So, have you thought about
your plans for the future?

80
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,685
Hnh?

81
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:55,225
You mean like,
after high school?

82
00:07:55,993 --> 00:07:59,135
Duh!
Sure that's what I mean!
What else is there?

83
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:02,275
Hm. We still
have some time.

84
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,422
Well y'know after this
semester, we'll start
getting career counseling...

85
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:12,199
So pretty soon you'll
hafta start thinking
about that stuff.

86
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,407
You had good grades to
start with, but then
you bottomed out.

87
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:16,977
Stop reminding me.

88
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:20,019
I had a lot of stuff
going on last year,
it couldn't be helped.

89
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:23,226
And besides, I'm
still above average.

90
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,470
What about Rukia?

91
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:28,339
Hnh?

92
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:30,176
Wonder how she's
doing these days.

93
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:33,853
Wait, what's Rukia got
to do with anything?

94
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:38,865
I was just thinkin'.
She could at least
drop by once in awhile,
to say hi to us.

95
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:43,175
Since she left, she hasn't
dropped by even once to say
"Hello!" That's pretty cold.

96
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:48,421
She's not being cold.
She got relieved of her
Karakura Town duties.

97
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:51,762
Her not coming back
here is normal.

98
00:08:54,235 --> 00:08:55,237
Don't you miss her?

99
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:58,780
Of course I don't miss her.

100
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,759
After sixteen years,
I finally get to live my
life as a normal human.

101
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:06,432
I hope it stays this
peaceful until I die.

102
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:10,776
Hm. You've got a
good point there.

103
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:14,318
I don't wanna go through
really scary stuff like
that ever again, either.

104
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:19,296
It's true.

105
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:23,573
Being able to see ghosts
never once made me feel
superior to others.

106
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:30,457
I never thought of making
a living from it, or using
my unique gift to help
people I didn't know.

107
00:09:31,994 --> 00:09:35,569
All I ever really wanted
was a normal life
without seeing ghosts.

108
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:38,911
Well, I finally got the
life I wanted, didn't I?

109
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:51,976
[Kugo]
Hey! Come back here!!

110
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:52,878
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

111
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:54,849
Hey!

112
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:57,189
Drop it, jerk!!
Give me back my bag!!

113
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,261
Hold this.

114
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:00,430
Sure.

115
00:10:00,463 --> 00:10:01,198
[Ichigo]
Come to think of it,

116
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,335
I'll be back.

117
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:05,041
Stop!!

118
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:12,526
Besides my Combat Pass,
there's one more thing that
I still possess, that proves
I was once a Soul Reaper.

119
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:31,071
The physical training I had
and the reflexes I developed
in order to survive, do come
in handy sometimes.

120
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:34,947
Whoa!! Man, that was pretty
incredible there, kid!

121
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,189
Thanks pal!
So hey, are
you hungry?

122
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:41,329
C'mon, I'll buy you some ramen!
That sound good?

123
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:42,265
No thanks.

124
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:46,075
I'd rather not get in
any trouble for this.

125
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,516
So do me a favor,
Don't tell anyone
what I did.

126
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:54,095
Oh? Sure. You got it.
Well, thanks again.

127
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,001
Let's go. We don't
wanna be late.

128
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:04,419
Hm. How 'bout that.

129
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:07,360
You're more cautious
than I thought,

130
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:16,616
Ichigo Kurosaki.

131
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,302
[Rejni]
How long you planning
to sleep Ichigo?!
Do I have to slug you?!

132
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,380
[Byakuya]
Come on, Ichigo Kurosaki.
wake up.

133
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:46,422
[Rukia]
Ichigo, you fool!
Get up!!

134
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:48,995
[Isshin]
Get up!!

135
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,537
Goood morniiing, Ichigooo!

136
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,709
[Isshin]
Huwaaagh!

137
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:58,251
Ah-You idiot!!
You really are
an idiot!

138
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,756
I could've fallen all the
way and hit the street!!

139
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,261
You could've killed me!

140
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:03,363
Whatever.

141
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,604
If you die, you'll go to
the Soul Society, right?

142
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:07,807
Uh!?

143
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,616
Ohh. Now you're
big-timing me, huh?

144
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:15,593
Look, you're not going
to die falling from the
second floor, okay?

145
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:16,595
Uh!?

146
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:18,433
You woke me up from a
really interesting dream.

147
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:20,705
So to make it up to me
you should go ahead and fall!

148
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:24,314
Whoa!! Stop that!
You'll make me fall for
real!! C'mon quit it!

149
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:28,390
Huh?!
You had a weird dream?
What was it about?

150
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:29,360
Mh!

151
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:36,310

I can't remember.
Trying to tell you
made me forget.

So? How much then?

Uh, how 'bout five thousand yen?

Five thousand yen per week?!

Sir!

157
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:57,395
I am Satoda, co-captain of
the school's soccer team!
We'd like to offer you--

158
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,433
Just tell me how
much and how long.

159
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,137
Well, we members of the
soccer team have prepared
a budget of two times...

Huh?

161
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,517
He's talking some business.
So he'll probably be awhile.

162
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,321
Okay, gotcha.

163
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,562
So he's all done
renting himself out to
the basketball team?

164
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:16,542
This really sucks!
Ichigo's not gonna have
time to hang out with us.

165
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:20,617
Funny. You make it sound
like he actually ever wanted
to hang out with you.

166

Whaaat?! Hey, what's
your problem, man?!

do than to make a total
nuisance of myself!

bugging Ichigo while
he's working at his part

It's true, so true,
I swear it is!
Whatever...

170
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,514
So what position?

171
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,551
We'd like you to play
as our goalkeeper!

172
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:36,523
Chad would make a
better goalkeeper.

173
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:41,235
We talked to Mister Sado,
but he turned us down.
He said he'd found a
better paying job.

[Ichigo]
So then, I'm your
second choice?

175
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:45,946
So how come I don't
recall Ichigo being this
obsessed about money?

176
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,452
He might be saving up
for after graduation.

177
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:50,457
Y'know, so he can
go live on his own.

178
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:53,532
What?!! You mean...
he's moving out?!

179

Heh... well, I'm not
sure about that.

180
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,445
But if you ask me,

181
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:04,190
Ichigo's dad doesn't seem like
the type who'd loan Ichigo
money for anything at all.

182
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,735
I'd say it's probably a
good idea for him to save
as much as he can now.

183
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:12,344
Ah, you just might be
right about that.

00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,405
Can't you see you're
making everyone nervous
for no good reason?

300
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,018
Actually, for Kurosaki's
friends, you guys seem
pretty clever.

301
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:46,258
You understand what I'm
saying, don't'cha boys?

302
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,830
Now hurry along
and go home.

303
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:50,969
Huh?! What's that?!

304
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,974
Are you Kurosaki?!

305
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:57,251
What'd you say?!

306
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:58,721
Augh!

307
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:03,266
Hey! What the
hell was that?!

308
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:05,371
You asking for
trouble, ya punk?!

309
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,877
That's exactly what I
was going to ask you.

310
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:11,886
So you did get a good
look at the guy, right?

311
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:14,928
What part of me
says "Kurosaki"?!

312
00:21:47,085 --> 00:21:48,321
Did you
find him?

313
00:21:49,993 --> 00:21:50,493
Yeah.

314
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:04,929
The next Substitute
Soul Reaper.

315
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:08,170
Seems like an
interesting fellow.

316
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,147
[Orihime]
Tatsuki!

317
00:23:48,181 --> 00:23:50,252
[Tatsuki]
Orihime! People will see your
panties if you run too fast!

318
00:23:50,286 --> 00:23:51,823
[Orihime]
Say, does this look
okay for my lunch?

319
00:23:51,823 --> 00:23:53,242
[Tatsuki]
No! You can't just eat
sweets for lunch!

320
00:23:53,242 --> 00:23:55,878
[Orihime]
There's this two-hour
comedy TV special today
that I want to see.

321
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:59,081
[Tatsuki]
No! It's bad for your eyes,
so you can only watch TV
for one hour a day!

322
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:00,282
[Ichigo]
What are you, her mom?
