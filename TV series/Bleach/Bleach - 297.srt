1
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:15,166
Hyaaahh!

2
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:23,566
I may have actually
reached my limit.
My limit as a Soul
Reaper, that is.

3
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,529
When I said 'since the
beginning,' I meant I've known
about you since you were born.

4
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:16,296
What?!

5
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,729
The moment you were born,
I knew you were a special case.

6
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:25,663
The reason is, because
you're a human, and--

7
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:32,263
Tch.

8
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:36,963
You talk too much, Aizen.

9
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:52,763
Dad, Is that... you?

10
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:01,163
Hey, Say something!

11
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:04,396
Dad?

12
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,563
What the heo~llll!!

13
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:21,463
Hmph.

14
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:29,663
Keeping his distance.
A wise decision.

15
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,763
Must be in their blood.

16
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:40,263
You've been watching
for quite a long time.

17
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,596
<i>Haven't you, Gin?</i>

18
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:50,463
You shouldn't assume I've
just been watching. I just
didn't think you needed my
assistance with him yet.

19
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:53,896
I see.

20
00:03:57,563 --> 00:03:59,163
Eeeyaah!

21
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:37,163
It's been a while
since I fought you,
hasn't it?

22
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:44,429
This time, I won't
be holding back.

23
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:02,196
Hyaaargh!

24
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:09,263
Heyaah!

25
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:18,896
Raikoho!

26
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:24,363
It's been a while,
my young friend,

27
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:28,363
since I've crossed
swords with you.

28
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:36,296
Do you remember the
last time we fought?
It seems like it was
only yesterday.

29
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:42,396
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>Ahh. Not good.</i>

30
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:57,329
Unh!

31
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:03,363
Aughh!

32
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:15,329
Unacceptable.

33
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:21,363
Being the "guardian" of the
gate doesn't mean you're
supposed to open the gate.

34
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:25,063
A gate-keeper who loses isn't
supposed to open the gate.

35
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:27,396
When a gatekeeper
loses,

36
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:30,196
It means... Death!

37
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,896
<i>When I cut off Jidanbo's arm,</i>
<i>you got very upset.</i>

38
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:42,896
<i>Without any hesitation,</i>
<i>you rushed in and attacked me.</i>

39
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:46,163
You wanna tell me just what the
hell you think you're doing?!

40
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:56,863
Impale him! Shinso!

41
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:13,796
I remember thinking,
that as an opponent,
you were extremely
interesting.

42
00:07:16,063 --> 00:07:17,963
Sorry, pal, but I
don't remember.

43
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,196
Huh?

44
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:23,663
Nice try, but you're a liar.

45
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:25,929
Hold on, was that
supposed to be an insult?

46
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:27,863
Take it however you want.

47
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:30,729
And I'm not saying I've
forgotten crossing
swords with you.

48
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:33,396
I just have no concept of
what was in your heart.

49
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:37,429
<i>Whenever I face someone in</i>
<i>battle, I have some idea of</i>
<i>what they're thinking.</i>

50
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:40,929
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not able to
read their minds.

51
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:44,696
But during the battles,
I can usually tell why
they're really fighting,

52
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:48,463
what they want out of me,
and if they think they're
stronger than I am.

53
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:53,096
<i>But after so many battles now,</i>
<i>I've come to realize</i>

54
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:58,263
<i>that the stronger my opponent</i>
<i>is, the easier it is for me</i>
<i>to understand their heart.</i>

55
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:02,996
Well, my friend, you're quite
the poet, aren't you?

56
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,596
Don't change the subject.

57
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,429
With you, it's an entirely
different matter.

58
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:12,563
Despite how much I
try to read you,
almost nothing comes through.

59
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:15,996
Even in the midst of the fight,
You weren't completely engaged.

60
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,796
I don't know what you were
thinking about, but it wasn't
the battle with me.

61
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:25,996
Know something? At first,
I thought you were an
interesting kid.

62
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:29,529
But the fact is,
you're actually
kind of creepy.

63
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,696
I don't think you should be
calling anybody creepy.

64
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:38,863
Fascinating, you
throw everything back
at your opponent.

65
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:41,429
I see why
Captain Aizen is
interested in you.

66
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,863
My Zanpakuto Shinso,
Do you know how far my
blade can extend?

67
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:49,363
I have no idea.

68
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,296
The length of a hundred
swords, actually.

69
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:55,063
When I was just a young boy,
people were very impressed.

70
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:57,429
They said I carried around
a hundred-bladed weapon.

71
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:59,296
I'm not interested
in your tricks.

72
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:03,496
Really? Do you have any
idea how far this blade
can extend in Bankai?

73
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:06,229
Can't say I do, but I didn't
come here for a quiz.

74
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:11,263
You mean you're not even going
to venture a guess? That's
really a shame. How boring.

75
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:16,396
Well, I'm going to tell you
anyway, and I'll explain it in
measurements you can understand.

76
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:19,663
It can extend to
thirteen kilometers.

77
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:23,029
That must be hard
for you to imagine.

78
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,896
It seems impossible, right?

79
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:29,963
<i>Tell you what.</i>
<i>I'll demonstrate it for you.</i>
<i>All thirteen kilometers of it.</i>

80
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:34,496
Bankai...

81
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:37,496
Kamishininoyari!

82
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:12,263
Why do you look
so surprised?

83
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,229
Don't you think one Bankai,

84
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:18,363
is capable of
stopping another?

85
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:19,996
HaaaaAAA!

86
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:33,463
You know, the more time I spend
with you, the creepier you get.

87
00:10:41,963 --> 00:10:44,729
Unh... Uh?

88
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:00,696
<i>Gin...!</i>

89
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:06,229
That was pretty scary.

90
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:12,696
But it was also enlightening.
I'd better deal with you
while I'm still able.

91
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:16,129
Otherwise, things may
get troublesome.

92
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:17,063
[gasp]

93
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:22,229
When did his blade suddenly
shrink back down?! Did I get
distracted somehow, and miss it?

94
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:27,163
<i>No! I never took my attention</i>
<i>away from his sword.</i>

95
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:30,363
<i>There's no way I wouldn't have</i>
<i>seen that huge blade contract!</i>

96
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:32,063
[gasp]

97
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:36,929
Now then, what should I
do to finish you off,
once and for all?

98
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,196
You easily stopped my Bankai.

99
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:42,629
Guess I have no choice but
to engage you, one on one.

100
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,129
I must say, that's
an impressive sword
you have there.

101
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:59,129
I feel like mine could
break at any moment.

102
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:02,029
Well, I'm all for that!
In fact, here, let me
help you!

103
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:06,363
If my hunch is correct, he only
shrunk that sword to make it
easier to handle.

104
00:12:06,396 --> 00:12:08,229
<i>He hasn't ended his Bankai.</i>

105
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:17,463
I have to watch his every
move! He's fast. And if he
points the tip of his sword
at me, I could be dead!

106
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:40,696
<i>He's vulnerable up close!</i>

107
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:49,096
So, just as I thought.

108
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:50,063
Huh?

109
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:01,796
The most frightening thing
about your Bankai is not its
length, and it's not its
destructive force, either.

110
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:05,029
It's the speed you're
able to contract.

111
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:07,796
I was thinking about
what you said,

112
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:10,963
Telling me the length of your
blade served no purpose.

113
00:13:10,996 --> 00:13:14,529
In fact, not telling me
about it would have been
to your advantage.

114
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:20,196
Similarly, swinging your
sword and slicing up the
town served no purpose.

115
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:24,429
<i>Attacking me head-on</i>
<i>would have made much more</i>
<i>sense, strategy-wise.</i>

116
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:32,529
I think you showed me those
things to distract me. Keep me
from noticing how fast your
contraction speed really was.

117
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:34,896
Am I wrong?

118
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:38,096
Not bad.

119
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:44,563
<i>He figured out my strategy</i>
<i>from my first attack, and was</i>
<i>able to apply that knowledge</i>
<i>to dodge my second attack.</i>

120
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:49,196
<i>That's frightening.</i>
<i>And the chances are,</i>
<i>he'll improve as the</i>
<i>battle goes on.</i>

121
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:55,363
<i>But he's still got</i>
<i>a long way to go.</i>

122
00:13:56,263 --> 00:13:59,396
Well, since you figured it
out, I guess I have no choice.

123
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:02,963
I'll tell you how fast
Kamishininoyari can
extend itself.

124
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:04,296
[claps]

125
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:06,129
Mm?

126
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:08,496
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

127
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:10,329
It's five hundred
times that speed.

128
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:11,363
[gasp]

129
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:16,563
The truth of the matter is,
Kamishininoyari isn't the
longest Zanpakuto.

130
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:19,163
But it is the
fastest Zanpukuto.

131
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:22,829
Now that you know that,
you realize you have no
chance of winning.

132
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:30,563
HYAAAAH!

133
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,063
What's wrong, Aizen?

134
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:50,663
Is it my imagination, or
are you getting slower?
Perhaps you've reached
your limit.

135
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:54,396
Well now that I think about it,
you may be right about my speed.

136
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,796
I may have actually
reached my limit.

137
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,496
My limit as a Soul
Reaper, that is.

138
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,063
What are you saying?

139
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:04,963
That my soul is about
to be re-structured.

140
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:09,329
Not so fast.
What makes you think
that's happening?

141
00:15:10,596 --> 00:15:15,929
The Hogyoku is finally
responding. It's beginning
to understand my thoughts.

142
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,637
<i>I have to concentrate!</i>
<i>Come on...</i>

143
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,170
Ignore the attacks where
he's swinging his sword,
and pay attention when
he makes a thrust!

144
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:43,404
Don't let him point
that blade at you!

145
00:15:49,704 --> 00:15:51,170
You're not getting away.

146
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:01,237
[chuckles]

147
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,470
You're awfully jumpy.
What's the problem?

148
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,804
Gah!

149
00:16:04,837 --> 00:16:07,737
You bastard!
I swear I'm gonna
break that sword
of yours!

150
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:10,770
You're welcome to try,
of course, but don't
get your hopes up.

151
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:25,170
I may have actually
reached my limit.

152
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:28,570
My limit as a Soul
Reaper, that is.

153
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:31,870
What makes you think
that's happening?

154
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,737
The Hogyoku is
finally responding.

155
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,937
I can feel that it's beginning
to understand my thoughts.

156
00:16:38,437 --> 00:16:39,670
That's nonsense!

157
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,904
You can dismiss
it if you like.

158
00:16:42,437 --> 00:16:45,837
<i>But I'm telling you, the</i>
<i>Hogyoku has a will of its own.</i>

159
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,304
Yeah right It's a mass
of energy, not a being.

160
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,604
I understand your
skepticism.

161
00:16:52,237 --> 00:16:55,570
Even I had no idea the
Hogyoku had its own will.

162
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:58,837
until I became its master,
that is, and was able to
feel it.

163
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:03,404
Tell me what you think the
Hogyoku's ultimate power is?

164
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,704
You may believe it is
the power to dominate
two opposing forces,

165
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,537
the balance between
Hollows and Soul Reapers.

166
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,537
You'd be wrong.

167
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:17,604
The Hogyoku's true power,

168
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,837
is the ability to manifest
the desires of those around it.

169
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,837
I'm surprised you
haven't seen that.

170
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:25,704
What are you talking about?

171
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:27,770
I guess I have to spell it out
for you.

172
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:33,870
All the amazing things
that happened to Ichigo
Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki,
and Kisuke Urahara,

173
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:39,470
were simply the result of
manipulation by the Hogyoku.
They were all manifested by
the Hogyoku's will.

174
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,504
What the hell do you mean?

175
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:46,404
<i>Kisuke Urahara</i>
<i>mistakenly believed that</i>
<i>the Hogyoku's power</i>

176
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:50,070
<i>was the ability to control the</i>
<i>boundary between Hollows and</i>
<i>Soul Reapers.</i>

177
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:53,937
<i>As its creator, this is what</i>
<i>he desired its powers to be.</i>

178
00:17:56,537 --> 00:18:03,537
Rukia Kuchiki, in her desire to
bring Ichigo Kurosaki into the
fold, passed along all of her
Spirit Energy to him.

179
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:09,504
<i>She lost her Soul Reaper</i>
<i>powers because she was still</i>
<i>suffering from the pain of</i>
<i>killing Kaien Shiba.</i>

180
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:18,870
Yasutora Sado and Orihime Inoue
developed special powers
because, deep in their hearts,

181
00:18:18,904 --> 00:18:24,637
<i>they hated the fact that they</i>
<i>remained helpless, while their</i>
<i>friends were manifesting such</i>
<i>incredible abilities.</i>

182
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,104
I've known about the Hogyoku's
true power for some time now.

183
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:34,004
[gasp]

184
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,070
I suppose it's incorrect to say
that I know everything about it.

185
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:44,170
To be accurate, I know that its
power was not the ability to
control the boundary between
Hollows and Soul Reapers,

186
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:46,437
as Kisuke Urahara
felt it was.

187
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:48,604
He misinterpreted.

188
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:52,937
<i>If that was really its</i>
<i>power, the results would</i>
<i>have been different.</i>

189
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:58,070
<i>Shinji Hirako and the other</i>
<i>Visoreds would never have</i>
<i>become complete Visoreds.</i>

190
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:05,070
The Hollowfication of
Shinji Hirako and the other
Visoreds was really nothing
more than an experiment.

191
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:08,837
<i>It was a confirmation of</i>
<i>the Hogyoku's powers.</i>

192
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:14,237
And in the end, it turned
out to be quite successful.

193
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:21,437
The activation of the Hogyoku's
power eventually turned Shinji
Hirako and the other Visoreds
into complete Visoreds.

194
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,470
<i>They wouldn't be what</i>
<i>they are today, without</i>
<i>that manipulation.</i>

195
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,537
And armed with my suspicions
about the Hogyoku's power,

196
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,870
<i>I had Rukia Kuchiki</i>
<i>approach Ichigo Kurosaki</i>
<i>with the idea that he could</i>
<i>become a Soul Reaper.</i>

197
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:41,304
If there were limits to the
Hogyoku's power, this would
help identify them.

198
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:46,737
It turns out the Hogyoku has
the power to manifest the
desires of those around it.

199
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:52,104
<i>But if the target does not</i>
<i>have the power to achieve</i>
<i>those desires, nothing</i>
<i>significant happens.</i>

200
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:55,504
It's a very interesting dynamic,
filled with subtleties.

201
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:59,137
<i>It can help guide you to</i>
<i>your goals, but can't</i>
<i>achieve them for you.</i>

202
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:04,470
Most creatures aren't
strong enough to take
advantage of this gift.

203
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:10,237
They're able to achieve their
petty wishes, but don't have the
vision or force of will to go
after their larger desires.

204
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:12,004
Aizen, you bastard!

205
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:39,304
That was a very nice move there.
Fascinating just how effective
sheer luck can be.

206
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:42,070
You're stupid to
think that was luck!

207
00:20:42,604 --> 00:20:44,270
I--Ichigo?

208
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,537
What is it?!
Leave me alone!

209
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,170
I'm just getting warmed up!
I'll defeat him soon!
I don't want you to interfere!

210
00:20:55,937 --> 00:21:01,070
Sorry about all this,
Captain Aizen. I hope
I didn't interrupt
your conversation.

211
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:02,970
It's all right.

212
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:09,704
I had pretty much finished
explaining myself.

213
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,070
Hey, what the
hell is that Dad?!
What's going on?!

214
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,304
Why are you
asking me?!

215
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:22,137
I had no idea what was going
on when you came flying in,
and as of this moment, I
still have no idea!

216
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:24,070
Hey, what kind of
answer is that?!

217
00:21:24,104 --> 00:21:26,837
You're the one who's
been fighting the guy!
Didn't you pay attention?!

218
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,804
That's not my job,
smart-ass!

219
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:32,404
If you want to know
what's going on, why
don't you get him to
explain it to you!

220
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:37,104
It doesn't matter if you
understand what it is.
You can't escape its influence.

221
00:21:39,404 --> 00:21:42,637
You're feeling it now, even as
you try to resist its will.

222
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,970
It has the power to destroy
the wall that separates
those beings who are gods,

223
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:48,904
from those who are not!

224
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,004
[gasp]

225
00:22:02,837 --> 00:22:03,904
So you've come.

226
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,270
<i>Kisuke Urahara.</i>

227
00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:48,644
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>You and your father</i>
<i>are very much alike.</i>

228
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,711
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Are you nuts? No way!</i>

229
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:55,977
<i>[Isshin]</i>
<i>I absolutely agree!</i>
<i>My son is nowhere near</i>
<i>as good a warrior as I am!</i>

230
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:57,811
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>See? That's what</i>
<i>I'm talking about!</i>

231
00:23:57,844 --> 00:23:59,144
<i>[Ichigo & Isshin]</i>
<i>Yeah, right!</i>

232
00:23:59,177 --> 00:24:00,577
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>[exasperated sigh]</i>
