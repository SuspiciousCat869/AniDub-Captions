00:01:49,588 --> 00:01:51,522
RANGIKU (VOICEVER):
Unbelievable.

3
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,755
YUMICHIKA (VOICEOVER): The
Zaraki Squad prides itself

4
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:54,988
on its lackadaisical standards.

5
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:57,288
RANGIKU (VOICEOVER): He just
said that and walked away.

6
00:01:57,322 --> 00:02:01,088
I expect that from him, but why
did Shuhei and Izuru run off

7
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,422
as quickly as they arrived?

8
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,822
Since my captain is
the one who ordered

9
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:07,488
them to come to the
World of the Living,

10
00:02:07,522 --> 00:02:09,655
shouldn't I be the one in
charge while they're here?

11
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:13,922
The captain's gonna hear
about this when I get back!

12
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:14,488
Huh?

13
00:02:14,522 --> 00:02:15,888
Wait a minute.

14
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:16,888
Isn't that--?

15
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:33,688
SAWATARI: It's nice to be
young, don't you agree?

16
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:38,155
It's been so long, I'd almost
forgotten how good it feels.

17
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:41,088
-Tell me why you've been
taking souls of the living.

18
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:42,955
SAWATARI: Why not?

19
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:45,055
-Stop attacking the living!

20
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,555
-Why should I?

21
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:49,288
I still want more power.

22
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:51,322
-What are you going
to do with that power?

23
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,422
-What, indeed?

24
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:55,555
That is an excellent question.

25
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:56,755
Too bad you'll never know.

26
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:04,055
-Whoa!

27
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:07,388
Haven't seen you in ages,
Chad, what have you been up to?

28
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:10,388
-Uh, why are you here?

29
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:11,888
-Well, actually,
it's just dumb luck

30
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:13,322
that I ran into you like this.

31
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:14,822
Sounds like things
have been getting

32
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:16,888
a little crazy in the
World of the Living lately.

33
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:19,555
Out of the blue, my captain
just says to me, Rangiku,

34
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:21,488
I want you to go to the
World of the Living.

35
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:22,688
And here I am!

36
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:24,622
-You may not know this,
but we lieutenants

37
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:27,488
aren't allowed to come to the
world of living very often.

38
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:29,255
It's been so long
that I'm completely

39
00:03:29,288 --> 00:03:31,522
out of touch with
what's going on.

40
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:34,755
Still, I think everything
is so fascinating here.

41
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:37,622
Everywhere you look, there's
always so much to see.

42
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:38,122
-Yeah.

43
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:38,788
Right.

44
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:39,655
Uh, listen, Rangiku.

45
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:40,655
-What is it?

46
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,022
Oh, are those two
friends of yours.

47
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,655
That's interesting, It
looks like they can see me.

48
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:46,488
-I'm Ururu.

Pleased to meet you.

-Oh, really?

-So that there's
no doubt, perhaps

68
00:04:21,222 --> 00:04:23,055
I should show you
a little proof.

69

That way, you can be certain.

00:05:57,955 --> 00:06:00,588
Thank for helping out.

98
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:01,288
Hm?

99
00:06:01,322 --> 00:06:02,788
Hey, what's the deal?

100

I said thank you, not zip it.

What the heck's wrong
with you, anyway?

BAURA: You called me
out on a nice night.

It feels good.

108
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:34,955
-It just talked.

independent minds.

That's interesting.

112
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:42,355
-Baura has a special
ability which

113
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:44,688
allows him to manipulate
space by creating

114
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:47,988
an alternate dimension, in
which he can swim about freely

115
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:51,388
unrestricted by objects
in this dimension.

116
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:53,755
It would appear that your
masked friend over there

117
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,688
possesses a similar ability.

118
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:58,755
[laughs] But
compared to my Baura,

119
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:01,455
his powers are insignificant.

120
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,855
-Are you sure about that?

121
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:06,588
-You're awfully arrogant
for one so young.

122
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:08,455
Perhaps we ought to
show him just how

123
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:11,122
different our powers really are.

124
00:07:11,155 --> 00:07:12,188
Baura!

125
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:13,855
-Do what you want,
but we're the ones who

126
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:16,655
are going to show you
a difference in power.

128
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:23,722
-Baura.

129
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:26,188
BAURA: OK, boss.

130
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:27,655
-[gasp] Return!

131
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:34,522
-You backed off.

132
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,755
Why?

133
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,888
SAWATARI: That Soul Reaper's
judgment was correct.

134
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:38,388
-Huh?

135
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:44,388
-If she had not commanded
that ash to return,

136
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,122
it would have been
developed by Baura,

137
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:47,855
and she would have
lost her Zanpakuto.

138
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:50,355
-What do you mean by that?

139
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,122
NOBA: The doll's mouth
is also connected

140
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,155
to an alternate dimension.

141
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:56,455
-Here I thought I might
finally get my hands

142
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:58,555
on a real Soul
Reaper's Zanpakuto.

143
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:00,455
But you had to go
and ruin my plan!

[phone ringing]

145
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:06,755
MAN (ON PHONE):
Yes, Ms. Rangiku.

146
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:08,222
What can I do for you?

147
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,222
-Lock onto my
location and freeze

148
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,788
everything in a
500 meter radius.

149
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,855
And give me soul protection.

150
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:16,855
MAN (ON PHONE): Understood.

151
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:18,955
-You better do the same
for Shuhei and Izuru

152
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:20,055
just to be safe.

MAN (ON PHONE): Yes, ma'am.

154
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:23,722
We've just received a report
that Lieutenant Abarai

155
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:25,322
charged into battle
without protection

156
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:27,022
and was injured while
protecting a human.

157

We don't know the
extent of his injuries.

RANGIKU (VOICEOVER): Renji.

159
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:34,155
-Is something wrong?

00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:36,722
-We're not the only ones
having a difficult time.

SAWATARI: [laughs evilly]

162
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:42,788
-I just contacted
the Soul Society

163
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,522
and asked them to use their
power to protect this area.

00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:48,422
There's no need to
hold back anymore.

00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:49,922
-I see.

166
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:52,888
All right.

167
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:54,888
[grunt]

168
00:08:58,388 --> 00:08:59,555
-Hado Four, Byakurai!

169
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:06,722
NOBA: Your attacks
won't harm him

170
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,922
when he's in an
alternate dimension.

171
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:13,888
-[grunting]

172
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:15,855
He's heading right for you!

00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:38,655
-Persistent.

-[groan]

177
00:09:41,655 --> 00:09:43,888
-For a little girl,
she's not bad.

178
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,388
NOBA: Over here.

179
00:09:59,922 --> 00:10:02,655
-It just swallowed our attacks.

180
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:05,155
-A frontal attack is useless.

181
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,888
-So how are we
supposed to stop it?

182
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,522
Noba, the first
time it attacked,

183
00:10:14,555 --> 00:10:16,322
you were able to
sense it beforehand.

184
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:18,355
How did you do that?

185
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:20,422
-As he surfaces from
the other dimension,

186
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:24,488
he creates ripples
in this dimension.

187
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:27,355
-Then can you use that
to predict his movements?

188
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:30,522
-I only sense him an
instant before he arrives.

189
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:33,422
-Then it looks like our only
option is to dodge his attack.

190
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:35,122
-Hm.

191
00:10:35,155 --> 00:10:36,588
If he's in a
different dimension,

192
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:39,722
then how's he able to
sense where we are?

193
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:43,288
NOBA: I think he's probably
using something like sonar.

194
00:10:43,322 --> 00:10:44,222
-Sonar?

195
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:45,855
NOBA: I've been
sensing subtle waves

196
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:48,122
of spiritual pressure
coming from the ground.

197
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:50,522
RANGIKU: What about tracing
that to find out where he is?

198
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:53,122
Is that possible?

199
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:54,288
NOBA: It's too weak.

200
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:57,722
-[sigh] Isn't there
anything we can do?

201
00:10:57,755 --> 00:11:00,388
-He attacked us by swimming
through the ground before.

202
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:03,455
Now that we're up high,
we seem to be safe.

203
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:06,155
We should use this time
to come up with a plan.

204
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:07,622
-Right.

205
00:11:07,655 --> 00:11:10,088
[gasp]

206
00:11:10,122 --> 00:11:11,088
-Hm?

207
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:12,055
[gasping]

208
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,555
[roar]

209
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:27,355
-Ururu!

210
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:31,788
Ururu!

211
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,117
-I'm glad your safe.

212
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,517
That's all that matters.

213
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:51,484
-Ururu!

214
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:01,384
[grunt]

215
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:04,384
NOBA: Chad.

216
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:06,284
-This way!

217
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:07,950
Do you see him?

218
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:09,217
CHAD: He's not behind us.

219
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,050
RANGIKU: What's
the deal with him?

220
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:17,284
It doesn't seem to matter
if it's high or low, as long

221
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:19,150
as there's a large
surface to enter through.

222
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:20,317
SAWATARI: You're catching on.

223
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:20,817
-What?

224
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,317
-[gasp]

225
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,784
-[gasp]

226
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,417
SAWATARI: That's one down.

227
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:40,284
Your little friend
is perfectly safe.

228
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:43,117
Baura's belly is connected
to an alternate dimension.

229
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,817
I can leave her there, out of
harm's way, for the time being.

230
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,217
However, she won't be
able to survive there

231
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,650
for a long period of time.

232
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:57,450
-What will you do with her?

233
00:12:57,484 --> 00:13:00,017
SAWATARI: Bounts usually
absorb only souls.

234
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,650
But Baura and I have
a unique ability.

235
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:05,150
We are able to
engulf a human body.

236
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,850
Then we dissolve it and
absorb not only the soul,

237
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:11,617
but the entire body as well.

238
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,617
-Damn.

239
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,417
Return Ururu to us
now, you bastard.

240
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:20,117
-[laughs] You'll all be
joining her soon enough.

241
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,017
I intend to swallow you up
one by one into Baura's belly!

242
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:29,117
Baura, take them!

243
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,850
BAURA: OK.

244
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:32,084
-That's not going to happen.

245
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:35,150
Roar, Haineko!

246
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:38,384
-Pay not attention to their
feeble attempts, Baura.

247
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,017
Swallow them!

248
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,450
[roaring]

249
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:44,817
-Huh?

250
00:13:48,217 --> 00:13:48,684
BAURA: Huh?

251
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:53,917
-Just what the hell was that.

252
00:13:57,117 --> 00:13:59,284
Oh!

253
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:02,050
-You didn't think you were
the only one with the ability

254
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:03,884
to dive into the
ground, did you?

255
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,784
SAWATARI: You redheaded witch!

256
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:07,250
-But instead of
looking down here,

257
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:10,017
you want to pay attention
to what's above you.

258
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:10,517
-What?

259
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,584
Damn Soul Reaper thinks
she can make a fool of me.

260
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,684
BAURA: They haven't
gone very far.

261
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:41,617
SAWATARI: Let's
stop them, Baura.

262
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,117
BAURA: OK.

263
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:50,250
-Do you really think
we'll be safe here?

264
00:14:50,284 --> 00:14:52,084
NOBA: As far as I can tell.

265
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:54,784
I'm guessing that in order to
move from the other dimension

266
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:58,217
into this one, he needs a
space wide enough for his body.

267
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,184
-That makes sense.

268
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:02,017
-An enormous amount
of energy is displaced

269
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,850
when he moves through space.

270
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:05,517
That would make it
physically impossible

271
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,584
to enter a cramped
area like this.

272
00:15:07,617 --> 00:15:09,084
-Hm.

273
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,250
-[grunt]

274
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:13,817
-What is it?

275
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,717
It doesn't do any good to worry.

276
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,117
It wasn't your fault.

277
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,517
-[sigh] Then what good am I?

278
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,417
My power has always been
used to protect others.

279
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,750
But now this.

280
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,950
-But you must learn for
yourself what that reason is.

281
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:37,517
This amulet will
guide you and help

282
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,150
you to learn their purpose.

283
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,184
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): If
there's ever anything

284
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,350
so important you'd
protect it with your life,

285
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:56,884
I'll protect it
with mine as well.

286
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,984
-And now they've
lost their purpose.

287
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:38,350
-Chad, you can't think that--

288
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:41,150
-Right now, the only thing I'm
thinking about is saving Ururu.

289
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:44,950
-Take it easy.

290
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:47,084
RANGIKU: You can't just
charge in without thinking.

291
00:16:47,117 --> 00:16:50,484
You have to have
some sort of plan.

292
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:52,550
-I plan on taking her place.

293
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:54,050
-No, that's out of the question.

294
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:57,217
He wants to capture all of us,
so making a trade for Ururu

295
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,217
won't work.

296
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,750
You've got to remember
that he thinks

297
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:03,617
of humans as nothing
more than food.

298
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,550
-[sigh]

299
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:07,484
-We have to come up with
a plan of some sort.

300
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,417
NOBA: Wait a minute.

301
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,417
-What is it?

302
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,750
-What if I lure him
into my dimension?

303
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:19,250
-You know, you might
have something there.

304
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:21,250
NOBA: We know that he has
an alternate dimension

305
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:22,350
within his body.

306
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:25,017
If I can surround his
body with my power,

307
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,984
I should be able to
contain everything

308
00:17:27,017 --> 00:17:28,384
within that dimension.

309
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:31,950
Once I've done that, I can move
the objects around at will.

310
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,650
-You think it's possible?

311
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,884
NOBA: Since we both create
alternate dimensions

312
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:39,517
with spiritual power,
it should work.

313
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,517
-Hm.

314
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,517
Well, unless someone
has a better idea.

315
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,517
-Fine, then.

316
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,884
What can we do to help?

317
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,850
-You'll need to
occupy him long enough

318
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:50,984
to lure him in front of
me without his noticing.

319
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:53,217
-I'll be the decoy
and maneuver him, OK?

320
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,884
-Wait a minute.

321
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:56,550
CHAD: Hm?

322
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:59,184
-If anyone is going to
be a decoy, it's me.

323
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:01,084
You can back me up if I need it.

324
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:02,284
-You can't do it.

325
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:03,650
I won't allow you
to put yourself

326
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:04,850
in that kind of danger.

RANGIKU: Danger?

328
00:18:10,384 --> 00:18:11,550
Now, listen.

329
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:14,450
Maybe you have forgotten
who you're talking to.

330
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:17,717
-I-- I didn't mean to--

-All right!

332
00:18:18,517 --> 00:18:20,317
Let's go catch us a fish.

333
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,884
[giggle] Come on, you two.

334

Don't just there.

Let's go!

336
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:37,517
Hey, Gramps.

337
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,684
I know you can hear me.

338
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,284
You move too slowly
to have gone very far.

339
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:42,184
Come on out!

340
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:43,250
I'm right here.

How do you expect me to see
him through all that smoke?

that, you little urchin.

357

Your puny minds
can't comprehend what

358
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,884
it takes to gain
this kind of power,

but I'm afraid you're
about 100 years too early.

Let's grab a bit to eat

think about eating fish

after fighting
someone like that?
