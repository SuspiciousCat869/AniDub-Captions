1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,733
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,400
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:24,200
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:29,066
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,133
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:33,503
Let's have some fun!
Byakuya Kuchiki!

7
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:35,903
Scatter.

8
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:44,969
That doesn't appear to
work.

9
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:53,536
And that
doesn't either.

10
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:03,469
Yeah, go on, run! Looks
like your speed's only
good for running away!

11
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:05,169
That's laughable.

12
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,069
Scatter.

13
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:11,836
That's very impressive.

14
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,436
Captain!

15
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:26,503
Byakuya!

16
00:03:27,836 --> 00:03:30,669
Rukia! Wait, it's too
dangerous out there!

17
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:32,436
Byakuya!

18
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:39,369
Outta my way!!!

19
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:41,436
You will not get past me!

20
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:56,703
Getsugatensho!

21
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:17,636
I don't want you to
bother me any further...

22
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:23,469
If I have to face you
again, I will have no
other choice, I will be
forced to take your life.

23
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:25,869
[laughing]

24
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:28,336
Take my life?! You've
got to be kidding.

25
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:31,536
Go right ahead!
Try, if you dare!

26
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:35,403
I've always wanted to
have a big sword fight
with you to the death.

27
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:37,469
You're finally onboard!

28
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,703
Come at me with that
spirit...

29
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:45,003
I'm ready to take you on,
Byakuya Kuchiki!

30
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:50,869
Very well. I see you
leave me no option.

31
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:06,836
[baby crying]

32
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:11,036
What the hell?

33
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:15,436
Byakuya!

34
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:18,769
Rukia! Wait!

35
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:23,269
Let go, Renji! I must
do what I can to stop
my brother!

36
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:28,536
Look out!

37
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:35,336
What is that?

38
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:41,169
Byakuya!

39
00:05:41,203 --> 00:05:42,603
It's you!

40
00:05:58,369 --> 00:05:59,503
Damn.

41
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,536
What the-?!

42
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:09,703
W-wait!

43
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:25,669
Is your only
plan to run away?!

44
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:35,436
Shucks! You dodged
that one nicely.

45
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:44,936
You couldn't dodge my
attack, so you decided
to sacrifice your arm
instead.

46
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:50,569
You get credit for quick
thinking, but you've just
given me more targets!

47
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:56,203
So! What should I
aim for this time?

48
00:06:57,836 --> 00:07:03,403
I don't understand this.
Our speed should be equal,
and yet...

49
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:10,203
Are you wondering why you
can't keep up with me?

50
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:11,636
What?

51
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,269
You, the fastest Soul
Reaper in the Soul Society,

52
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:19,403
and I, your Zanpakuto,
are almost perfectly
equal in speed.

53
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:21,003
But--

54
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:25,469
While my attacks on you
are scoring direct hits,
your attacks keep on
missing me.

55
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:29,403
Oh dear, what will you
do now?!

56
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:32,603
Your fear is written all
over your face.

57
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:38,436
So you see, I understand
why you feel completely
hopeless.

58
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:44,403
Too bad! I wonder what
it'll take for you to
strike me!

59
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:51,203
I know you've never fought
with an adversary that's
this much smaller than you.

60
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:53,936
When two combatants are
equal in speed,

61
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,936
the one who is smaller,
in this case, me, always
has the advantage.

62
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:01,036
That's just common
sense.

63
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:06,769
Your biased perception is
clouding your judgment.

64
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:10,636
Just as in your
relationship with
Yoruichi.

65
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,136
You resent her when she's
not around, but will do
anything for her when
she is.

66
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,569
There is no middle ground
with you.

67
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:20,203
What would you know about
Lady Yoruichi?!

68
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:23,269
I know everything!

69
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:29,503
After all, I was your
Zanpakuto, remember?

70
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:35,436
Yoruichi's the one
holding you back! She's
the real problem here.

71
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:39,769
What's with that look on
your face?

72
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:43,569
Oh, no, I've
upset you!

73
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,769
Stop!

74
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,303
You can't quite
get me, can you?

75
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:16,203
[laughing]

76
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,903
Your attacks never work,
do they?

77
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:22,103
Time to deliver the
finishing blow!

78
00:09:26,836 --> 00:09:30,636
You're not really
thinking you can you keep
up with my moves, are you?

79
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:33,636
Now, where should I
make the final strike?
Right...

80
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:38,236
... there! Nice
knowing you!

81
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:42,703
W-What?!

82
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:47,169
This can't be!

83
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:56,469
How--?!

84
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:03,936
I concentrated the energy
of Shunko around the Homonka
mark you aimed for.

85
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:06,636
A sword cannot penetrate
that.

86
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:11,869
I'm sorry, but I do not
rely solely on my Zanpakuto.

87
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:14,869
That is the way in
which I was trained.

88
00:10:14,903 --> 00:10:17,203
To be at this level.

89
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:20,203
Damn it!

90
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,703
[laughing]

91
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:06,869
Huh?!

92
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:11,803
Found you! Hide
and seek time!

93
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:13,636
Oh...

94
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:15,836
I see you!

95
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:19,236
I found you again! Yay!
Let's play tag!

96
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:24,369
Hey wait!

97
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:26,769
Gotcha!

98
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:34,569
Oh!

99
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:46,636
Hey. Next time just
keep your ass out of
my battle.

100
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:52,103
Because of your interference,
Byakuya had the chance to
get away from me.

101
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:59,869
So how are you planning
on making it up to me?
Huh? Well?!

102
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,403
What the--??

103
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:13,169
That is my Zanpakuto.

104
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:16,769
And I will not allow you
to do whatever you please
with it.

105
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:23,269
It is my duty to
administer the punishment
to it for betraying its
master.

106
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:25,536
Damn you.

107
00:12:45,822 --> 00:12:47,756
I must go.

108
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:57,122
It looks like you've
really been beaten up.

109
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:04,422
Lady Yoruichi.

110
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:06,589
<i>What is it, Soi Fon?</i>

111
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,656
Please! Not that! Stop!
Let go! I'm begging--

112
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:19,222
Why are you protesting
treatment? Your body
has been infused with
a deadly poison.

113
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,489
You must be treated
immediately or you'll
die.

114
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:30,156
I don't need that stuff!
I've already heard that
your treatments don't
really work!

115
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:34,289
My goodness! Who would
have told you such a
vicious lie?

116
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,589
Uryu! He told me!

117
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:42,756
Oh, that Quincy. I knew I
should have rebuilt him too!

118
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:46,356
That would have kept him
from spreading such
ridiculous rumors!

119
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,489
"Too"? Did you just say
"too"?

120
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:55,456
That means you have the
intention to rebuild me
as well!

121
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:59,189
You talk too much as
well!

122
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:04,489
I'm thinking since I'm
treating you anyway, I
could rebuild you without
an extra charge.

123
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:06,589
You should be grateful!

124
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:13,456
I should be thrilled
about being injected with
something harmful?!

125
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,322
Nemu!

126
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,522
Huh?? What?! Hey! No!
Don't! Wait!

127
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,456
Please, Ichigo,
calm down.

128
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:22,322
Keep him still, Nemu.

129
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:23,789
<i>Hey!</i>

130
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,689
I don't care what you do
to Ichigo, as long as
he's still able to fight
me when you're done.

131
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:34,922
Kenpachi! Don't just
sit there! Stop him,
will you?!

132
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:36,922
Why should I?

133
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:40,922
I don't care if you get
turned into a machine or
a fire-breathing monster.

134
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:44,622
As long as I can still
have fun fighting with
you.

135
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:46,356
You jerk!

136
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,322
You hang in there, Icchi!

137
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:52,422
Hey hold on, how come the
poison isn't affecting the
two of you?!

138
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:56,056
Oh, good question.

139
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,956
We held our breath and
didn't breathe in the
poison, so we're doing
a-okay!

140
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:01,956
Well that's rather
strange.

141
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:06,689
That poison is supposed to
be capable of entering your
body whether you inhale
it or not...

142
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:10,089
Well, maybe it doesn't
work on idiots.

143
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,189
<i>I bet there's</i>
<i>another reason.</i>

144
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:16,389
I'll bet that Captain
Zaraki's Spirit Energy
repelled the poison.

145
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:19,322
Captain Kyoraku! And
Captain Ukitake!

146
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:22,089
Sorry about showing
up so late, Ichigo.

147
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,289
So are you all
right, then?

148
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:28,756
Captain Kurotsuchi...
Our thanks for tending to
everyone.

149
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:33,089
Now that Squad Four's
arrived, we'll take care
of things from here on.

150
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:34,556
Great-I'm saved!

151
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,056
Please be quiet.

152
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:38,222
Hey! Come on! Let me go!

153
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:43,322
It isn't easy to treat
a victim of my poison, if
you are not familiar with
it.

154
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:45,322
Please rest assured.

155
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:48,089
We successfully treated
Isane and the others who

156
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:51,589
were exposed to the
poison during Ashisogijizo's
attack.

157
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:54,822
We have already analyzed
its contents.

158
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:57,889
That was unwarranted!

159
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:06,522
Next time, I'll create a poison
that even you will be unable to
analyze and treat so quickly,
Captain Unohana.

160
00:16:06,556 --> 00:16:09,389
Well I have that to look
forward to.

161
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:12,556
Uh, are they having an
argument?

162
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:17,722
Captain Unohana. Did you
say that Ashisogijizo
attacked?

163
00:16:18,456 --> 00:16:25,789
Yes. Before coming here,
Konjiki Ashisogijizo
infiltrated the Seireitei.

164
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,322
Hado Number Thirty One!
Shakkaho!

165
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:49,922
[squeaking]

166
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:09,956
Damn it! It's catching
up to us!

167
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:34,122
Momo!

168
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:39,589
I'm sorry. I think the
poison has taken effect!

169
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:43,989
I think... you must just
be over tired.

170
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,922
I'm glad you're
all safe--

171
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:49,789
Momo!

172
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:50,822
What's
happening?!

173
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:55,856
Rangiku!
They've been poisoned!

174
00:17:56,889 --> 00:18:01,989
Isane! Damn it!!

175
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:13,456
Fortunately, Ashisogijizo
conducted its rampage
relatively close to our
Squad Four barracks.

176
00:18:14,256 --> 00:18:17,022
All four of them are
being treated there now.

177
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:20,556
Thanks to our effective
treatment, their lives
aren't in danger.

178
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:25,556
After a week or so of bed
rest, they should be fully
recovered.

179
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:27,156
That's good to know.

180
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:29,922
<i>Captain Unohana!</i>

181
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:34,222
Lieutenant Kira was
discovered near a
collapsed building.

182
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:36,922
We found Third Seat
Madarame near the
courtyard!

183
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:40,456
And Fifth Seat
Ayasegawa in the
forest! They were
unconscious!

184
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:42,322
I understand.

185
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:47,122
In that case I will
look after the wounded
here. Please go and help
out the others.

186
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:48,656
Yes ma'am!

187
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:56,689
Say, Captain Kurotsuchi.
Your Zanpakuto. Was it
really such a wise
decision to break it?

188
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:02,222
Yes it was. It was more
important for me to
recover Ashisogijizo

189
00:19:02,256 --> 00:19:05,556
to understand the secret
behind the brainwashing of
the Zanpakuto.

190
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:09,156
Wait. So earlier you
forced it to submit?

191
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,956
Hardly. It simply
self-destructed.

192
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:17,856
It was the same as when
that ruffian took action
and broke Wabisuke.

193
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:21,356
Then it's lost...
forever.

194
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:26,922
Enough talk! I broke
my own Zanpakuto in order
to discover vital new
information.

195
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:32,489
[chuckling]
You ask too many
questions.

196
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:38,089
You don't think losing
your own sword just to
conduct an experiment, is
too big a price to pay?

197
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:40,122
Oh, of course not!

198
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:44,656
[laughing]
It's a good thing
you're on our side.

199
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:48,822
Rukia. Are you okay?

200
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:52,722
I'm sorry that I
have you so concerned.

201
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:54,389
It's fine. Relax.

202
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:57,122
Right.

203
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:02,022
S you tried but you
couldn't stop Byakuya?

204
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,056
Yes.

205
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:12,622
I don't understand. Just
what exactly is he
intending to do?

206
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:30,689
Good work.

207
00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:43,289
Are you heading to the
World of the Living?

208
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,256
Follow me.

209
00:20:58,322 --> 00:21:01,622
All right then. I
guess I'll get going.

210
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:04,456
Where are you going,
Captain Zaraki?

211
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:10,456
You know where. I'm going
to go find Byakuya so we
can finish our fight.

212
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:12,556
Sounds like great fun,
Kenny!

213
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:15,389
You won't find him just
searching blindly.

214
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:19,722
Yoruichi!

215
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:22,589
Yoruichi Shihoin, you're
back?

216
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:25,456
They really did a number
on this place.

217
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:29,822
So, do you know where
I'm gonna be able to
find those rebel bastards?

218
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:31,489
I don't!

219
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:32,556
What?!

220
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:36,522
But I have discovered
where they're holding
the Head Captain.

221
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,022
So, do you
wanna go?

222
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:02,222
It's here.

223
00:23:48,431 --> 00:23:51,298
Renji, do you know where
my broken Sodenoshirayuki
is?

224
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:53,364
<i>Hey! Zabimaru is missing</i>
<i>too.</i>

225
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:57,264
<i>Oh, Captain Kurotsuchi</i>
<i>took them both. He said</i>
<i>he's going to repair them.</i>

226
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:01,064
<i>Oh, that's nice...</i>
<i>What?! We've gotta get</i>
<i>them back before he</i>
<i>rebuilds them!</i>

227
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:02,598
Sodenoshirayuki!
