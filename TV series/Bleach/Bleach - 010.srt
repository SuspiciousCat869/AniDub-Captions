1
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:46,714
-Good evening, everyone!

2
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:49,249
This week's episode
of Spirit Hunter

3
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:50,984
is brought to you
live from an abandoned

4
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:53,487
hospital in the
town of Karakura,

5
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:55,723
where the tortured
screams of the dead

6
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:58,192
can be heard echoing
through the hall.

7
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:59,993
-Who knows what
horrifying sights

8
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:01,995
we'll witness here this evening.

9
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:05,399
-And now, folks, let's
get in a warm welcome.

10
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:09,803
This century's premier
spiritualist and messenger

11
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:13,741
from hell, Mr. Don Kanonji.

12
00:02:13,774 --> 00:02:19,413
[applause]

13
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:21,181
-The spirits are
always with you.

14
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,397
-Bwahahahaha.

15
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,399
-Huh?

16
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,134
Ichigo, you barely
reacted at all.

17
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:42,736
Don't you even know
where it's from?

18
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:45,739
-Uh, Spirit Hunter?

19
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,207
-Yeah, isn't that
show just the best?

20
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:48,108
Come on then, Ichigo.

21
00:02:48,142 --> 00:02:50,110
Join in with me.

22
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,479
-Banzai!

23
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:55,249
-Oh hey, Tatski,
what's the matter?

24
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:57,718
-Let's go already, you
can bwahaha with me.

25
00:02:57,718 --> 00:03:00,454
Now move!

26
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:02,055
-Yo, Ichigo.

27
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:02,923
Keigo here.

28
00:03:02,956 --> 00:03:04,491
-And Mizuiro!

29
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07,227
-Bwahahaha.

30
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:08,262
-Meh.

31
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:10,130
-What do you mean,
you're not going?

32
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,733
It's the best TV show in Japan.

33
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:14,401
And it's going to
be broadcasting live

34
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:16,036
from Karakura.

35
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:17,738
You live in this town, dude.

36
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,773
You'd have to be
dead to miss it.

37
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:21,141
-Guess that makes me a zombie.

38
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:22,776
Get lost.

39
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,814
-But I already went to the
trouble of asking Rukia to go.

40
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:29,483
-Hi, Ichigo.

41
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:31,385
-Come on, Rukia.

42
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:33,420
Muahahaha.

43
00:03:33,454 --> 00:03:34,321
-No.

44
00:03:34,354 --> 00:03:36,423
I'd be too embarrassed to do it.

45
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:37,724
-Oh please, Rukia?

46
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:38,425
Do it.

47
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,026
Muahaha.

48
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,194
-Geez.

49
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:41,395
She's becoming quite the
little actress, isn't she?

50
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:46,967
[crowd chanting]

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,336
-And how is everyone tonight?

52
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:51,205
Hold on to your
seats, my babies.

53
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:53,474
It's time again to
hear the spirits cry.

54
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:55,742
[applause]

55
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,178
-So tell us, what do
you think of this place?

56
00:03:58,212 --> 00:03:59,480
Well?

57
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:03,383
-The stench of the spirit world
hangs in the air around us.

58
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:04,785
I'd have to say that.

59
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:07,354
[crowd chanting]

60
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:09,857
-Bwahahaha!

61
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,339
-Bwahahaha!

62
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:21,101
-And we're cutting
to commercial.

63
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:25,739
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Man, I hate
stupid shows about spirits.

64
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:26,874
-This way, everyone.

65
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:28,141
We're about to get started.

66
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:31,745
Make your way to the spirit
purification location.

67
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:33,914
-Ichigo?

68
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:35,182
-I'm sorry for the other day.

69
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,483
-What do you mean?

70
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:38,252
-It's just that
Tatsuki was telling me

71
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:41,255
you really can't stand
TV shows like this one.

72
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:42,890
And I had no idea.

73
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:43,490
-That's cool.

74
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:44,758
It's really no big deal.

75
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,059
-Bwahahaha.

76
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:47,361
-Look at those two.

77
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:50,163
They know it drives me
nuts, but they do it anyway.

78
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:52,132
-But you still showed up.

79
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:53,000
Why is that?

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,001
-Oh.

81
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:55,869
Yeah, well my dad
and my little sister

82
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:58,138
go out of their minds
for Spirit Hunter.

83
00:04:58,171 --> 00:04:59,840
-And that's why you're here?

84
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:01,174
-Guess so.

85
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,111
I couldn't just let them
come alone, you know.

86
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,980
-Wow, you've got such
a good heart, Ichigo.

87
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:08,916
-Why, isn't that normal?

88
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:11,084
-Uh, oh.

89
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:11,718
Yeah.

90
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:12,486
That's normal.

91
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,161
Mmhmm.

92
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:16,423
Very normal.

93
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:19,826
-Hey, Orihime, I we're going
to head on without you.

94
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,028
-Oh hey!

95
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:23,330
Hold on, Tatsuki, wait up!

96
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:23,931
See you.

97
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:28,402
-Yeah, sure.

98
00:05:28,435 --> 00:05:29,469
I'm normal.

99
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,104
But what about the
rest of these weirdos?

100
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:32,439
What's their excuse?

101
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:34,374
-Ichigo, what's wrong?

102
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,843
-Bwahahaha.

103
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:39,112
-You, too!

104
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:42,716
-Hey, what's with
the serious look?

105
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:45,218
As long as you're here, you
might as well try and have fun.

106
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:45,986
-Shut up.

107
00:05:45,986 --> 00:05:47,354
I'm always like this.

108
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:50,223
-Between all of your school
work and your duties as a soul

109
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:52,426
reaper, you must be exhausted.

110
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,262
And there will be hard
battles on the road ahead.

111
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:58,031
Use tonight to enjoy
yourself a little.

112
00:05:58,065 --> 00:05:59,132
-What?

113
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:00,867
Are you--

114
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,036
-By the way, tell me.

115
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,504
What is this festival all about?

116
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:08,008
-You mean you showed up
here without even knowing?

117
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:09,343
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Seriously, you

118
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:11,945
think there'd really be spirits
in an old deserted hospital

119
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,714
like this one?

120
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:15,082
-What are you getting at?

121
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:16,883
-I mean, if they
had been here, you

122
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,720
soul reapers would have helped
them cross over already, right?

123
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,054
-Well, not necessarily.

124
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:24,891
Jibaku spirits are often
tied to places like this.

125
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:27,461
Jibaku spirits are ghosts
that dwell within the Earth,

126
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:29,730
so it's very rare
that soul reapers are

127
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,431
able to pinpoint their location.

128
00:06:31,465 --> 00:06:36,770
There's only one reason a
Jibaku would reveal itself--

129
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:41,141
when it notices humans are
invading its territory.

130
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:45,979
[eerie noise]

131
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:47,948
-What's the matter, Chad?

132
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:49,716
-Do you guys hear anything?

133
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,417
-Huh?

134
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,319
Come on, Chad, cut it out.

135
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:53,987
You're giving me the creeps.

136
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:55,122
-It's just your imagination.

137
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:57,391
[eerie noise]

138
00:06:57,424 --> 00:06:58,358
-Yeah, right.

139
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:00,494
My imagination.

140
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:01,795
-Oh, boy.

141
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:03,430
I never should have come
out here with you guys.

142
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:06,166
-Hey, why the long face?

143
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,100
-Nothing.

144
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:11,505
[eerie noise]

145
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:13,740
-That's the cry of a Jibaku.

146
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,143
So there is one here.

147
00:07:16,176 --> 00:07:19,980
-Wait a sec, how do you know
that sound's not a hollow?

148
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,484
-There are certain paths along
which hollows come into being.

149
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:27,020
One path is when
a jibaku spirit,

150
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:30,190
with its fierce attachment
to the world, is left alone

151
00:07:30,223 --> 00:07:34,194
and becomes a hollow, much
like this spirit here.

152
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:35,829
-So then he's a--

153
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:38,331
-A hole on the verge
of becoming a hollow.

154
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:39,066
A demi-hollow.

155
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,870
[screaming in pain]

156
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:47,140
-Yeah, well he sure feels
like a hollow to me.

157
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:50,377
Except that he's not wearing
one of those white masks.

158
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,880
And the hole in his chest
hasn't opened all the way.

159
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:56,216
-The hole in a
hollow's chest shows

160
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:58,118
that the heart has
been lost, leaving

161
00:07:58,118 --> 00:08:00,387
nothing but raw instinct.

162
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:03,123
The white skull-shaped
mask is all that shields

163
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:05,859
those bared instincts
from the outside world.

164
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:10,931
Neither are necessary if
the heart is still intact.

165
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:14,134
Upon death the chain of fate
is severed from the body.

166
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:17,370
Usually, the spirit waits
for a soul reaper's guidance.

167
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,840
But if they have
regrets in this world,

168
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:22,275
they become bound to the
source of their pain.

169
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:30,817
So that means this
demi-hollow's heart

170
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:32,085
is chained to the hospital.

171
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:34,354
-This hospital belongs to me!

172
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:35,989
I'm not giving it up for anyone!

173
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:38,058
Don't even think about
trying to come in here!

174
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:39,893
I'm going to be filthy
rich in this place--

175
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:43,396
-Yeah, well, whatever he is,
he sure sounds like a dumbass.

176
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:45,065
(ON TV): Coming back
from commercial--

177
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:46,133
-Oh!

178
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,801
I think the show is
about to get started.

179
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:54,975
-The spirits are
always with you.

180
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:55,909
Wahahaha!

181
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:58,712
(CROWD): Wahahaha!

182
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,847
-Hey, knock it off!

183
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:02,115
-Don't worry.

184
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:05,418
It takes months for a spirit
to transform into a hollow.

185
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:08,388
-Now then, the time has come
once again for Don Kanonji

186
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:09,723
to take the stage.

187
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:11,258
-You can feel the excitement
in the air tonight.

188
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:12,359
TATSUKI (OFFSCREEN): We
don't want the spirit

189
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:14,861
to become agitated with
this many people around.

190
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:16,863
We'll do the konso
after the show.

191
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:18,165
-Yeah, but--

192
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:20,167
-Spirits go through
so much pain when

193
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,501
they transform into hollows.

194
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:23,970
They fill the night
with terrible screaming.

195
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:26,006
I mean, does it look
like that demi-hollow

196
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,140
is suffering to you?

197
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:27,974
-Huh?

198
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:29,509
And who the hell are you?

199
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:32,212
You think you can come in
here and defile my hospital?

200
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,314
You've got some nerve, buddy.

201
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:36,383
And what's with the
crazy frigging hat?

202
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:37,717
-My guess is no.

203
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:38,919
-There, you see.

204
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:40,720
Unless someone
deliberately messes

205
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:42,389
with that opening
in his chest, he's

206
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:47,427
still got another six months
before he becomes a hollow.

207
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,330
[screaming in pain]

208
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:55,135
-All right, let's send you
over to the other side, baby.

209
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:57,070
-There it is, folks,
the super spirit

210
00:09:57,103 --> 00:10:01,007
gained an unusual [inaudible]
this early in the game.

211
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,976
-What the hell does
he think he's doing?

212
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,177
-The fool.

213
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:08,849
All he's doing is speeding
up the creation of a hollow.

214
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:09,783
-Oh yeah!

215
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:12,285
[speaking gibberish]

216
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:12,886
-Get gone!

217
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:18,058
-Come on, knock it off!

218
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:19,860
-Hey, who's that guy?

219
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,827
-Security, do your job!

220
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,766
-Over here, we've got to
get you out of your bodies.

221
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,168
-Kill her!

222
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,736
-Let go of me.

223
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:36,142
[screaming in pain]

224
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:37,077
-No!

225
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,079
-Get your hands off of me!

226
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:47,854
Who did that?

227
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:49,422
-Hello.

228
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:50,457
-Mr. Hat and Clogs?

229
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,058
-Don't just stand
there like a lump.

230
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:53,827
Get to work already.

231
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,228
-Right.

232
00:10:55,262 --> 00:10:56,263
-Hey, what's wrong?

233
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:58,131
-What the hell are
you doing here?

234
00:10:58,131 --> 00:10:59,099
-What?

235
00:10:59,132 --> 00:10:59,866
-Out of the way.

236
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,801
I'll take care of this.

237
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,169
-Hey, stop it!

238
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:10,877
-Holy moly, Don Kanonji was
just thrown through the air.

239
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:12,379
-What's wrong with you, kid?

240
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:15,015
-Well, then, I guess
you can see me, too.

241
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,116
-Of course I can.

242
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,419
I'm the century's
premier spiritualist.

243
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:20,720
Oh wait, I get it.

244
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,856
You're dead, but you're
a fan, aren't you?

245
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,791
-Don't make me kill you.

246
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:32,732
[screaming in pain]

247
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:34,301
-Don't tell me, am I too late?

248
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:46,478
[screaming in pain]

249
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,234
-He's gone.

250
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,835
-Yeah!

251
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,003
Mission accomplished, baby!

252
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:11,005
ANNOUNCER: Another
successful soul purification!

253
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:11,487
-Are you kidding?

254
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:11,973
-No.

255
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,345
The moment a demi-hollow
becomes a hollow,

256
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:20,781
it disperses and reforms
as a hollow elsewhere.

257
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:23,284
But if its heart was
bound to something here

258
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:24,218
in this hospital--

259
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:32,260
[crowd chanting]

260
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,296
-Yeah, thank you!

261
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,298
-Look out, Ichigo!

262
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:37,899
Above you!

263
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:57,084
[screams]

264
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:09,397
-What is it?

265
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,131
-A hollow.

266
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,766
I hope you're ready.

267
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:13,000
-Oh, I feel it.

268
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:16,203
I feel something that
reeks with the scent

269
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:18,272
of a super dangerous spirit.

270
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:21,742
Now I understand, you're that
other spirit's evil lord,

271
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:23,744
and you've come here
seeking vengeance.

272
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:25,780
-Nice try, jackass.

273
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:27,348
-Oh, the pain.

274
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:30,885
Must devour!

275
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:33,354
-Hold on.

276
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:34,789
-Run, boy.

277
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:35,263
-Huh?

278
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:37,325
-To wah.

279
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,261
Come on, you bad spirit.

280
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:42,930
Don Kanonji, the premiere
spiritualist of the century,

281
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:44,899
is ready!

282
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,834
-How are you?

283
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,702
-What are you doing?

284
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,043
-Kid, why didn't you run?

285
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:58,079
-Look, you're the one
who should be running.

286
00:13:58,112 --> 00:13:58,946
-Huh?

287
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,880
Me, run?

288
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,917
What are you saying?

289
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,152
[roars]

290
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:07,188
-Oh, Jesus.

291
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,023
-Just as I thought.

292
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,925
Wonderful.

293
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,294
But he's got his
work cut out for him.

294
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:14,729
Let's see how he does.

295
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:24,905
-A golden chance.

296
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,779
ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): What
could this mean, ladies

297
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:32,980
and gentlemen?

298
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:34,281
Don Kanonji--

299
00:14:34,315 --> 00:14:37,685
-Oh, I see, so that's how you
plan on fighting this one, huh?

300
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:39,820
ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): The
glass of the entrance has

301
00:14:39,854 --> 00:14:42,623
been shattered and whole
walls have been destroyed.

302
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:45,092
Folks, it appears
that Don Kanonji

303
00:14:45,126 --> 00:14:48,029
must be battling against
some unknown force.

304
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:49,230
-Don't worry about it.

305
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,133
A hollow of that level won't
be a problem for Ichigo.

306
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,135
-But I, uh--

307
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:57,638
-Best not to make too much
of a fuss at the moment.

308
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:01,642
Besides, seems as Don Kanonji
has a bit of power himself.

309
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:05,179
Why don't we let them handle it?

310
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:07,715
-Wait, why are we
running away, kid?

311
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:10,251
-Because I heard some
idiot say we should run.

312
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,087
-I know, but I was talking
about you, kid, not me.

313
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,722
Kanonji runs from no one.

314
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:21,662
-All right.

315
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:23,097
Can you explain this one to me?

316
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,634
Why should I run away and
you stay behind to fight?

317
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:32,907
-Well I-- I have to stay,
because-- because after all,

318
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,874
I'm the hero.

319
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:35,042
-Huh?

320
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,077
-Listen, little man.

321
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,412
Do you have any idea
the ratings my show

322
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,147
pulls in for the network?

323
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,382
-What the hell do I care?

324
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:43,050
-I'll tell you why you should.

325
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:45,619
I've got 25%.

326
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:49,623
One in every four households
is watching my show.

327
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:54,662
And many of those
views are children.

328
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:56,831
Those children
watch my adventures

329
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:59,100
and their hearts are inspired.

330
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:01,168
They see me stand
up to evil spirits

331
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,804
and learn what true courage is.

332
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,073
So don't you get it?

333
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:08,709
With all those kids out there
watching my show, running

334
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:11,078
isn't an option, understand?

335
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:14,014
-Don Kanonji, you're right.

336
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,116
-You bet I am.

337
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:19,153
Now let's get out there
and crush that monster.

338
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,087
-Think, you idiot.

339
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:21,722
You can't do that.

340
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:24,125
What if the audience
gets mixed up in it?

341
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:27,228
That thing is going after people
with high levels of spirit

342
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:30,097
energy like you and me.

343
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:33,000
There's no question it's
going to come after us,

344
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,936
but we need to fight it in
here so no one in the audience

345
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,806
will get hurt.

346
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,144
-Kid, I am amazed.

347
00:16:43,177 --> 00:16:45,212
For you to have thought
things through like that

348
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:47,281
in the heat of battle.

349
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:49,116
Kid.

350
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,717
-He's here.

351
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:55,856
-I'll devour you!

352
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,659
-Let's do this!

353
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:00,161
-Not enough room.

354
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,202
Dammit, it's too cramped
to use the [inaudible].

355
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:13,707
What the hell is this?

356
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,309
I can't frickin' get it off.

357
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,683
I can't get him.

358
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:24,652
Ah, hold on a second!

359
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:45,773
-Hey, kid.

360
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:46,640
Are you all right here?

361
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,141
-You again?

362
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,013
Move it, Kanonji, run!

363
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:59,220
Dammit.

364
00:17:59,253 --> 00:17:59,820
Hold on!

365
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:11,031
Kanonji!

366
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:13,167
-Are you hurt, kid?

367
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,134
-You can't handle them!

368
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:15,903
Get the hell out of here!

369
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:17,371
-No.

370
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:20,774
I know my own strength
and I know the difference

371
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:23,777
between my enemy's
powers and my own.

372
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:26,113
I must say, you've made
quite an impression

373
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,316
on me today, putting the
safety of others first.

374
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,684
That's great.

375
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:32,152
You and I are two of a kind.

376
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,689
What's say we be friends?

377
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:38,826
-Oh, uh, that's
all right, really.

378
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:41,128
-Whooooa, Kanonji!

379
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,963
Ultimate attack!

380
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:43,446
Cannonball.

381
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:04,151
-Kanonji!

382
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:06,620
-Even if this body
is obliterated,

383
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,822
so long as I can
serve as a shield

384
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,892
to the children of tomorrow,
I shall carry no regrets

385
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:15,229
for the life that I've lived.

386
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:15,996
Good luck.

387
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:26,640
-Sorry, pal, but
this is the end.

388
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:30,426
-Well done.

389
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:36,917
That was great.

390
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,752
Magnificent.

391
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:39,953
Just magnificent.

392
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:41,088
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Kananji.

393
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:44,124
Don't get too excited.

394
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:45,926
-Huh?

395
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,860
Why not, kid?

396
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,096
You just defeated this monster.

397
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:51,098
This is a time to rejoice.

398
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:53,033
Huh?

399
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:56,303
What the?

400
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:58,806
Huh?

401
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,373
it can't be.

402
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:03,177
He's the one who-- What?

403
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,112
-He was a hollow.

404
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:07,147
With the chain linked
to his soul broken,

405
00:20:07,147 --> 00:20:08,382
the hole in his chest opened.

406
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:12,052
He became a monster devoid
of conscience, a hollow.

407
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,054
-That-- who?

408
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:18,759
So then-- no.

409
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,294
So if that's the
case, what is it

410
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:21,895
I've been doing all this time?

411
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,735
Oh, no.

412
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,170
I'm so ashamed of myself.

413
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:37,177
[cries]

414
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:38,779
-Hey, come on.

415
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:41,715
Quit your crying,
hero, let's go.

416
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:43,150
Everybody's waiting.

417
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:54,895
[crowd cheering]

418
00:20:54,928 --> 00:20:55,896
-What's wrong?

419
00:20:55,896 --> 00:20:58,265
You'd better answer them.

420
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,034
It's part of a hero's
duties, isn't it?

421
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:01,969
-Kid.

422
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:03,137
ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN):
All right,

423
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,074
Don Kananji's soul
purification seems to be over.

424
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:08,909
-Mission accomplished!

425
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:11,278
Bwahahahaha.

426
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:11,879
-Bwahahaha!

427
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:21,021
[cheering]

428
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:24,224
-Kid, that was a
magnificent battle.

429
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:29,630
I stand in awe of your courage,
and I'm amazed by your power.

430
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,300
I hope you'll lend me that
strength in the future.

431
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:39,907
-Uh-- yeah, sure,
once in awhile.

432
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:41,742
-Thank you.

433
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:45,879
From now on, you will
be my number one pupil.

434
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:51,051
-That's a demotion!

435
00:22:57,248 --> 00:23:00,251
Rukia and I set out to
exterminate some hollows.

436
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:01,586
-Bwahahahaha... It is I, Don
Kanonji.

437
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:02,387
But somebody beats us to it.

438
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,082
-Come on repeat after me.

439
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,752
A mysterious figure watches
from the shadows.

440
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:07,887
-I can't hear
you! One more time. Muahahaha.

441
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:12,125
Shut up... will ya? I am begging
you, please go home!
