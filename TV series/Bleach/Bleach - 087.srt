-You've all been
very entertaining,

8
00:01:55,422 --> 00:01:58,655
but I'm afraid you're
about 100 years too early.

9
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:01,022
I won't be sealed away yet.

BAURA: Understood.

-We've got to hurry!

20
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:47,355
NOBA: It's no good.

21
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:56,722
-Noba.

22
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:57,588
-Over here!

23
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:04,022
-Damn it.

24
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:18,088
-He's not planning
on letting us go.

25
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:28,755
I could try Shunpo,
but my spiritual

26
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:30,988
is limited here in
World of the Living.

27
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:33,988
I doubt we'd make it very far.

28
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:35,222
Flying's out of the question.

29
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:38,288
It would be too difficult
carrying the two of them.

30
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:41,155
I've got to think of something.

31
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:46,488
-Rangiku, there's no
need for you to die, too.

32
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:50,322
Leave us, and get out
here while you still can.

33
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,822
We'll act as decoys
and draw his attention.

34
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:57,855
You shouldn't have any
problem getting away from here

35
00:03:57,888 --> 00:03:58,888
on your own.

36
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,422
-I could never do
something like that.

37
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:02,622
Stop talking nonsense, and
start thinking of a way

38
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:04,655
to get all of us
out of this mess.

39

-[gasp]

40
00:04:12,222 --> 00:04:14,155
-We'll have to wait for
him to attack, and then

41
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:17,188
use my Shunpo to run as
far away as possible.

42
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:18,255
-You got it.

43
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:35,122

00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:52,022
-It didn't work!

47
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,322
-[together] Noba!

48
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:11,255
-I can't believe
you pulled that off.

49
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:11,955
NOBA: No problem.

50
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:16,855
-It looks like we bought
ourselves a few minutes.

51
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:19,455
But it's only a matter of time
before he catches up to us.

52
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:26,322
I sense clashes and spiritual
pressure somewhere across town.

53
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:28,588
It's probably Shuhei
and the others.

54
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:31,222
It seems like we keep moving
further and further away

55
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:32,988
from them.

56
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:35,755
They've been successful in
separating us from each other.

57
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:45,288
Noba's too weak now.

58
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:46,988
e could never neutralize
the doll's power

59
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:47,788
like he did before.

60
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:54,622
-I'm going to immobilize that
doll and capture it myself.

61
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,022
And then I'm going to
make it cough up Ururu.

62
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:58,988
-It's not as simple as that.

63
00:05:59,022 --> 00:06:01,022
Without Noba, we
wouldn't have any idea

64
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:03,522
when or where it
was going to attack.

65
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:06,622
Even then, we barely
have time to dodge it.

66
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:08,622
It's impossible to
mount a counterattack

67
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:10,655
in that brief instant.

68
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:12,955
We won't be able to
do any real damage

69
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:14,622
by just attacking
with sheer force.

70
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:23,188
-If I knew when and
where it was coming from,

71
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:24,922
then I would be
able to concentrate

72
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:26,255
my attack on his belly.

73
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:28,788
That's where the
scales look thinner.

74
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:32,255
-It's possible, but it would
mean using a decoy again.

75
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:35,422
And we should pick the
battleground, not him.

76
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:38,222
At any rate, it's dangerous
for us to stay here.

77
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:39,588
We need to get moving.

78
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:41,422
-Right.

79
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:44,355
Noba, I think we should
leave your Gigai here.

80
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:45,888
-His Gigai?

81
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:46,922
-Yes.

82
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:48,388
Noba is a Mod-Soul
created to assist us

83
00:06:48,422 --> 00:06:50,055
in fighting the Bounts.

84
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:53,722
The body he's using is a
Gigai created by Uruhara.

85
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:55,288
-So that's the
reason why he could

86
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:57,055
tell where the Bounts
were going to appear.

87
00:07:00,355 --> 00:07:05,022
-Rangiku, I want you to
take out Noba's Soul Candy.

88
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:08,322
As a Soul Reaper, you
can do that, right?

89
00:07:08,355 --> 00:07:11,088
-Chad, that's not necessary.

90
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:16,322
As long as a Mod-Soul's capsule
remains intact, he cannot die.

91
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:18,422
Mine is still fine.

92
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:19,822
-But still.

93
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,122
-We don't have to
leave my Gigai.

94
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:24,088
I still have enough
strength to teleport

95
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:25,922
between dimensions
with this body.

96
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:28,488
-Noba.

97
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:30,155
RANGIKU: It might work.

98
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:34,722
We might just be able to
pull this off after all.

99
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,688
What if we tried
to combine my Kido

100
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,588
with Noba's
Bount-tracking power?

101
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:41,488
We might just be able
to hook that big fish.

102
00:07:41,522 --> 00:07:43,688
-Is that possible?

103
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:45,155
RANGIKU: Yes, but
it would probably

104
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:48,522
use up the rest of
our spiritual power.

105
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,188
If we fail, then we're done.

106
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:56,255
-What do I do?

107
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:57,322
-Noba.

108
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:59,988
-Uruhara created us
for the sole purpose

109
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,955
of defeating the Bounts.

110
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:03,822
Far too many innocent
souls have already

111
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:05,288
fallen victim to their greed.

112
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:23,188
I'll do whatever it takes.

113
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:24,822
-All right.

114
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:26,822
-We've got one chance.

115
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:29,955
Noba and I will have to
use Kido to draw him out.

116
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:32,155
We won't be able to
move during that time,

117
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:35,555
so you'll have to attack him.

118
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:37,288
You can take him out
with that same attack

119
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:39,788
you used to surprise
Captain Kyoraku that time.

120
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,722
-They've lived far too long.

121
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:05,155
Though I'm sure they're
planning something right now.

122
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:15,188
[laughs] They should be
planning their funeral.

123
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,655
Go, Baura.

124
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:22,322
RANGIKU: This should do.

125
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:22,822
CHAD: Yeah.

126
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:28,755
-Are you ready?

127
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:29,255
-Mm.

-[grunt]

00:09:58,388 --> 00:09:58,855
-Noba.

130
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:08,622
-You must link your
spiritual pressure with mine.

131
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:09,155
All right.

132
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:09,655
Here we go.

133
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:22,855
-Noba, Rangiku.

134
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,822
[grunting]

135
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:41,122
CHAD: What's happening?

136
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:43,188
Do you think it's going to work?

137
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:45,755
Are you--

138
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:49,022
--[gasp] Hearts of the south
and eyes of the north.

139
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:51,755
Fingertips of the
West, heel of the east.

140
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:56,322
Gather together the wind
and scatter the rain.

141
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,955
Bakudo 58, Kakushitsuijaku!

142
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:16,955

144
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:28,088
-Rangiku.

145
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:30,055
-Why can't I found him?

146
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:32,888
Is Bount spiritual pressure
different from ours?

147
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:35,355
[grunting]

148
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:54,555
-I see him.

149
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,522
It's working!

150
00:11:57,555 --> 00:12:00,955
I don't think he knows
we're tracking him.

151
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:01,955
-He's coming.

152
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:02,655
-Which way?

153
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,822
Where is he coming from?

154
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:10,488
CHAD (VOICEOVER):
They've done their part.

155
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,288
Now it's time for me to do mine.

156

-They won't be expecting
an attack from here.

159
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:31,455
[gasp] How did they
know where I was.

160
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:32,855

[groaning]

165
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:21,949
-It's Ururu.

166
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:25,416
-Oh, it looks like
I'm back, aren't I?

167
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:30,116
-Ururu!

168
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:37,116
-[laughs] Snot-nosed brats.

169
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,349
I've had enough of this
foolishness for one day.

170
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:43,683
We'll finish this another time.

171
00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:46,416
[laughs]

172
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:47,416
-Good.

173
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:49,016
I've had enough of
your crap anyway.

174
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:50,049
SAWATARI: Baura.

175
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,449
BAURA: Yes.

176
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:52,916
-[gasp]

177
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,249
We let them escape.

178
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:15,949
You had the perfect
shot back there,

179
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:17,949
but you chose not
to finish him off.

180
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,749
If you had used your
full power, there's

181
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:22,083
no way he would have survived.

182
00:14:22,116 --> 00:14:25,383
-But then Ururu would
have died as well.

183
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,416
RANGIKU: I figured that's
what you were doing.

184
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,283
Looks like you made
the right decision.

185

MAYURI: Yes!

189
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,649
I've done it!

190
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:04,416
I've finally recovered
the Bount data.

191
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:06,683
Whoever it was thought
they could hide it from me.

192
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:10,683
But they had no idea who
they were dealing with.

193
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:14,616
This material in these files
is absolutely fascinating.

194
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:19,283
I never knew the Bounts had
concealed such a secret.

195
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:21,749
I wonder if I can get
my hands on a Bount

196
00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:24,016
to conduct a little research.

197
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,249
It would be simplest to go
to the World of the Living

198
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:27,316
and deal with this myself.

199
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:30,316
But I don't have
time for that now.

200
00:15:30,349 --> 00:15:32,216
And I would imagine
the Soul Reapers

201
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:33,783
who've gone to the
World of the Living

202
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:36,616
to watch the Bounts
are too busy to help.

203
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:38,649
There must be a solution
to this problem.

204
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:42,116
Huh?

205
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,649
What's this?

206
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:47,449
[laugh] Well now, I'm
beginning understand

207
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:49,116
why the Bounts are
so anxious to get

208
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,216
their hands on a Quincy,
someone with the ability

209
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:55,616
to isolate Reishi
and disburse them,

210
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:58,883
converting that spirit
energy into power.

211
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,816
There's only one
who can do that.

212
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:03,283
Nemu?

213
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:05,349
-Yes, Master Mayuri?

214
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:08,583
-Go fetch Research
Material Q141 and take it

215
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:10,483
to the World of the
Living right now.

216
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:12,949
-Yes, Master Mayuri.

217
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:15,549
That's Q141, correct?

218
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:19,249
-I'll be anxious to see
what he does with it.

219
00:16:19,283 --> 00:16:20,916
[laughs]

220
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:30,716
-Damn it.

221
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:33,383
Why do I have to get stuck
out here in the boondocks

222
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,349
guarding this godforsaken hole?

223
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:38,649
-Uh, because Captain
Zaraki ordered you to?

224
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:39,683
Shut up, you idiot.

225
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:42,316
I know that.

-Someone's there.

Quit sneaking around
like some kind of coward!

231
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,616
Come out and show your face!

00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:00,349
MEN: Where is he?

233
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,183
Over there!

234
00:17:01,216 --> 00:17:03,916
I think he's behind the bricks.

235
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:05,249
-Go report this to the captain!

Attention, attention.

00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:15,183
There is an intruder
in the Seireitei.

238
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:17,916
There is an intruder
in the Seireitei.

All companies report to
their defensive posts.

Repeat, this is an emergency.

00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:24,616
There is an intruder
in the Seireitei.

242

There is an intruder
in the Seireitei.

IKKAKU (VOICEOVER): He's here.

I can feel it.

245
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,449
Someone is definitely
running in front of me.

246
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:36,616
So why can't I feel
any spiritual pressure?

247
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,716
-I got you!

248
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:43,683
Extend, Hozukimaru!

249
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,283
You only want to attack me
when you're invisible, huh?

250
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:56,616
Well, bring it on!

251
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:05,649
IKKAKU (VOICEOVER): He's
completely masked his presence.

252
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:07,049
Move.

253
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,449
Move, damn it!

254
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:13,149
Because as soon as you
do, I'm going to nail you.

-Gotcha!

RIKICHI: Captain Kuchiki!

258
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,716
I'm sorry to disturb you.

259
00:18:41,749 --> 00:18:43,583
-What's all the commotion about?

260
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:45,283
Is there an intruder?

261
00:18:45,316 --> 00:18:47,749
-Well, we haven't received
all the details yet.

262
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:49,349
But, sir--

263
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:50,716
-What is it?

264
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:53,249
-A Stealth Force officer just
delivered this secret letter

265
00:18:53,283 --> 00:18:54,949
from Head Captain
Genryusai Yamamoto.

266
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:57,483
And it's addressed to you.

267
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:58,716
-From Head Captain Yamamoto?

268
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:11,516
And the moon was so
beautiful tonight.

269
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:12,483
Such a pity.

270
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:23,283
-I'm sorry, Captain.

271
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:24,616
I let him get away.

272
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:26,416
-Don't worry about it.

273
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:27,683
-What?

274
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:30,416
-I don't know who it was,
but he's not much of a man

275
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:33,116
if he has to hide his spiritual
pressure while pulling crap

276
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:34,416
like this.

277
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:37,649
It's been a little boring
around here lately, though.

278
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:41,849
This could turn out to be
an interesting diversion.

279

[laughs]

280
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:01,949
-It's just I can't
see the Hollows.

281
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:06,349
[cries] And-- and the
ones that they attack.

283
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,483

URYU: I want to become strong.

00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,216
I'm want to become strong.

286
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:21,116
I want to be a powerful
Quincy and protect everyone

287
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:21,816
from the Hollows.

288
00:20:26,749 --> 00:20:29,316
SENSEI: Release the
tension in your shoulders.

289
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:32,349
Trust your body to
show you the fog.

290
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,549
-Yes, sir.

291
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,349
-Now maintain it and draw
the arrow straight back.

292
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:40,416
It must be a straight line.

293
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,349
And you release your hand.

294
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:46,283
You don't shoot the
arrow, simply release.

295
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:56,349
These are the building
blocks to all of your powers.

296
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:58,249
Perfect them with practice.

297
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:02,549
-But it's so difficult.

298
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,616
-A Quincy's arrow
is only released

299
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:06,516
for those you want to protect.

300
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:09,483
-Those I want to protect?

301
00:21:09,516 --> 00:21:12,349
-In time, you will
understand what I mean.

302
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:35,416
URYU (VOICEOVER): Those
I want to protect.

303
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:39,049
SENSEI: Uryu, watch closely.

304
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,783
Once you master the basics
I've just taught you,

305
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:43,883
the rest is simple.

306
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:48,716
Everything beyond that
will depend on your heart.

307
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:49,849
URYU (VOICEOVER): My heart.

308

-Quincies release
arrows from their hearts

309
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,916
to protect the
ones they cherish.

310

YUMICHIKA: Hey, Rangiku.

00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:10,129
While all of you
were busy fighting,

315
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:11,595
I found the Bounts hideout.

316
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:13,162
RANGIKU: How'd you
do that, Yumichika?

317
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:15,529
YUMICHIKA: When you're blessed
with my brains and beauty,

318
00:24:15,562 --> 00:24:16,529
it's child's play.

319
00:24:16,562 --> 00:24:17,829
RANGIKU: You never
want to get dirty.

320
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:19,729
And yet you chose the
dirtiest job of all.

321
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:20,695
YUMICHIKA: That may be.

322
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:22,529
But I won't tell

CHAD: Golden.

RANGIKU: You know, I
just realized something.

327
00:24:38,995 --> 00:24:40,029
CHAD: What?

328
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,695
-Shouldn't we have
left Noba in his Gigai

329
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:43,895
rather than putting him
into a stuffed animal?

330
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:47,595
I mean, his abilities are
stronger in the Gigai, right?

331
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:48,795
-There's one problem.

332
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,629
-What do you mean?

333
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:52,962
-Well, uh, to do
it, the bodies would

334
00:24:52,995 --> 00:24:56,295
have to join together
if he was in the Gigai.

335
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:03,262
Noba's shy.
