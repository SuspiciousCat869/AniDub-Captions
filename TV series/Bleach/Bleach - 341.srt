1
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:07,941
We found out
we weren't strong...

2
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:10,613
Nor were we weak...

3
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:12,820
There was no
hatred....

4
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:14,390
No anger...

5
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,695
Only...

6
00:02:17,197 --> 00:02:18,500
[sob]

7
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,452
"Bankai," huh?

8
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:32,901
I'm certainly hoping that
isn't your way of serving
notice that your Spirit Energy
has fully returned to you...

9
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:36,242
Maybe, Wanna
find out?

10
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:40,753
Why don't you
guys wait right
here.

11
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:41,688
[gasp]

12
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:43,894
But, Ichigo...

13
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:45,965
[grunt]

14
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,770
I'll finish this
right now!

15
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:52,214
I wouldn't go
pushing your
luck with a
makeshift Bankai.

16
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:53,851
That could
prove fatal.

17
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:03,441

00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:05,445

21
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:20,615
Ichigo!

[fighting grunts]

23
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:28,701
Ahhh, damnit!

24
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:29,904
No, Kon!
Don't!

25
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:31,808
Huh!? What do you
mean, "don't!"

26
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:33,913
We can't just
stand by and watch!

27
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,950
Kon...

28
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,060
At a time like this we
can't stand still! We
should fight together!

29
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:42,434
How much rest do
all of your guys
need!? Get your
asses up!

30
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,707
[chuckle]

31
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:49,351
You don't know
when to shut up,
do you?

32
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:50,954
Well?! Let's
go!

33
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:51,857
Wait!

34
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:52,859
Oh what!?

35
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:54,898
If we're going to
fight together...

36
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,709
Let's give it
everything we've
got!

37
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:01,848

00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:10,602
What are
you doin!?

40
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:12,640
Somenomai,
Tsukishiro!

41
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:14,612
You refuse
to learn!

42
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:16,884
Stop interfering!

43
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,526
You're the one
who keeps butting
in here!!-- Whoa!

Three! Soren Sokatsui!

Getsuga....

....tensho!!!

[struggling shouts]

56
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,682
He can't absorb
Ichigo's Getsuga...

57
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:28,723
I knew it!
Kageroza isn't
able to control
Hollow powers!

58
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:34,937
[panting]

59
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:37,844
He's stronger?!

60
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,991
You must be wondering
why my Getsugatensho
is more powerful now
than it was before...

61
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:47,903
I was really afraid
somewhere in the back
of my mind, of losing
all my Spirit Energy.

62
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:51,043
But something
came to me once
I lost my powers.

63
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:52,547
And what
was that?

64
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:56,089
I can't stand
the thought of
not giving this
my best shot!

65
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,829
I'll use everything
I've got to defeat you!

66
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:03,172
I have to admit that
compared to the last
time we fought, you
are different.

67
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:04,709
However...

68
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,652
[gasp in pain]

69
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:10,490
You still
can' beat
me...

70
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,898
He's controlling
space again.

71
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:16,505
At this rate,
we'll never be
able to save
Nozomi.

72
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:19,110
We have to find a
way to neutralize
him somehow...

73
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:22,118
But he doesn't
seem to have any
weaknesses so far.

74
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:24,190
Go for his
vital point.

75
00:06:24,657 --> 00:06:27,932
If we can
shatter his Soul
Chain, we have
a chance!

76
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:29,937
Makes sense.

77
00:06:29,937 --> 00:06:34,815
If we stop the flow of
Spirit Energy in his body,
there's a chance he'll split
back into 2 entitled again.

78
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:36,619
Hold on...

79
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:38,223
The Soul
Chain, huh!?

80
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:39,058
Kon?

81
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:40,729
You're not...

82
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:43,068
I will let
Ichigo know!

83
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:47,111
[gasp]

84
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:49,918
[weak gasps]

85
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:54,195
Is this the best
you can do with the
help of your so-
called friends!?

86
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:58,037
Or has your
Spirit Energy
completely
run out!?

87
00:06:59,307 --> 00:07:03,116
As long as I
save Nozomi, and
protect all of
my friends...

88
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:05,723
Nothing that happens
after that matters!

89
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:09,164
In that case,
I'll end this
quickly for you!

90
00:07:10,768 --> 00:07:12,138
The charm!!

Finally...

96
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:35,828
I've waited
for this...

97
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:36,831

you!!!

I... haven't
given up... yet!

136
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:17,616
Sop fighting this
pointless battle!
You've lost,
Kageroza!

137
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:22,261
So you think...
that I've lost
Huh!?

138
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:30,882
So this is pointless?
I'll show you you're
dead wrong!

If I'm going to
lose this body...
then I will
destroy everything!

Hey! What the

00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:28,086
I don't know!

148
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:35,538
What the hell?

149
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,976
What is that?
Spirit Energy?

150
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,118
Unbelievable...
He still had
this much power
left!?

151
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:45,595
No, wait. That
Spirit Energy is
the reishi of the
Soul Society itself!

152
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:48,368
(Uryu)
And it looks like
he's absorbing it..

153
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,475
I've never seen
this before!

154
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,485
We can't handle
that! It's too
much Spirit Energy!

155
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:58,326
This was never
part of the plan!

Things are getting
interesting!

00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:12,426
Damn!

159
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:18,040
From what I see, it
certainly appears that
you Reigai weren't
expecting this either.

160
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,782
That Spirit
Energy is
really insane!

161
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:27,362
So much force with
just a single blast...
This can't be good.

162
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,538
You're right, and
it keeps growing
bigger and bigger.

163
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:34,211
(Shunsui)
I think we're
in trouble...

00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:37,720
Damn! We have
got to act
fast here!

165
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,427
Ohhh boy.

166
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:42,365
Danku!

167
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,821
(Shunsui)
Old Man Yama..!

168
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:58,336
Every scheme of Kageroza
Inaba's, or should I
call him Ouko Yuskima
instead...

169
00:12:58,336 --> 00:13:02,813
...has been spurred
by a vengeance against
the Soul Society

170
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:10,733
His intention is
clear. He means to
destroy the Soul
Society.

171
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:12,771
[charging shout]

172
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,884
Damn!

173
00:13:18,117 --> 00:13:23,496
How unexpected! Never
in my wildest dreams
did I think the end
would be like this!

174
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:26,103
Well, then so
be it!

175
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:32,151
Now join me, Ichigo
Kurosaki, in the
place between chaos
and nothingness!

176
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:35,793
(Kageroza)
[evil laughter]

177
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,832
It just keeps
on growing!

178
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,237
Now it's up to
us to stop it!

179
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:41,407
(Sajin Reigai)
Wait!

180
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:42,275
[gasps]

181
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:46,151
Those Reigai...!

182
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:51,564
Why are you
here?

183
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,173
Are you gathering
to go for an
all-out attack?

184
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:57,678
No. That's
not it.

185
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:02,290
Do you remember
what I said to
you, Master
Genryusai?

186
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:09,909
Certainly to you originals,
what we're doing might seem
like a selfish rebellion by
mere pretenders...

187
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:14,854
But still, we Reigai
have our own way of
pursuing our beliefs!

188
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,558
(Captain Yamamoto)
And what is that!?

189
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:19,966
We cannot tell
you that just
yet...

190
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:24,476
Now we will
demonstrate to
you what I meant.

191
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,216
Explain.

192
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,597
You have told us that
what you protect is very
clear to you, and it is
the same as well for us.

193
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:36,205
We will protect the
Soul Society in our
own way.

194
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:41,684
We accept our duty
as Mod Souls to stop
a fellow Mod Soul
who's lost control.

195
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:44,257
Let's go!

196
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,259
What!?

197
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:47,633
Impudent children...

198
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,711
[charging yells]

199
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:55,518
Ha ha ha ha!

200
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:59,962
[charging yells]

201
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:02,702
[attack yell]

202
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:13,996
[attack yell]

203
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:17,538
[attack yell]

204
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:20,978
Damnit them! You're
not stopping me!

205
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:23,318
[attack yell]

206
00:15:23,351 --> 00:15:26,659
[gasp in pain]
Not again!

207
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,667
[painful screams]

208
00:15:31,471 --> 00:15:33,576
You've done
enough!

209
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:38,688
What are you
doing!? Nozomi!?
Stop it!!

210
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,561
We must end
all this!

211
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:43,834
Nozomi! What
are you doing?!

212
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:46,406
[screaming]

213
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,080
[gasp] They
did it!

214
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:21,625
They were Reigai,
but they had the
pride of true Soul
Reapers.

215
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:24,498
Ow ow ow ow ow!

216
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,071
Is everyone okay!?

217
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:29,377
Yeah... just
barely...

218
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:32,149
(Thinking)
Ichigo...

219
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:38,398
[panting breaths]

220
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:48,055
I guess your big
invading army plan
didn't work out the way
you thought it would.

221
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:50,527
Now it's time
to save Nozomi!

222
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,002
I don't understand!
Why is it I can't
defeat you!?

223
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:01,487
Why do you refuse
to give up!? Why
can you keep on
fighting?!

224
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,594
What makes you
so driven!?

225
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:15,120
[gasp]

226
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:24,509
[gasp]

227
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:25,478
[scoff]

228
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:30,924
You damn bastard!

229
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:34,166
You have something
to protect!

230
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:43,755
You have friends to
be there for..! To
shield! To support!

231
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:45,860
People you
care for!

232
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:52,176
(Thinking)
Only the truly weak
seek out the aid and
comfort of others.

233
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:56,753
So why then!?
Why are you
so strong!?

234
00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:57,756
[attack shout]

235
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,738
[attack yell]

236
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,307
(Nozomi)
We found out
we weren't strong.

237
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:21,981
(Nozomi)
Nor were we
weak...

238
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:25,923
(Nozomi)
There was no
hatred...
No anger...

239
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:31,670
(Nozomi)
Only that all this
time, we were just
...alone.

240
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:42,730
Nozomi...

241
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:48,311
Were we mistaken..?
Misguided by our
beliefs..?

242
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:51,986
I don't know.

243
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,091
I see.

244
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:05,117
Hm.

245
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:11,734
[gasp]

246
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:18,750
(Kon)
Nozomi!

247
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,288
Are you alright!?

248
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:22,893
Kon... Yes.
I'm alright.

249
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,867
Oh! Your...

250
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,275
Oh, you mean
this thing?
It's no big
deal really.

251
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,280
[gasp]

252
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:33,619
(Kon)
Well! So everything's
good now, right?

253
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,757
Yes. You're
right.

254
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,731
Come on! Let's
go back to the
World of the
Living, Nozomi!

255
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:44,278
[gasp] Hey!
You're...

256
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:47,085
Nozomi...

257
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:49,791
I'm sorry, Ichigo...

258
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:56,908
(Nozomi)
This was the
only way...

259
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,861
Ichigo! What's
going on here!?

260
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:08,202
Oh...

261
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:10,341
(Nozomi)
Kon...

262
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,880
This is as
it should be.

263
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:16,756
What is that
supposed to mean!?
It sounds like
you're leaving us!

264
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,730
Before he disappeared
I made a promise to
him...

265
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:22,403
...that this
time, I will
be his friend.

266
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:23,873
Friend..?

267
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:27,114
I learned from
you what it
really meant
to have friends.

268
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:30,055
So I'm going,
because it's
my turn to
teach him.

269
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:34,332
You're not going!!
You're talking like
you're going to
disappear forever!

270
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:36,804
Well I won't
let you go!

271
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:40,179
Thanks for
giving me
this, Kon.

272
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:46,260
[sigh] I guess
in the end I
couldn't
protect you.

273
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,303
That's not true!

274
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:53,410
You did protect
me! We were
alone...

275
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:56,084
...but now
we'll both
be at peace.

276
00:20:56,317 --> 00:21:01,931
(Nozomi)
It's because all of you,
because Ichigo and you
were there for me, Kon.

277
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:05,106
Yeah! I'm here
for you! I'll
always be here
for you!

278
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:06,442
So then..?

279
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:12,523
All this time I
couldn't hear it,
but now I can
hear it...

280
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:15,163
The voice of my
soul from deep
inside me,

281
00:21:15,196 --> 00:21:17,535
Can you hear
it, Kon?

282
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:21,177
No, I can't
hear what's
deep inside
of you. But I-

283
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,789
Well, if you let
me put my ear to
your breast I could
try to hear it.

284
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:30,834
You really are
a pervert, you
know that!?

285
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:34,576
[sniffling]
Well pardon me
for liking you!

286
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,823
[sob]
Please don't
forget us.

287
00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:46,472
I won't forget.
After all, we'll
always be...

288
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:56,362
Real friends.
Always and
forever.

289
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:49,601
(Ichigo)
Hey, I wanna say something
before we head back to
the World of the Living.

290
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:52,308
(Kon)
Yeah? Go for it.
Let is all out
while you can.

291
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:54,145
(Ichigo)
Bankai!

292
00:23:54,178 --> 00:23:56,150
(Ichigo)
Bankai! Bankai! Bankai!
Bankai! Bankai! Bankai!
Bankai!

293
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,181
(Kon)
What the hell
was that?

294
00:23:58,214 --> 00:24:01,217
(Ichigo)
I'm stockpiling my call
outs since I won't be able
to do them for a while.
