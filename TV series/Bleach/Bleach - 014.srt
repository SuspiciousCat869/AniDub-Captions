[theme music]

2
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:53,107
-You better get
ready, Uryu Ishida,

3
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:54,907
because I'm gonna beat
the hell out of you.

4
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:55,607
Do you know that?

5
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:03,907
Oh no, you don't.

6
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:14,141
To you, this is just
a contest to see

7
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:16,241
which of us can kill
the most Hollows,

8
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:18,707
but I'm not interested
in playing your game.

9
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:20,107
Fight me.

10
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,841
If you're so sure that Quincys
are superior to Soul Reapers,

11
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:25,174
then why don't you
prove it right now.

12
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:26,307
Or are you too afraid?

13
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:30,507
What are you waiting for?

14
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,941
Come on.

15
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:33,207
-Ichigo, wait.

16
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:33,974
-What do you want?

17
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:35,807
-Look up there.

18
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:37,207
-Huh?

19
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,607
What the hell?

20
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,941
-The Hollows.

21
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:41,707
They're gathering.

22
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,107
-Where are you going?

23
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,374
There are too many of them.

24
00:02:57,407 --> 00:03:00,441
-Now who's afraid, Ichigo?

25
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:03,474
If you don't have the guts,
just stay back here and watch.

26
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:05,874
I told you before,
I am the winner.

27
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:11,841
Down here, filthy Hollows.

28
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:16,741
I, Uryu Ishida, the last of
the Quincys, challenge you.

29
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:18,874
-Is he really the last one?

30
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,341
-It was thought they all
became extinct 200 years ago.

31
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,274
Well, not exactly.

32
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:30,207
They were systematically
killed by the Soul Reapers.

33
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:31,874
URAHARA (OFFSCREEN):
As you can imagine,

34
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:34,107
it was a very difficult
and painful decision

35
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:35,641
for the Soul Reapers.

36
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,641
But in the end, it became
necessary to destroy

37
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:42,474
the Quincys because
it was the only way

38
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:46,007
to prevent the
destruction of this world.

39
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,741
-Soul Reapers were also referred
to by other names back then.

40
00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:52,274
They were called
Balancers or Regulators.

41
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:53,541
-What did they balance?

42
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:55,841
-The number of souls
in the Souls Society

43
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:59,474
and in the human world does not
change by much as time goes by.

44
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:02,407
They just trade places
between the two worlds.

45
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:05,774
It's the job of Soul
Reapers to regulate that,

46
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:08,207
to keep the balance.

47
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:11,107
It worked until the Quincys
disrupted the equation.

48
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,474
The Quincys didn't
cleanse the Hollows.

49
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,341
They destroyed them completely.

50
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:21,874
This meant that any
soul which left the Soul

51
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:25,274
Society for the human
world would never return.

52
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,807
If things had
continued that way,

53
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:30,441
the balance between the two
worlds would have collapsed.

54
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,341
It would have meant
the apocalypse.

55
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:35,841
-[gasps].

56
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:40,741
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): So there were
many meetings between the Soul

57
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:43,807
Reapers and the Quincys,
but to no avail.

58
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:46,907
The Quincys refused
to listen to reason.

59
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:48,774
Finally, there was no choice.

60
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:52,407
The order was given for
the Quincys' annihilation.

61
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:54,707
Many have accused the
Soul Reapers of arrogance

62
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:55,574
for their actions.

63
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:03,307
-What the--?

64
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:04,374
They just keep on coming.

65
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,507
Sensei.

66
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,541
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Uryu!

67
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:18,507
-Ichigo Kurosaki, you
are completely insane.

68
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,207
-All right, Uryu.

69
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:23,641
Now I understand why you think
Soul Reapers are your enemies.

70
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:26,341
I don't know who is
right and who was wrong,

71
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:28,174
the Soul Reapers or the Quincys.

72
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:29,941
But it was so long
ago that I don't

73
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:31,374
see how it matters anymore.

74
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:34,641
But I'll tell you one thing
I know for sure, Uryu,

75
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:35,941
your methods are completely--

76
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:37,841
URYU (OFFSCREEN): That's
all ancient history.

77
00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:38,807
-Huh?

78
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,174
-I don't care about
some slaughter

79
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,407
that happened 200 years ago.

80
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,374
It's just one more fact
that was passed down

81
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:46,741
to me from my sensei.

82
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:48,407
In fact, when I
heard that story,

83
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:50,141
I think I sided more
with the Soul Reapers

84
00:05:50,174 --> 00:05:52,674
than I did with the Quincys.

85
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:55,207
That is, until my
sensei was murdered.

86
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,607
SENSEI (OFFSCREEN):
After much thought,

87
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:03,041
I must conclude that in
the end, the Quincy had

88
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:05,574
only themselves to
blame for failing

89
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:08,774
to heed the warnings
of the Soul Reapers.

90
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,374
URYU (OFFSCREEN):
But why, Sensei?

91
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:12,407
How can you say that when
it was the Quincys that

92
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:13,607
were wiped out?

93
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,474
-It does seem cruel.

94
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:18,007
So many lives were
cut short so young.

95
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,074
But the memory of those
souls who are lost

96
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:24,407
is what is important now, and
to worry about who was right

97
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,674
and who was wrong
is meaningless.

98
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:30,207
We must do all we
can, Uryu, to prevent

99
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:32,607
such a tragedy from
ever happening again.

100
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:36,407
That is the lesson I want you to
learn so that such sadness will

101
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,474
never again occur in the lives
of humans or Soul Reapers.

102
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:47,374
-He was a kind, gentle man
with no hatred in his heart.

103
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,341
To the very end, he tried
to convince the Soul Reapers

104
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:52,941
that Quincys were necessary.

105
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:56,141
He kept encouraging
them to work together,

106
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:59,174
suggesting new ways
to fight the Hollows.

107
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:01,274
But the Soul Reapers
always had the same answer

108
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:03,941
to his efforts-- don't
interfere with our work.

109
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:10,107
Then one day five Hollows
appeared and surrounded sensei.

110
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:12,507
It was obvious that he
couldn't take them on his own,

111
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:16,974
and yet not one Soul
Reaper came to his aid.

112
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:19,274
They knew about the Hollows.

113
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:21,041
Sensei was under
constant surveillance,

114
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,207
and yet it was two hours
before they finally arrived.

115
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:27,141
If only they had
listened to his advice.

116
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:30,174
If only they had
heeded his warning.

117
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,974
Then he wouldn't
have been alone.

118
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:34,174
Help would have
reached him in time,

119
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:37,074
and sensei wouldn't
have wound up dead.

120
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:41,141
Now do you understand,
Ichigo Kurosaki?

121
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:43,174
That's the reason that
this is so important,

122
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:45,541
why I have to prove to you
and to all Soul Reapers

123
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:47,407
the superior strength
of the Quincy.

124
00:07:50,474 --> 00:07:52,374
I realized that our
methods are different,

125
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:55,441
that our ways of thinking
are at opposite poles,

126
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,441
so if you really
believe my way is wrong,

127
00:07:57,474 --> 00:08:00,041
then stay back and watch.

128
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,941
Watch and witness
the true power of--

129
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:04,641
-Shut up already.

130
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:06,774
-What is your problem?

131
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:08,207
-You messed up your own story.

132
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:09,807
Your sensei wouldn't
want you to prove

133
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:11,507
the strength of the Quincys.

134
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,707
You said it yourself.

135
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:14,774
His greatest hope was for
Quincys and Soul Reapers

136
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,141
to work together.

137
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:18,507
Isn't that right?

138
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,174
Come on, think about it.

139
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:22,007
When will you ever
have a better chance

140
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,207
to do that then right here
surrounded by enemies?

141
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:27,141
You say we're at
opposite poles, but I

142
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,174
say when two warriors
are heavily outnumbered,

143
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:31,841
the trick is to
fight back to back.

144
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:32,574
-Very well.

145
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:44,274
-Now that was nice.

146
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:45,607
-I didn't do it for you.

147
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:47,741
I only did It because they
were about to attack me.

148
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:48,574
-So what?

149
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:49,941
That's all right.

150
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,574
It's kill or be killed.

151
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:54,141
What's more important
here is, together

152
00:08:54,174 --> 00:08:55,641
we can kill a lot more.

153
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:58,941
Isn't that a good enough
reason for us to join forces?

154
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:02,407
After all, we both share the
same single-minded purpose.

155
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,074
We both have reasons to want
to destroy as many Hollows

156
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,807
as we can.

157
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:10,741
-You know my reason,
but what's yours?

158
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:13,707
-My mother was
killed by a Hollow.

159
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:15,574
-[gasps].

160
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:17,774
-I'm sure you'll agree
that's enough of a reason

161
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,374
all by itself, but there's
still more to it than that.

162
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,141
After all the
agony I suffered, I

163
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:26,641
want to make sure others
don't suffer the way I did.

164
00:09:26,674 --> 00:09:29,241
My father and my sisters
went through so much pain

165
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:31,207
after mom was killed.

166
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:33,207
It was so hard for me to watch.

167
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:40,207
That's something I don't
ever want to see again,

168
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:42,874
that sadness in their faces.

169
00:09:42,907 --> 00:09:44,641
-So that such sadness
will never again

170
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:47,974
occur in the lives of
humans or Soul Reapers.

171
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:50,274
-I'm not a superhero.

172
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:53,774
I know that I can't protect
everybody in the world,

173
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:56,174
but that doesn't mean
I'm gonna be content

174
00:09:56,207 --> 00:10:00,241
protecting only the people I
can hold in my arms either.

175
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:03,941
I am going to protect as many
people as I possibly can.

176
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:06,841
Your method of using bait to
deliberately draw Hollows here

177
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,974
just to prove a point is only
endangering innocent lives.

178
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:11,941
I don't agree with
that, but right now

179
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:13,841
is not the time for arguments.

180
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:17,141
We've got to work
together, you and me.

181
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:19,707
So what do you say?

182
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:21,974
URYU (OFFSCREEN): What do I say?

183
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:26,341
I think you talk too much, but
I understand what you're saying.

184
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:28,174
I have to help you
survive this battle

185
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:31,641
or you won't be around
for me to kick your butt.

186
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:32,674
-Sounds like a plan.

187
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,374
-What the--?

188
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:01,174
Ichigo?

189
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,141
-Huh?

190
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:05,141
-Look at the sky.

191
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:07,107
-What's that?

192
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:08,541
URYU (OFFSCREEN):
I-- I don't know.

193
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:23,122
-Oh, no, is that
what I think it is?

194
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:27,855
It can't be.

195
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,255
-What is that huge thing?

196
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,855
Tell me.

197
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:34,855
-That's not your everyday,
garden variety Hollow

198
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:38,355
-That little bit of bait I used
can't possibly have drawn this.

199
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:42,188
-Maybe not, but it's here.

200
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:42,822
Here they come.

201
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:52,622
-I'm sorry we're so late.

202
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:53,722
-We just love the triple.

203
00:11:57,922 --> 00:12:01,488
-I thought you might need a
little assistance, Ichigo.

204
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:02,288
-Mr. Hat-and-Clogs.

205
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:14,055
-And if you don't mind me making
a suggestion, why don't my crew

206
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:18,155
and I take care of these
small fries for you, Ichigo,

207
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:21,388
while you go concentrate
on that big guy?

208
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:24,822
Oh, uh, you should probably get
started before it's too late.

209
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:31,188
-Menos Grande.

210
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:32,455
-Menos what?

211
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:35,555
-It's a huge Hollow, born
from hundreds and hundreds

212
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,322
of Hollows mixed and folded
and crushed together.

213
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:41,955
Until now, I've never seen
it except for illustrations

214
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:43,222
in textbooks.

215
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,488
Menos Grande.

216
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:47,855
I don't know what we can do.

217
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:51,655
Only one group can handle this
thing, the Royal Special Task

218
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,988
Force.

219
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,322
Menos Grande is way too much
for any single Soul Reaper.

220
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:04,388
-That thing is too big
for any of our weapons.

221
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:07,522
-Ha, just because it's overfed
doesn't change anything.

222
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,355
We're just gonna have
to chop a little more.

223
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,622
-Chop?

224
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:13,222
-Yep, and the bigger they
are, the harder they fall.

225
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:14,322
Come on.

226
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:16,722
Together, we'll take
that ugly sucker down.

227
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,722
Let's go, Uryu.

228
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,755
-Ichigo, don't be crazy.

229
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:22,322
-Ichigo?

230
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:24,488
Ichigo, stop.

231
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:27,422
You two aren't enough to
go up against Menos Grande.

232
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:27,855
Huh?

233
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:33,855
-Urahara, are you trying to
get Ichigo killed out there?

234
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:34,955
-Of course not.

235
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:35,922
Just watch.

236
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:39,422
There is a method to my madness.

237
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,722
This is a battle
that must be fought.

238
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,822
-(SUFFERING) This
is a binding spell.

239
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,822
-It is for Ichigo, and
for you too, Rukia.

240
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:02,188
-I told you that would happen.

241
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:07,488
Dammit.

242
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:08,355
Hey, Ichigo.

243
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:10,188
So can you get up?

244
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:11,955
-Sure, I'm good as new.

245
00:14:11,988 --> 00:14:14,655
-That was the dumbest charge
I think I've ever seen.

246
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:15,822
What were you thinking?

247
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,622
Did you actually
think that would work?

248
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:19,355
-Huh?

249
00:14:19,388 --> 00:14:21,588
-Well, I figured if I
just kept chopping away

250
00:14:21,622 --> 00:14:24,455
at him like a giant tree,
I'd eventually bring him

251
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,555
down to the point where I
could whack him on the head.

252
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:29,222
-I can't believe
you're acting like this

253
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:31,788
is some kind of
little kid's game.

254
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,022
Now, get up and let's
try a different strategy.

255
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:38,422
[groaning]

256
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:39,188
-What is this?

257
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:45,088
There's power flowing
into me from his sword.

258
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:47,988
This must be Ichigo's power.

259
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,988
What'll I try next?

260
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,255
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Ichigo, look.

261
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:52,722
-Huh?

262
00:14:52,755 --> 00:14:54,455
What did you do, Uryu?

263
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:56,055
How did you bow get so big?

264
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:57,588
-Just be quiet and listen.

265
00:14:57,622 --> 00:15:00,122
I think there actually may be
a way we can defeat this thing.

266
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:01,355
Are you ready to do it?

267
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:07,455
CHAD (OFFSCREEN):
Orihime, do you

268
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:09,555
see Ichigo and Uryu next to him?

269
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:10,722
-Yes.

270
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:18,655
Mr. Urahara said to
watch from here, so-- uh.

271
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:22,122
Does he mean we should
so when the time comes,

272
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:26,955
we'll be able to choose
the path we'll walk?

273
00:15:26,988 --> 00:15:30,455
The truth is, I' haven't
forgotten a single thing that

274
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:31,688
happened that horrible night.

275
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,722
But having seen my brother
as a monster, and Ichigo

276
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:36,522
trying to kill each
other, it would

277
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:39,222
be easier if I could forget.

278
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:40,022
Chad?

279
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:41,322
-Huh?

280
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:45,222
-Well, what are we
supposed to do now.

281
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:47,688
-Hmm.

282
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:51,655
-Now, we are ready
to fight that thing.

283
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:52,488
-You're not serious?

284
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:53,722
This won't work.

285
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:54,622
-Quiet.

286
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:55,988
Just do what I say.

287
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,955
You've got to release
all of your spirit energy

288
00:15:57,988 --> 00:15:59,755
at once while we're connected.

289
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:01,822
That way, I should be
able to harness the power

290
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:03,255
and shoot an enormous arrow.

291
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,288
It's the best way to
use all of your energy.

292
00:16:05,322 --> 00:16:07,088
Right now, you're
just wasting it.

293
00:16:07,122 --> 00:16:09,822
-Well, you don't have to
be so insulting about it.

294
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:12,288
-Argh, quick taking things so
personally and just release

295
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:14,488
that energy already.

296
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:16,088
-How do I do that?

297
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:17,588
-You mean to tell
me you don't know?

298
00:16:17,622 --> 00:16:19,788
What's been your method for
battling with the Hollows

299
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:21,622
all this time?

300
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:23,822
-Just instinct.

301
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:24,822
-Just instinct?

302
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:26,955
But that's impossible.

303
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:30,055
-I never did really
understand that stuff.

304
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:31,755
I figured my spirit
energy was pretty much

305
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:33,788
always at its maximum level.

306
00:16:38,722 --> 00:16:39,655
[cracking noises]

307
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:47,022
-Oh, no.

308
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:48,222
the Cero.

309
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:51,622
Does he intend to release
a Doom Blast right here?

310
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:53,855
You've got to run, both of you.

311
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,555
If you're hit by that, there'll
be nothing left of you.

312
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:57,522
-This will work.

313
00:16:57,555 --> 00:16:59,022
I'm sure of it.

314
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:06,422
-Ichigo, grab that
sword and let's do it.

315
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:08,022
I meant let's do it together.

316
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:22,255
What's he doing?

317
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:29,222
I'm feeling extraordinary
spiritual pressure.

318
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:30,955
Ichigo's power, it's
actually increasing.

319
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:36,088
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): I figured
my spirit energy was pretty much

320
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,388
always at its maximum level.

321
00:17:38,422 --> 00:17:39,822
-But there's no way that can be.

322
00:17:39,855 --> 00:17:41,855
If someone's spirit energy
was always at maximum,

323
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:44,055
it would all drain
away in no time,

324
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:46,022
no matter how much he had.

325
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:49,422
Ichigo says he can't control
the spirit energy at all.

326
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:50,988
He must have an
incredible amount

327
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:56,055
to let it spill out the way
he does and still have more.

328
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:58,655
It's like a faucet
that's been left turned

329
00:17:58,688 --> 00:17:59,922
on with the water gushing out.

330
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,455
Most people will
quickly turn it off,

331
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:05,622
but if Ichigo were to do that,
if his spirit energy were

332
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:08,455
to stay bottled up, then
soon the spirit pressure

333
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,755
would begin to skyrocket,
just like it is now.

334
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:13,855
And then, if through
some incident,

335
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:16,188
that pressure were to
be suddenly released--

336
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:16,688
-[grunts].

337
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:28,022
-I think it's time.

338
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:28,522
-[grunts].

339
00:18:51,222 --> 00:18:52,588
-He cut it open.

340
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:56,255
-Menos is retreating.

341
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:09,422
-I win!

342
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:10,922
-What in the world is he?

343
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:12,222
-Well done.

344
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,888
Now I can understand
why the boss

345
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:16,755
has been keeping
an eye on this one.

346
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,988
[thunder]

347
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:21,522
-Well, what's the matter, Uryu.

348
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:23,755
You don't have anything to say?

349
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,988
I just saved your butt and
cleaned up your mess too.

350
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:29,655
It seems like you could
at least say thank you,

351
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:31,855
or congratulations or something.

352
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:33,955
That's weird.

353
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:35,188
(STRUGGLING) I can't move.

354
00:19:43,922 --> 00:19:44,855
What's happening?

355
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,488
-The zanpakuto,
it's breaking down.

356
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,588
-Ichigo released all his
spirit energy at one time.

357
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:56,255
It looks like it's put way
too much strain on his body.

358
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:02,255
-I've got to do something
before it's too late.

359
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:08,122
[grunts]

360
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:09,388
I must endure the pain.

361
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:16,955
I think I can save
him if I can really

362
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:20,855
Ichigo's out of control spirit
energy bit by bit by firing

363
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,855
arrows until his energy
level stabilizes.

364
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:34,722
-What do you think
you're doing this?

365
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:36,288
-Shut up.

366
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:39,222
-But Uryu, your arm
is getting torn apart.

367
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:40,722
-I said, shut up.

368
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:42,755
How many times do
I have to tell you?

369
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:44,688
I have to make sure
you survive so I

370
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:46,655
have someone to
pummel in the future.

371
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:50,455
Stay alive, Soul Reaper, so I
can beat the hell out of you,

372
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:53,055
and so you can try to do
the same to me, Ichigo.

373
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,355
[grunts]

374
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:58,822
Dammit.

375
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:01,022
My need to prove myself
against Soul Reapers

376
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,688
is responsible for all of this.

377
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,288
Forgive me, sensei.

378
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:07,688
I've always blamed Soul
Reapers for your death,

379
00:21:07,722 --> 00:21:10,022
just so I could
avoid blaming myself

380
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:13,122
because I wasn't willing to
risk my life to save you.

381
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:16,555
But I know you never
hated Soul Reapers.

382
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:18,722
Your sincerest wish was for
Quincys and Soul Reapers

383
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,888
to join together.

384
00:21:20,922 --> 00:21:24,255
So today, I'm going to
save a Soul Reaper's life.

385
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:26,655
I'm a weak disciple,
sensei, a weak apprentice

386
00:21:26,688 --> 00:21:29,788
unable to give his life for you.

387
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,022
Can you ever forgive
me, grandfather?

388
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:37,722
-How am I supposed
to beat up that guy?

389
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,355
He's just so pathetic.

390
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:53,581
[music playing]

391
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:52,521
-Hey, how are you?

392
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:54,121
I'm Kon, the superstar
of the world of Bleach.

393
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:55,654
And I've got good
news, because right

394
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:57,588
after this comes my
own brand-new special.

395
00:22:57,621 --> 00:22:59,221
Even the Soul
Society is shocked.

396
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:00,788
Mr. Kon's Soul
Reapers Dictionary

397
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,221
is about to start,
so stay tuned.

398
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:02,988
Ow.

399
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:03,921
-I've never heard of that.

400
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:05,788
-No, it's not for
real this time.
