1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,333
[grunting]

2
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:14,135
Shorty! Shorty! Shorty!
Shorty! Shorty! Shorty!
Shorty! Shorty! Shorty!

3
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:02,289
Let's go.

4
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:07,923
[yelling]

5
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:11,823
[grunting]

6
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,323
[growling]

7
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:51,756
Come on, Sosuke...
Let's settle this now.

8
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:06,196
Looks like I missed.

9
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:09,829
What are you talking
about? You obviously
hit me.

10
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:20,296
Komamura.

11
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,029
I'm sorry to interfere,
Captain Komamura.

12
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,796
I beg you, sir... Please
let me join you in this
battle.

13
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:38,363
Shuhei!

14
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:46,029
Mashiro... Super Kick!

15
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:54,496
Oh, my...

16
00:03:54,896 --> 00:04:00,796
That girl defeated Fura
with little effort. You
know, I feel somewhat
sorry for Wonderweiss.

17
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:03,403
He really cared for that
thing.

18
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:07,303
Ahhhh...

19
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:09,836
Mashiro...!

20
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:12,136
Ahhhh!!!!

21
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:14,636
...Drop kick!

22
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:18,236
Ahhhh!!!

23
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:25,503
Well... so
much for him.

24
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,003
Yeah! Victory!

25
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:36,469
Hmph!

26
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:42,303
Hey...

27
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:43,903
I need to talk to you.

28
00:04:44,003 --> 00:04:46,903
How 'bout later? I'm
kinda tied up now.

29
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:50,803
And if you're still
harping about who we are
and where we came from,
forget it!

30
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:54,769
Don't worry. I don't
care about that anymore.

31
00:04:55,103 --> 00:04:59,036
The fact of the matter
is, I need to ask if
you'll do me a favor.

32
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:03,743
Can I leave her to you?
I would help, but...

33
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:06,843
I want to... go and
confront Sosuke.

34
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,409
Um... Is that all right?

35
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:17,609
All right? What are
you, stupid? We came
here to take Sosuke's
ass out, and instead we

36
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:20,943
saw you guys getting
slaughtered, so we
decided to step in and
help you, even though

37
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:25,076
some of us thought it
was a bad idea! So why
should we let you fight
Sosuke first?

38
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:27,009
You're right. I
shouldn't have asked.

39
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:30,476
Forget what I just said.
I was being too impatient.

40
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:33,276
Forget it? That's all
you have to say? How
'bout 'I'm sorry'?

41
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,809
I'd like to hear an
apology from that big
mouth of yours!

42
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,676
Sorry.

43
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,143
Huh! What was that? I
can't hear you?!

44
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:40,009
Sorry.

45
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:40,976
A little louder?!

46
00:05:41,076 --> 00:05:42,209
Sorry.

47
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,543
What kind of an apology
is that? There's no
feeling in it!

48
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:46,476
That's all you're
getting, so live with it!

49
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:49,976
Hmpf! Apart from that,
what's a kid like you
doing in a captain's
uniform?

50
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:51,609
Are you really a
Captain?!

51
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:54,576
From the way you fight,
it's hard to believe anyone
would promote you to that rank!

52
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:56,209
I said I was
sorry. Let it go.

53
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:59,276
You think you're hot
stuff because you were
able to become a
Captain? Well, you

54
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:01,916
don't impress me at all!
I've seen newbies who
fight better than you!

55
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:03,783
You're too height
challenged to wear
the uniform!

56
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:09,349
Shorty! Shorty! Shorty!
Shorty! Shorty! Shorty!
Shorty! Shorty! Shorty!
Shorty! Shorty! Shorty!

57
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:13,049
What do you mean,
'shorty'?! You're
short!

58
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:14,916
What?

59
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:17,183
You're shorter than me,
so shut up, you shrimp!

60
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:21,416
Who you calling a shrimp,
you hair-ball?! You want
to fight? If you want a
fight, I'll give it to ya!

61
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:24,649
You're the one who's
trying to pick a fight!
I just wanted to apologize
to you,

62
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:26,549
but you insist on
not letting it go!

63
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:29,316
Oh! Now you're touching
me!

64
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:33,983
Is that what this has all
been about from the beginning?
Are you just a pervert?!

65
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,849
A pervert?! I can't
belie---? What did you
just call me?!

66
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:39,316
Pervert! Pervert! Pervert!
Pervert! Pervert! Pervert!

67
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,749
Shut up! How dare you
say that, you little
brat!

68
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:44,183
Oh, you can't keep your
hands off me, can you,
you pervert?!

69
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:45,616
<i>That's enough from both</i>
<i>of you!</i>

70
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:47,016
Huh?

71
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:51,849
Don't over-react It's
okay to be interested
in a girl's body.

72
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,583
That's not what happened!

73
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:54,883
I'll give you some
privacy...

74
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:56,916
What?! Don't leave me
alone with him!

75
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:04,456
You're taking me on by
yourself?

76
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:08,089
I was under the
impression I was going to
fight three against one.

77
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:11,656
That's interesting. You
see, I was thinking...

78
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:13,423
...the same thing!

79
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:17,889
Damn! We'll settle this
later.

80
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:19,189
Let's go!

81
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,056
Fine.

82
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:29,623
[gasping]

83
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:34,489
It's finally three
against one.

84
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:36,956
I like those odds.

85
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:41,556
He looks strong---I'll
give him that.

86
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:44,756
Are you both sure...
you want to remove your
masks?

87
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:49,123
We can only wear them for
three minutes. It's a
hero's handicap.

88
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:52,156
So if you're ready...
Let's begin.

89
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:02,163
Damn! That gun he's
carrying can fire Ceros.

90
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:10,729
Stop dodging! Stand
still and take it like
a man!

91
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:13,563
Ouch! Now why did you go
and do that, Stark?

92
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:17,896
I can't hit the things
I'm shooting at, when
you're blabbering like
that.

93
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:21,396
Well if you weren't so
busy holding onto my
butt, maybe you could aim
better!

94
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:24,863
I told you before, I
can't tell where your
butt is on this thing!

95
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:29,396
Yeah, like I'm supposed
to believe that! Hey,
quit squeezing so hard!

96
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:31,029
Are we interrupting?

97
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:40,296
And who might you be?

98
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:48,429
That's what I want to
know! Who is this guy?!
He's absolutely huge!!

99
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:53,063
Not to mention the fact
that he's super strong!

100
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:55,729
It's been a while, hasn't
it...

101
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,529
...Miss Soi Fon?

102
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:05,436
What?! Wait a minute,
Captain, you know this guy?
Why didn't you say something
to me earlier?!

103
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:09,769
You should have told
me! I thought he was
just some stranger who
butted into our fight--

104
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:15,469
I don't know him. I've
never seen him before.

105
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:21,603
I should have expected
you wouldn't acknowledge
our acquaintanceship.

106
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:27,469
I'm aware that you've
never thought very highly
of any of us. I suppose
it's only natural.

107
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,669
Huh?

108
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:33,003
<i>You are wasting time.</i>

109
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:40,436
It doesn't matter who you
are, or what powers you
have. All those things
are meaningless to me.

110
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:46,669
You are all equally
helpless against my
power.

111
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:52,403
Now then... Turn to bones
and perish.

112
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,936
Respira!

113
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,243
Kido.

114
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:10,776
I know you have the
lethal power... to
rapidly age anything
you can touch.

115
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,609
That is the reason I have
come to confront you.

116
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:23,343
Your powers are
ineffective unless they
can make contact.

117
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:26,643
I have nothing to
fear from anything
you posses.

118
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:31,376
Yeah! Amazing! This
guy refuses to be
intimidated!

119
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:35,309
I see....

120
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:40,576
Don't bother, you
cannot escape.

121
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:47,409
[gasping]

122
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:50,609
We're all screwed!

123
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,443
Shut up, Marechiyo!

124
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:56,976
What?! That barrier
can't be breached!

125
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:13,965
Shuhei...

126
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:19,731
He's in no condition to
return to the battlefield
yet.

127
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:27,031
It's obvious he's
pushing himself.

128
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:30,498
It's been a while, hasn't
it... Captain Tosen.

129
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:38,298
I'm here... to thank
you.

130
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:44,631
Interesting choice of
words...

131
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:48,298
Are you being sarcastic?

132
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:54,065
Not at all. I came here
today to thank you for
everything you've taught
me.

133
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:02,731
I'm truly grateful. I've
learned so much from you.

134
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:09,038
And now, I'm going to use
every skill you've ever
taught me in the past...

135
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:13,871
...to open your eyes, to
appeal to your sense of
honor...

136
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:17,538
...and bring you back
into the Soul Society.

137
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:24,638
You're going to make
me... come back... to
my senses?

138
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,338
You haven't changed...

139
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:30,871
...Suzumushi.

140
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:42,405
Shuhei... I thought I
told you... Those who
do not know fear, have
no right to fight.

141
00:12:44,538 --> 00:12:47,338
Like I said before,
you haven't changed
at all.

142
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:53,138
Even as you stand there
to confront me, your
words don't have a shred
of fear in them.

143
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:06,511
He's right behind you,
Shuhei!

144
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:17,778
[struggling]

145
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:21,178
You do not understand the
true meaning of fear.

146
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:22,711
You can't defeat me.

147
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,011
[grunting]

148
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:57,045
Listen, you shorty,
stop gettin' in my way!

149
00:13:57,145 --> 00:14:00,911
You should be glad I was
in your way! You can't
even thank me for saving
you!

150
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:04,518
Who told you to save
me?! I certainly didn't!
You messed up my attack!

151
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:06,118
Are you crazy?!

152
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:22,251
Halibel's not holding
anything back while
fighting those three...

153
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:24,451
Wouldn't you agree?

154
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:30,218
And here I thought I
could ambush you...

155
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:35,418
You see everything. No
matter. I guess...

156
00:14:35,518 --> 00:14:37,618
...we'll just have to
fight head-on.

157
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:44,318
You ready, Sosuke?

158
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:59,818
Foolish pests! Did
you think that your
Kido would not age?

159
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:08,258
Your minds work in such
limited, pathetic ways.
Humans die, animals die,
plants die---

160
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:11,158
even Soul Reapers die!

161
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:17,891
It's the arc of the
universe. Everything that
comes to life, eventually
ceases to exist.

162
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:24,658
And if men's creations
grow old. The the Kido
of the Soul Reapers do
as well.

163
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:33,991
There may be a Kido that
can last for a thousand
years, but there is no Kido
that can exist for eternity.

164
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:42,925
And it is no surprise,
because the concept of
eternity is an absurd notion
born out of the fear of aging.

165
00:15:43,891 --> 00:15:48,458
We've got to get out of
here right now, Captain!
We're just no match for
this guy!

166
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:52,625
Let's swallow our pride
and get help from the
others before this guy
reduces us to--

167
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:56,725
Would you shut
up, Marechiyo?!

168
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:07,365
I'm starting to become
bored with your timidity
and lack of strength.
Let's end this now.

169
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:14,998
Now then... Perish!

170
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,765
[screaming]

171
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,598
This won't stop me!

172
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:39,531
The head, unable to
retreat, falls slowly and
surely into the depths of
the bottomless ocean, and

173
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:44,231
atones for its sins in
bolts of blue, white,
black, and red.

174
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:49,998
I see what you're
attempting. You're adding
chants to your Kido,
strengthening the barrier

175
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:54,865
originally created
without incantation. A
very clever maneuver,

176
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:57,631
but you're not going
to make it in time!

177
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:00,431
Gate of the Dragon Tail!

178
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:14,605
Last one! This
completes it!

179
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:29,638
Hmm... a very
impressive trick.

180
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:34,371
Help me, Soi Fon! Please
lend me your strength!

181
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,905
Huh? The Captain's
strength?

182
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:41,905
That is correct. I need
to borrow the power of
her Bankai!

183
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:43,538
[gasping]

184
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:49,771
The only way you could
know about my Bankai is
through Kisuke Urahara.

185
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:53,105
That man... never
ceases to annoy me.

186
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:57,871
Believe me, I can
understand your not

187
00:17:57,971 --> 00:18:01,238
wanting to work with
anybody associated with
Mr. Urahara...

188
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:03,405
But this is an emergency
situation!

189
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:06,611
And it's vital that you
find a way to get over
your bitterness!

190
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:12,678
[groaning]

191
00:18:12,778 --> 00:18:14,678
Very well, then.

192
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:18,111
Listen. I'm prepared to
offer you a deal.

193
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,411
Yeah? What kind
of deal?

194
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:28,411
What a waste of energy!

195
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:33,878
Even something as
elaborate as this, is only
going to buy you a little
time.

196
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,478
Now rot!

197
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:50,411
Gate of the Tiger Fang!

198
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:54,511
Gate of the Turtle Armor!

199
00:18:57,245 --> 00:18:59,045
Gate of the Phoenix
Wing!

200
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:17,118
Shiju Saimon!

201
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:28,885
[breathing hard]

202
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:34,151
[laughing]

203
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:35,351
How absurd!

204
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:40,085
You think this structure
can contain me?! You're
deluded!

205
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:43,285
It will barely slow me
down!

206
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:46,118
[laughing]

207
00:19:48,285 --> 00:19:56,185
Buying time against me,
the master of aging... is
like spitting on a god.

208
00:19:56,285 --> 00:20:01,751
Though, perhaps I
should praise you for
doing your best.

209
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:08,291
You're missing the point.
That barrier is not actually
meant to contain you.

210
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:10,425
Hm?! What?

211
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:24,025
Do you remember? You
avoided Captain Soi Fon's
Bankai by releasing your
aging powers, which

212
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:30,258
caused it to detonate
before it struck. At the
same time, you directed
the blast away from you.

213
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:37,725
I asked myself a simple
question.

214
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:41,358
If you were in a place
where you couldn't escape
the force of a blast...

215
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:46,091
...and if you were also
at a distance where your
aging powers could not
reach us...

216
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:47,391
Hm?!

217
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:52,825
...then what would happen
to you?

218
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:56,358
You... bastards!!

219
00:20:57,725 --> 00:20:59,291
Repeat your promise.

220
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:03,898
Tomorrow, you'll trap
Kisuke Urahara in one
of your barriers for
a full month.

221
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:05,865
Oh, I promise.

222
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:07,798
Good.

223
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:11,231
You'll pay for this, you
Worms!

224
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:14,231
Jakuho Raikouben!

225
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:19,731
See ya.

226
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:27,465
[screaming]

227
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:37,298
Oh, dear...

228
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:40,898
It looks like another one
of your friends has gone
down in flames.

229
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:57,798
I salute you, king of
Hueco Mundo...

230
00:21:57,898 --> 00:22:00,331
...and offer my deepest
condolences.

231
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:50,833
Decay is my companion.
The world is my servant.

232
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:56,800
We have an appointment,
you and I. As crows pick
away at this body,

233
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,433
I'll be waiting for
you at the elm mansion!
