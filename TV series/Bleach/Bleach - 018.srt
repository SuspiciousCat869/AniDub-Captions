ICHIGO (IN HEAD): Nothing
feels real to me now.

3
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:57,461
It doesn't feel real
being here in school,

4
00:01:57,494 --> 00:02:00,661
that I was beaten up and
almost killed by those two guys

5
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:02,927
from the Soul Society.

6
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:09,094
And the strangest thing of all
is that she isn't here anymore.

7
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:10,961
Not a single one
of my classmates

8
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:15,994
even remembers that
Rukia ever existed.

-Man, are you still
doing that stupid laugh?

11
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:22,627
You're just jealous
because I can

12
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:24,761
imitate the coolest guy on TV.

13
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:27,561
-Have you made any plans
for the summer yet, Orihime?

14
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:29,527
-Nope, I don't have a clue.

15
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:30,694
-Here's a great idea.

16
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:32,294
You should stay the
summer at my house.

17
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:35,061
My parents will be on vacation,
and it'll be just you and me.

18
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:36,761
-Oh no you don't.

19
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:38,061
-Well, why not?

20
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:39,361
It's not like I'm inviting
her to take a bath with me.

ICHIGO (IN HEAD): Is
this what it really

22
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,327
means to be returned
to the Soul Society?

23
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:46,294
You just disappear from
this world completely?

24
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:49,694
You're erased from
people's memories?

25
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:54,361
Every trace of Rukia is
vanishing right before my eyes,

26
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:57,061
fading away into white.

And for some reason,

00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:19,427
Uryu, the one person I
thought might remember Rukia,

36
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:21,494
decided to cut the
last day of school.

KEIGO (OFFSCREEN): Ichigo, ha,
round and around and around

38
00:03:25,761 --> 00:03:26,827
you go.

39
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:31,061
Now then, see if you
can hit the watermelon.

40
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:32,561
Nice try, but that was my melon.

41
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:34,327
It's OK though, because
I don't need a head

42
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:35,661
to think about anything anymore.

43
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:38,061
School's out for summer,
and summer means the sea.

44
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:40,794
And the sea is where we're all
going because I, Keigo Asano,

45
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:43,627
have planned a super
trip for us to the beach.

46
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:45,861
Ten fun-filled days of
sunbathing, swimming, fireworks

47
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:49,361
and lots of unsupervised and
questionable activities, right?

48
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:52,027
-Sorry, but I'm afraid I've
already made other plans?

49
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:53,127
-Huh?

50
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:55,261
-I'm not too keen on
the ocean either, Keigo.

51
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:56,361
-Huh?

52
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:58,794
-I've got the nationals
tournament to go to.

53
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:00,894
-Well, if Orihime and [?
Totski ?] aren't going,

54
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:02,894
then neither am I.

55
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:06,061

things I have to take care of.

-And I'm flying to
Hawaii tomorrow.

58
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:14,527
-What could possibly be better
than going on vacation with me,

59
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,861

00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:17,661
-I'm going o this great trip
to Hawaii with my girlfriend

61
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:20,727
and nine of her friends,
so that's like 11 of us.

62
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,427
-Hawaii?

63
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,727
Just you and 10 girls?

64
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,527
So how'd you forget
to invite me?

65
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,727
How dare you leave me out
of a sweet deal like that.

66
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:28,227
-It wasn't my idea.

67
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:28,927
I promise.

68
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,927
I won't have any fun.

69
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:30,194
I'm not even bringing
a bathing suit.

ICHIGO (IN HEAD):
It feels weird.

Everyone's acting normal.

72
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,827
Our world still
rotates without Rukia.

73
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:43,127
But then why shouldn't it?

74
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:45,961
Rukia's originally
from the Soul Society.

75
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,694
I guess she never really
belonged over here.

76
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:51,194
But what if that's true?

77
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:52,794
What does that mean for me?

78
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:57,827
What do I do now?

-Huh?

00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,594
-Why has everyone
forgotten about her

85
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:15,894
like she never even existed.

86
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:18,494
I need you to explain what's
happening around here.

87
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:26,661
So you're saying Rukia went
back to this other world

88
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,027
she came from?

89
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,427
-Yeah.

90
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:30,261
I gotta admit.

91
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:31,627
I am surprised.

92
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:35,194
I really had no idea you've
been able to see us, Orihime.

93
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:37,361
For how long?

94
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:40,127
-Ever since the incident
with my brother.

95
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:44,794
-Oh, makes sense.

96
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,661
-I don't think I've ever
properly thanked you

for everything you did for him.

98

By guiding his spirit
on the other side,

99
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,961
he's finally in a place
where all he knows

100
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:55,027
is peace and happiness now.

101
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:56,227
Somehow I can just feel it.

102
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:57,527
-Is that so?

103
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,427
-Uh-huh.

104
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:02,327
I imagine Rukia is happy
on the other side as well.

105
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,127
She probably has friends
and family waiting for her.

106
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,127
-I have to go and
bring her back.

107
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:16,127
-But why should you bring her
back if she's happy there.

108
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:17,961
-Because I know she's
in serious trouble,

109
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:20,461
and they just might kill her
if I don't get her out in time.

110
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:28,661
-Here's what the
Ichigo I know would do.

111
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:31,961
Hmm, he'd make a mad face
and tell Rukia she can always

112
00:06:31,994 --> 00:06:34,561
visit with friends and
family later if she lives,

113
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:38,861
but she won't have that
chance if she's dead.

bit more like a grownup?

00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:04,461
How dare you mock me.

161
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:06,694
I could kill you for
an insult like that.

162
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:08,261
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN):
Tell me something.

163
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,327
Am I really going to die, Renji?

164
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:14,727
-Oh, absolutely.

165
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:19,227
For what you did, I expect
you'll be executed immediately.

166
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:21,427
-Very well.

167
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,361
I understand.

168
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:24,327
-Huh?

169
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:25,694
What do you mean you understand?

170
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:26,794
I was just kidding, Rukia.

171
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,127
It was only a joke.

172
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:29,861
-So which one is it, you idiot?

173
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:31,327
-An idiot, huh?

174
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:32,861
If I'm an idiot,
then how come you're

175
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,194
the one locked up in the cell?

176
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:36,661
You're pretty lucky
Captain Kuchiki is probably

177
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:38,927
pleading for clemency
for you even as we speak.

178
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:43,794
-Well, I doubt that.

179
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,194
-How can you say such a thing?

180
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:47,461
A man like Kuchiki would
never stand by and do nothing

181
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:51,394
while his own sister
faces a death sentence.

182
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:53,494
-You're quite
correct about that.

183
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,127
He'd rather kill me himself.

184
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,961
-Huh?

185
00:09:56,994 --> 00:10:01,161
-I know it for certain because
I know full well the kind of man

186
00:10:01,194 --> 00:10:02,594
he is.

187
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:07,027
40 years have passed since I was
taken in by the Kuchiki family,

188
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:11,461
and in all those years, he
has never once looked at me.

189
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:22,775
[dog barking]

190
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:35,042
-No way, this place is amazing.

191
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:37,308
Who would have guessed
that all this time, there

192
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:41,108
was a huge subterranean
training ground under my store?

193
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:42,308
-Oh, forget the acting.

194
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,242
Obviously, you knew this
place was down here,

195
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:47,108
but I will admit
it's impressive.

196
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:49,242
-So then, you wanna
get down to business?

197
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:51,308
-Yeah, let's just
get on with it,

198
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:53,642
this training session
or whatever you call it.

199
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:55,542
-Always be careful
what you ask for.

200
00:10:59,508 --> 00:10:59,975
-[grunts].

201
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:06,175
What's the big idea of knocking
me down like that, you--

202
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,108
[whooshing sound]

203
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:10,508
-It's hard to breathe when
you're in the form of a soul,

204
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:11,908
isn't it, Ichigo?

205
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:13,608
Right now, your
Soul Sleep, which

206
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:15,708
is the wellspring of
your spirit energy,

207
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:19,542
and your Soul Chain, the
booster, have been destroyed.

208
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:22,608
So now, your soul is
like any ordinary human

209
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:24,275
with no spiritual power.

210
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,942
And so before we can
proceed, we must first

211
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:29,808
restore the spiritual
power you have lost.

212
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:31,975
-All right already,
just tell me what to do.

213
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:33,108
-You're so impatient.

214
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:34,808
All right, let's bring
out your opponent,

215
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:36,442
and then we can start.

216
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:38,708
Warrior, are you
ready for battle?

217
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,775
-Nice to see you again, Ichigo.

218
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:48,608
-Huh?

219
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,042
-Here's your first lesson.

220
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,408
You must go up against
Ururu one on one.

221
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:53,208
-Huh?

222
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:54,808
-The rules are quite simple.

223
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:56,708
Lesson one is over
when one of you

224
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:58,975
is no longer able to
continue the match.

225
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:01,842
If you can, I suggest going
for the knockout punch.

226
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,908
-Are you kidding?

227
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:04,808
You expect me to
punch a little girl?

228
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:06,542
-It's always dangerous
to underestimate

229
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:07,475
your opponent, Ichigo.

230
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,908
URURU (OFFSCREEN): Please put
on all this protective gear,

231
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:12,675
Ichigo.

232
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,408
I don't want to kill you.

233
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:16,708
-This whole thing's ridiculous.

234
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:18,308
I'm not fighting her.

235
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:26,908
-We tried to warn
him, didn't we?

236
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:32,142
-So where'd he go?

237
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:33,142
I don't see him anymore.

238
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:35,008
-Do you suppose he's dead?

239
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:36,508
Hard to say.

240
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:37,008
-[grunts].

241
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,742
-It looks like he's
going after her.

242
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:47,575
-Hey, he just ran
right past her.

243
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:49,942
-If little miss muffin
hits me with another punch

244
00:12:49,975 --> 00:12:52,408
like that one, I'll be
taking a long dirt nap.

245
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:55,142
Hat-and-Clog, how do I
put this gear on anyway?

246
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:58,542
-Strap the headgear onto
your forehead, Ichigo.

247
00:12:58,575 --> 00:12:59,275
-Like this?

248
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:00,308
-That's right.

249
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:02,708
Now yell as loud as
you can, "Amazing

250
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:04,008
headband of justice in place.

251
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:06,508
Amazing armor of
justice protect me now."

252
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:07,875
Go on, say it.

253
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:10,542
-The amazing headband of-- what?

254
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:13,508
Ah, that's just stupid.

255
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,375
-Interesting how the
fear of imminent death

256
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:16,542
can change one's mind.

257
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:18,942
-All right, I'll say it.

258
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,975
Here goes nothing.

259
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,808
Amazing headband of
justice in place.

260
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,475
Amazing armor of
justice protect me.

261
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:25,675
-Well, what do you know?

262
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,842
I can't believe he
actually said it.

263
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:28,608
-What?

264
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,508
You're gonna pay for that.

265
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,742
-Look outside behind you.

266
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,042
-Oh, great.

267
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:39,142
All right, bring it.

268
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:40,142
[screams]

269
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:43,042
Amazing armor of justice my ass.

270
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:44,408
More like armor of junk.

271
00:13:44,442 --> 00:13:46,942
Running for my life is the only
thing that's saving my life.

272
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:48,308
ICHIGO (IN HEAD): Wait a minute.

273
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:51,708
If I'm outrunning her, it must
mean my speed has returned.

274
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:53,642
And that means maybe I
can dodge her punches.

275
00:13:57,442 --> 00:13:57,908
-Here goes.

276
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:01,808
-Whoa.

277
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:02,342
-Huh.

278
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,108
-[chuckles].

279
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:06,375
ICHIGO (IN HEAD): I can do it.

280
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:09,942
I won't aim for her face.

281
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,508
I'll just give her a tap on her
headgear to make her back off.

282
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:16,942
And then because of my
size, I can-- oh, damn.

283
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:17,942
I cut her.

284
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:34,275
-Safe.

285
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:41,608
-Hey.

286
00:14:45,575 --> 00:14:47,608
Give me one more
crack at her, please.

287
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:49,375
-Congratulations.

288
00:14:49,408 --> 00:14:51,508
I pronounce lesson one cleared.

289
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,242
-What the hell are
you talking about?

290
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,575
She kicked my ass just now.

291
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:55,875
I lost.

292
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:58,342
-I never said anything about
you having to actually win

293
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,075
the fight in order to
clear the lesson, did I?

294
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,408
-I thought--

295
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,742
-The fact is, Ichigo, Ururu
here has the fighting skills

296
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:07,175
to counter even
full-fledged Soul Reapers.

297
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,108
A mere human would
never have a chance

298
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,775
of defeating her outright.

299
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,675
By the way, are you still
having difficulty breathing?

300
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,908
-No, now that you mention it.

301
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:18,708
-Which means that
we've successfully

302
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:20,575
restored your spirit energy.

303
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:22,342
The entire point
of that lesson was

304
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,042
to determine in
a one-shot battle

305
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:27,508
whether or not you could
dodge Ururu's first attack.

306
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,808
Spirit energy
increases a lot faster

307
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:32,208
when the soul is in
danger of being destroyed.

308
00:15:32,242 --> 00:15:33,908
We just needed to
find out if you'd

309
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:36,375
be able to raise yours fast
enough to dodge that fatal

310
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:37,175
punch.

311
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,542
-And if I hadn't succeeded?

312
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:39,708
-Then you would've died.

313
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:43,308
-Why the hell didn't you
say so in the first place?

314
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,842
-I wasn't worried about it.

315
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,075
I had a lot of faith
that you'd be successful.

316
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,608
-Huh?

317
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:51,508
-Well, so far, so good.

318
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:54,708
Now then, let's celebrate the
return of your spirit energy,

319
00:15:54,742 --> 00:15:55,542
shall we?

320
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:04,775
Now, let's continue
with your second lesson.

321
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:05,975
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Lessons?

322
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,342
-You'll need them if
you want to learn more.

323
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,308
-I suppose I do, but
this all seems so sudden.

324
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:16,075
-Plus, it's a little weird
dealing with a talking cat.

325
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,042
-You think so?

326
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:25,308
-Your friend Ichigo is preparing
to go to the Soul Society.

327
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:27,908
If you also want to learn to
use the new powers awakening

328
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:32,042
inside you, then you will have
to agree to take my lessons.

329
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,475
After that, the choice will be
yours whether you want to go

330
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:35,408
or not.

331
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:39,708
-Well, I'm going to go.

332
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:41,175
-Are you really?

333
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,675
Aren't you scared?

334
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,175
I am.

335
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,642
-Uh-huh.

336
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:51,175
-I won't force you.

337
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:51,675
-Uh-huh.

338
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,108
URYU (IN HEAD):
Excellent, this will

339
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:02,208
be the perfect place for me
to train in complete solitude.

340
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:03,608
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
There he is.

341
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:05,342
We found him.

342
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,675
Hi, Uryu.

343
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,908
Whatcha doing?

344
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:11,408
-I could ask you the
same question, Orihime.

345
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:13,275
So how did the two
of you find me?

346
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:14,608
-Yoruichi.

347
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,842
He just followed your aura,
and it led us right to you.

348
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,242
-Yoruichi?

349
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:20,608
-Did you come out
here to go camping?

350
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:21,675
-Huh?

351
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,908
Not exactly.

352
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,475
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN):
You're training, aren't you?

353
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:25,242
-Huh?

354
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:27,308
Who said that?

355
00:17:27,342 --> 00:17:27,808
Huh?

356
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:28,808
-It was me.

357
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:32,075
I'm right over here.

358
00:17:32,108 --> 00:17:33,342
I'm Yoruichi.

359
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:33,975
-Ah!

360
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:35,475
No, a talking cat.

361
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:36,508
No way!

362
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:37,575
-What?

363
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:39,375
You've never seen a
talking cat before?

364
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:40,908
Honestly, don't be such a wimp.

365
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:43,575
-You are making kind
of a fuss, Uryu.

366
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:44,775
What's the bid deal?

367
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:46,975
-Well, if it makes you
feel any better, Uryu,

368
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:50,008
I'm having a little trouble
with the talking cat myself.

369
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:51,642
-Some humans have
so much trouble

370
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:54,875
adjusting to the unexpected,
especially the males.

371
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,475
-Excuse me.

372
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,208
Why did you come here anyway?

373
00:17:59,242 --> 00:17:59,708
-Actually--

374
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,742
URYU (IN HEAD):
Ichigo is planning

375
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:05,708
on going to the Soul Society?

376
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:09,475
-Yes, he's going to go there
to try to rescue Rukia.

377
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:12,075
We thought you'd want to know
so you could help him too.

378
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:15,475
-What Ichigo does has
nothing to do with me.

379
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:16,975
-But what about Rukia?

380
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:17,975
Her life is in danger.

381
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:19,242
-You're forgetting
that I'm a Quincy,

382
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:21,008
and the whole reason
I'm out here training

383
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:23,708
is that I'm angry I
lost to a Soul Reaper.

384
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:26,475
Rukia doesn't mean
anything to me.

385
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:26,975
-[sighs].

386
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,942
Too bad, but I understand
that you're only

387
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:38,708
doing what you
think is best, Uryu.

388
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:44,042
It's completely confusing
to me at this point,

389
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:45,642
but I'm going to
keep on listening

390
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:48,008
and try to learn all I can
about these changes that

391
00:18:48,042 --> 00:18:49,408
are happening.

392
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:52,208
It's a little scary to have
new powers awakening inside me,

393
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:54,108
but I want to know what
I can do with them.

394
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:01,208
Be careful, Uryu.

395
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,075
URYU (IN HEAD): Sorry
to let you down,

396
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:11,575
Orihime, but this
training is too important.

397
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,275
I can't let anyone see
what I'm about to do.

398
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,842
Please watch over me, sensei.

399
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:32,675
-(STRUGGLING) I feel
like I'm-- I'm dying.

400
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,875
-That's because you are.

401
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:36,142
You see, once the chain
of fate has been severed,

402
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,775
you can no longer return
to your physical body.

403
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,175
Death comes quickly.

404
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,408
-Do you have to be
so casual about it?

405
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,808
-That's not even
the worst of it.

406
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:46,575
Your chain will begin
the encroachment

407
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:47,908
where it was severed.

408
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:50,342
When the end reaches your
chest, you will become a Hollow,

409
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,942
and that will be the end of you.

410
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:55,875
-What do I have to do?

411
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:58,042
-If you don't want
to become a Hollow,

412
00:19:58,075 --> 00:20:00,042
you must become a Soul Reaper.

413
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,042
-Huh?

414
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,542
-If you manage to
clear lesson two,

415
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:04,042
you will find that
in the process,

416
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:07,575
you have regained your former
powers as a Soul Reaper.

417
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:11,908
Of course, which path
you choose is up to you.

418
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:14,075
-As if you even needed to ask.

419
00:20:14,108 --> 00:20:15,242
-All right, then.

420
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:18,642
Let's get this party started.

421
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,308
Go!

422
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:21,808
-[screams].

423
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,042
-Well, what do
you think of that?

424
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:28,875
We really suckered him
that time, didn't we?

425
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:29,708
-Yeah, good one.

426
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:32,075
-That's one deep whole, Ururu.

427
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:33,308
-I do my best.

428
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:34,742
[hitting bottom]

429
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,208
[coughing]

430
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,775
-What the hell have
you done to me?

431
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:49,708
-Bakudo, 99, Part 1 [?
restict. ?] No doubt

432
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:52,775
you think it rather harsh of
me, but until you have cleared

433
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:55,042
this lesson, your arms
must unfortunately

434
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:57,375
remain bound, Ichigo.

435
00:20:57,408 --> 00:20:59,175
-Ah you-- dammit.

436
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,608
HAT-AND-CLOGS
(OFFSCREEN): Ichigo?

437
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:01,975
-Huh?

438
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:05,942
-Start climbing back
up the shaft, Ichigo.

439
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:09,508
That's all there is to this
lesson, otherwise known

440
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:10,808
as the Shattered Shaft.

441
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:13,342
-Yeah, that'll work with my
arms tied behind my back.

442
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,875
HAT-AND-CLOGS
(OFFSCREEN): I wouldn't

443
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:18,375
waste time arguing
about it if I were you.

444
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,808
-[screams].

445
00:21:28,842 --> 00:21:31,375
-You have a period of
72 hours at the bottom

446
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:33,608
of Shattered Shaft, Ichigo.

447
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:35,908
That is how long it'll
take for the chain of fate

448
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:37,608
to be completely encroached.

449
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:39,475
By the end of that
time, if you have not

450
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:42,208
returned to the top of the
shaft as a Soul Reaper,

451
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:44,442
then we will have no choice,
Ichigo, but to kill you.

452
00:21:52,294 --> 00:21:54,227
[music playing]

453
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:55,160
-Hey, Jinta and
Ururu, how quickly

454
00:22:55,194 --> 00:22:58,227
do you think Ichigo can
come back as a Soul Reaper?

455
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,994
-I say five hours.

456
00:23:00,027 --> 00:23:01,494
-More like 12 hours.

457
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:03,760
-I'll bet you 1,000 yen he
never makes it back at all.

458
00:23:03,794 --> 00:23:05,727
-I'll teach you
guys to doubt me.
