1
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:58,109
It's your call.

2
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:01,515
I'm Kugo.

3
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,654
Kugo Ginjo.

4
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:15,677
[Uryu]
He's fast! No ordinary
human can move that fast!

5
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:20,154
I don't see any changes in
the reishi surrounding him.

6
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,460
So then how is he able to
accelerate like that?!

7
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:26,232
Huh?

8
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:30,374
What was that?
A light?!

9
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:32,178
Hm?

10
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:35,350
[gasp]

11
00:02:43,634 --> 00:02:46,841
- Oh!
- Look at that guy!
- Messed up!

12
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:48,879
- What happened?
- Did you see it?

13
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:54,423
[ambulence driving off]

14
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,828
I suppose there's no point
in worrying about stuff.

15
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:09,889
[Keigo]
Oh well, it's just
you and me today.

16
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,895
Hey, if it bugs you
that much I'll leave.

17
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:14,197
No! Don't do that!

18
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:17,471
Guess I'm just wonderin'
if Ichigo's okay.

19
00:03:17,504 --> 00:03:20,944
I'm sure he's okay.
Something must've
just come up for him
at the last minute.

20
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:22,314
"Come up"...?

21
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:25,754
[Keigo]
You mean like that big
fight he had with the gang
who came looking for him

22
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:28,726
or when he got kidnapped
by that crazy boss of his?

23
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:33,871
Fighting, having a job.
He sure is living the
teen life big time.

24
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:38,346
What the?! Getting
kidnapped's his job?!
That's "living the life"?!?

25
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,751
Sounds more like
planning an
early death!

26
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,524
Hm?

27
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:45,928
Huh? What is it?

28
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:48,934
I've got this feeling
somebody's following us.

29
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:54,880
"Following us"? Why
in the world would
anyone be after us?
We're not Ichigo!

30
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:56,550
Look out! Move!!

31
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:57,753
Hnh?
Hnh?

32
00:03:57,753 --> 00:03:58,487
Waagh!

33
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,226
Aah! Aaaah! Ahhhh!

34
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:09,243
That sure
was close.

35
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:10,879
I think I
peed my
pants.

36
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:13,385
Damn! Hey are you
kids all right?!

37
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:14,687
Just barely.

38
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,324
You moron!!

39
00:04:17,794 --> 00:04:18,929
[construction worker]
Who did that?!
Watch what you're doing!

40
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,269
Thanks a lot,
Tatsuki.

41
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,275
Hey, were you by chance
following us just now?

42
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:28,014
What? "Following you"?
What're you talking about?

43
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:30,753
I just happened
to be walking by.

44
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,365
From what I saw, someone
just tried to drop a
steel beam on you.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,737
You think it was
done on purpose?!

46
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,540
Don't scare us like that!

47
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:51,296
[Riruka]
Aaaw, did you blow it?

48
00:04:51,696 --> 00:04:55,571
You brought him food and
he still turned you down?
That sucks!

49
00:04:55,571 --> 00:05:00,047
But that's what you get
for being so cagey and
not showing me what that
Ichigo guy looks like!

50
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,717
I'd have to
agree, sir.

51
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:04,355
What are you two
doing here?

52
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:11,470
I thought I told you all to
stay and wait at the club.

53
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:15,778
Oh, you said that?!
Hey we're in this together,
you're not the boss of us!

54
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:18,384
Neither of us are here
to take orders from you.

55
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,860
First of all, you
have no persuasive
skills to speak of!

56
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:26,668
I should handle this one!
I'll persuade him in no time!

57
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,476
As I recall it was
Mr. Ginjo who persuaded
us to work for him.

58
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,817
Why don't you shut up!
You're the only one he
persuaded, Giriko!

59
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:38,392
He's not running things and
I'm not working for him,
Are we clear?!

60
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:39,594
And besides--

61
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:39,995
[gasp]

62
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:43,702
Put a sock in it.
I've heard enough.

63
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:45,506
[snarl]

64
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:48,345
Let's go.

65
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:01,839
Hanging on to the
past isn't my style.

66
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:04,779
So I'm through.

67
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:20,978
Hey Ichigo, guess what?!

68
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:22,448
Hm?

69
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,684
Check it out!!

70
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,989
It's the very first
test I took this year!

71
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:28,494
And I scored a 95
percent on it!

72
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:30,999
Aren't I awesome?!

73
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:35,475
That is awesome!
Way to go!

74
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:38,415
You should go and show Dad!
He'll be thrilled!!

75
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:40,552
Uhh..

76
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,860
Speaking of Dad, do
you know where he is?

77
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:46,664
I dunno.

78
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:49,938
When I woke up this
morning, he was gone and
he hasn't come back.

79
00:06:50,673 --> 00:06:53,478
Oh yeah? Well I'm gonna
go relax in my room.

80
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,082
Oh, hey wait.

81
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,887
Hm? What d'ya need, Yuzu?

82
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:02,096
Uh.

83
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:05,103
[Yuzu]
It's nothing.
Never mind.

84
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:08,676
Hmm...

85
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:11,750
My cheeks are still red.

86
00:07:11,983 --> 00:07:15,056
My whole plan was to
give him that bread and
then ask him a question;

87
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:17,528
I didn't expect him to
invite me to come in.

88
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:22,905
So come on in.

89
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,212
I mean, when he put
it that way, how
could I say no?!

90
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:28,985
Wanna come in?

91
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,660
And then he took me up to
his room, and told me to
take home what I wanted!

92
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:36,901
He is so sweet! So sweet!
The sweetest!

93
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,571
S - W - E - E--

94
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:39,038
Agh!

95
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,744
Uhh...

96
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,548
Sorry about
that, Brother!

97
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,185
[gasp]

98
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:48,090
So, hey.

99
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:48,891
Yeah?

100
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:53,734
I'm wondering, has
anything happened
to you recently?

101
00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:56,540
[sip]

102
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:00,148
Not really. Why would you ask
something like that?

103
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:02,753
I just know it.

104
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,659
You're keeping something
from me, aren't you Ichigo?

105
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,165
[Ringtone]
You'll be fine.
Um-hm-hm!

106
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:09,901
That scared me!

107
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:12,874
Who'd call this late?

108
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:15,881
Oh, it's Uryu.

109
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:18,552
Hey! What's up, Uryu?

110
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:20,222
Huh?

111
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:22,159
Oh, hello.

112
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:24,999
Uh-huh? What?!

113
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,512
Where's Ichigo?

114
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:34,886
His room. I called
him but he said
he'll eat later.

115
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,257
Oh yeah?
In his room?

116
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,765
Y'know boys at his age.
All of them are just pervos.

117
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:42,100
Don't say that!

118
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:44,806
I don't like
talking about stuff
like that okay?

119
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:48,112
And besides, Ichigo isn't
that kind of boy at all!

120
00:08:48,614 --> 00:08:50,651
Yea, yeah.

121
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:55,061
Listen, Yuzu, you'll be
better off once you drop
those ridiculous notions
you have about our brother.

122
00:08:55,661 --> 00:09:00,538
I mean, he's a typical
boy, like all the rest.
He's not some anime
character.

123
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,610
So, of course, he's going
to be doing things--

124
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:06,651
I don't think that about him
and I don't care anymore!

125
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:07,987
I'm done talking to you!

126
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,757
Huh? Hey wait!

127
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,097
I didn't mean it
like that, Yuzu!
I was just teasing you!

128
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:16,571
Oh yeah?! Well just for that,
you can do the dishes tonight!

129
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:17,206
[slam]

130
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,616
Oh boy, Ichigo
must've given her
the brush off again.

131
00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:25,823
I guess I better have
him go smooth things
over with her.

132
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:27,594
[slam]

133
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:29,063
Hm? Yuzu?

134
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,639
Ichigo! Hey,
where're you going?!

135
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,841
Hold up a sec!

136
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,877
Ichigo!

137
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,227
Uryu!

138
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:46,633
Ah! Oh, Ichigo!

139
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:50,974
[panting]
Orihime! So you're
already here.

140
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,277
Where's Chad?

141
00:09:52,277 --> 00:09:54,282
He didn't pick up
when I phoned him.

142
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:57,321
He's probably still working
at his construction job.

143
00:09:58,156 --> 00:10:02,665
[Uryu]
So he even gave Ichigo
a call? Really?
That was unnecessary.

144
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,141
Uryu.

145
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:11,917
You're so predictable.
You speak like an adult,
but it's still just talk.

146
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:15,658
I thought I wasn't supposed
to be allowed visitors here.

147
00:10:16,126 --> 00:10:20,769
Couldn't my condition get
even worse from having
people come see me?

148
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:24,643
Don't be foolish.
Who do you think
operated on you?

149
00:10:24,944 --> 00:10:27,950
Your wounds won't
get worse from
having visitors.

150
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:33,127
You're an amateur who
was slashed by an enemy
and nearly died.

151
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:37,169
You're not in any position to
be telling your doctor what
he should and shouldn't do.

152
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,174
[sigh]

153
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,814
Wait! He was what?!

154
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:47,356
An enemy cut you down?!
What's he talking
about, Uryu?!

155
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:50,797
It's none of your business.

156
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:53,335
Of course this is my business!

157
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:55,707
You were attacked
and almost killed!

158
00:10:55,874 --> 00:10:59,815
Listen if you can't handle
this thing yourself, then
we'll have to do something
about it together!

159
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:03,690
Say something!

160
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:07,264
Sharing any
information is vital.

161
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:10,103
Don't you let my
efforts go to waste.

162
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,940
No one asked for
your opinion!

163
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,809
Hngghh!

164
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:15,280
Oh dear. That was close.

165
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:17,819
If you had yelled a few
more decibels higher,

166
00:11:17,852 --> 00:11:20,056
you may have ripped all
of your sutures apart.

167
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,158
[wincing in pain]

168
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:27,038
Uryu...

169
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:32,315
I'm sorry Orihime,
there isn't anything I
can say to you right now.

170
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:34,887
Please go home.

171
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:38,394
Okay.

172
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:48,715
Ichigo?

173
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:52,958
Huh? Oh! I bet you've
gotta be pretty exhausted
by now, Orihime.

174
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:54,260
I'll walk
you home.

175
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,767
What?! No, but I...
Uh really?!

176
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,736
Ah!

177
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,307
Perhaps I'd better
drive her back myself.

178
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:06,185
And you should go home now.
I recall how your dad can be.

179
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:09,958
He'd probably give me
grief if he knew I had
you out this late.

180
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,107
I understand.
Thank you.

181
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:19,244
Ah!

182
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:25,424
Bye Ichigo! See you in
the morning at school!

183
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:28,430
Calm down, you
shouldn't be yelling
in a hospital.

184
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:30,434
Oh! I'm sorry!

185
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:35,778
Ichigo doesn't seem like
he'll be much help, so
I'll tell you this instead.

186
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:38,918
Uryu wasn't attacked
by a Hollow.

187
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:39,485
Huh?

188
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:43,360
But it wasn't by a
Soul Reaper, either.

189
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:47,034
I found residual
Spiritual Pressure
on his wounds.

190
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:51,510
And to be frank, I'm not
sure if I can call it
"Spiritual Pressure."

191
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:55,385
It was a kind of energy
signature unlike anything
I've ever come across.

192
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:57,155
What does that mean?

193
00:12:58,324 --> 00:12:59,393
Don't ask me.

194
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:03,067
I have told you everything
that I know about this.

195
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,512
My thinking is that even
Uryu doesn't know a thing
about who attacked him.

196
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:14,224
So you see, it's not that
he didn't want to tell
you what happened to him.

197
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:16,595
It's just that he
had nothing to tell.

198
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,232
I see.

199
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:22,039
One thing is clear though.
Someone is targeting you kids.

200
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:25,146
Any thoughts who
might've done this?

201
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:26,414
No.

202
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:30,089
This is just my
hypothesis but...

203
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:35,233
Whoever attacked him possesses
some power we know nothing
about. This enemy is probably,

204
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:37,171
A human.

205
00:13:38,873 --> 00:13:41,412
Someone who is less
like a Soul Reaper,

206
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:43,918
And more like you and Sado.

207
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:50,598
Since Uryu is a Quincy,
he would generally fall
into that category as well.

208
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,312
Assuming that the
attacker was human and
had been targeting individuals
with unique abilities,

209
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,021
It's logical that the
next person in line
could be Sado or you.

210
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:03,157
Ah!

211
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:05,528
[Ryuken]
Be careful.

212
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,901
Hey wait! Hold up
Rukia, I said wait!

213
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:27,907
Don't you understand
the meaning of "wait"?!

214
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:29,310
What do you want?

215
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:31,214
"What do I want"?

216
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:33,586
Do I have to want something
just to talk to you?

217
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:40,466
You fool, don't stop me for
something as trivial as that.
Besides...

218
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:41,602
Hnh?

219
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,574
Who are you anyway?

220
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:46,478
What the?

221
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:09,225
It seems that things aren't
going as we had planned.

222
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:14,636
Well that's all right.
Let's try a different
approach.

223
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:17,943
[Ichigo]
Morning guys.

224
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:22,084
[sigh]
[sigh]

225
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:27,562
Umm. What's up you two?
Hurry up and start
eating, c'mon.

226
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:29,166
Oh sure!

227
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:34,143
I've got an idea! What do
you say we go shopping
after school today?

228
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,347
Didn't you say there were
some things you wanted?

229
00:15:36,347 --> 00:15:37,182
'Kay.
'Kay.

230
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:43,027
Go bowling?

231
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah! This is our last
year together, right?

232
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:49,007
College entrance exams and stuff
are just around the corner,

233
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,346
so this might be our
only chance to go and
have some real fun!

234
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,388
I don't see why you're
trying so hard to create
happy memories for us.

235
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,127
Let's just do what
we always do.

236
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:02,734
You don't get it, do you?
Who knows what might
happen to us!

237
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:07,076
Live for today!
I mean, just
yesterday--

238
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:08,213
Uhh...

239
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:09,181
Um-um.

240
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:10,484
What happened?

241
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:13,991
Uh... Just yesterday...
This uh...

242
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:19,168
He thought some hot girl was
following him, but instead it
turned out it was Tatsuki.

243
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:23,544
Right! True story but
funny, huh? Ha ha ha ha!

244
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:24,412
Yeah, funny.

245
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:28,687
Sorry guys, but I
promised to take my
sisters shopping today.

246
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,258
See ya later.

247
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:35,701
It's best we don't
tell him, right?

248
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:37,372
I think so.

249
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,585
Huh?

250
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:46,189
Yuzu!

251
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:47,493
Hey, Ichigo!

252
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:48,795
Where's Karin?

253
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:52,403
She's running a little
late, so she said for
us to go ahead.

254
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,305
Mh.

255
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:58,081
I see! Well then,
shall we get going?

256
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:00,419
Mm... Sure.

257
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:04,795
Huh?

258
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:06,097
Isn't that...?

259
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:10,172
It's that punk from
the other day!

260
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,109
Why's he
looking at us?

261
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:16,585
[labored breathing]

262
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:17,454
[Tatsuki]
Ichigo!

263
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:21,295
Weren't you with
Keigo and Mizuiro?

264
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:24,802
I was but I left, 'cause
I'd made plans to hang
out with my sisters.

265
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:26,071
Hello there.

266
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,475
So what's up,
Tatsuki?
Oh, hey!

267
00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:31,416
I told them that we'd try and
meet up later, but I can't
seem to reach them now.

268
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,220
They're just
not answering.

269
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,526
Maybe their phone's
out of range or their
battery's dead.

270
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:38,664
I'm hoping that's
all it is.

271
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:40,501
But after
what happened
yesterday...

272
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:43,540
Hnh?! Yesterday?
What are you
talking about?

273
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:46,413
So they didn't tell you
what happened to them?

274
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:48,116
Hm?

275
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:52,359
[creepy breathing]

276
00:17:57,736 --> 00:17:59,673
You're telling me
they got attacked
by someone?!

277
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:02,412
What? I don't
know! But...

278
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:12,800
What are you
waiting for,
Ichigo?

279
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:13,902
[gasp]

280
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,205
Yuzu...!

281
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,746
They're your friends, right?
Then go and help them!

282
00:18:24,324 --> 00:18:25,659
Sorry about
this, Yuzu.

283
00:18:26,428 --> 00:18:27,296
Let's go!

284
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:29,134
Uh, right!

285
00:18:32,206 --> 00:18:34,344
Dammit! I can't
reach them either!

286
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,451
Hey Tatsuki,
let's split up!

287
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,590
You go check the area
over by the bowling
alley. Got it?

288
00:18:40,924 --> 00:18:41,425
Right!

289
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:43,730
I'll go and check
out where they were
attacked yesterday.

290
00:18:44,865 --> 00:18:47,538
It's the high-rise
construction site
on Third street!

291
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:48,339
Got it!

292
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:57,191
Keigo! Mizuiro!

293
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,567
[gasp]
Look out!!

294
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:11,320
Huh?

295
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:12,923
[Ichigo]
So, you did this?!

296
00:19:14,492 --> 00:19:16,363
Why'd you go after
these guys?!

297
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:18,668
If you wanted revenge
then attack me!

298
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,841
Me, "Revenge"?
It's not about that.

299
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,614
I was just asked by
someone to do this!

300
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:26,351
Asked by someone?!

301
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:27,686
That's right!

302
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:29,724
Agh!
Dagh!

303
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:33,331
Damn! If I didn't
have to hold this up!

304
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:36,471
But you do!
You're stuck here!

305
00:19:36,739 --> 00:19:39,611
I'm gonna take down your friends
one after the other!

306
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,247
Gaagh!

307
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:44,755
And when they're gone,
then I'll get your family!

308
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:46,258
Hnh!? You what?!

309
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,594
Heh.

310
00:19:48,496 --> 00:19:50,500
No way in hell!

311
00:19:51,502 --> 00:19:52,905
Raaagh!

312
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,656
[panting]

313
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:03,760
Who was it?
Answer me!

314
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:05,464
[gasp]

315
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:11,343
Who're you?

316
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,447
Wait!

317
00:20:15,651 --> 00:20:16,519
[chuckle]

318
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:19,325
Hey! Hold it!

319
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:21,564
Dammit.

320
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:22,799
[Ryuken]
Let him go.

321
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:26,407
Ryuken?

322
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:31,050
I'm glad he sensed my Spiritual
Pressure and decided to leave.

323
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:33,821
Uh, why're
you here?

324
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,394
Just walking by.

325
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,498
That guy.
Who was he?

326
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:41,437
Probably some punk
just looking to
get into a fight.

327
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:42,807
That's not
what happened!

328
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:45,413
Those guys, did they
attack your son?

329
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,517
These two
will be okay.

330
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,854
They're unconscious,
but they're not
seriously injured.

331
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:53,829
Just to be safe I'll call
an ambulance for them.

332
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:56,668
As for you, don't get
involved any further.

333
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:59,842
Tch! I have to!
I can help out!

334
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:02,080
Then let me ask
you something.

335
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:05,954
Just what can you do?

336
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:15,006
What's going on here, dammit!

337
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,546
I'm not understanding
any of this!

338
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:20,550
Damn it!

339
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:23,523
Isn't there anything
I can do to stop it?!

340
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:31,440
Here's some advice.

341
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,544
Act now while
you can.

342
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:36,083
That's if you want to
protect your family.

343
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:48,875

Welcome to
X-cution.

350
00:23:45,614 --> 00:23:47,484
[Ichigo]
Uryu's dad!
How's Uryu doing?

351
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:50,344
[Ryuken]
It's not your concern.
And don't address me
as "dad."

352
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:51,445
[Ichigo]
Then Uryu's father...?

353
00:23:51,478 --> 00:23:52,679
[Ryuken]
Don't address
me as "father"!

354
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:55,315
[Uryu]
Ryuken!
Who cares about that?!

355
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:58,485
[Ryuken]
Uryu, it's okay for you to
address me as "Daddy."

356
00:23:58,518 --> 00:23:59,519
[Uryu]
No way!
