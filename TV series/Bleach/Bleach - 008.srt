00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:05,494
-I shall go.

[birds chirping]

00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,727
-Ah.

5
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:19,761
Boy, we're never going
to get to the top.

6
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:20,861
-Speak for yourself.

7
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:22,794
This hill's no problem.

8
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:25,427
And please, don't let
Dad hear you say that.

9
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:26,761
-You can do it, Yuzu!

10
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:27,727
Hang in there!

11
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:30,227
You see, Dad's on your side!

12
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:31,327
-Now you did it.

13
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:34,161
Just ignore him, or
else he'll never stop.

14
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:37,427
Giving guys like him attention
only encourages them.

15
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,794
-You're wrong about that.

16
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:41,194
I'm automatically encouraged,
even if you ignore me!

17
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,594
-Look out, Yuzu!

18
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:43,761
-Hyaah!

19
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:46,494
Father slide attack says,
this way to the top!

20
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:49,361
-And daughter says,
go back to the bottom!

21
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:51,227

00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:56,261
-[grunt] Now we can walk
in peace for a while.

24
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:57,061
-Phew.

25
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,861
Man, it's hot.

26
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:01,227
Even for the middle of
June, this kind of heat's

27
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:01,994
a little unusual.

28
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,194
(THINKING) That day
was also June 17.

29
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:11,294
But that day was
completely different.

30
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:13,227
KARIN (OFFSCREEN):
Someone's up there already.

31
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,161
-Wow, she had to climb
up there pretty early

32
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:15,894
to beat us to the top.

33
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:16,394
-Uh-huh.

34
00:03:16,427 --> 00:03:17,194
-Uh--

35
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:17,894
-Although--

36
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:19,027
[laughing cheerfully]

37
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:20,294
KARIN (OFFSCREEN):
--isn't she awfully happy

38
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:22,294
for someone visiting a grave?

39
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,061
-She's waving like
she knows you.

40
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:24,861
-Ah-ah, no way.

41
00:03:24,894 --> 00:03:25,694
Nope, nope.

42
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,627
Nope, never seen her before.

43
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:30,027
-There is something
familiar about her.

44
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,894
I wonder if I've seen
her somewhere before.

45
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:32,461
-No!

46
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:33,594
Don't say that!

47
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:34,961
Hey, I just remembered,
I think I do know her.

48
00:03:34,994 --> 00:03:36,694
In fact, she's a girl from my
class back in middle school.

49
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:38,894
Maybe I should go talk to
her or something, you know?

50
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,761
[nervous laugh] I'll go and
have a little chat with her,

51
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:44,161
and you two go on ahead to
Mom's grave without me, OK?

52
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:45,127
Gah!

53
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,494
-Ichigo--

54
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,861
-Aha.

55
00:03:49,894 --> 00:03:52,194
-And what is that
supposed to mean, Karin?

56
00:03:52,227 --> 00:03:55,361
KARIN (OFFSCREEN): What it
means is our Ichigo has finally

57
00:03:55,394 --> 00:03:56,961
grown up and become a man.

58
00:04:00,294 --> 00:04:03,227
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): What are you
doing following me here, Rukia?

59
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:04,327
-Isn't it obvious?

60
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:06,194
I'm here in case
a Hollow shows up.

61
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:08,127
You certainly can't
handle it yourself.

62
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:10,627
-Hey, way to keep a low
profile in front of my family.

63
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:12,394
Why were you waving
at me like that?

64
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:14,194
-I suppose I could have
been more discreet.

65
00:04:14,227 --> 00:04:16,294
I just doesn't think of it.

66
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:17,261
-That's OK.

67
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:18,561
So what are you upset about?

68
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:20,227
-Actually, I'm not
upset about anything.

69
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:25,261
Listen, about your
mother, I heard

70
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:28,094
you mention that
someone killed her.

71
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:29,761
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
I didn't say that.

72
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:31,961
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN): But you
never said who killed her.

73
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:33,527
-Listen, just drop it, OK?

74
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:35,194
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN):
When I first met you,

75
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:37,261
you said you'd been
able to see spirits

76
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:39,061
since you were very young.

77
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:43,127
Ichigo, I need you to
answer one more question.

78
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:47,394
Your mother, could she have
been killed by a Hollow?

79
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:50,394
Do you think that it's possible?

80
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:54,394
If your spiritual capabilities
were that high as a child, then

81
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,261
there may have been a
Hollow who sensed you.

82
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:57,794
And when it came
after you, it could

83
00:04:57,827 --> 00:04:59,261
have killed your
mother by mistake.

84
00:04:59,294 --> 00:04:59,827
-Stop it!

85
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,227
Just shut up!

86
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:03,361
Why does everything always have
to be about Hollows with you,

87
00:05:03,394 --> 00:05:04,661
anyway?

88
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:07,461
There was no freaking Hollow
there that day, all right?

89
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:09,527
You'll never understand
the pain and suffering

90
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:11,827
I have to live with
every single day.

91
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:19,661
So sorry to wreck your theory,
but all the usual suspects,

92
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:26,194
like Hollows, serial killers,
thugs, they're not to blame.

93
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:27,194
I am.

94
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,127
-Huh?

95
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,094
Wait, Ichigo!

96
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:41,827
TATSUKI (OFFSCREEN):
So what is it, Orihime?

97
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:43,327
You said you had
something important

98
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,161
you wanted to tell
me about Ichigo.

99
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:47,161
-Um--

100
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:48,561
-What's it all about it?

101
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:49,261
-Mm-hmm.

102
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:50,561
Wait 'til you hear this.

103
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:52,194
I think I may have
finally figured

104
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,127
out the mystery of Ichigo.

105
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,027
-The mystery?

106
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:58,294
-I think Ichigo is actually
some kind of superhero,

107
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:00,127
and he's here on a
mission to protect Earth.

108
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:02,427
-Ah, he's a superhero.

109
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:06,394
[chuckling] The first
time I saw your superhero,

110
00:06:06,427 --> 00:06:07,994
we were both only four.

111
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:10,494
I was at the dojo were
I started my training,

112
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:13,194
and I saw him come in
for the first time.

113
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:15,027
He was holding his mom's hand.

114
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:17,094
She was so beautiful.

115
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,161
But what I noticed most was
his incredible orange hair

116
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:22,994
and his big, goofy grin.

117
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:25,561
I knew right away he
wouldn't last too long.

118
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,461
He was just too skinny and weak.

119
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,427
[shouts]

120
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:32,127
[crying]

121
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:34,161
TATSUKI (OFFSCREEN): In
fact, in our first match,

122
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,694
I made him cry with
a single punch.

123
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:38,761
I just reached out and
poked him with a soft one,

124
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:40,727
and that was all she wrote.

125
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:44,294
One quick shot, and he
was down for the count.

126
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,861
You know, he cried
every time he lost.

127
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:49,761
But then the most amazing
thing would always happen.

128
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:51,761
When his mom would
come to pick him up,

129
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:54,894
even if he was still sobbing,
as soon as he saw her,

130
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:58,361
that big smile would break
out across his face again.

131
00:06:58,394 --> 00:06:59,661
He was such a baby.

132
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:01,494
I mean, what kind
of a kid smiles

133
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:03,461
when he's just lost a fight?

134
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:05,227
I didn't get it.

135
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:09,461
Here was this total wimp,
just a complete momma's boy,

136
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:13,761
and yet he seemed to be so
happy all the time, like life

137
00:07:13,794 --> 00:07:18,427
was just one big ride,
no worries at all.

138
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:21,427
He was a happy kid
because of his mom.

139
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:25,627
But then when we
were nine-- she died.

140
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:27,127
[gasp]

141
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:30,994
-He didn't come to school
that day, of course.

142
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:33,727
I was kind of worried because no
one seemed to know where he was

143
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,294
or if he was OK.

144
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:39,261
It seemed so unfair.

145
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:42,994
No nine-year-old kid can handle
that kind of grief alone.

146
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:45,394
So I went looking
for him everywhere I

147
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:47,361
thought he might have gone.

148
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:49,594
I finally found
him by the river,

149
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:52,394
right where his mother had
died, just wandering around

150
00:07:52,427 --> 00:07:53,627
in circles.

151
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:56,294
He'd crouch down
when he got tired,

152
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:57,794
then he'd get up
and keep walking.

153
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,794
For days I watched him.

154
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,427
He did that from
morning 'til night,

155
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,627
like he was waiting
for her to come back.

156
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:06,161
I hated seeing him that way.

157
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,894
The happy Ichigo was gone.

158
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:09,761
-How sad.

159
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:18,861
-Ichigo killed his mother?

160
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:19,361
No.

161
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,894
You have to admit
that it is possible.

162
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:27,794
A Hollow might have killed her.

163
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,194
I can't believe I said that.

164
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:32,861
How insensitive.

165
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,094
-Hey, Rukia, yoo-hoo!

166
00:08:42,661 --> 00:08:43,861
-What are you doing, Kon?

167
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:46,161
I told you not to come
out until I said so.

168
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:47,327
-Give me a break.

169
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,527
I can hardly even breathe
inside here, Rukia.

170
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:51,494
I need oxygen, stat.

171
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:54,194
When are we going
back home, anyway?

172
00:08:54,227 --> 00:08:58,061
-I told you before, it's my duty
to always stay close to Ichigo

173
00:08:58,094 --> 00:09:00,761
so I can help him if
a Hollow shows up.

174
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:01,694
-Hollows?

175
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,061
You're like a broken
record, Rukia.

176
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:04,494
That's all you ever talk about.

177
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:05,727
Hollow this, Hollow that.

178
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:07,094
I think you need
to get out more,

179
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:08,827
maybe make some new
(SHOUTING) frieeends!

180
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:13,994
Hey, how about--

181
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:15,927
-Shh.

182
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:19,294
[snoring]

183
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:19,794
-Huh?

184
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:25,761
-What is that?

185
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:42,561
[yawning]

186
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,627
-That was a nice little nap.

187
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:45,894
Hmm?

188
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:47,694
Hello there, comrade.

189
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:49,561
-It's you.

190
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:53,227
[laughing]

191
00:09:53,261 --> 00:09:54,594
-Sorry.

192
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,527
I hate to be caught napping,
but these missions get so dull

193
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:59,094
sometimes that I just
can't seem to stay awake.

194
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:01,461
-[gasp] A Soul Reaper?

195
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:02,227
Not good.

196
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:03,827
Not good at all.

197
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:04,727
-Mission?

198
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:06,227
What kind of mission are you on?

199
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:09,427
-[laughing] Don't
you know, Rukia?

200
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:16,361
ICHIGO (IN FLASHBACK):
Goodbye, Tatsuki.

201
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:17,794
TATSUKI (IN FLASHBACK)
Bye, Ichigo.

202
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:19,161
See you at the dojo tomorrow.

203
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:25,261
-Ow!

204
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:26,827
-Oh, that careless driver.

205
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:27,561
Come here.

206
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,794
Are you all right?

207
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:32,327
Let me switch places with you
and walk next to the street

208
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:33,561
so that doesn't happen go.

209
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:35,861
-Nah, you don't have to do that.

210
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:38,261
I'm the one with the
raincoat on, so I don't mind.

211
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:41,127
Let met protect you from
stuff like that, OK?

212
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:43,327
-What a brave boy.

213
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:44,894
That's very sweet.

214
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,894
But before you worry
about protecting me,

215
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:48,827
I think you should work
on protecting yourself

216
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:50,227
from that Tatsuki.

217
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:51,227
-Come on.

218
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:52,594
I won a point from
her the last time.

219
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:54,061
-[chuckle] There you go.

220
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:55,561
You're all cleaned up now.

221
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:56,661
Let's go.

222
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:58,827
And I'll walk on the
street side this time.

223
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:02,494
-Hey, Mom, can I-- can I
hold your hand, please?

224
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,894
-[laughing] Why,
of course you can.

225
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:07,727
ICHIGO NARRATING: I
loved my mother so much,

226
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:10,961
and I always felt safe as
long as she was with me.

227
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:17,427
-Hmm?

228
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:18,727
What's that girl doing?

229
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,261
ICHIGO NARRATING:
Back then, I didn't

230
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:21,894
know I was seeing ghosts.

231
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:24,227
I couldn't tell the
difference between the living

232
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:25,161
and the dead.

233
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:27,227
-Ah-- I'll be right back!

234
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:29,227
-(SHOUTING) Ichigo,
where are you going?

235
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:32,194
No, Ichigo, stop!

236
00:11:32,227 --> 00:11:33,661
[shout]

237
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:40,261
ICHIGO NARRATING:
When I was little,

238
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:43,161
my dad told me that my name
meant "he who protects."

239
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:45,961
Up until then, I had
just wanted to protect

240
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:47,461
my mother and my sisters.

241
00:11:47,494 --> 00:11:49,827
But that day, I knew
I was meant to protect

242
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:51,261
that little girl, too.

243
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,127
That's all I was trying to do.

244
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:56,161
But instead, my mom died
trying to protect me

245
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:58,127
from going into the river.

246
00:11:58,161 --> 00:11:59,694
I never saw what caused it.

247
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:00,827
I never saw it coming.

248
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:03,994
But I knew when I looked
at her, my mom was dead.

249
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:05,127
[crying]

250
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:07,261
ICHIGO NARRATING: That
little girl was gone.

251
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,294
-No!

252
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,194
ICHIGO NARRATING: I
remember thinking,

253
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:12,227
how was I ever going
to explain what

254
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:14,794
had happened to Karin and Yuzu?

255
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:16,094
We all loved my mom.

256
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:18,761
She was always the
center of our universe,

257
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:20,561
the heart of our family.

258
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:22,561
[crying]

259
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:27,061
ICHIGO NARRATING: And now that
heart had been cut out-- by me.

260
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:42,868
KARIN (OFFSCREEN,
IN PRAYER): Hi, Mom.

261
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:45,035
I know it's been a while
since we visited you.

262
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,402
Sorry about that.

263
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:47,835
But we're all doing pretty well.

264
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,302
How have you been?

265
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,535
W-well, not that
great, I guess, seeing

266
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:52,802
as how you're dead and all.

267
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:53,368
[yuzu crying]

268
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:53,868
-Hmm?

269
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:00,368
Hey, you can't keep
bursting into tears

270
00:13:00,402 --> 00:13:02,202
every time we come
here, you know.

271
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:03,602
We're 11 years old.

272
00:13:03,635 --> 00:13:06,035
We're big kids now,
for crying out loud.

273
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:10,435
-I know, but this place
just makes me sad.

274
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:11,902
[crying]

275
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:12,935
-Oh, geez.

276
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:14,668
Are you sure you're
really my sister?

277
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:16,435
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN):
I'll cheer you two up!

278
00:13:16,468 --> 00:13:21,935
[manic laughter] Ah, ah,
ah, ah, yo yo yo yo yo yo!

279
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,968
It's time for the annual
Kurosaki family headstone

280
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:25,602
leaping and incense
eating competition,

281
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:27,402
so let's get started--

282
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:31,568
-You win for most
annoying dad of the year.

283
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,968
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN):
I won already?

284
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:35,168
But I was just getting started!

285
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:37,702
-[sigh] Can we trade in our dad?

286
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:39,402
We really need to
get a new model.

287
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:40,702
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN): Here we go.

288
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,868
Losers gotta wash my feet!

289
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:42,868
-Dad, that's disgusting.

290
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:45,068
-Come back and fight like a man!

291
00:13:45,102 --> 00:13:46,035
-No more games.

292
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:48,268
Who are you?

293
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:49,902
Just answer the question now.

294
00:13:49,935 --> 00:13:52,935
-[snickering] Rukia Kuchiki.

295
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:56,235
That's a name that everybody
at Soul Reaper Academy knows.

296
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,502
-Huh?

297
00:13:57,535 --> 00:14:00,668
SOUL REAPER (OFFSCREEN):
Let's face it, you're famous.

298
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:03,668
Adopted into the
noble Kuchiki family,

299
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:05,702
you were known to the
rest of the student body

300
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:10,768
as the princess of princess
of Rukon District. [laughing]

301
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:13,235
And I, of course,
am Eikichiro Saido.

302
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,002
You remember me now, don't you?

303
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:19,635
I was older than you, but
you know my reputation.

304
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:20,968
Maybe this'll ring a bell.

305
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:23,802
They call me that
really funny guy, right?

306
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:25,435
-I've never heard of you.

307
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:26,268
-Ugh.

308
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:27,202
Oh, well.

309
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:28,302
No matter.

310
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:31,468
I suppose we should
get down to business.

311
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:33,102
Hey, settle down.

312
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:36,868
All you gotta do is
answer a few questions.

313
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:42,568
-Miss Kuchiki, you can't
hope to hide it forever.

314
00:14:42,602 --> 00:14:44,302
-Oh, wait.

315
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:45,502
The stealth force.

316
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:47,268
-Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

317
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:48,035
Woo-hoo!

318
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,902
That is the correct answer.

319
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,268
Johnny, tell her what she's won.

320
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:52,468
-Would you just knock it off?

321
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:53,235
-Ichigo, help!

322
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,102
Emergency!

323
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:55,368
Rukia's in trouble!

324
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,535
Ichigo, where are you?

325
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:59,968
Ichigo-- uh-oh.

326
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:01,368
This can't be good.

327
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:07,868
[shouting]

328
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:12,335
-I am really not in the
mood for you right now, Kon!

329
00:15:12,368 --> 00:15:15,635
-Rukia's in trouble.

330
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:17,102
-Hmm?

331
00:15:17,135 --> 00:15:18,702
EIKICHIRO (OFFSCREEN):
They're getting

332
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,435
pretty irritated
with you back there.

333
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:22,968
They want to know why
you're still here.

334
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:25,935
-I'm still here because
the Hollows keep coming.

335
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,002
Orders come in, too.

336
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:29,502
It's simple as that.

337
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,002
-That doesn't explain why you're
dressed like a high school

338
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:32,868
girl.

339
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:33,568
-Wh-what?

340
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:34,802
What's the difference?

341
00:15:34,835 --> 00:15:36,435
I'll wear whatever I want to!

342
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,002
-Oh, don't be embarrassed.

343
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,435
It just looks like
you're finally

344
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:42,702
growing up into a woman.

345
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:44,102
-What's that supposed to mean?

346
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:47,568
EIKICHIRO (OFFSCREEN, LAUGHING);
Oh, stop, you're killing me.

347
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:48,735
Why not admit it?

348
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:50,702
You're involved with
that kid whose mother

349
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:52,202
was killed by a Hollow.

350
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:53,635
The guy with the spiky hair?

351
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:55,135
-What are you talking about?

352
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:57,102
-Do you feel sorry
for him, or are you

353
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:59,068
looking for fun in
the human world?

354
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:00,868
-None of your business, Saido!

355
00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:03,335
Shut your mouth, or
I'll shut it for you!

356
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:05,768
-Nothing to be embarrassed
about, my little flower.

357
00:16:05,802 --> 00:16:06,868
Everybody needs love.

358
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:08,235
And I guess the
best you could do

359
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:12,668
was a human boy to
get all smoochy with.

360
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:14,968
No, huh?

361
00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:16,335
Too bad.

362
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:18,868
That's the only excuse I
think the Soul Society would

363
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:20,302
have bought.

364
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:21,902
If I don't get an
answer from you that

365
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:24,835
satisfies our superiors,
I'll have to take you back,

366
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:27,335
even if it means
dragging you by the hair.

367
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:28,868
-Are you threatening me?

368
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:30,168
-Could be.

369
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:33,268
-Well, Saido, I
have no intention

370
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:34,702
of returning until I'm done.

371
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:36,968
-Eh, I tried.

372
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:39,468
But you leave me no choice.

373
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,335
KON (OFFSCREEN,
SHOUTING): Rukia!

374
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:45,102
-Huh?

375
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:46,302
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Rukia!

376
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,768
Are you all right?

377
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:51,535
Who are you?

378
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,402
And what do you want here?

379
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:55,135
-Well, it's spiky head.

380
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,268
Am I really visible
to you, lover boy?

381
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,302
-Kon, who is this clown?

382
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:00,302
-I don't know.

383
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:01,702
Beats me.

384
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:02,935
-[growling] You brought me here
in a panic because you said it

385
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:04,502
was an emergency, you furball!

386
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:07,402
EIKICHIRO (OFFSCREEN): Never
mind about me right now.

387
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:09,268
Tell me about yourself, son.

388
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:11,068
Just what do you do?

389
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:11,902
-Don't say it.

390
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,602
-I'm a substitute Soul Reaper.

391
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,568
-A Soul Reaper?

392
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,902
Is that right.

393
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:21,835
I'm still waiting
for the punchline,

394
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:25,268
because that has to be a joke.

395
00:17:25,302 --> 00:17:29,402
Oh, Rukia, that's a big mistake.

396
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:32,535
What you've done is
considered a serious crime.

397
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:33,735
-What crime?

398
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:35,435
What's he saying?

399
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:37,068
-Maybe it's better.

400
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:39,102
It'll be more fun to
kill a Soul Reaper

401
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:41,902
impostor than just
another dumb Gigai.

402
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,635
So let's do it!

403
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:45,102
-Do what?

-Huh?

00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:55,035
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Give it to me.

-Now you die!

00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:00,468
Huh?

-Not bad.

412
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:12,502
You're human, and yet you
were able to transform.

413
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:15,202
I'm interested in knowing
how you got that ability.

414
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:17,302
-I don't give
explanations to anyone

415

who attacks me or my friends.

-Wait, Ichigo, just
stay out of it!

417
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,602
It's my battle, not yours.

-What can you do?

419
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,802
You don't have your sword.

420
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:26,635
Move it, Kon!

Wh-what is it?

00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:41,868
-There you are.

-Where is dad?

-He told me he went to talk
to the cemetery director.

-(THINKING) Ugh.

you keep me company for a while.

You're using your strength to
try to cover for your weakness.

446
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:41,835
But in fact, you have no

about this being
a serious crime?

answer me if I did?

That's your business.

it's a deep, jagged wound.

00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:10,668
And because of that, I don't
know what words to say.

490
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:14,135
I don't know how to ask you
about it without dredging up

491
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:16,102
your pain all over
again, without tearing

492
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:19,035
your heart completely apart.

493
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:21,002
I'll wait for now.

494
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:22,568
But when you want
to talk, when you

495
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:26,202
feel like you're ready
to tell me about it,

496
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:27,568
I'll be there to listen.

497
00:21:32,768 --> 00:21:35,735
-[sigh] This is a big mess.

498
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:37,368
What do I do now?

499
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:39,802

500
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:41,768
-Yuzu, no.

HOLLOW (OFFSCREEN):
You're too noisy.

503
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:49,068
And anyway, you're too
small, even for an appetizer.

504
00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:50,535

THEME SONG: Nobody
knows who I really am.

506
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:05,859
I never felt this empty before.

507
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:10,592
And if I ever need
someone to come along,

508
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:15,592
who's going to comfort
me and keep me strong?

509
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,292

ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
I've decided to protect.
