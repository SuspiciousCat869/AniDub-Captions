00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:52,955
NARRATOR: We now go back
in time to 110 years ago.

3
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,608
At that time, the 13
Court Guard Squads

4
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:56,075
had different
members than today,

5
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:58,942
but there were also some
very familiar faces.

6
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:01,108
The captain of Squad
Five was Shinji Hirako,

7
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:02,908
who currently
resides in the World

8
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:04,575
of the Living as a Visored.

9
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:06,542
At that time,
other Visoreds also

10
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:11,042
held positions in the Squads
as captains and lieutenants.

11
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:13,542
Another interesting fact
is that in those days,

12
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:17,308
Sosuke Aizen was the lieutenant
under Shinji Hirako in Squad

13
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:18,508
Five.

14
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:21,008
It was then that Squad 12
Captain, Kirio Hikifune,

15
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:23,675
was promoted to the Royal
Special Task Force, which

16
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,908
left her position
in the squad open.

17
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:29,042
Yoruichi Shihoin, the captain
of Squad Two at the time,

18
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:30,808
personally recommended
the Third Seat

19
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:33,408
in her squad to fill
the vacated position.

-Huh?

23
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:09,042
Ah ha, please don't tell me that
I'm the last one to get here.

24
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:11,442
I'm truly sorry I'm late.

25
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:14,642
Let me just say,
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

26
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,108
it's nice to meet you all.

27
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:20,975
-That's the guy?

28
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:22,442
They chose him?

29
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:25,142
He looks too easy
going to be a captain.

30
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:27,275
-It's not like you've
got room to talk.

31
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:39,275
-Uh, so, may I uh please
have permission to enter?

32
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:40,675
-Don't be a wimp.

33
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,642
-Huh?

34
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:44,075
-You are now a
Captain of a Squad.

35
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:46,542
Stand tall and enter, Kisuke.

36
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:48,408
-Right.

37
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:48,908
-Yes.

38
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:50,375
Enter.

39
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:52,908
And be quick about it.

40
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,875
[baff]

41
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:57,908
-Let us begin.

42
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:00,575
The Installation Ceremony
shall now proceed.

43
00:04:03,808 --> 00:04:05,942
I'm sure that the
rest of you captains

44
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:08,142
have heard by now
what has occurred.

45
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:12,308
Seven days ago, Squad 12
captain, Kirio Hikifune,

46
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:14,442
relinquished her
position as captain

47
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:19,475
because she was promoted to
the Royal Special Task Force.

48
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:22,108
So as a result of
this, the search

49
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:26,142
began for a new squad captain
to fill her vacant position.

50
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:31,308
I sent out a formal notice
to the other captains.

51
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:34,375
The following day, I
received a recommendation

52
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:39,308
from Squad Two Yoruichi
Shihoin, and subsequently

53
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:42,375
the Third Seat from
her squad was summoned.

54
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:47,442
And so yesterday, I,
Genryusai Yamamoto,

55
00:04:47,475 --> 00:04:50,242
along with the three
captains who are present,

56
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:53,242
conducted an examination
to thoroughly evaluate

57
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:56,675
this man's qualifications
to become captain.

58
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:00,542
And after a complete inquiry,
we found no shortcomings

59
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:02,808
in his abilities
or his character.

60
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:11,075
Therefore, I announce that the
former Third Seat of Squad Two,

61
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:13,942
Kisuke Urahara,
is hereby promoted

62
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:17,642
to the rank of Captain
of Court Guard Squad 12.

63
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:18,975
[laughs nervously]

64
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:25,975
-And um so I'm
pleased to inform you

65
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:27,875
I've been placed here
to be your new captain.

66
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,908
Nice to meet you.

67
00:05:32,942 --> 00:05:37,308
(NERVOUS LAUGHTER) Um.

68
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:41,542
Hello there.

69
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,775
[smack]

70
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,042
-I will not accept this!

71
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:47,608
I already don't like that
Captain Hikifune left us

72
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:50,142
so fast, and now we get you?

73
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,442
Come on, you're from Squad Two!

74
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:52,942
That's the Stealth Force.

75
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:54,142
You're killers!

76
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:56,175
Someone who spent his time
secretly killing people

77
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,608
isn't a suitable choice
to be our captain!

78
00:05:58,642 --> 00:05:59,908
-Lieutenant, please!

79
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,208
You're going too far in
front of the Captain!

80
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:03,542
-Am I?

81
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:06,042
I'm just saying out loud
what I know every one of you

82
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,308
is thinking.

83
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:09,175
Well, isn't that what you think?

84
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,975
How will it be possible
for us to follow

85
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:14,108
orders some nobody like him?

86
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:18,808
-Well, I-- we'll obey him.

87
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:22,175
[nervous laughter]

88
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,308
-What's so funny?

89
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,342
Didn't you hear me earlier
when I insulted your old squad?

90
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,542
You had no reaction at all.

91
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:30,542
You coward!

92
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:32,042
Aren't you angry at me for that?

93
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:36,775
-Not at all.

94
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:39,442
After all, now I'm the
Captain of Squad 12.

95
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:45,708
That's what I decided this
morning when I woke up.

96
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:50,808
Once I get out of this bed, I
will now belong to Squad 12.

97
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:54,175
I consciously decided
that I will only get angry

98
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,342
if someone criticizes Squad 12.

99
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,875
I think it's nice to be able to
choose what upsets you and what

100
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:02,208
doesn't.

101
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:05,808
I believe having the will to
change what we think really

102
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,975
allows us to be able
to start over, right?

Hey, what's going on?

-We're unpacking
for the big move.

-Big move?

122

What are you talking about?

00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:07,942
-Captain Urahara is moving in.

-Don't go calling
that jerk Captain!

125

This whole situation
makes me want to puke.

126
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,542
All this furniture's his?

127
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:16,475
How much junk's he got?

128
00:08:22,842 --> 00:08:25,308
-(GROWLING) I was wondering
what you're going to do with all

129
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:26,942
this stuff.

130
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:28,142
-Good question.

131
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,175
It's just, my promotional
happened so suddenly.

132
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,942
And I must admit, I feel
bad for having asked you

133
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:35,875
Squad members to help me.

134
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:38,075
Sorry about this.

135
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:39,642
But as you can
see, there's really

136
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:42,742
no way I could have
managed all this by myself.

137
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:45,508
-I will not accept this!

138

-Hey, that sounds familiar.

139
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:49,142
Didn't you say that
to me a bit earlier?

140
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:51,575
-I'm going to keep saying it.

141
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:54,508
I refuse to accept you and
all this stuff you've got!

I'd say you're all right.

-Well, I'm not all
right, dumbass!

You're really OK?

165
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:41,175
I brought this.

like you, you gutless squirrel?

I have a lot of things,

into my captain's quarters.

when you do that!

Go on.

I wanted to lay
out what will now

be the objectives for Squad 12.

I thought about it all night.

205
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:16,775
I really considered what
it is we should stand for.

what you thought.

-Well, anyway, I still have
lots of things in boxes,

212
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:45,608
so I should get
back to unpacking.

I thank you all for giving
me a little more time.

00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:25,183
I don't get it.

330
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:28,716
Why would he do that?

-Oh, Captain Hirako.

335
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:50,049
Good evening.

336
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,216
-Just call me Shinji.

337
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:53,316
We're both captains.

338
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:59,849
[sighs] What

339
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:01,316
-Do you think of Hiyori?

340
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:02,983
A pain in the butt?

341
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,116
-No.

342
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:07,983
-She was pretty close
to Captain Hikifune.

343
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:12,249
I'm convinced she thought
of her as a mother figure.

344
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:15,783
So it'll be difficult
for you to win her over.

345
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:18,849
-I tend to think you're
right about that.

346
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:22,749
I've done what I can to
make us all get along.

347
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:24,683
But it seems no
matter what I do,

348
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:27,349
it's just not going as
smoothly as I'd like.

349
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:32,183
Are you really giving
this all you've got?

350
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,283
I certainly don't
think that I know it

351
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,516
all about these situations,
but as someone who's

352
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:42,949
been a captain a
bit longer than you,

353
00:18:42,983 --> 00:18:46,316
maybe you should hear me out.

354
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:48,983
Those chosen to
command should be

355
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:51,683
able to sympathize
with those who serve,

356
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:54,283
however they should not show it.

357
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:54,783
-Hmm.

358
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:00,783
-You do things as
you think best,

359
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:05,383
and if it turns out that no one
follows you, then perhaps you

360
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,449
just weren't to right
vessel to lead them.

361
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,916
And besides, you
don't really seem

362
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:16,049
the type that
possesses the skill

363
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,316
to be much good at thinking
about how others feel.

364
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:27,683
Well, anyway, I wouldn't let
this bother you too much.

365
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:30,649
I'd say you and I seem to
have something in common.

366
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:34,049
But I couldn't help coming
by to give you some advice.

How long have you
been aware of me?

00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:10,198
From the time you were
in your mother's womb.

-Captain, what is it?

377
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,464
You truly are a frightening man.
