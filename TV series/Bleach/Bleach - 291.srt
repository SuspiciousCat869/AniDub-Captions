1
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:10,333
Believe me, I do not want
to have to kill you...

2
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:13,033
How dare you!

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,500
Welcome Sosuke,

4
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:23,233
To the inverted world.

5
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:12,350
Suzumushi Hyakushiki.

6
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,550
Grillado Grillo!

7
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,417
At last, I can see...
I can see..!!

8
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:10,217
Heh.

9
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,183
Yah hah hah hah!

10
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:15,383
I can see, Sajin!
I can see, I can see!

11
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:18,317
<i>So that is the sky!</i>

12
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,083
<i>So this is blood!</i>

13
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:30,517
And so that is what
you look like, Sajin.

14
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,950
You're not how I imagined.

15
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:40,483
You're much, much uglier.

16
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:07,983
Heh.

17
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,417
<i>When? When did you</i>
<i>become like this?</i>

18
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:22,550
You seem shocked by my new
form... Preparing to give up?

19
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:25,817
So I'm ugly to you?

20
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,517
Well. I remember you telling
me once just how much you
personally were disgusted by
what you saw in the mirror.

21
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,183
Did it bother you to hear
those words coming from me?

22
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:38,517
That's not it.

23
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,883
Then what is it?

24
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,017
I pity you.

25
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,650
Why's that?

26
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:48,550
Before this, your vision
was unobstructed.

27
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,917
Now it seems you
are truly blind.

28
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:54,483
Your words have no meaning.

29
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:56,983
I can see clearly now.

30
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,250
See for yourself!

31
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,483
So explain this!
What are you
witnessing now?!

32
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,483
Is my attack the attack
of someone stumbling
around in the dark?!

33
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:16,350
What is your answer
to that, Sajin!??

34
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:22,217
Ngyahh.

35
00:05:24,517 --> 00:05:25,650
What's wrong?

36
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:29,483
I thought you could see
things better than I could?

37
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:41,217
Your sword has a most
interesting shape.

38
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,983
Nice huh? You can't borrow it.

39
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:48,150
We'll see. I don't sense
anything different here.

40
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,683
Didn't you tell me
before that it takes
over a person's senses?

41
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:58,050
What are you talking about?
The change is already in effect.

42
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,183
Mmh?

43
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:01,583
Ohh... What is that?

44
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:04,750
Do you smell
something good?

45
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:06,017
[gasp]

46
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:10,083
It's too late to
hold your breath.

47
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,317
Heh. Welcome, Sosuke,

48
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:18,983
...to the inverted world.

49
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:43,717
Kaname...

50
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,317
Believe me, I don't want
to have to kill you...

51
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,250
But I can tell now that
you've lost your ability to
see the world as it is...

52
00:06:56,717 --> 00:07:00,383
I'm forced to kill you
in the name of justice!

53
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:04,650
Did you say, "justice"?

54
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,683
How dare you!

55
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:20,517
You have lost the true vision
you had as a Soul Reaper.

56
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:24,317
You know I am telling
you the truth.

57
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,883
(Sl. Straining CT Exhale)

58
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:31,583
All those years, even though
you were blind, you always
had a way of understanding
things, and seeing reality.

59
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:36,917
You saw the dark and the
light in others and you
fought as a warrior, as
if you had perfect sight!

60
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,383
You're so sure of yourself,
But you know nothing about me!

61
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,217
What changed you?!

62
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,317
What was it that made you
decide to close your eyes to
the world before you?!

63
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,217
Silence!

64
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:09,183
You show me disrespect!

65
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:12,050
Now I can clearly see
how ugly you really are!

66
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:25,583
Raaghh!

67
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,483
I told you, you may
now possess sight,

68
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:58,350
Yet it appears you are
now more blind than ever.

69
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:01,483
You refuse to see the
essence of my being.

70
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:08,217
My true essence is far beyond
my physical appearance, Instead
I ask you to look further.

71
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,817
Gaze deeply...

72
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,983
Into my heart....

73
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,150
"Into your heart"?

74
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,317
Don't act as if you
understand my life.

75
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,683
Your heart?
What heart is that?

76
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:46,150
<i>Ridiculous.</i>

77
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,217
I'll give you one last
chance to understand!

78
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,083
Where is my heart?!
Can you see it?

79
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:00,183
I'm curious, Why did
you choose to become
a soul reaper?

80
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:04,517
To repay a debt of
gratitude to the one
who saved my life.

81
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,317
Repaying a debt.
That sounds like you.

82
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,150
And what about
you, Kaname?

83
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:16,750
Me?... Well...

84
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:22,050
<i>It's For justice.</i>

85
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:25,717
I dedicated my life to
this all because of her.

86
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,850
She loved this world,
So I became a Soul Reaper
to bring justice to it.

87
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,683
I couldn't sit by and watch
the justice she fought for
just simply disappear.

88
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:42,650
When she died, I decided I had
to carry on her heart's desire.

89
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,983
That's why I did it,
She is why I became
a Soul Reaper.

90
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:00,150
Kaname...

91
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:02,183
At that time, I noted,

92
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:05,650
There was something you
didn't say that made an
impression on me.

93
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,150
<i>You talked a lot</i>
<i>about how she felt,</i>
<i>how she loved the world.</i>

94
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:15,917
<i>But you never called it...</i>
<i>the world YOU love.</i>

95
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:22,417
<i>That was when I realized,</i>
<i>your heart is filled with</i>
<i>hate for this world...</i>

96
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:27,917
<i>I fully understood</i>
<i>your feelings.</i>

97
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,550
<i>In fact, I would have</i>
<i>felt the same way.</i>

98
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:35,417
<i>Anyone would feel like that</i>
<i>if they had lost a loved one.</i>

99
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:44,683
<i>I was glad to know that</i>
<i>you had real feelings,</i>

100
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,717
<i>and weren't some saint</i>
<i>who could say that he</i>
<i>still loved the world</i>

101
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,017
<i>in spite of what had</i>
<i>happened to your</i>
<i>dearest companion.</i>

102
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,417
<i>That was the reason I</i>
<i>decided to reach out</i>
<i>and become your friend.</i>

103
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,683
<i>If you knew sadness,</i>
<i>I would embrace it.</i>

104
00:12:05,717 --> 00:12:08,917
<i>If you went astray,</i>
<i>I would guide you.</i>

105
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,417
<i>If you make a mistake,</i>
<i>I will forgive you.</i>

106
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,417
<i>When you had nowhere to turn,</i>
<i>I would be your refuge.</i>

107
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:34,883
<i>I wanted to help, all so</i>
<i>that this man who could</i>
<i>no longer love the world,</i>
<i>might love it again.</i>

108
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:50,317
Los Nueve Aspectos.

109
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,417
Kaname...

110
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:26,217
Shall we end this now,
what do you say?

111
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,650
Mmgh.

112
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:33,383
Justice... isn't something
that's seen with your eyes.

113
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:38,650
Justice Is something mere words
can't completely describe.

114
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:51,150
<i>[Sajin]</i>
<i>Forgive me, Tetsuzaemon...</i>
<i>Forgive me, Shuhei...</i>

115
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:54,317
<i>Forgive me, Kaname....</i>

116
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,017
I cannot kill you.
I know you too well.

117
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:16,350
That's enough. You're not
really Captain Tosen anymore.

118
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:22,850
Before this, when you
couldn't see, you could have
easily dodged my attack.

119
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,917
Reap...Kazeshini!

120
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,250
[choking]

121
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,817
<i>[younger Kaname]</i>
<i>Why isn't that man</i>
<i>going to be executed?!</i>

122
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:50,350
I need to speak to the
central 46! Right now!

123
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:52,750
I beg you!

124
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:56,717
<i>Why?</i>

125
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:00,017
<i>Why?</i>

126
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,317
<i>Why?</i>

127
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,317
<i>Why?</i>

128
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:10,317
<i>How did it come to this?</i>

129
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:30,848
Welcome Sosuke...
to the inverted world.

130
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:39,215
Here we have the
power of Sakanade.

131
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:45,715
It completely reverses your
opponent's sense of direction
and acts like a puzzle game
changing which way you move.

132
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:47,981
Yes... funny isn't it?

133
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:50,315
You probably haven't
played any video games.

134
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:51,615
Have you?!

135
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:54,681
This is quite interesting.

136
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:59,148
Everything is reversed.
Up is down.

137
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:01,548
And left is right.

138
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:06,181
Did you honestly think
that I wouldn't notice?

139
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:10,548
[gasp]

140
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:13,348
I'd say it appears
you didn't notice.

141
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:18,548
Up and down, left and right,
and front and back are all
reversed.

142
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:22,648
The way you turned and
where you just attacked
from, are also reversed.

143
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:24,448
Hmm.

144
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:29,515
All those changes in
direction and damage
coming at you from
every single angle.

145
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,348
So why don't you
ask yourself,

146
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:34,781
can you really fight while
reversing everything
inside your head?

147
00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:38,681
No one can do that.
It's impossible.

148
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:42,815
<i>Whether you're a Soul Reaper,</i>
<i>an Espada, or a human,</i>

149
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:45,615
<i>the sense most used</i>
<i>in battle is sight.</i>

150
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:49,015
<i>We all fight based on</i>
<i>visual information.</i>

151
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:56,481
But once I employ Sakanade,
it becomes almost impossible
to fight based on sight.

152
00:16:56,981 --> 00:17:00,348
So you're left with reacting
reflexively to my attacks,

153
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:02,948
but you have to think
twice before every move.

154
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,081
Heh.

155
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:05,915
What a challenge.

156
00:17:05,948 --> 00:17:10,681
Even with your fast
reaction time, how will you
counteract your reflexes?

157
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:14,548
The more conditioned you are,
the greater chance you'll fail!

158
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:21,481
<i>Over here!</i>

159
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:25,148
What's wrong Sosuke?!
You look quite confused!

160
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:26,181
I've got you!

161
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:35,581
Not too bad, Sosuke.

162
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:38,015
Even though everything
is reversed for you,

163
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:42,615
you still somehow managed to
dodge almost all of my
triple bluffed attacks.

164
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:45,181
You are quite impressive.

165
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:46,981
But.

166
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:49,781
It ends here.

167
00:17:52,615 --> 00:17:54,815
You are through, Sosuke!

168
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:58,515
Nh!

169
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:05,515
<i>So that's it...?</i>

170
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:09,848
Your whole strategy was nothing
more than an optical illusion.

171
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:13,948
How did you...?!

172
00:18:16,281 --> 00:18:19,448
<i>You talked about how when</i>
<i>warriors battle, they rely</i>
<i>mainly on their sight.</i>

173
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,215
<i>Have you forgotten that</i>
<i>you are no exception in</i>
<i>this situation?</i>

174
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:26,848
Wh-What do you mean, Sosuke?

175
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:30,348
Please... don't act so
surprised, Shinji.

176
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:37,215
Your ability is nowhere
near my level of power, one
which takes control of all
five of your senses.

177
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:41,381
So instead of me being
beaten by this visual
effect, it was you.

178
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:48,148
<i>If I can change your</i>
<i>senses even a little,</i>
<i>the rest is easy.</i>

179
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:49,448
Rrgh.

180
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:56,815
Yours was a parlor trick.
It's quite a far cry from
my ability to control all
five senses.

181
00:18:57,548 --> 00:19:01,981
<i>It was child's play</i>
<i>for me, Shinji Hirako.</i>

182
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:09,715
<i>[Kaname]</i>
<i>Who is this...This woman?</i>

183
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:12,448
<i>How strange...</i>

184
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:17,781
<i>This wasn't how it was</i>
<i>supposed to happen.</i>
<i>Who is she?</i>

185
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:28,515
<i>I can't see.</i>
<i>I can't see anything.</i>
<i>Not a thing.</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>

186
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:42,615
Agh...
Sajin...
Shuhei...

187
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:48,781
Don't speak. Your Hollow
powers are allowing you
to breathe, but your
throat's been torn open.

188
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:52,548
You don't need to
talk right now.
It's better that you
save your strength.

189
00:19:57,115 --> 00:20:01,281
Kaname, you said
something before
our battle began.

190
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:06,881
You mentioned to me that
you knew someday, we would
cross our swords in combat.

191
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:10,348
<i>To be honest,</i>

192
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:14,815
As we were fighting,
I found myself feeling
the same thing.

193
00:20:17,315 --> 00:20:19,648
Shuhei probably had
the same thought.

194
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:25,181
Our relationship
has been all too
superficial
until now.

195
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:28,981
Even as friends,
it was our fate to
fight each other.

196
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:31,981
And by fighting,

197
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:35,348
We've come to a greater
understanding between us.

198
00:20:36,948 --> 00:20:39,181
<i>I can't ask you</i>
<i>not to hate me,</i>

199
00:20:39,215 --> 00:20:42,748
<i>I know you'll probably</i>
<i>hold a grudge after</i>
<i>what's happened,</i>

200
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:47,148
<i>Just don't allow your</i>
<i>hunger for revenge to</i>
<i>change who you truly are.</i>

201
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:53,381
I feel just as you
must've felt when you
lost your friend.

202
00:20:53,881 --> 00:20:59,181
If we were to lose you,
it would leave a hole
in my heart.

203
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,948
I thank you, Sajin.

204
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:15,048
Shuhei, let me have
a look at your face.

205
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:20,715
Because of my Hollowfication,
I'm still able to see.

206
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,815
I want to see your face
while I still have the
chance to remember it.

207
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:30,815
Captain...

208
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:31,848
Hungh!

209
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,615
Captain!
Captain!!

210
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:47,281
<i>Aizen!!!</i>

211
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:55,315
I won't forgive you Aizen!!

212
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:49,074
<i>[Soi Fon]</i>
<i>Huh, They're finally settling</i>
<i>the score down there.</i>

213
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,007
<i>[snoring]</i>

214
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,974
<i>[Soi Fon]</i>
<i>Ugh! Wake up, Marechiyo!</i>

215
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:56,341
<i>[Marechiyo]</i>
<i>Captain Soi Fon,</i>
<i>I've defeated Sosuke Aizen!</i>

216
00:23:56,374 --> 00:23:58,041
<i>[Soi Fon]</i>
<i>Quit dreaming!</i>
<i>He's still alive!</i>

217
00:23:58,074 --> 00:24:00,241
<i>[Marechiyo]</i>
<i>There you go with</i>
<i>the lies, Captain.</i>
