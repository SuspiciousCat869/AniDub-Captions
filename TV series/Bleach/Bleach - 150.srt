for Sosouke Aizen's

4
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:54,642
in order to save Orihime.

But they are dragged

by Runuganga, the guardian
of the White Sand.

In the forest,
Rukia is separated

from Ichigo and the others.

She is saved by a mysterious
Soul Reaper named Ashido.

CEO Long ago, Ashido followed
Hollows into the Menos Forest

00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:15,842
where he fought Hollows
by himself for centuries.

back to the surface
with Ashido's help,

19
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:36,642
and they finally
make to Las Noches.

They have come to save you.

Why else would they

But that no longer has

By wearing these clothes,
you are no longer

This isn't a visit

We're not just going to walk

when they brought her here,
which she won't escape from.

380
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,044
He ordered her to
surrender, and made

381
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:56,044
her unable to refuse by offering
to spare her friends' lives.

382
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:58,377
Afterwards, he gave
her a 12-hour reprieve

383
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,177
and allowed her to say
goodbye to one of her friends

on the condition that no
one else could see her.

-And you call that a cage?

386

-By giving her a
reprieve and allowing

387
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:13,977
her to say goodbye to a friend
in such a tense situation,

388
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,310
she'll mistakenly believe that
we've shown her some sympathy

389
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:19,610
and we are on her side,
which will eventually

weaken her will.

But in truth, her
friends' lives were not

392
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,244
actually at risk at all
during that 12-hour reprieve.

393
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:32,144
Furthermore, even though
she was forced to surrender,

394
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,344
by allowing her to choose
someone to say goodbye to,

395
00:17:35,377 --> 00:17:37,644

she had done so by.

that she bought into
our plan completely.

399
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:49,877
The idea that she chose
us was etched even deeper

400
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,244
into her mind, and gradually she
will lose the will to run away.

401

Even you can understand that.

is that by allowing

that she'd most likely leave

said goodbye to that person.

If she left evidence
behind with a friend,

then we have completely failed!

-Quite the opposite.

The evidence of
having said goodbye

becomes undeniable

-In other words, the
stronger the evidence

418
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,110
was, the more her
friends would be

419
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,844
inclined to think that she
willfully betrayed them,

420
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:37,010
and that she wasn't, in
fact, taken against her will.

Though, that last part
wasn't a complete success.
