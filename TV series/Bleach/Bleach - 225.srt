ICHIGO (NARRATING):
I'm Ichigo Kurasaki.

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,866
And other than having the
ability to see spirits,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,100
I used to be an ordinary
high school student.

4
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,566
But the day I met
Rukia Kuchiki, I

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,400
was given the powers
of a soul reaper

6
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,366
in order to protect the
world of the living.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,800
As I began my work as a
substitute soul reaper,

8
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,266
I found myself thrown into
a never ending battle.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,033
In the midst of everything,
my best friend Orihime Inoue

10
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:27,166
was abducted by ex soul
reaper captain Sosuke Aizen.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,900
My friends Chad and
Udi you joined me

12
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:30,733
as I raced to rescue Orihime.

13
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:33,133
Once we arrived in Hueco
Mundo, we entered a fight

14
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,400
with powerful enemies
known as arrancars.

15
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:37,233
We were too late to
keep Aizen from entering

16
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:40,033
the world of the living But
luckily, the 13 court guard

17
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:41,966

there to stop it.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,233
An all out war was
about to begin!

NARRATOR: Soul
reapers and arrancars

22
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,980
faced off against each other
throughout Karakura Town.

23
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:35,346
Rangiku Matsumoto
squared off against three

24
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,180
of Harribel's proxiones,
Apacci, Mila Rose, and Sung-Sun.

25
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:43,313
Rangiku noticed that her three
opponents did not get along

26
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:44,946
and tried to use that
to her advantages

27
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,446
as she confronted them.

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,913
But fighting three
against one took its toll,

29
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:51,313
and gradually pushed
her into a corner.

30
00:02:51,346 --> 00:02:54,046
Then an unexpected
helper suddenly appeared.

MOMO (NARRATING):
He really got her.

169
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,513
He smashed her from just
bellow the ribs down

170
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:18,480
through the intestinal area.

171
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:20,880
She can't breathe
with these injuries.

172
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:24,346
I have to hurry!

173

There are broken bones
throughout my body.

178
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:44,813
Both Rungiku and myself
have been taken out

179
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:46,813
within moments of each other.

180
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:48,313
This is crazy.

181
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:52,580
There is no way we can
win against this thing.

-You did an extremely effective
job holding him off, Momo.

Izuru.

189

Let's get rid of this monster.

-What the?

191
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:51,206
Who are these bozos?

192
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,440
SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
They must be her friends.

193
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:56,906
I saw them coming from the
direction of the pillars.

194
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,673
-So if you saw them coming, why
didn't you try and stop them?

195
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:02,773
I thought you were in
a much better position

196
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:04,106
to see their approach.

197
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,806
Or are your eyes just useless
holes sitting on your face?

198
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,040
-What's that?

199
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:10,340
-Stop it, both of you.

200
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,173
We're right in the
middle of a battle.

201
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:13,773

205
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,906
What is it with these guys?

206
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,706
They love to interfere in
other people's battles.

207
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,806
Ayon!

208
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,640
Don't give them the
opportunity to butt in.

209
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:35,006
Kill them both now!

210
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,973
Ayon!

211
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:39,873
[groan]

212
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:42,140
Looks to me like he's
trying to ignore us.

213
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:43,673
-Don't be stupid.

214
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:45,073
Look at him.

215
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:47,573
What makes you think he has the
capacity to hear a word we say?

216
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:50,873
-Well, he's got to have eardrums
on him somewhere, doesn't he?

217
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:53,273
-I'm not absolutely sure.

218
00:13:53,306 --> 00:13:55,940
I've never seen him react
when we speak to him.

219
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:58,140
Maybe he just reads our minds.

220
00:13:58,173 --> 00:13:59,906
But apart from
that, would you mind

221
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,540
not asking me to agree with
you when we're having to fight?

222
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:04,006
It's very annoying.

223
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,373
-Really?

224
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:08,440
I have to presume that Ayon
gets his nasty side from you.

225
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,173
-That may be so, but he
gets his face from you.

226
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:13,740
Those ugly horns are
exactly like yours.

227

-Don't force me to kill you
before I kill those soul

-This fighting stops now!

230
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:21,473
It doesn't matter
who Ayon takes after.

231
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:24,006
-That's because he gets
his temperament from you.

232
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,206
I'm sure he's doomed to
be alone and unmarried

233
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,573
because no one can stand him.

234
00:14:27,606 --> 00:14:28,573
-Get bent, lady!

screaming about up there?

00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:38,173
They've lost it.

00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:39,040
-Yeah.

239
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:41,740
Don't worry about them, Izuru.

240
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:42,306
-You're right.

241
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:47,006
-Know what?

242
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,006
I'm going to kill
both of you, some day!

243
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,706
-If you've got the
game, bring it all!

-Mmm-hmm.

245
00:14:54,706 --> 00:14:57,606
-I knew it was a bad
idea to bring him out.

246
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,740
He's nearly uncontrollable.

247
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:06,606
-Izuru.

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,706
I'll handle this guy.

-[groan]

Wait a minute.

252
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:16,973
You sure you want
to fight him alone?

253
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:19,006
-Who said anything
about fighting alone?

254
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,706
After you've done
emergency first aid,

255
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,940
hide them both using Kido,
then come back here to help!

256

-Rangiku needs assistance
quickly or she might die.

Don't forget, you're a
former member of squad four.

was a long time ago.

I'll heal your injuries
as soon as as I can.

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,740
Just hang in there, Momo!

-Don't worry, I'm all right.

270

It's Rangiku.

IZURU (NARRATING): Momo's
in pretty bad shape herself.

274
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:29,606
She's either got a broken rib
or even worse-- one of her lungs

275
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,140
is collapsed.

276
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:41,773
However, Rangiku's condition
is even more critical.

277

Here goes.

278

skills are still sharp.

evaluate its capabilities.

either of those two cows.

-Ha.

287
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:42,673
In my opinion, they're all the
same, judging by that attack.

How disappointing.

316

APACCI (OFFSCREEN): Ayon
was too strong for them,

and they were too cocky.

318

It serves them right.

Inexcusable!

332
00:21:59,673 --> 00:22:03,306
Making your head captain come
out here to the front lines?

333
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,640
You squad members are
quite a disappointment.

336
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:46,995
SPEAKER (NARRATING): Let's go.

337
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:48,095
Our battle has just begun.

338
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:49,528
SPEAKER (NARRATING):
You're right.

339
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:50,595
Our battle has just begun!

340
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:52,095
SPEAKER (NARRATING):
Isn't that what

341
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:54,262
they say just before
they cancel your series!

342
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:56,195
SPEAKER (NARRATING):
All right, soul reapers.

343
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:57,162
It's time to focus.

344
00:23:57,195 --> 00:23:58,262
Our battle has just begin!

345
00:23:58,295 --> 00:23:59,662
SPEAKER (NARRATING):
Head captain,

346
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:03,195
do you know something we don't?
