[music - yui, "rolling star"]

2
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:51,850
-Soul reapers.

3
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:55,084
The spiritual guardians to
the world of the living.

4
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:58,217
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

5
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,384
of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

6
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:04,084
Sosuke Aizen, who
betrayed the Soul Society

7
00:02:04,117 --> 00:02:08,350
and left the Seireitei in chaos,
has set his plan into motion.

8
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:11,184
Arrancars have arrived
in Karakura Town.

9
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:14,317
Using the Hogyoku, Aizen
has created these Arrancars

10
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,684
by shattering the boundary
between soul reapers

11
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:17,284
and hollows.

12
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,350
-Ichigo prepared to battle
Ulquiorra and Yammi, who

13
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:29,984
were sent into
Karakura Town by Aizen.

14
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,617
But the voice of the
Hollow within Ichigo

15
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,284
made it impossible
for him to fight.

16
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:41,150
Luckily he was saved
by Kisuke and Yoruichi.

17
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:44,350
-It's time we deliver
our report to Lord Aizen.

18
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:47,217
I'll tell him the soul
reaper he's interested

19
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,450
in has no value whatsoever.

20
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,650
-It's all because I'm weak.

21
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:57,650
I don't know what I can
do other than feel guilty.

22
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,084
-Yo.

23
00:03:06,117 --> 00:03:07,350
What's going on, Ichigo?

24
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,184
-R-- Renji?

25
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:14,517
Toshiro?

26
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,850
Wait a minute, what are
you guys doing here?

27
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:22,550
-That's Captain
Hitsugaya to you.

28
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:26,084
-Yeah, fine, but I don't
understand why you're here.

29
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:27,617
-Orders from above.

30
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,884
Looks like there's a major storm
brewing with the Arrancars.

31
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:33,884
We were sent here to join forces
with the substitute soul reaper

32
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:35,750
and prepare for the battle.

33
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:37,284
-Arrancar?

34
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,950
What the hell's that?

35
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:40,284
-What?

36
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:41,784
You're not serious, are you?

37
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:44,517
You mean you've been fighting
these guys without any idea who

38
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,517
you were dealing with?

39
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,884
-What are you talking about?

40
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,650
-You dummy.

41
00:03:51,684 --> 00:03:54,350
He's talking about those guys
who beat you up the other day.

42
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:05,017
-Rukia.

43
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:12,317
-Whoa.

44
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,984
Is that Rukia?

45
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:15,117
-Yeah.

46
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,484
I think she just came
in through the window.

47
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:19,484
-Well, she hasn't been
at school for a while.

48
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:20,684
-Idiot.

49
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:23,050
Wherever she was, I'm sure
that there were doors.

50
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:25,284
-Anyway, it's those other
kids I'm worried about.

51
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,417
-What the hell was that for?

52
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,350
Hey!

53
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:42,117
-It was for your pathetic face.

54
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,384
Come on.

55
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:47,717
-I should have figured
here this wouldn't be easy.

56
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,084
-That's Ichigo.

57
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:51,450
He manages to make
everything difficult.

58
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:53,484
-Well, you can't blame
Rukia for giving him

59
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:55,750
hell with that stupid
look on his face.

60
00:04:55,784 --> 00:04:57,484
-You thought he looked stupid?

61
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,017
Oh, I don't know,
I thought he looked

62
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,417
kind of helpless and cute.

63
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,184
-Have you ever seen a guy you
didn't think was cute, Rangiku?

64
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:04,317
-Who asked you, Yumichika?

65
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,384
Why don't you mind
your own business?

66
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:07,384
-What about Ikkaku?

67
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:08,650
He said something too.

68
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,884
-Leave me out of this.

69
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:11,284
-This is ridiculous.

70
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:12,684
All of you shut up.

71
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:14,884
-What did those
guys do to Ichigo?

72
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:17,084
They knocked him unconscious.

73
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,950
Or maybe they killed him.

74
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:19,884
-Whatever.

75
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,050
All I know is that
they don't look

76
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:22,817
like anybody I
want to mess with.

77
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,117
Look at them.

78
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,850
Do you see the tattoos all
over the guy with the red hair?

79
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:27,684
-[growls]

80
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:29,117
-Don't let it get to you, Renji.

81
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,550
It's just humans and
their silly chatter.

82
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,650
-But she doesn't
look so scary and he

83
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:35,984
looks like an elementary
student with silver hair.

84
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:37,750
Eyebrow boy can't be too tough.

85
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:40,550
And then there's baldy.

86
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:46,050
-Well, whoever just called
me baldy, step forward.

87
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:48,250
-Don't let it get
to you, Ikkaku.

88
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:49,984
It's just the human
silly chatter.

89
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,517
-Where do you
think you're going?

90
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,484
Come back here.

91
00:05:58,384 --> 00:06:00,684
-I can't believe I got
stuck with these idiots.

92
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:07,950
-So Rukia, what's all this
about and where are we going?

93
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:09,017
-Be quiet.

94
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,484
You just keep running
and I'll navigate.

95
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:14,817
Found it.

96
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,417
Right there.

97
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:20,717
-Huh?

98
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,250
I don't see anything.

99
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:25,984
[explosion]

100
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,384
[roaring]

101
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,917
-A Hollow.

102
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,617
-Yes.

103
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,217
Now go get it!

104
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,684
[screaming]

105
00:06:42,717 --> 00:06:43,684
-That hurt.

106
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,150
Wow you're an ugly one.

107
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:12,017
-What are you doing?

108
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,050
Hurry up and kill it.

109
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:16,250
You call that fighting?

110
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:17,684
Just what are you waiting for?

111
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:19,984
-Nothing.

112
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:21,517
-Then stand up and fight.

113
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,084
You shouldn't have
any trouble at all

114
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:25,150
defeating a Hollow
like this one.

115
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:26,350
-I know that.

116
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:27,417
Don't tell me what to do.

117
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:43,117
All right, you, I'm gonna--

118
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,050
--[laughs] I'm getting closer
and closer to the circus now,

119
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,150
aren't I?

120
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:53,450
At this rate it won't
be too much longer.

121
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:59,117
[laughs] Pretty soon now
I'm going to swallow you up.

122
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,984
-No, get out!

123
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:01,050
-Until you completely disappear!

124
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:01,550
-Stop!

125
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:03,750
-[laughs]

126
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,617
-I think I know what happened.

127
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,884
You got beaten by the Arrancars.

128
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,417
Now you can't function
as a soul reaper.

129
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,517
What are you so afraid of?

130
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,717
I know they hurt Orihime.

131
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,950
They got Chad too, Ichigo.

132
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:34,350
So what?

133
00:08:34,384 --> 00:08:37,250
Are you really so weak now that
you would lose heart and give

134
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:40,250
up over something like that?

135
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:42,517
Is it because you're
afraid of losing?

136
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,484
Or maybe you're
afraid you won't be

137
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:47,084
able to protect your friends?

138
00:08:47,117 --> 00:08:51,117
Or is it you're afraid of
the Hollow that you know

139
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,350
is inside you.

140
00:08:53,384 --> 00:08:55,050
[roaring]

141
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,917
-If you're afraid of
losing, then you just

142
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,650
have to get stronger.

143
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:03,217
If you're afraid you
won't be able to protect

144
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,450
your friends from harm, you have
to get stronger and make a vow

145
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:08,417
that you'll never let them down.

146
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,217
But if you're afraid
of the Hollow within,

147
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,650
then you must not only become
strong enough to destroy it,

148
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:17,650
but pledge to yourself
that you will.

149
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:20,584
Even if no one believes in
you, stick out your chest

150
00:09:20,617 --> 00:09:22,417
and scream your defiance.

151
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,117
But that is the
kind of man you are.

152
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,617
I know it in my heart.

153
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:37,050
[yelling]

154
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,984
-You're awfully noisy.

155
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:47,984
Both of you.

156
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,917
Here I come.

157
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:04,850
-Orihime!

158
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,817
-Rukia?

159
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,450
-Hi.

160
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,017
It's been a while.

161
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,750
Or maybe not so long.

162
00:10:13,784 --> 00:10:16,017
-It looks like your
injuries have healed.

163
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,084
-They have.

164
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,750
Thanks to you I'm
fine now, Orihime.

165
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,117
-Oh, you're welcome.

166
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,917
It was nothing, really.

167
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,050
So how long are you going to
be staying with us this time?

168
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,884
-I'll tell you all
about that later, OK?

169
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:29,917
Hey.

170
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,684
[panting]

171
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,717
-Are you all right?

172
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:38,684
-Orihime.

173
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:45,484
-You're sorry that you
were so weak, right?

174
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,217
-Right.

175
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,184
I'm sorry, Orihime.

176
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:56,550
I'll get stronger.

177
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:58,717
I will get stronger.

178
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,350
I promise you.

179
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:05,650
So that next time I
won't let them hurt you.

180
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:15,017
-Thank goodness.

181
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,017
He's back to his old self again.

182
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:22,250
Thank you, Ichigo.

183
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:29,050
Thank you too, Rukia.

184
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:30,550
And welcome back.

185
00:11:45,186 --> 00:11:46,519
-I tell you, it's true.

186
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:48,619
At the convenience store if
you try mixing two parts ginger

187
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:51,352
ale and one part yogurt drink,
it tastes just like hair tonic.

188
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:52,419
I kid you not.

189
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,686
I think I drank a gallon of it.

190
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,052
Man, what a headache.

191
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:58,819
-That sounds like something
only you would say, Mr. Asano.

192
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,019
You're lucky it
didn't poison you.

193
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,952
-Hey, you don't even
sound like you care.

194
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:05,419
What if I had gone into some
kind of tonic induced coma

195
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:06,252
and never recovered.

196
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:06,752
Mizuiro.

197
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:07,886
I'm serious.

198
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,652
Do you think I should go
get my stomach pumped?

199
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,252
-Well, I don't know
about that, but it

200
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:15,686
sounds like there's something
going on our classroom.

201
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,252
-You're right.

202
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:18,586
Never fear.

203
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:20,286
You can count on Keigo to go
in and assess the situation.

204
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:24,319
Hey!

205
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,052
Who's the one causing
a disturbance in here?

206
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:27,452
Don't you know that's my job?

207
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:32,486
-Who are you?

208
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,552
Well, speak up,
shaggy little worm.

209
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:37,952
Start talking or I'll
slice you up into sausage

210
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:40,686
and feed you to the
dog for breakfast.

211
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,352
-Take it easy, will you, baldy?

212
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,019
Chill out.

213
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:46,352
-Keep slapping my head
like that, Rangiku.

214
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:48,819
That is, if you want
to lose your hand.

215
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,186
-Shut up.

216
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:53,952
Cut out the whining or I'll
have to tell Yachiru about this.

217
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:54,719
-No, no, no.

218
00:12:54,752 --> 00:12:56,319
Please, don't do that, OK?

219
00:12:56,352 --> 00:12:58,486
I'll keep it under
control, I swear.

220
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,619
-I shouldn't have to remind
you in the first place,

221
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:02,552
so don't make me do it again.

222
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:05,386
Now as for the rest of you
idiots, let's get moving.

223
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:06,886
We've got a lot to do.

224
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,552
-Your reference to idiots
couldn't have included me, now,

225
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:11,086
could it?

226
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,352
-Of course not.

227
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:14,519
You're not like the
rest of them, Captain.

228
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:17,319
You're letting your persecution
complex get the best of you

229
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:19,586
again.

230
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:20,952
-Uniform.

231
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:23,852
Maybe you should let me check
those shirt buttons for you.

232
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:30,652
-Think he's all right?

233
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:31,852
Sure went down hard.

234
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:32,886
-Forget him.

235
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:33,786
We have to go.

236
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:38,586
-Huh?

237
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,286
Hey, what are you doing
down there, Mr. Asano?

238
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,286
You're liable to get
stepped on that way.

239
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:43,052
-Never mind.

240
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:44,386
Just stop being so formal.

241
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:53,619
-Huh?

242
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,186
[crying] Rukia!

243
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:09,752
-Same old Kon, I see.

244
00:14:09,786 --> 00:14:12,219
-Yeah, only one person would
stomp me without hesitation

245
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:15,452
after we hadn't seen each
other for a whole summer.

246
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,352
It has to be Rukia.

247
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:20,752
I'm so happy I could cry.

248
00:14:20,786 --> 00:14:22,552
-Rukia, quit fooling
around with him

249
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:23,919
and just get in here already.

250
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:24,886
-OK.

251
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:27,219
Same old tiny bedroom
of yours, I see.

252
00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:29,586
-Why do you have to go and
point out how small it is?

253
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,452
It's no fair comparing it
to Byakuya's big old house.

254
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:33,286
RUKIA: You're right.

255
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:34,052
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:35,419
It just slipped out.

257
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:37,052
ICHIGO: Yeah, right.

258
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:38,719
Hey, don't sit on my bed.

259
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,519
RUKIA: You sure
are grumpy today.

260
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:41,919
ICHIGO: You shut up.

261
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:43,786
And I don't care what you think.

262
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,319
You can sit on the floor.

263
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,686
RUKIA: I can't believe
how stingy you are.

264
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:51,052
-I wondered why there
wasn't anyone downstairs.

265
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:52,819
What are you two doing?

266
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:53,986
Eavesdropping?

267
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:54,652
-Shh.

268
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,952
It's an emergency.

269
00:14:55,986 --> 00:14:58,986
Ichigo brought a girl
home from school with him.

270
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,886
-He's brought other
girls home before too

271
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,852
and it was no big deal.

272
00:15:02,886 --> 00:15:04,519
Tatsuki, for one.

273
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:06,252
-But this one's not Tatsuki.

274
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:11,486
This girl's got, um, more
of a curvy type figure.

275
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,719
-OK, but maybe since
Tatsuki's gotten older,

276
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:15,686
her body's sexier now too.

277
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,952
-Tatsuki's hot now?

278
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,152
Ooh!

279
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:20,552
-Shut up and stop your
slobbering, you old fart.

280
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,352
-Anyway, he'd have
to bring home someone

281
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:26,519
at least as hot as
Orihime to surprise me.

282
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,319
-Wow, Karin, really?

283
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:29,252
-You're right.

284
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:31,286
Ichigo could never
be that popular.

285
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:32,019
-What the hell?

286
00:15:32,052 --> 00:15:33,486
Do you ever shut up?

287
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,486
-I told you he was
going to be mad.

288
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,152
-We're sorry, Ichigo.

289
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:40,286
-I can't believe
nosy my sisters are.

290
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:41,952
And my father's even worse.

291
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:44,552
-Your family's always been
good for a laugh at least.

292
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:45,986
-Shut up.

293
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,152
Just tell me about
these Arrancars.

294
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:50,452
Do you know what they
are and what they want?

295
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:51,986
-Mm-hmm.

296
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,852
-So then tell me why
I'm being targeted.

297
00:15:54,886 --> 00:15:55,852
RENJI: Just a second.

298
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:56,619
-Huh?

299
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:58,419
I know that voice.

300
00:15:58,452 --> 00:15:59,186
Renji?

301
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,486
Are you there?

302
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,552
RENJI: If you want to know
about the Arrancar, just hang

303
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,319
on We'll tell you all about it.

304
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,186
-Hey, Ichigo.

305
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,652
It's been a while.

306
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:14,986
Or maybe not.

307
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:16,686
-You jerks, what the hell?

308
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,819
Did you forget how did
to use a damn door?

309
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,486
--[laughs] If you need a new
light bulb, here you go.

310
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,452
-That was stupid.

311
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,119
-Now that's no way
to greet old friends.

312
00:16:29,152 --> 00:16:32,519
I'm hoping we'll
have some fun here.

313
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:35,252
-Oh, wow.

314
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,219
Your buttons are too tight.

315
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:39,152
Let me adjust them
for you, please.

316
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,686
There's the toy lost its mind?

317
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,552
-No.

318
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:47,986
He's always like that.

319
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:53,919
-Arrancars are
essentially Hollows,

320
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:55,686
but ones that have
removed their masks

321
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:59,419
and gained the power of both
Hollows and soul reapers.

322
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,986
Until recently they were
a few and imperfect,

323
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,952
but now that Aizen has
begun manipulating them

324
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:07,119
with the Hogyoku, mature,
fully developed Arrancar

325
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,886
are being born.

326
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:11,719
Like the two that you
ran into the other day.

327
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:13,119
Are you with me so far?

328
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:14,452
-Yeah.

329
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:16,386
But it'd probably be clearer
without the crappy drawings.

330
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,819
-The Soul Society was
willing to sit back and see

331
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:24,886
if anything developed
with the Arrancars,

332
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,019
but that was before
Aizen got involved.

333
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:30,319
We also had to deal with
three of our captains

334
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:32,286
having gone over to
the enemy's side.

335
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,352
On top of all the uproar
with the Bount incident.

336
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:39,719
Meanwhile, the fully
developed Arrancars

337
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:41,686
were completed much sooner
than we had expected.

338
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:43,686
And now that they've been
sent into this world,

339
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:45,986
we can't afford to sit
back and wait any longer.

340
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:50,752
They selected a team
to come here at once.

341
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:51,952
That's us.

342
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:53,419
-Who made the selections?

343
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:55,952
-Head Captain Yamamoto did.

344
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:58,886
-Central 46 has been
vacant ever since Aizen

345
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,786
killed all of the leaders.

346
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:03,552
So as of now, ultimate
decision making

347
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:05,552
has reverted to
the head captain.

348
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:09,052
Rukia was chosen because she's
the one who knows you best.

349
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:10,019
-Not true.

350
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:11,919
I was chosen because
of my abilities.

351
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:14,186
-There weren't many
officers to choose from.

352
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,519
I was closer to Rukia than most.

353
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:19,186
So they chose me.

354
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:22,952
After that, I was told to choose
outside the captain class who

355
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:25,752
I most trusted to
fight by my side.

356
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:29,819
So that's why I asked
Ikkaku to accompany me.

357
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:32,486
Then Yumichika told
me he wanted to come.

358
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:35,152
And when Rangiku heard about it,
she said it sounded interesting

359
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:36,452
and she wanted in too.

360
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:37,919
But then Yumichika
said he wouldn't

361
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:39,352
go if Rangiku was
coming and then

362
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,686
Rangiku swore she'd kill us
both if we left without her.

363
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,952
So in the end, Captain
Hitsugaya had to come along just

364
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:45,186
to supervise the two of them.

365
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:46,719
And here we are.

366
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,152
-Is this a mission or a party?

367
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:52,452
-In any case, we are not
sure why, but we know

368
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:54,952
-Aizen has his eye on
you, Ichigo Kurosaki,

369
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:56,386
and that's not good.

370
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,686
-Hey, Captain Hitsugaya,
you should come down

371
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,052
through the ceiling with us.

372
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:01,719
We didn't do that
much damage after all.

373
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:04,152
-Have you been out on the
window ledge all this time?

374
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,586
In plain sight?

375
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:07,419
What if the neighbors
report a silver haired

376
00:19:07,452 --> 00:19:09,186
elementary student burglar?

377
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,086
-Shut up.

378
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,919
-It's true enough
that an Arrancar

379
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,419
is born when the mask is
removed from a Hollow?

380
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:17,852
But simply taking the mask
off a run of the mill Hollow

381
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:20,119
wouldn't result in anything
particularly dangerous.

382
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:25,619
Anyone who was serious about
declaring war on the Soul

383
00:19:25,652 --> 00:19:29,086
Society would need something
big, something strong.

384
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,986
Menos level and above.

385
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:33,152
-Above a Menos?

386
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:34,152
Hold on.

387
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:35,552
Are you trying to
tell me that there

388
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:37,852
are Hollows out there that are
even stronger than the Menos?

389
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,052
-Yes.

390
00:19:40,086 --> 00:19:42,186
Well actually, to be
more specific about it,

391
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:43,619
there are three
different classes

392
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:46,486
of beings under
the name of Menos.

393
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,152
The first is the Gillion, the
lowest class within the Menos.

394
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:52,386
And there are many of them.

395
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:54,152
Their main characteristic
is that they all

396
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:56,619
look exactly the same.

397
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:59,119
The Menos that you
banished from this world

398
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:01,452
soon after you gained the
power of a soul reaper

399
00:20:01,486 --> 00:20:03,919
was of this kind.

400
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,386
I guess you could call
it a foot soldier.

401
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:09,152
-That was a foot soldier?

402
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:11,052
-They're big, but they're slow.

403
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,986
And their intelligence
is only slightly higher

404
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,086
than a wild animal.

405
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,919
It's hardly any trouble
at all for a captain

406
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:17,752
to subdue and kill one of them.

407
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:20,919
The problem is the next level.

408
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:23,586
This class is
called the Adjuchas.

409
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,719
They're somewhat smaller
than the Gillions

410
00:20:25,752 --> 00:20:27,219
and there are fewer of them.

411
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:30,286
But they are highly intelligent
and much better fighters

412
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,552
and they control the
large numbers of Gillions.

413
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:38,719
And finally, there
are the Vasto Lordes,

414
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:41,719
the highest class
within the Menos.

415
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:44,719
They are equal to
humans in size.

416
00:20:44,752 --> 00:20:47,719
And there are very few of
them with in Hueco Mundo.

417
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:50,219
But I have to give
it to you straight.

418
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:53,186
The grim truth is that
these Vasto Lordes

419
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,186
are believed to be even more
powerful than the soul reaper

420
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:59,186
captains are.

421
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:01,452
Exactly how much
power the Menos have

422
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:05,786
gained by turning into
Arrancars is still unknown.

423
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:07,752
But now that three
of our captains

424
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:10,719
defected to lead
the Menos, there

425
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:13,219
is one thing we can be sure of.

426
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:16,686
If Aizen now has more than
10 of those Vasto Lordes

427
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:27,986
under his control, then
the Soul Society is doomed.

428
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:53,352
