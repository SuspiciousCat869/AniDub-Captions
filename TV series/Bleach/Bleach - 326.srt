1
00:01:57,945 --> 00:01:59,611
Ichigo Kurosaki.

2
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:04,978
I've been expecting you.
We'll meet again,
here in the Soul Society.

3
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:15,678
Returning to the Soul Society
is going to be far riskier than
when you went the first time.

4
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:19,645
<i>Kisuke did warn me.</i>
<i>And I haven't forgotten.</i>

5
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:23,578
<i>There's no choice.</i>
<i>I have to get to the</i>
<i>Soul Society quickly!</i>

6
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:29,711
Gokei.
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

7
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:48,578
There is one thing that
the both of us share.

8
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:51,745
<i>To protect my pride...</i>

9
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:55,545
<i>I'll use any means necessary.</i>

10
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:23,245
I knew we would face each other
in battle, sooner or later.
It was only a matter of time.

11
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,411
I can see that
you're wounded.

12
00:03:28,578 --> 00:03:29,978
It won't be an issue.

13
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:34,278
Just as I expected.
You are predictable.

14
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:36,978
I would never run, no
matter what the situation.

15
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,011
Stand aside, I'm coming through.

16
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:43,511
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

17
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:51,545
[in unison]
There can only be one
Byakuya Kuchiki!

18
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,545
Kenny, I'm not so sure
you should be doing this.

19
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:09,111
Maybe you should have
rested a little bit longer.

20
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:11,278
You're walking like
a tired old man.

21
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:14,045
You're wrong.
And you're worried
for nothing.

22
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:17,245
The fact is, I'm
feeling awesome.
I'm ready for battle.

23
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:18,945
Hmmm...

24
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,445
[gasp]

25
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:32,945
Kenny, it's one of
those imposters!

26
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:36,545
You're right, Yachiru.
But it makes no
difference to me.

27
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,478
So how did you phrase it?

28
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:47,145
"When the leader of the
Punishment Force draws
her sword, an execution
battle is imminent."

29
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:47,811
Right?

30
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:57,678
So it's an ambush, is it?
Well, I sure hope you guys
are gonna make this fun.

31
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,612
Kill him!

32
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,945
I can feel it.
Many battles are
just beginning!

33
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:35,378
Oh!

34
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:02,745
Insolent youth!

35
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:08,678
<i>We have to find Kageroza</i>
<i>and apprehend him quickly!</i>

36
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:11,511
Ah!

37
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:22,678
Oh, Shiro?

38
00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:25,011
Momo?!

39
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:40,111
So how does it look?

40
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:45,511
There's a lot of fighting
going on, and it seems the
Captains haven't made it to
Kageroza's location yet.

41
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:47,078
What about Ichigo?

42
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,711
He appears to be making
good time on his way to
the Soul Society.

43
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,611
That's a relief.

44
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:56,445
<i>Except it's all</i>
<i>going too smoothly.</i>

45
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,078
<i>Kageroza couldn't possibly</i>
<i>have missed Ichigo's presence.</i>

46
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:10,578
What's with the
provocative look,
you lech!

47
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:14,978
I know what you're up to,
and you can stop stripping
her with your eyes, buddy!

48
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:17,545
Hey, I'm not a perv,
like you!

49
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:18,845
What'd you say?!

50
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,745
You and I
need to talk.

51
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:23,778
Hey, let go of me!
I have a right to
speak my mind!

52
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,378
You can't treat me like
some kind of stuffed
animal or something!

53
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:28,745
<i>Help! I'm being toy-napped!</i>

54
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:31,445
So. What is it?

55
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:34,078
There's something I
want to ask about.

56
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:35,978
When you were with Nozomi...

57
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:41,511
Did you notice anything
different in the way
she behaved, anything
out of the ordinary?

58
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,278
I'm not sure what you mean.

59
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:46,245
I'm trying to figure out
why Kageroza's after her.

60
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:52,378
Once I return and I have
retrieved Nozomi...

61
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:56,378
<i>Then I will be able to</i>
<i>completely show all of</i>
<i>you my true power.</i>

62
00:07:56,778 --> 00:08:00,845
<i>When that occurs, not only</i>
<i>the Soul Society but also</i>
<i>the World of the Living,</i>

63
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:03,678
<i>will be forced to exist</i>
<i>under my control.</i>

64
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:05,845
She is the key to all of this.

65
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:12,978
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>My guess is, that girl is</i>
<i>carrying around some kind of</i>
<i>secret. It's something big.</i>

66
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:18,745
<i>[Mayuri]</i>
<i>It could be that what he</i>
<i>wants is something he's</i>
<i>hidden in her body.</i>

67
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:23,311
After mulling it over,
that's what we concluded.

68
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:26,645
But of course, that doesn't
answer the key question.

69
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:29,078
What is it that's
hidden inside her?

70
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:35,211
What is the secret that
Kageroza needs that can
control both the Soul Society
and the World of the Living?

71
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:38,945
Do you have any idea
what it might be?

72
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:40,411
Hmm.

73
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:43,611
Something hidden inside
her body, you say?

74
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:48,611
All right, I admit it!

75
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:51,911
I did see her naked,
but it was an accident,
and it was just one time!

76
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:56,078
<i>You have to believe me,</i>
<i>it was a coincidence that</i>
<i>I happened to walk in on</i>
<i>her at the wrong moment!</i>

77
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:58,445
[sigh]
<i>It wasn't like I was</i>
<i>worried about her or anything!</i>

78
00:08:58,478 --> 00:08:59,878
Anyway, the bottom line is,

79
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,945
if she knows about it and
doesn't want to tell us,

80
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:03,378
we can't force it out of her!

81
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,745
Well obviously you like
her and don't want to
see her get hurt!

82
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:07,678
Umm??

83
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:10,278
Wait a minute, what the hell
are you talking about?!

84
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:13,945
No! Are you out of your mind?
You've got to be kidding me!

85
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:16,445
No way would I be
attracted to her!

86
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:18,178
She's a violent smart-ass!

87
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:22,211
I don't have any feelings for
her, and I don't know anything!
That's my final word!

88
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:26,645
<i>I really don't care if</i>
<i>she comes or goes!</i>
<i>That's how little</i>
<i>interest I have!</i>

89
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:28,778
[sigh]

90
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,711
Augh!

91
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:33,378
Why did you
do that?

92
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,178
Just because.

93
00:09:36,411 --> 00:09:37,845
[computer beeps rapidly]

94
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:38,478
Huh?

95
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,711
What does that mean?

96
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:41,211
It's good news.

97
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,578
Looks like Ichigo made
it to the Soul Society.

98
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:45,511
Hold on...

99
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,178
This is way off the mark.
Kisuke must have made a
mistake in his calculations.

100
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:01,678
Not really.
I summoned you here.

101
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,145
<i>Kageroza!</i>

102
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:11,578
Don't blame your friend.
I tweaked the Precipice
World a bit.

103
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,211
What the hell for?

104
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:16,045
Heh heh heh heh heh!

105
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:17,078
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Yaah!</i>

106
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:22,078
You said you'd eventually
control both the Soul Society
and the World of the Living!

107
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:23,978
How are you gonna
pull that off?!

108
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:27,778
Why is Nozomi so important?!

109
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,378
Heh heh heh heh!

110
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:31,178
This is funny to you huh?!

111
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:34,445
What did you hide inside her?!

112
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,645
You're just full of questions,
aren't you, young man?

113
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:44,811
I'd love to answer them all,
but I don't have the time.
I'm on a tight schedule.

114
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:50,778
The more pressing question you
should be asking yourself is,
why did I summon you here?

115
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:57,311
The answer is really quite
simple: To erase you.

116
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:14,700
Oh, Shiro?

117
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,267
Momo?

118
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,167
What in the world
are you doing here?

119
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,400
Well...

120
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:29,567
When I woke up, everyone from
Squad Twelve, who had been
looking after me, was gone.

121
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,167
I went looking for them...
and somehow, I ended up here.

122
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:40,633
Momo. You still don't look
well. You should be in bed.

123
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,667
You need to get your rest.

124
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,733
Hm. No, I'm all right.

125
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,700
It's dangerous.
Multiple battles are
going on right now.

126
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,167
I'm about to engage
the enemy, as well.

127
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,867
You really should find
somewhere safe to go.

128
00:11:56,467 --> 00:12:00,100
Thank you, Shiro.
But, I'll be just fine.

129
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,233
[fainting gasp]

130
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,733
See what I mean? You're weak.
Don't strain yourself.
You need to rest right now.

131
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,967
I'm sorry Shiro.

132
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,133
I'm so sorry.

133
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,633
[gasp]

134
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,633
Not gonna happen.
The truth is,
you can't kill me.

135
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,400
Even so, can you kill me, Shiro?

136
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:46,400
Can you stab me... once more?

137
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,200
[gasp]

138
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,633
Haah!

139
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:56,633
Augh!

140
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:07,533
I am sorry, Shiro.
The truth is,
it's not my fault.

141
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,633
[pained gasps]

142
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:13,600
It's Kageroza's fault,
for coming up with this idea!

143
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,733
Yaa ha ha!
Take 'em all down!

144
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,733
Oh, I will, in time...

145
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,867
<i>This is nothing,</i>
<i>compared to</i>
<i>fighting myself!</i>

146
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,433
<i>He was as strong as I was,</i>
<i>and yet I still won!</i>

147
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,233
[giggle]

148
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:55,433
<i>It was the fight of my life!</i>
<i>My body is still tingling!</i>
<i>Now I want more!</i>

149
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:02,267
You never know when to give up,
Kenpachi Zaraki!

150
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:08,000
Whatever you're feeling,
you should barely be able
to stand up after
fighting your own Reigai!

Heh! What makes you
such an expert?

152
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:20,000
They're all planning to
attack us at the same time.
What are we going to do?

153
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:23,233
What can I do?
I'll just have to
take them down!

154
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:26,033
Yachiru. Get ready to dodge.

Heh.

159
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:54,000
He took us all on, and we
weren't able to lay a
finger on him! His Spirit
Energy is ridiculous!

160
00:14:54,267 --> 00:14:54,900

<i>Oh, absolutely!</i>
<i>How 'bout you, Kenny?</i>

163
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:09,433
Not a scratch. These guys
were no challenge at all.
I barely raised a sweat.
I'm totally unsatisfied!

164
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,100
So what's the deal?
Are you gonna make
this fun for me?

165
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,233
Cat got your tongue,
Soi Fon?

166
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,167
She's behind you!

172
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:45,200
Sorry I'm a little late.
Allow me to assist you.

173

You want to assist?
I don't think so.

174

She's all mine.
I can take her
by myself.
Don't interfere.

175
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,000
Hm. Don't worry about me.

176
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:59,400
I'll admit it took time to get
through the Precipice World,
but my health is strong,
and I'm ready to go.

177
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:03,700
Are you hard of hearing?
Who says I'm worried about you?
Just stay out of my way!

178
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:07,200
Captain Soi Fon!
I'm going to be
your opponent!

179
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,333
What?! Have you
completely lost it?!

180
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,267
Yeah! Go for it, Bow-Wow!

181
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,200
Tch. You took the
fun right out of it.

182
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,733
I'm going on ahead,
after Kageroza.

183

Bye-bye!
Have a good battle!

Rrrgh!

You attacked Shiro and hurt him,
didn't you?!
That's unforgivable!

199
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,733
It wasn't my fault!

200
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:37,067
I didn't do it because I
wanted to, believe me!

201
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:40,700
Huh?

202
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:48,633
Shiro!

203
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,467
Help me, please!

00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:56,000
Bakudo Number Four! Hainawa!

Shiro, please,
you have to help me!

[stunned breaths]

208
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,400
Don't let her trick you!
She's an impostor!

209
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,600
I am not!
You're the
impostor!

210
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,600
Shut your mouth!
Impostor!
Yah!

211
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,200
Please believe me, Shiro!

212
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:17,767
Stop it now!

213
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:19,733
Uhn!

214
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,867
Urrgh!

215
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,267
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,967
So sorry.

217
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:35,767
[in unison]
Now snap... Tobiume.

218
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,633
UWAAAGH!

219
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,333
We're both sorry.

220
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,300
This is Kageroza's
strategy.

221
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,333
The truth is, we're
weaker than you, Shiro.

222
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,733
He said if you
dropped your guard...

223
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:58,833
...We'd be able
to defeat you.

224
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,433
He knew something we didn't;
That you could never attack us,
Shiro.

225
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:05,600
We're so sorry.

226
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,067
Please don't hate us
for what we've done.

227
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:13,233
So you're
both Reigai?
That's good.

[both gasp]

229
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:15,633
What did you say?

230
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,200
How can you say
something like that?

231
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,000
How can this be good?
We tricked you!

232
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,733
It is good. Because I didn't
have to get the real Momo
involved in this mess.

233
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:29,567
[gasp]

234
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,433
I made a vow...

235
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:35,300
To never hurt...
Momo ever again!

this quick.

So close, but we failed.
And I'm glad.

[small sigh]

245
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,533
I have to tell you, Toshiro.
You're too naive.

246
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,500
You've been here in the
Soul Society from the start?

247
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,633
The whole time.

248
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:26,433
I was taking care of some
business. And you?

249
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,100
I had some unfinished
business, as well.

250

Hey. Be careful, don't
push yourself. I'll join
you as soon as I can.

[amused sigh]

Erase my existence?
Why am I your target?

Heh heh heh heh heh!

254
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:53,667
Answer me!

Uh??

Really.
