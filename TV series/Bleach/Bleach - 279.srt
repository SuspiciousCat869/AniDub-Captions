1
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:16,900
We have company.

2
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,966
It's been a while,
hasn't it... Sosuke?

3
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,153
Well, look at that. A
lot of familiar faces
decided to drop by and
say hello.

4
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,320
Surprised to see us?

5
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:28,853
You shouldn't be.

6
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:33,086
Each of us was highly
motivated to make it here
for the main event... Sosuke.

7
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,153
Heh.

8
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:43,253
Hah!

9
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:48,420
What the hell?
Who are they?

10
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:53,353
It can't be!

11
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:57,453
Shinji... Hirako!

12
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:09,320
Shinji Hirako. Rojuro
Ohtoribashi. Love
Aikawa. Hachigen
Ushoda...

13
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:16,453
...Lisa Yadomaru.
I hereby assign all
five of you to form the
investigational unit in

14
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:19,286
charge of this vanishing
Souls case!

15
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:10,486
Sosuke...!

16
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:16,253
I suppose, when it comes
right down to it, that
you owe your friends
here an apology...

17
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:23,553
Because you were chosen
by me, they ended up on
the ground as casualties,
through no fault of their own.

18
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,753
...Captain Hirako.

19
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,220
Sosuke!

20
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,286
[struggling]

21
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,586
What's happening to me?

22
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,586
[struggling]

23
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:49,086
Sosuke!! What's
going on?!

24
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:58,186
[struggling]

25
00:05:00,786 --> 00:05:01,953
Goodbye.

26
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,653
I must commend you---You
people have provided
wonderful research
material.

27
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:18,120
[screaming]

28
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:30,986
Well... Unexpected
guests... How very
interesting.

29
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,553
<i>K-Kisuke!</i>

30
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,453
[panting]

31
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:43,153
Why'd you come here?
You're such an idiot!

32
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:52,686
So... Lieutenant Aizen.

33
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,320
Yes?

34
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,820
What have you done?

35
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:56,753
Nothing.

36
00:05:59,386 --> 00:06:06,020
As you can see, I
happened upon the members
of the Soul investigation
unit. They seem to have

37
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:10,953
been injured in battle. I
was merely trying to save
their lives.

38
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:18,886
<i>Injured in battle? You</i>
<i>call these 'injuries'?</i>
<i>You're dancing around</i>
<i>the truth.</i>

39
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,220
This is Hollowfication.

40
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,620
First it's the vanishing
souls...

41
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,553
Squad members
disappearing like they'd
been erased. And now,
what you see here...

42
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,986
It can only be one thing.

43
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:44,453
...Hollowfication
experiments.

44
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,120
Clear out of the way!
Captain Urahara!

45
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:55,886
Hado Number Eighty-Eight!

46
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:59,353
Hiryu Gekizoku Shinten
Raiho!

47
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:14,386
Bakudo Number Eighty-One.

48
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:16,320
Danku.

49
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:33,220
It can't be...!

50
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:38,286
My Kido was stopped by a
lieutenant...? Using a
'Danku' with no incantation!

51
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:56,186
I went ahead and brought
all eight of 'em here.

52
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,786
Oh, and the 'new gigai'
prototype you were
working on, too.

53
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:08,353
If I know you, from
the very first moment
Shinji told you about

54
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:11,086
this incident, you
imagined the worst
case scenario---

55
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,453
And I bet you also came up
with the best solution to
overcome it.

56
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:28,620
It is time to pass
judgment! The captain
of Squad Five, as well
as the other seven

57
00:08:28,653 --> 00:08:35,553
captain-class members,
who were the victims of your
cruel experiments, will be
disposed of as Hollows.

58
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:45,320
Your reputation... surely
precedes you.

59
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:59,886
Kisuke did say, there
were no miscalculations.
That was the biggest
miscalculation of all.

60
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,386
As expected, everything
turned out the worst
possible way.

61
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:15,966
Kisuke got us all to this
point. We owe him big. Oh,
and Sosuke Aizen, too.

62
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:30,383
Let's do this.

63
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:52,116
Shinji Hirako. You've
returned. I figured you
were hiding in the World
of the Living.

64
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,750
It's been a long time
since we've seen these
people...

65
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:03,083
Is there anybody within
the Thirteen Court Guard
Squads you guys want to
say hello to?

66
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:04,016
Now is your chance.

67
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,350
Come on!

68
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:08,983
Shut your mouth, Hiyori!
I wasn't speaking to you!

69
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:12,350
Gimme a break! Why am I
supposed to assume you
weren't speaking to me?

70
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:15,516
You were talking to
everyone in the group,
and that includes me!

71
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,116
Well, I'm fine. I've got
nothin' to say to these
guys.

72
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,350
The same goes
for me, too.

73
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:25,850
There's no one in the 13
Court Guard Squads I
really want to talk to.

74
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:27,583
I'm with you there.

75
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:31,283
Ichigo isn't here. I
wonder why?

76
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:38,716
Hey! Where the hell are
you going, Lisa?!

77
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,883
Well, now that the ice is
broken, I guess I'll go
have a chat with the Head
Captain.

78
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,383
Hold on! I thought we
were together on this!

79
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:01,183
How long are you going to
lay there, playing dead?!

80
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,416
Well, now.
What a surprise.

81
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,550
Wow Lisa, look how
beautiful you've become
since the last time I saw
you.

82
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:15,650
Hmpf!

83
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:23,483
[grunting]

84
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:28,583
Stay down here and rest.
And I'll show you how
strong I've become.

85
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:30,483
Lisa...

86
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,416
I am glad to see
you're doing well.

87
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,350
You're an idiot.

88
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,583
[groaning]

89
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,950
You're right about that.

90
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,416
I suppose you've
returned, seeking
your revenge.

91
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,916
Yes, but against Sosuke.

92
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,916
I don't really care about
you, old man.

93
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,783
I have one small
complaint... It's very
irritating that you chose
to erect such an

94
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:12,216
incredibly strong barrier
around this place.

95
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,116
I mean, if we hadn't
found this guy standing
watch outside...

96
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,316
... we would've been circling
the area forever, and
wasting a lot of time.

97
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,383
I'm sorry, Head Captain.
I must admit, I wasn't
sure whether I should
let them in..

98
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,283
But considering the
situation in here...

99
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:28,716
Save your breath.

100
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,216
Shinji Hirako...

101
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,050
Huh?

102
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:37,883
Under the circumstances,
are we to consider you an
ally for now?

103
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,716
I'd have thought that
would be obvious by now.

104
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,816
Forget about it.

105
00:12:55,416 --> 00:13:00,516
By no means are we your
allies. We're Sosuke's
enemies.

106
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,283
There is someone else we
support..

107
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:07,116
And that's Ichigo
Kurosaki.

108
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,550
Ichigo Kurosaki.

109
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:15,783
Hmpf!

110
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:17,483
So, how was your little
visit?

111
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:19,416
You done talkin' with
these fools?

112
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,983
No, but we can't waste
any more time on them.

113
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:25,816
I believe the enemy is
losing patience.

114
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:34,516
Aaaah. Aaaah.

115
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,516
That kid has the most
irritating voice... I'm
trying to enjoy the
moment, here!

116
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,250
It's like listening to
somebody's nails scrape
across a blackboard.

117
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:48,883
You should open your
mind---There is meaning
to Wonderweiss's sounds.
Be patient, and watch.

118
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,916
Now what the hell is he
trying to do?

119
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:02,016
[gasping]

120
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,783
There's tons of them!

121
00:14:05,816 --> 00:14:07,750
Are all of those things
Gillians?!

122
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,016
Let's go.

123
00:14:15,516 --> 00:14:17,816
[roaring]

124
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:25,650
[yelling]

125
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,150
[yelling]

126
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,050
[grunting]

127
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:41,050
[roaring]

128
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:49,716
Mashiro Kick!

129
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:11,250
Quiet down! You're
creating quite a
disturbance.

130
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,550
You need to learn some
manners!

131
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,183
I would appreciate it if
you didn't roll these
things in my direction.

132
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:59,050
That's right. Come to me.

133
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:05,350
Good, just a little
closer...

134
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:12,050
Be captivated by my
melody!

135
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,183
[roaring]

136
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,116
[growling]

137
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,016
Wow! This is amazing!
Never seen anything like
it! They're all so
incredibly strong!

138
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,516
Who are these guys?!
They're using Hollow
powers like Ichigo!

139
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,150
What do you think?

140
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:51,016
You have to admit, we've
gotten pretty skilled with
Hollowfication, haven't we?

141
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,450
Come on, Sosuke...

142
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,383
Let's settle this now.

143
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,016
Looks like I missed.

144
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,383
What are you talking
about...?

145
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,950
You obviously hit me.

146
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:25,950
Yes, but I was trying to
slice off everything
above your left eye.

147
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:29,450
Since your head's still
intact, I don't consider
that a hit.

148
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,916
Listen to how confident
you are, Kaname.

149
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,016
From your reaction, it
must really bother you...

150
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,483
...knowing that I'm the
one who is going to kill
you.

151
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,616
Komamura?

152
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,583
Allow me to assist you,
masked visitor.

153
00:17:55,616 --> 00:18:00,550
I don't know. pal. Are
you sure you want to get
involved and help an
outcast like me?

154
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:06,516
Although, now that I
see you clearly, I think
you and I might have
quite a bit in common.

155
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:11,750
Amusing, but I saw how
you and your friends
confronted those Menos
Grande without hesitation.

156
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:17,116
That action alone was
enough. You convinced me
that you're on our side.

157
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,016
Despite your attitude, I
have decided to fight
with you!

158
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,016
There's no point
objecting! My mind
is made up!

159
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:29,450
I don't believe this
guy. Talk about pushy!
I don't know what to say
to shut him up!

160
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,183
Komamura...!

161
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:36,116
Thanks for sharing your
thoughts with everyone,
Komamura. I guess you
have a point.

162
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:56,216
I suppose I should thank
you for the help,

163
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,683
although I'm still not
sure exactly whose side
you're on.

164
00:18:59,716 --> 00:19:01,250
Hmpf!

165
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:05,683
Let me make it clear
to you. We really don't
want to help you Soul
Reapers out.

166
00:19:05,716 --> 00:19:09,250
But at the moment, we
don't have much choice.
That's how it is.

167
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:11,483
Here's some
friendly advice.

168
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:19,683
Strangers don't always
need a good reason to
team up with each other
in battle.

169
00:19:19,716 --> 00:19:23,416
Sometimes that's just the
way these situations work
out.

170
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,683
Remember, the enemy of
your enemy... is likely
to be your ally.

171
00:19:27,716 --> 00:19:29,750
Reason enough to join
forces!

172
00:19:32,483 --> 00:19:33,850
I suppose you're right.

173
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:48,316
Hey Kensei! I had my eye
on that one, you greedy
pig!

174
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,683
Oh, shut up!

175
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:53,416
You can have that big one
over on your right! And
quit complaining!

176
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,116
The big one? Over
there?

177
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,250
All right! You're
the best, Kensei!

178
00:20:03,283 --> 00:20:06,583
Uniting against a common
enemy is not that
surprising.

179
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:09,916
It's said by some to be
one of humanity's bad
habits.

180
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:11,750
But that's not true.

181
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,516
The fact is, there's a
more compelling reason.

182
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,883
Everything's driven by
a basic instinct for
survival.

183
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:23,150
There's a large body of
research that shows it's
at those times when
spiritual unions are at

184
00:20:23,183 --> 00:20:24,916
their most--- ah!

185
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,950
Why did you smack me in
the head?!

186
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,550
Because we're all
finished talking about
that subject.

187
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:34,350
So step off your pedestal
and start focusing your
energy on the problem
at hand.

188
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,550
Take a look. Does he
bother you at all?

189
00:20:39,316 --> 00:20:43,750
Tell me something...
Why'd you take off your
masks in the middle of a
fight?

190
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:46,516
We can only wear them for
three minutes at a time.

191
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,616
It's a trade-off for
being a hero.

192
00:20:53,416 --> 00:21:00,550
[winding up]
Mashiro Super Kick!

193
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:10,783
Aaaaahhh...

194
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,116
It's the exact opposite
of our first encounter.

195
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,183
I never imagined the day
would arrive when I would
have to protect the innocent
from your sword.

196
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,616
The irony is
overwhelming.

197
00:21:32,383 --> 00:21:34,450
Yes, for you.
But not me.

198
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:38,950
I knew the day would come
when you and I would
cross blades.

199
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:44,516
And it was clear to me,
that it would end with
one of us dying.

200
00:21:46,216 --> 00:21:48,850
That day has arrived.

201
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,850
I'm sorry to interfere,
Captain Komamura.

202
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:04,316
I beg you, sir... Please
let me join you in this
battle.

203
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:06,950
Shuhei!

204
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:48,352
Facing a horde of Menos
is nothing to us
Visoreds!

205
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,685
<i>So, Shinji---How many did</i>
<i>you defeat?</i>

206
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:55,252
It doesn't matter how
many I defeated!---What
matters is how many we're
going to defeat together!

207
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:56,252
Ow!

208
00:23:58,385 --> 00:23:59,918
<i>I don't want to hear that</i>
<i>from someone who still</i>
<i>hasn't taken out a single</i>
<i>Menos!</i>
