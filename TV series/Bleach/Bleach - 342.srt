1
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:00,882
Yah!

2
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:06,427
Augh!

3
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:08,599
[roar]

4
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:13,611
Hado Number
Thirty-Three!
Sokatsui!

5
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:27,711
[panting]

6
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:39,706
Are you okay?

7
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,878
Caught me off guard.
My bad.

8
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,213
Hunh Really?

9
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:47,858
Most of the time you
would've been able to
easily dodge that
attack with Flash Step.

10
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:50,832
I figured I could dodge
'em without Flash Step.

11
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,604
So instead you nearly
got yourself killed.

12
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,843
Listen, your Spirit Energy--

13
00:02:58,917 --> 00:02:59,718
What, Rukia?

14
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:00,821
Uh, nothing...

15
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:01,757
[Kurumadani]
D'AAAAGH!

16
00:03:02,258 --> 00:03:02,760
Huh?!

17
00:03:02,793 --> 00:03:03,895
You guys again!

18
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:05,532
Imoyama!

19
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:10,577
Who're you calling Imoyama?!
My name's Kurumadani!
Ku-ru-ma-da-ni!!

20
00:03:10,611 --> 00:03:12,014
Sure. Like it
really matters?

21
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:13,016
It does matter!

22
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:16,892
[Kurumadani]
Now listen up! Don't go
playing cowboy here with
the Hollows again!

23
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:20,667
Unless I say you can!
C'mon! Sheesh!! Hmph!

24
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,875
Wow Imoyama.
You need to relax.

25
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,249
Hey give him a break.
He's making a good point.

26
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,920
after all, he is
my replacement.

27
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,397
Come on. Try not
to push yourself.

28
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:36,337
Right.

29
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:46,294
[folks laughing]

30
00:03:46,328 --> 00:03:47,030
Faster!

31
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:49,067
Come on, you can do it...

32
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:51,439
Oh! you okay?!

33
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,310
[chuckle]

34
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,749
Nice, isn't it?

35
00:03:57,286 --> 00:04:00,326
Seeing everyone able
to live and enjoy their
peaceful, ordinary lives.

36
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:01,830
Heh.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,336
It sure is.

38
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:15,963
So then, when they
finally arrested
this guy,

39
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:18,970
he said the reason he
did it was because he
saw it on TV!

40
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:20,740
Can you even
believe he
said that?

41
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:25,819
Y'know Keigo, your stories
are usually vague,
pointless, and kinda boring.

42
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:26,688
What?!

43
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:28,860
That's pretty harsh!

44
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,802
I was just livening up
the mood of our post-
lunch conversation
with a saucy story!

45
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,540
[Mizuiro]
"Post lunch"?
We're still eating!

46
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,979
[Keigo]
Can't you simply
enjoy my jokes
for a change?

47
00:04:37,012 --> 00:04:37,814
[Uryu]
Hey Ichigo!

48
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:38,449
Hnh?

49
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:43,427
[sigh] Aw-right.

50
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:45,031
See you guys
in a bit.

51
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:48,940
You think he's still
doing that weird stuff?

52
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:50,878
I don't know.

53
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:52,482
You're okay
with it!?

54
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:53,817
Yeah, sure, why not?

55
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:57,661
I guess.

56
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,040
I understand.

57
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,376
[phone clicks off]

58
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:08,920
[sigh]

59
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:13,029
[Ichigo]
Rukia! What're
you doing here?

60
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:15,936
I was uh, just
taking a walk.

61
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:19,612
What about you?
You must've stayed
late today.

62
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:24,991
I have to. To make up for all
the schoolwork I missed while
I was dealing with Aizen.

63
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:29,534
Don't complain, after all, your
main job is being a student.

64
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:30,971
Yeah, I got that.

65
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:34,078
[Ichigo]
Hey Rukia...

66
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:35,148
[Rukia]
What is it?

67
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:37,420
How long you gonna
be staying here?

68
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,825
That's really none
of your business.

69
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:43,066
I'd say it is.
Have you forgotten?

70
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:45,038
You're freeloading
at my place.

71
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:49,448
Your family said I could
stay at your place,
as long as I want to.

72
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,987
Yuzu and my dad said that.

73
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:00,473
I'll leave when my
mission's done.

74
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:01,943
I gotcha.

75
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:05,084
Shouldn't we be getting
back to your place?

76
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:08,993
Your sister was really
excited about making us
curry for dinner tonight.

77
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:10,997
Gyaah! Dammit!

78
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:14,038
Yuzu asked me to pick
up pickles on the way
home to have with it!

79
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:16,009
Then you'd better
get going!

80
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,780
Yeah, I'll see
you at home!

81
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:20,921
You fool.

82
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:31,513
Don't worry kid!
I'll keep you safe!

83
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:32,615
[ferful trembling]

84
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:44,008
Almost done!

85
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:44,911
Ulp!

86
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:49,120
Damn it! Not right now!

87
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:52,127
[gasp]

88
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,783
[roar]

89
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:02,685
Hup!

90
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:10,102
Rukia!

91
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:16,885
Thanks Uryu.

92
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:20,293
You were really
struggling against that
Hollow. Why's that?!

93
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:22,097
I did thank you,
didn't I?

94
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:29,347
Sorry you got scared,
That happens sometimes.
So are you okay?

95
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:31,084
Uh, yeah.

96
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,588
[phone beeps]

97
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:33,724
Must be another one!

98
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:35,093
It's gonna be
a busy night.

99
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,932
Right! Let's go Rukia!

100
00:07:37,365 --> 00:07:40,072
You stay here.
Uryu and I will go.

101
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,244
Huh? But how come?

102
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:44,048
Don't be an idiot.

103
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:46,219
Were you just going
to leave this kid?

104
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:49,126
Perform Konso on this spirit,
then catch up with us.

105
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:50,998
Hey, wait!

106
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,651
Rukia, about Ichigo's
Spirit Energy.

107
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:02,023
I know. It's
running out fast.

108
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:10,977
The Spirit Energy he
regained using Mod Soul
technology was temporary.

109
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:14,151
Now his Spirit energy
is declining so quickly.

110
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:18,028
He can't even do a
Flash Step anymore.

111
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:20,198
Then why are you still
letting him fight!?

112
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,638
In his condition,
he'll--

113
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:23,774
Yeah, I know that!

114
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:25,845
It's just not that easy!

115
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,888
[Jushiro]
I read your latest
reports, Rukia.

116
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:30,991
Listen....

117
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:34,733
It is vital that you keep
Ichigo from fighting any more.

118
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:39,077
I know sir, but
he's so determined.

119
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,446
This'll be tough on him.

120
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:44,823
But he is losing his
Spirit Energy a lot
sooner than we expected.

121
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:47,963
Fighting's just too
dangerous for him,
and us.

122
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:49,066
I understand.

123
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,254
[Ichigo]
Rukia! There you are!

124
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:12,989
Hm?

125
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:15,361
You look spaced out.
What're you doing here?

126
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,198
Oh, nothing much.

127
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:20,172
Really? You've been
kinda acting weird.

128
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:22,043
No I haven't.

129
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:25,083
Then, why is it you're
not looking at me?

130
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:27,322
You've been kinda
distant lately.

131
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:43,326
Hey, there's something you
want to tell me isn't there?

132
00:09:44,228 --> 00:09:45,097
Yeah.

133
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:46,901
I--

134
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,438
You don't have to
tell it to me now.

135
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:49,406
Whu?!

136
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:54,452
What is with you!?
First you want me to tell
you, then you don't!

137
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:57,259
Sorry. I just
wanted to be sure.

138
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,461
Well quit it!

139
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:00,800
I said I was sorry!

140
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,508
Listen, we've known each
other a long time Rukia.

141
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:08,217
So by now, I can
pretty much guess
what you're thinking.

142
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,086
Ugh!

143
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:11,558
Fine, whatever.

144
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,565
Anyway, come on.
Everyone's waiting for us.

145
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:16,002
Huh?

146
00:10:17,906 --> 00:10:19,243
She's here!

147
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:21,315
Hey Rukia,
over here!

148
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:22,383
Hm?!

149
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:25,223
[Rukia]
Wha...?

150
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,364
What's going
on here?

151
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:30,202
Can't ya tell?
It's ice-skating.

152
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:33,242
No. What I mean is,
what're all of us
doing here?

153
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:35,915
C'mon, remember
the other day?

154
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:38,087
When you were staring
down at this place.

155
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:42,832
I thought by the way you
were smiling, you wanted
to do some ice-skating.

156
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:44,034
Huh???

157
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:46,841
[chuckle]

158
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:48,846
You fool!

159
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:50,215
Say what?

160
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:51,518
Oh, it's nothing.

161
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:55,862
In springtime when all the
cherry blossoms are in bloom,
it's pretty here.

162
00:10:56,262 --> 00:11:00,139
Hey wait, we could ask
Byakuya; he'd show us cherry
blossoms whenever we want.

163
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:03,079
What do you think my brother
is some kinda genie?!

164
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:06,586
Anyways, why'd you decide to
invite everyone to come here?

165
00:11:07,221 --> 00:11:09,293
You kidding?
Don't you get it?

166
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:13,536
C'mon Rukia, Ichigo!
Let's do some skating!

167
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:16,509
Sure-be right there!
Let's go!

168
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,416
Uh, wait a minute!
You know I've never
done this before!

169
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,390
Whoa-ahh! I can't skate!

170
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:25,898
Outta my way!
Yahhh! Help!!

171
00:11:25,898 --> 00:11:26,900
Unhh!

172
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:29,974
You're gettin the
hang of it, Keigo!

173
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:34,919
See ya!

174
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:37,291
Hey No way!

175
00:11:37,593 --> 00:11:38,962
Tatsuki!

176
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,940
Okay. I'm letting go!

177
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:47,047
Hey! Not so fast! Whoa!

178
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:49,186
Hee...

179
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:51,224
[laughs]

180
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:52,193
How 'bout that?!

181
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:53,028
Whooa!

182
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:57,272
Ah! Thank you.

183
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,112
Heh!

184
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,240
Blaagh!

185
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:17,351
Man, this sucks!
How come I'm the only one
stuck in a backpack!?

186
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:20,225
Everyone looks like they're
having more fun than me.

187
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:24,501
Gaaaah! I bet no one would
notice if I got out for a bit.

188
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,205
Huaagh!

189
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,614
Mommy! This stuffed
lion's moving!

190
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,589
Don't be silly, that's
impossible, it's a doll.

191
00:12:33,756 --> 00:12:35,360
But I saw it moving!

192
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:38,501
[fireworks]

193
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:39,136
Huh?

194
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,305
Huh?

195
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:45,250
[fireworks]

196
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:49,994
Ah!

197
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:53,101
Wow! How pretty!

198
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:57,110
What's with this big
fireworks display?

199
00:12:57,412 --> 00:13:00,051
This new theme
park recently
opened up nearby.

200
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:03,559
And they do this incredible
fireworks show every
day about this time.

201
00:13:04,094 --> 00:13:05,597
There's a new
theme park?

202
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:08,103
Are you saying you
don't know about it?!

203
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:11,645
The place isn't that big,
but it's a perfect place
for a date.

204
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:15,520
Or for two lonely single
guys like us, right Chad?

205
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:17,592
Yeah. It was
a lot of fun.

206
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,262
[laughs]

207
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,713
Y'know, it's nice
to spend time like
this for a change.

208
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:27,715
Yeah.

209
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:38,741
See you!
Goodnight!

210
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:40,211
Yeah, later.

211
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,648
'Night!

212
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,492
That was a lot of fun.

213
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,502
I can't believe you thought
of planning all that.

214
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:53,509
Tsk! Was that supposed
to be a compliment?

215
00:13:55,513 --> 00:13:58,587
Hey, Rukia, there's
something I've been
meaning to ask you.

216
00:13:59,088 --> 00:13:59,757
What is it?

217
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,229
That one time...

218
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:08,511
When I had really lost
control of myself back there,
My Spiritual pressure must've
been really different.

219
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:11,217
How were you
able to find me?

220
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:14,257
It's hard to say.

221
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:16,562
What!?
So you don't know?!

222
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:24,146
Compared to when
we first met,

223
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:25,818
you've become
much stronger.

224
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:34,471
It's as if you're a
completely different person.

225
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:42,823
But you know, you're
still the same Ichigo.

226
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,562
Huh? What're you--?

227
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:45,630
[beep]

228
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:47,702
A Hollow!

229
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:49,639
Ah!

230
00:14:51,544 --> 00:14:53,749
[Jushiro]
It is vital that you
keep Ichigo from
fighting any more.

231
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,320
Ichigo, wait!

232
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,491
What's the matter?

233
00:14:57,858 --> 00:15:00,365
I feel its Spiritual
Pressure even from here!

234
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:01,701
This one's
a big one!

235
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:02,937
Let's go!

236
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:04,274
Ichigo!

237
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:10,889
[roar]

238
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:13,629
Yaaahh!

239
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:18,741
Damn! It dodged me like
I wasn't even there!

240
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:24,421
Augh!

241
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:30,602
Ichigo!

242
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:33,709
Oh no! His Spirit energy!
It's...

243
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:35,379
Damn! Not now!

244
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:36,616
[roar]

245
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:38,486
Come on!

246
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:46,539
[roar]

247
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,288
This one's
massive!

248
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:55,526
Sorry, I'm getting
in your way.

249
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,261
Mh!

250
00:15:56,996 --> 00:15:58,935
Stop that talk!
Don't even think it!

251
00:15:59,636 --> 00:16:03,746
You are not in my way!
If you get hurt, then
I'll help you!

252
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,521
If you can't fight, then
I'll fight in your place!

253
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:11,430
If you're in pain,
then I'll help you to
deal with your pain!

254
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:14,772
After all, we're
friends, right?!

255
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:20,017
Yeah we are.

256
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,554
[sudden stab of pain]
Hngh!

257
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:24,694
Ichigo!

258
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:26,365
I'm okay!

259
00:16:26,398 --> 00:16:28,036
[roar]

260
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:35,486
Rukia. Can you take
out that thing's legs?

261
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:38,393
Sure, I've got it.

262
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,603
[roar]

263
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:46,779
Dance, Sodenoshirayuki.

264
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:56,836
Tsuginomai, Hakuren!

265
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:03,385
[growl]

266
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:11,003
This is my last one!

267
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:12,606
Ichigo...

268
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:21,894
Now!

269
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:24,868
Getsuga... tensho!!

270
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:40,137
Ichigo!
Are you alright?!

271
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:42,008
Mh. Just
barely.

272
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:46,618
Honestly, you're always
pushing yourself way too hard...

273
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:52,132
Well like you said before,
no matter what happens,
I'll always be me, right?

274
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:52,766
Mm.

275
00:17:53,936 --> 00:17:57,444
So then, don't go hiding stuff
that you have to say to me.

276
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:58,813
[gasp]

277
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:03,592
So you knew, what I've
been meaning to tell you?

278
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:08,771
I'm pretty sure I've got
a good idea what the old
man and the others are
thinking about me.

279
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:10,174
Ichigo...

280
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:13,715
Sorry. I know I've
put you through a lot.

281
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:15,620
Grghh!

282
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,658
Oh no!
What's wrong?!

283
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:24,006
Are you okay?!

284
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:25,543
Yeah...

285
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:32,927
I'm really sorry Rukia, for
dragging you into my personal
mess up 'til the very end.

286
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:35,499
Don't say that!

287
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:39,876
You fool.
That's just not right!

288
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:44,788
We're friends.
Don't forget that.

289
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:46,792
Real friends.

290
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,134
I know that, just stop
talking and rest.

291
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:56,047
[pained moans]

292
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:00,691
You're right, Ichigo.

293
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:05,770
And no matter what happens,
nothing will change who we are.

294
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:26,218
You're
awake!

295
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:28,256
Huh?
Hey wait!

296
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,062
So, am I home!?

297
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:32,031
Yes.

298
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:36,107
Oh yeah!
So are my powers--?

299
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:38,747
Ichigo.

300
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:39,549
Huh?

301
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:44,828
Right now your body
is in the second stage
of Spirit energy loss.

302
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:48,970
Soon all the Spirit energy
you have left will be gone.

303
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,838
I see, I thought so.

304
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,619
Well I'm not surprised.

305
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:11,924
I saw this coming.

306
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:19,342
Hey can I go outside?

307
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:42,829
I can't sense any spirits.
Not a single one...

308
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,142
Even Rukia's presence is
starting to fade away.

309
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:53,020
It's true, I really
am losing my powers.

310
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:01,206
This is goodbye, Ichigo.

311
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:04,847
It looks that way.

312
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:08,022
Hee.

313
00:21:08,957 --> 00:21:11,262
Hey, there's no use
looking so sad, okay.

314
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:15,940
Even if you won't be able
to see me, I'll still be
keeping a close eye on you.

315
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:19,147
Now that's just great!
You spying on me!

316
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:22,255
And just so you know,
I'm not sad! okay?

317
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:25,997
Ah!

318
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,264
[Ichigo]
Rukia, say bye to
everybody for me.

319
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,502
Sure.

00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:55,197
Goodbye, Rukia.

321
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:11,904
[Ichigo]
And thank you.

There's no reason for me to
stay at Ichigo's anymore.

323
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,440
[Uryu]
You can stay with me!
I just came up with a
new design for you!

324
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,025
[Chad]
Wait! Let me give him a hug!

325
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,127
[Uryu]
Just remember he's going
home with me, Chad!

326
00:23:57,127 --> 00:24:00,864
[Kon]
Knock it off, really!
Don't fight over me!
You guys are creeping me out!
