[music playing]

2
00:01:39,347 --> 00:01:41,681
-Knowing he was a liability
without his powers,

3
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:43,414
Uryu separated himself from us.

4
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:47,214
He was saved by a Bount
named Yoshino Soma.

5
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:49,147
Yoshino was on a
mission of her own,

6
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:51,514
determined to thwart
Kariya's ambitions.

7
00:01:51,547 --> 00:01:53,381
But in battle, her
fierce Goethe proved

8
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,747
to be no match for
Koga's doll, Dalk.

9
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:59,614
Koga had increased his power
by absorbing living souls.

10
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:03,714
Yoshino and Uryu
were soon captured.

11
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:05,781
We tracked Uryu to
Kariya's mansion

12
00:02:05,814 --> 00:02:07,547
and snuck in to try to free him.

13
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:09,581
But our actions
were anticipated.

14
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:10,914
They knew we were coming.

15
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:14,881
We ended up in a huge hall
where the Bounts were gathered.

16
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:18,214
I stayed behind to battle while
the others managed to escape.

17
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:19,581
They searched the
house for Uryu,

18
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:23,881
but were attacked instead by
Maki Ichonise, a soul reaper.

19
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:26,481
At first I struggled in
battle against Fried,

20
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,247
Utagawa's serpent doll.

21
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,381
But I was able to
use my getsuga tensho

22
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:33,081
to escape danger
and even the odds.

23
00:02:33,114 --> 00:02:35,714
And it was then that Utagawa
turned on his master,

24
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:39,114
suddenly stealing Kariya's
monshou and betraying him.

25
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:40,447
-Ugh.

26
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:40,947
Kariya!

27
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:47,447
-What was that?

28
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:47,981
You bastard.

29
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:52,347
-He's a soul reaper.

30
00:02:57,247 --> 00:03:06,481
-[grunting] Whoa, what's this?

31
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:15,781
(SCREAMING)

32
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:17,014
-It's all over.

33
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:18,581
-No, it can't be.

34
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:22,281
-Tell me something.

35
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:24,581
Why would a soul reaper
want to help a Bount?

36
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:25,947
-Since you won't
live long enough

37
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:27,747
to understand the
answer, there's

38
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:29,414
no point in telling you.

39
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:30,947
-So you don't want to talk now?

40
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:32,747
That's just too bad,
because you're not

41
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:34,281
going to get another chance.

42
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:34,781
Aaugh!

43
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:45,581
-Huh?

44
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:50,014
Kurodo!

45
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:52,047
Noba!

46
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,714
-Unfortunately,
they took an attack

47
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:55,414
from a skilled soul reaper.

48
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,081
There'll be a lot of damage.

49
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:58,214
-Then what'll we do?

50
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:00,947
I can't just stand by
and let them both die!

51
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:03,281
Without Kurodo and
Noba, I'd be all alone!

52
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:05,147
The two of them are all I have!

53
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:06,747
Noba, you've got to wake up!

54
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:10,547
Please open your eyes, Noba!

55
00:04:10,581 --> 00:04:12,914
Kurodo!

56
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:14,647
Please don't die!

57
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:16,114
You've got to stay
with me, Kurodo.

58
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:19,181
-I wonder if I can
circulate the chi to heal.

59
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:20,847
My current state--

60
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:23,681
-Please, say something, Kurodo!

61
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:24,614
Anything.

62
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:26,914
Just talk to me.

63
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:29,181
[crying]

64
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:30,414
-Calm down, [inaudible].

65
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:32,281
-But Rukia!

66
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,381
-All right, that's
enough, Kurodo.

67
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:38,181
You can stop pretending
to be unconscious now.

68
00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:41,647
-[laughs] Well, good
morning, everyone.

69
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,114
-Noba?

00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:50,514
-Kurodo!

72
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:51,181
-Wait!

73
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:51,981
It's not like that.

74
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:53,081
We really were hurt.

75
00:04:53,114 --> 00:04:55,381
We were dying swans,
crossing the river Styx.

76
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:57,881
But when we heard your pleading
voice, we couldn't leave you

77
00:04:57,914 --> 00:04:59,014
and we came back.

78
00:04:59,047 --> 00:05:01,414
[smack]

79
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:03,447
-You have a lot of
nerve, you big faker.

80
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:05,081
-Those two sure are a handful.

81
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:05,581
-Mmm.

82
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:32,881
-Let's do this! [grunting]

83
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,081
-It's useless to run.

84
00:05:57,247 --> 00:06:01,114
-You cannot see my sword, no
matter how hard you may try to.

85
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:03,447
-Bastard!

86
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:04,914
-Is it instinctual?

87
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,847
You should not be able to
see my Nijigasumi's attacks.

88
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,881
They should be invisible to you.

89
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:12,747
And yet, you are
reflexively dodging them.

90
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:14,114
That is interesting.

91
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:15,314
-Heh.

92
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:18,914
So that was the full power
of your zanpakuto, huh?

93
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:20,681
Well, in that case--

94
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,447
-In that case, what?

95
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:29,047
-[roaring] I'll keep coming!

96
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:30,814
[shouting]

97
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:32,781
-I'm not about to
make it that easy.

98
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:38,081
-Where are you?

99
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:41,947
-Now you shall have a
taste of my true power.

100
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:46,547
-Flash and burst.

101
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,047
Nijigasumi!

102
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:54,514
-[grunting]

103
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:58,447
-When my nijigasumi shines, its
light penetrates everything.

104
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:02,181
There are no longer any
shadows or darkness to hide in.

105
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,181
-Aaugh!

106
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:06,681
[explosion]

107
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:15,947
-You molded high-density
spiritual pressure into a blade

108
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:19,014
and then plunged it into the
ground to create an explosion

109
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:20,214
and escape.

110
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:23,714
But doing so seems to have
taken its toll on you.

111
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:27,581
-[heavy breathing]
Shut the hell up.

112
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,314
-Hmm.

113
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:32,814
-Wait.

114
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,481
-Hmm?

115
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:36,381
-Master Kariya.

116
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,447
-I'll take care of this.

117
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,747
-But there is no need.

118
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:43,647
I have the situation
under control, I assure--

119
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:45,214
-I have no doubt
of that, but I'm

120
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:48,247
interested in his
soul, Ichinose.

121
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:49,047
-Very well.

122
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:51,714
As you wish, Master Kariya.

123
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:53,881
-What's going on?

124
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:56,847
What are you two talking about?

125
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:59,447
-My apologies, but
I've seen enough

126
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:03,381
that I'd like to invite
you to stay here with us.

127
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:04,647
Forever.

128
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:05,414
-Heh.

129
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:06,647
And be eaten?

130
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:09,014
Thanks, but I think
I'll pass on that.

131

[piano music]

132
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:19,247
-Master Kariya, you overwhelm
me with your strength.

133
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:22,614
Your power has not diminished
since I first met you.

134
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:23,914
[footsteps]

135
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:28,381
-Why are you allowing this?

136
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:30,814
-Unfortunately, it
is within the rules.

137
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:34,114
A combat match attended by
at least 200 squad members

138
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:37,014
to establish supremacy is
one of the accepted methods

139
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:40,414
by which he can gain the
captaincy of squad 13.

140
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,414
As you know, your captain
accepted the challenge

141
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:43,914
of his own free will.

142
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:46,847
We are not allowed to do
anything now to stop him.

143
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,314
-But he accepted the challenge
in the name of honor,

144
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:52,514
and the Soul Society needs
men with wills such as that.

145
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:54,614
That is what I have
been taught to believe.

146
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:57,081
-I feel the same way
as you about this.

147
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:59,447
How can the Soul
Society allow such a law

148
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:01,347
to exist when it is
supposed to always

149
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,414
be striving for
peace of the soul?

150
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:08,747
And to make matters even worse,
this man, Kenpachi Zaraki,

151
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,881
he is a dangerous man.

152
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:12,447
Madness is his strength.

How could you do
this to the captain?

163
00:09:51,114 --> 00:09:53,114
I cannot accept this!

164
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:54,481
-Please, don't do this.

Come to your senses, lad.

00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:56,481
What are you thinking?

167
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:57,947
Don't do it.

168
00:09:57,981 --> 00:10:00,981
-Lemme at him!

169
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:05,281
-That day, the captain I
respected was taken from me.

170
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:08,914
It's not right that a battle
should be so meaningless,

171
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:12,614
a battle between those
who only seek strength.

172
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:16,047
I could not stop
trembling with rage.

173
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:19,814
But in the end, I was prevented
from attacking him there.

174
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:22,347
And soon after,
Kenpachi officially

175
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:26,447
became captain of Squad 11.

176
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:27,881
-Huh?

177
00:10:27,914 --> 00:10:29,381
Fight one on one?

178
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:31,447
Not a chance.

179
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:33,281
-You are refusing me
when I have officially

180
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:34,814
challenged you to a duel?

181
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,214
You cannot!

182
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:39,481
-Listen, you don't understand
that you're different from me.

183
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,547
First, you need to go
take the captain's exam.

184
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:45,014
-I have no quarrel
personally with you,

185
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:48,681
but I cannot allow my captain's
death to remain unavenged.

186
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,247
-So that's what
this is all about.

187
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:53,647
A lot of fuss about nothing.

188
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:56,314
You'd never even
be able to cut me.

189
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:57,814
-What's that?

190
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:59,781
-Do it right now if want to.

191
00:10:59,814 --> 00:11:02,047
If you can give
me even a scratch,

192
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:04,081
I'll consider this
battle you want so badly.

193
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:09,347
Well, do you want to?

194
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:12,847
Come on, then.

195
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,681
-Flash and burst!

196
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:15,181
Nijigasumi!

197
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:20,547
-Huh huh.

198
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:22,014
[slashing]

199
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:23,947
[clattering]

200
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:24,914
[blood dripping]

201
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:27,547
-Like I tried to
tell you, you have

202
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:31,081
no hope of ever cutting me.

203
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:32,581
-Why, damn it?

204
00:11:32,614 --> 00:11:34,581
Why are you like this?

205
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:39,747
-You live like and ivy vine.

206
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:42,581
You can only survive by
clinging onto the trees,

207
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:43,981
depending on them.

208
00:11:44,014 --> 00:11:45,314
That's your flaw.

209
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:53,814
Put down some roots so some
day you can stand on your own.

210
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,981
-I didn't care about
anything after that.

211
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:58,881
I died at that moment.

212
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:00,881
Or at least that's
what I thought.

213
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:09,214
Until I met Master Kariya.

214
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:29,055
[footsteps]

215
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:30,555
[grunting]

216
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:39,455
-I left the Soul Society
and wandered aimlessly,

217
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:42,388
and finally I found myself
in the world of the living.

218
00:12:42,422 --> 00:12:46,822
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Why?

219
00:12:46,855 --> 00:12:48,088
Why am I here?

220
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:56,522
It's a serious crime to come
to the world of the living

221
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:58,188
without permission.

222
00:12:58,222 --> 00:13:01,422
I can never return to
the Soul Society now.

223
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:03,488
Will I just wither
away in this wasteland?

224
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:20,755
If I die, that's all right.

225
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:22,188
I can see my captain again.

226
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,755
[shouting]

227
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:29,255
-A fire?

228
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:36,688
[interposing voices]

229
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:39,588
-These souls!

230
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:42,688
What's going on?

231
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,622
[evil laugh]

232
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:45,588
-Aaugh!

233
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:49,522
-[chuckles] Ah, dessert.

234
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:52,455
[heavy breathing]

235
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:53,922
-A hollow!

236
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:55,388
[roars]

237
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:01,922
[chuckles]

238
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:04,288
[roars]

239
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:06,822
[yells]

240
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,622
-Run away, boy.

241
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:09,555
Get out of here now!

242
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:18,922
[grunting] At that
moment, my body

243
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:20,822
reacted before I could think.

244
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:22,288
[roars]

245
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:27,122
Ha!

246
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:29,555
Is that all you
have, soul reaper?

247
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:31,788
-I was so weak, I
feared I wouldn't

248
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,288
be able to handle the
opponent before me.

249
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:36,588
-Today is a great day.

250
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:39,422
First I filled my
stomach with fresh souls,

251
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:42,922
and now I will enjoy
devouring a soul reaper.

252
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:57,188
[laughing]

253
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:02,222
-Auugh!

254
00:15:02,255 --> 00:15:04,822
I wondered, am I
going to die here?

255
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:06,788
I realized I could
very well perish,

256
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:12,422
and yet what crossed
my mind was not

257
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:17,522
a feeling of relief over finally
being able to die, but fear.

258
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:20,688
Fear because I
didn't want to die.

259
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:26,488
I realized how pitiful I really
was, how lowly and significant.

260
00:15:26,522 --> 00:15:30,022
But even then, I could not
let go of my dying body.

261
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:35,788
[laughing]

262
00:15:35,822 --> 00:15:38,855
-This is the end, soul reaper!

263
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,788
[laughing]

264
00:15:40,822 --> 00:15:43,222
[roaring]

265
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:46,155
[yelling]

266
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:46,655
-Eh?

267
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:52,022
What is this?

268
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:58,322
-Are you all right?

269
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:01,155
-Yes, thank you.

270
00:16:01,188 --> 00:16:03,255
He had stopped the
hollow in its tracks

271
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,788
with only the touch
of a single finger.

272
00:16:05,822 --> 00:16:09,888
I never knew such a
thing was possible.

273
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:12,822
[grunting]

274
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:17,822
-This is your fight and
you should finish it.

275
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:18,322
Here.

276
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:28,322
[grunts]

277
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,622
[growls]

[yells]

280
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:40,822
-Soul reaper, what
happened just now?

281
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,488
You don't seem like
the kind of man

282
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:44,822
who would need help to defeat
such an unworthy opponent.

283
00:16:49,622 --> 00:16:50,922
-I have failed.

284
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:52,922
KENPACHI (OFFSCREEN): You
live like an ivy vine.

285
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:56,788
You can only survive by
clinging onto the trees.

286
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:58,722
-There is no need
to be concerned.

287
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,888
Everyone has a weakness.

288
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:04,455
We can't cast t hem away,
no matter how long we live.

289
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:08,422
As long as we are in
the cycle of rebirth,

290
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:10,955
I would like you to
come along with me.

291
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:16,422
-I was charmed in an
instant by this man.

292
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:28,388
-If you stay with us, your
soul will meld with mine.

293
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,055
Glory will forever
shine upon your head.

294
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:33,722
So then, won't you
entrust yourself to me

295
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:35,788
for a wealth you've never known?

296
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,255
-I told you that I refuse.

297
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:41,355
-I see.

298
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:43,022
That is most unfortunate.

299
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:44,455
[roars]

300
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:49,255

-Damn it.

304
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:10,355
[gasps] I can't move.

305
00:18:13,722 --> 00:18:15,422
-You aren't quite what
I thought you were.

306
00:18:15,455 --> 00:18:16,855
Well--

307
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:20,255
-I have no strength at all.

308
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:21,688
[thud]

309
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,655
-Master Kariya, aren't you
going to finish him off?

310
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:28,922
-No.

311
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:33,555
This person won't color my
world as richly as the Quincy.

312
00:18:33,588 --> 00:18:34,955
You may do what
you like with him.

313
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:43,722
-Hold it.

314
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:48,488
Hey, Kariya!

315
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:49,622
Come back!

316
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:52,122
-I guess I'll definitely
have to finish him off.

317
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,322
[explosion]

318
00:18:58,355 --> 00:18:59,755
-What?

319
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:02,155
-Great shot, Ururu!

320
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:05,022
Now, 10 degrees higher
should be a direct hit.

321
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:05,855
-Right.

322
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:06,855
-Oh yeah!

323
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:08,322
[explosions]

324
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:17,655
-Yoruichi!

Shunko!

326
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:26,055
-Ack!

327
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:28,522
-Look out!

328
00:19:28,555 --> 00:19:30,455
-(COUGHS) What is this?

329
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:32,455
An earthquake or a thunder
storm or is the house

330
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:33,955
coming down on us?

331
00:19:33,988 --> 00:19:35,322
No, but this is bad.

332
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:36,855
We're going to be in trouble
if we don't calm down and find

333
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:38,388
a way out of here
without panicking!

334
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:39,788
-Then calm down.

335
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:40,755
-OK.

336
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:41,855
-Does anybody know
what all this is?

337
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:42,522
What's Happening

338
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:43,288
-This way.

339
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:44,555
-Why?

340
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:46,522
-I sense Uryu's spiritual
pressure behind this door!

341
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:47,255
-You're positive?

342
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:50,488
-Rukia!

343
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,322
-Uryu!

344
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:52,855
Are you in one piece?

345
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:53,988
-Yeah, I'm fine.

346
00:19:54,022 --> 00:19:54,922
It's OK.

347
00:19:54,955 --> 00:19:56,522
-Thank goodness
you're all right!

348
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:58,688
I was desperately trying
to come up with some tender

349
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:00,988
and touching words to come up
with at your memorial service

350
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:02,988
because it looked like that
was how this was going to end--

351
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:03,922
-Let's get out of here!

352
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,188
-I won't have to after all.

353
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:09,555
-Uryu, I sense a Bount nearby.

354
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:11,088
-What's wrong, Uryu?

355
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:11,855
-I wonder, too.

356
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:26,955
-Help me lift her.

357
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:28,588
-Why should we do that?

358
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:31,722
Don't you realize
that she's a Bount?

359
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:32,455
-Yes, I know.

360
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:33,822
But this one's different.

361
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:36,222
-Different, meaning she was the
first to attack us, perhaps,

362
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:37,155
but why help her?

363
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:40,388
-Uryu, what's this about?

364
00:20:40,422 --> 00:20:43,622
-I'll explain it later.

365
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:45,755
-Very well.

366
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:46,255
-Nova!

367
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,588

[gasps]

370
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:05,255
-The whole mansion is destroyed!

371
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:07,188
-Oh, Ichigo!

372
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:08,422
-Wait.

373
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:09,422
-But, Chad!

374
00:21:09,455 --> 00:21:10,888
We've got to go help them.

375
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:11,388
-No.

376
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:12,388
This way.

377
00:21:12,422 --> 00:21:14,922
-Huh?

378
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:17,755
Ichigo!

379
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:19,522
-Don't worry, it's not serious.

380
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:22,422
-Oh, thank goodness!

381
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:26,288
[blast]

382
00:21:26,322 --> 00:21:28,822
My beloved Rukia!

383
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:32,655
I thought I'd never
see you again!

384
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:34,022
You and your sweet-- ah!

385
00:21:34,055 --> 00:21:34,888
Ugh!

386
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:36,055
[squeaks]

387
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:37,988
-How nice to see everyone
safe and sound again

388
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:40,155
and what a coincidence
that we all ended up here

389
00:21:40,188 --> 00:21:41,122
in the same spot.

390
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:42,788
-I searched for
spiritual pressures

391
00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:44,755
and created an exit accordingly.

392
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:46,255
It was not a coincidence.

393
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:46,888
-Can you stand?

394
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:48,455
-I think so.

395
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:50,788
It's best that we
don't linger here.

396
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:52,555
We need to move out
as soon as possible.

397
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:53,022
-Mmm.

398
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:53,463
-Mmm.

399
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:53,886
-Mmm.

400
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,988
-It would seem they've
taken Yoshino and the Quincy

401
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:06,222
along with them.

402
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,388
-It's my fault, Kariya.

403
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:08,722
I let my guard down.

404
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:11,822
-We should go after them,
master, or else the plan will--

405
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:13,022
-Just let them go.

406
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,255
-But then what--

407
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:16,022
-I know Yoshino.

408
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:18,555
She will come back to me.

409
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:23,588
And the Quincy will
return as well.

410
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:26,655
[whispering]

411

[theme music]

413
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:08,517
-Damn!

414
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,217
I don't think I
can win like this!

415
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,050
-Perhaps I get help
you out by lending you

416
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,650
my underground training grounds.

417
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:15,584
Right now it even comes
with an instructor.

418
00:24:15,617 --> 00:24:16,884
-Hello, I'm the instructor.

419
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:17,684
-Ooh, where?

420
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:18,350
-What are you talking about?

421
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:19,284
I'm the instructor!

422
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:20,084
-You suck!

423
00:24:20,117 --> 00:24:21,317
-Shut up, shut up!

424
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,650
-Make me!

427
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,250
-Golden.

428
00:24:37,284 --> 00:24:40,017
-Excuse me, but perhaps
you could explain to me

429
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,417
why you're here attending a
lieutenants' meeting, Captain

430
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,417
Kuchiki?

431
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,784
-I'm here because
my lieutenant has

432
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,650
been assigned to temporary duty
in the world of the living.

433
00:24:47,684 --> 00:24:50,717
It is no more and
no less than that.

434
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,617
Byakuya, you're so enthusiastic!

435
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,084
See, I have a really great idea.

436
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,150
We're going to eat lunch
right after this meeting.

437
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:59,884
Why don't you come
with me? (MUFFLED)

438
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,950
-What is the next
topic of discussion?

439
00:25:02,984 --> 00:25:04,484
-He's good.
