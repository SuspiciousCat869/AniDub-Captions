00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:50,282
NARRATOR: Ichigo
and his friends,

5
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:52,848
still undergoing intense
training in preparation

6
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:55,948
for the showdown this winter,
were forced into action

7
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:59,315
when Aizen's elite group
of Arrancars appeared.

8
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:01,782
But the Arrancars
suddenly retreated

9
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:04,348
in the midst of battle.

10
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:06,982
The Espada's attack
was merely a diversion

11
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:11,515
to draw attention
away from Orihime.

12
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,848
Aizen's plan was
proven successful

13
00:02:13,882 --> 00:02:16,615
when she was captured
by Ulquiorra,

14
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:19,282
and taken to Hueco Mundo.

15
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:22,248
The Soul Society alerts
Ichigo and the others

16
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:24,182
of Orihime's disappearance.

17
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:26,215
And Ichigo vows to save her.

18
00:02:26,248 --> 00:02:28,382
But he is forbidden
from taking action

19
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,748
by Head Captain Yamomoto.

20
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:32,015
-You must not.

21
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:35,515
We are going to need your
help in this battle, Ichigo

22
00:02:35,548 --> 00:02:37,115
Kurosaki.

23
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:39,282
I won't allow you to plot
your own course of action,

24
00:02:39,315 --> 00:02:40,948
and die for nothing.

25
00:02:40,982 --> 00:02:43,282
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
Tatsuke, realizing

26
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:47,848
that Orihime is one, pressures
Ichigo for information.

27
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:49,115
-You know.

28
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:52,148
You know where she
went, don't you?

29
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:53,448
Admit it!

30
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:55,448
I've had it with all the lies.

31
00:02:55,482 --> 00:02:56,582
Tell me the truth.

32
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:59,415
What are you trying to hide?

33
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:01,748
-Mind your own
business, will you?

34
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:10,615
NARRATOR: Ichigo decides that
he will go to Hueco Mundo,

35
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,415
and that he must go by himself.

36
00:03:12,448 --> 00:03:15,682
He visits Urahara's shop
in order to get help.

37
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:17,715
-Hey, welcome back.

38
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:20,382
I've been waiting
for you to show up.

39
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:24,382
NARRATOR: Already waiting there
for Ichigo were Uryu and Chad.

40
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:37,348
-Now do you think that I'm
still not strong enough?

41
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:40,248
Believe in us.

42
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:42,715
-Chad.

43
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:44,182
-Don't take this on by yourself.

44
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:46,115
This is what friends are for.

45
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:52,248
-All right.

46
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:53,682
Are we all set?

47
00:03:57,915 --> 00:04:00,048
It looks like everybody's ready.

48
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:00,548
Finally.

[dog barking]

50
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:15,282
-Ichigo.

51
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:18,348
It was him, right?

52
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:19,848
-Definitely.

53
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:20,948
-I don't get it.

54
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:23,748
What can he be doing
here, at Urahara's shop?

55
00:04:23,782 --> 00:04:25,682
-That's the only reason
we came here, isn't it?

56
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:28,148
To find out exactly
what's going on.

57
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:28,848
-Oh, yeah.

58
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:29,582
That's why we're here.

59
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:30,415
I almost forgot.

60
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:37,615
-Can you believe this?

61
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:40,382
Ichigo sure is hopeless.

62
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,182
-You can tell he's
hiding something.

63
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,815
I read Ichigo like a book.

64
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:45,415
He is going to do something.

65
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:49,615
It's like he's telling
us right out loud.

66
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:52,615
-What a big idiot.

67
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:54,715
-You're one to talk, Tatsuke.

68
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:57,148
Both of you share a certain
kind of straightforwardness.

69
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:58,682
You're a lot alike in that way.

70
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:13,682
-And do yourself a favor,
and just stay away from me.

71
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:15,648
-That stupid jerk.

72
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,448
Just what the hell
am I to him, anyway?

73
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:25,748
-This isn't like you.

74
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:32,582
Look, you want to know where
Ichigo's going, don't you?

75
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:33,948
-I guess.

76
00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:37,182
-Then I have an idea.

77
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:37,882
-Hm?

78
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:38,782
-What now?

79
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,482
-Well?

80
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:43,782
-Well, listen to you.

81
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:45,082
What are you saying?

82
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:46,882
You're the one who brought
this up in the first place.

83
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:49,482
We followed Ichigo
all the way here.

84
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,848
-So what do you think, then?

85
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:51,682
What should we do?

86
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:55,715
-Tell us, Tatsuke!

87
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:58,382
What exactly is our plan
at a time like this?

88
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:00,715
Tell me, please!

89
00:06:00,748 --> 00:06:02,548
-You talk too much!

90
00:06:02,582 --> 00:06:07,082
-No, please don't get all
mad at me, for real, Tatsuke.

91
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:10,615
-We're definitely
going in there.

92
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:12,282
-Now you're finally
acting a little more

93
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:13,248
like yourself, Tatsuke.

94
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:16,282
-What a pest.

95
00:06:22,848 --> 00:06:23,415
-All right.

96
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,048
Let's go.

97
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:28,682
-Ichigo.

98
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:36,215
-All right, boys.

99
00:06:36,248 --> 00:06:37,282
The time has come.

100
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:40,415
I shall now open the
path to Hueco Mundo.

101
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:43,182
The rest of you better
stand back a little bit.

102
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:45,848
It's pretty dangerous here.

103
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:48,715
-Ah, this doesn't happen
often, so I wanna see it!

104
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:49,682
-Ririn's right.

105
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:52,148
This is a special
event, and it's

106
00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:54,515
rare to get such good seats.

107
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,215
-Not a problem.

108
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,848
-Afraid I can't
let you to do that.

109
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:58,982
-What?

110
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:00,948
-Put me down.

111
00:07:00,982 --> 00:07:02,282
-What do you think you're doing?

112
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:04,448
I demand you put
me down right now.

113
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:05,382
-Hm.

114
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:06,782
I can walk on my own.

115
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:13,882
-Leaving us out is not fair!

116
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:14,582
-All is well!

117
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:17,882
Ready here, sir!

118
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:20,148
-Good work!

119
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:21,248
All right.

120
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:21,948
It's time.

121
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:30,682
Here in my right hand, the
stone that connects the worlds.

122
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:35,048
In my left hand, the blade
that binds existence.

123
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:38,815
The shepherd with black
hair, the chair of the noose.

124
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:41,982
I strike the Ibis when
the clouds gather.

125
00:07:53,415 --> 00:07:56,548
This hole that the Arrancars
come and go through

126
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:58,348
is known as the Garganta.

127
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:01,182
There is no solid ground
beyond this point.

128
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,182
Only a chaos of resihi.

129
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:06,382
Each of you must create his
own path out of that reishi.

130
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:10,682
Go towards the darkness, and
you will arrive in Hueco Mundo.

131
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:13,248
-All right, fine.

132
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:14,282
-Kisuke?

133
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:16,015
-Hm?

134
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:19,315
-Can you let my family
know that I'm all right?

135
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:21,182
I want you to tell
them not to worry,

136
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:24,248
that I can take care of myself.

137
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:27,415
-Yes, of course I will.

138
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:30,682
And what about your friends?

139
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:35,782
-When I come back home,
I'll apologize to them.

140
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,815
-All right, then.

141
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:38,148
Good.

142
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:41,948
-Well, I guess the best we
can do is wish you luck.

143
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:43,015
-Please be careful.

144
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:43,515
-Yeah.

145
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:47,415
Let's go!

146
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:04,848
-There they go.

147
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:06,515
Why don't you
three come out now?

148
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,648
[laughter]

149
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:12,715
-How's it going?

150
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:15,548
So how long did you
know we were here?

151
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:18,615
-Since before you had arrived.

152
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:22,282
I was well aware that you
were following Ichigo.

153
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:25,115
So I left the store unlocked.

154
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:28,982
Ichigo.

155
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:32,748
I cannot believe how
naive that boy can be.

156
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,715
He thinks that
friendship is a thing

157
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:37,215
that you can end, just by
being cold to everyone.

158
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:46,882
Well then, time
waits for no man.

159
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:48,415
Got to get to work.

00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:00,929
-Ah, welcome.

162
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:04,362
This is Las Noches, our palace.

163
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:09,562
Orihime Inoue.

164
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:12,429
Is that correct?

165
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:14,562
-Yes.

166
00:10:14,596 --> 00:10:16,196
-Sorry to rush you, Orihime.

00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:23,029
But, will you show
me your power.

168
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:25,829
-Yes.

169
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:27,762
What was that, just now?

170
00:10:27,796 --> 00:10:33,262
It felt as if my strength was
being sucked out of my body.

171
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:35,496
-It seems there are certain
people who would much

172
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,496
prefer if I had not brought
you here, to Hueco Mundo.

173
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:43,029
Isn't that right, Luppi?

174
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:45,429
-Yes, of course I don't like it.

175
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,996
Our entire battle
has meant nothing.

176
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,429
All of it was little
more than a diversion,

177
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:52,262
so we could bring
this girl here.

178
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:55,962
Frankly, it only makes
me disgusted with her.

179
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:57,596
-It was shocking.

180
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,829
I was surprised to see
you beaten so severely.

181
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:07,262
Oh, I know what we should do.

182
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:12,929
Orihime, demonstrate the
strength of your power for us.

183
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:17,429
I want you to heal
Grimmjow's left arm.

184
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:18,329
-Impossible!

185
00:11:18,362 --> 00:11:19,429
That's crazy, Lord Aizen.

186
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:20,962
It can't be done.

187
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:22,562
Grimmjow?

188
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:26,362
Director General Tosen
turned his arm into ashes.

189
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:28,896
How is she going to heal
something that doesn't exist?

190
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:30,262
She's not a God.

191
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:36,496
-Soten Kisshun.

192
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:46,162
Now why, I reject.

193
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:46,862
-Hey!

194
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:48,062
Are you listening, girl?

195
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:50,429
If you're putting on an
act in a pathetic attempt

196
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:53,896
to save yourself, you
might as well stop it.

197
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:55,929
Should I see proof,
you haven't any power.

198
00:11:55,962 --> 00:12:01,796
And there's no reason to
keep someone like you alive.

199
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:08,596
Huh?

200
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,062
How?

201
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,429
This is beyond the
point of healing.

202
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:14,462
What sorcery is this?

203
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:16,229
What did you do, girl?

204
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:19,262
-Don't you understand?

205
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:21,796
Ulquiorra thinks it's temporal
or spatial regression.

206
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:24,462
Both are interesting theories.

207
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:25,962
-Yes.

208
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,029
-It can't be.

209
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:30,029
No human could have
such advanced power.

210
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:32,796
It's completely impossible.

211
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:34,229
-It is neither one.

212
00:12:34,262 --> 00:12:35,629
Temporal or spatial.

213
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:44,362
It rejects all
forms of phenomenon.

214
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,196
Her power limits,
rejects, and negates

215
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:49,296
what has happened to an object.

216
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:51,096
She has the power
to return things

217
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:54,462
to the state they existed in,
before events changed them.

218
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:59,229
It exceeds temporal
or spatial regression.

219
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:01,729
Effortlessly, it
overcomes the limits

220
00:13:01,762 --> 00:13:03,629
of all established phenomenon.

221
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:05,696
It knows no borders or barriers.

222
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:09,129
In fact, it oversteps the
limitations set by gods.

223
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:24,996
-Hey, girl.

224
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:26,396
Come heal one more thing.

225
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:39,496
-Just what do you think
you're doing, Grimmjow?

226
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,562
Grimmjow.

227
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,929
You bastard.

228
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,196
-Your days are done.

229
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:57,596
Good bye, Mr. Ex-Number 6.

230
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:19,662
It's back!

231
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:21,896
My power is back.

232
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,429
The sixth Espada
is Grimmjow again!

233
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:28,662
[laughter]

234
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:41,396
-Hueco Mundo's beyond here.

235
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:47,796
Dammit.

236
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:49,596
He talked about making
a path with reishi,

237
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,496
as if it were so easy.

238
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,129
But I'm really
terrible when it comes

239
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:54,762
to doing little
things like this.

240
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:01,096
[heavy breathing]

[crash]

242
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:14,262
-Chad, are you all right?

243
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:18,129
-I'm doing fine.

244
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:19,662
-Sorry about that.

245
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:20,162
-My, my.

246
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,129
That's pathetic.

247
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:26,396
I mean, really.

248
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,429
Can't you make footing
that's any better than that?

249
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:30,996
-Just shut the hell up.

250
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,029
I told you I'm not good at
things like this, didn't I?

251
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:36,396
And I want to know what
that thing is you have.

252
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:37,896
It looks to me like
you're cheating.

253
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:39,962
-This is a variation
of the Hirenkyaku.

254
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:41,629
It's nothing, really.

255
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:43,162
-I want you to make me one.

256
00:15:43,196 --> 00:15:46,162
-Look, your inability
to control spirit energy

257
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,562
means that you wouldn't
be able to use this.

258
00:15:48,596 --> 00:15:49,529
-Huh?

259
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:50,862
The way that you're
talking, you'd

260
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:53,396
think I didn't even
have any powers at all!

261
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:54,829
-Was I wrong?

262
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:57,229
You can't make your
own footing properly.

263
00:15:57,262 --> 00:15:58,762
-Yeah, well I'm gonna kill you.

264
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:04,129
-I'll go ahead of you.

265
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:05,996
-Uryu.

266
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,596
I was told you made a
deal with your father.

267
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:11,929
Kisuke said, that in exchange
for all of your father's

268
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:14,629
training, you promised
you wouldn't get involved

269
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:16,662
with the Soul Reapers
or associates.

270
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:18,262
That's what he
said you agreed to.

271
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:19,529
-Huh?

272
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,962
-So, Uryu, why are you here?

273
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:24,162
-Is that true?

274
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,229
Because I didn't
hear anything about.

275
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:28,629
Talk, Uryu.

276
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:30,029
-In exchange for the training.

277
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,729
Yeah, that was the agreement.

278
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:36,662
[music playing]

[gasping]

280
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:57,096
-Hello, there.

281
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:59,196
Sorry to disturb
you at this hour.

282
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:03,329
Well, actually,
it's still evening.

283
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:03,829
-Kisuke.

284
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:11,229
-Oh, your father isn't here.

285
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:13,862
I'm in luck.

286
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:16,596
-Tell me what it is
you want, Kisuke.

287
00:17:16,629 --> 00:17:17,829
-Oh yes, right.

288
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:18,596
-What?

289
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:19,529
Get to the point, already.

290
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:29,562
Orihime's been abducted
by the Arrancars?

291
00:17:29,596 --> 00:17:31,596
-To be more accurate,
the Arrancars

292
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:34,562
did it on Sosuke
Aizen's command.

293
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:40,196
Ichigo is probably going to
go and save her by himself.

294
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:42,929
I strongly suspect that
he'll come looking for me,

295
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:45,862
seeking a way to get
into Hueco Mundo tonight.

296
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:47,129
-Please leave.

297
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:48,762
-Huh?

298
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:51,062
-I see what it is you're
trying to tell me.

299
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:54,096
To go with Ichigo to
Hueco Mundo, right?

300
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:55,462
That can't happen.

301
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:57,829
Because right now I
can't involve myself

302
00:17:57,862 --> 00:17:59,929
with Soul Reapers.

303
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:01,496
Please, go now.

304
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:06,296
If Orihime needs saving,
I can do it by myself.

305
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:08,829
By himself?

306
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:10,696
Wait a minute.

307
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:15,062
Did you just say a moment ago,
that Ichigo is by himself?

308
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:19,829
-Yes.

309
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:21,696
The Soul Society
is having nothing

310
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:23,396
to do with this incident.

311
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:26,529
Ichigo made the decision to
head into enemy territory

312
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:29,129
by himself.

313
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:31,429
-Is that so?

314
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:34,229
Then that changes everything.

315
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:34,729
-Really?

316
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:36,029
Why's that?

317
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:37,296
I mean, I don't get it.

318
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:39,729
I'm still a Soul Reaper,
even without the Soul Society

319
00:18:39,762 --> 00:18:40,996
helping me out.

320
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:42,396
-That's incorrect.

321
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,529
You're a substitute Soul Reaper.

322
00:18:44,562 --> 00:18:49,429
And furthermore, you've been
abandoned by the Soul Society.

323
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,496
In other words, right
now you're neither

324
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,962
a Soul Reaper nor one
of their associates.

325
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:56,096
So even if I associate
myself with you,

326
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:58,962
it doesn't go
against my contract.

327
00:18:58,996 --> 00:19:01,196
-That's an illogical argument.

328
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:04,329
-I prefer to think
of it as a loophole.

329
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:05,529
-Whatever.

330
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,462
What the hell is the
difference between the two?

331
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:08,396
-Shut up.

332
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:10,262
Whose side are you on, anyway?

333
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:10,829
-Your enemy's.

334
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:15,262
-How typical of Uryu.

335
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:29,996
-Hm.

336
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:34,562
Hey.

337
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:37,596
It looks like Uryu
ran away, doesn't it?

338
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:42,829
-How did you get
in here, Isshin?

339
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:43,629
-Huh?

340
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:44,996
What's this?

341
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:46,696
In all the years
that I've known you,

342
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:48,662
you've never called me that.

343
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:51,196
What's with the change
in your attitude?

344
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:53,196
-Just answer my
question, Isshin.

345
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:56,129
I'm asking you how
you got in here.

346
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,896
That attire.

347
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,429
You've got all your powers back?

348
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:01,862
-Pretty much.

349
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:04,362
How do I look?

350
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:06,029
-It makes me sick.

351
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:09,529
-Well, thank you very much.

352
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:11,729
Aren't you going
to read the letter?

353
00:20:11,762 --> 00:20:13,262
Foolish.

354
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,596
-Why bother?

355
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:18,896
I already know what it says,
without having to read it.

356
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:21,162
-So you wanted him to go, huh?

357
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:22,529
-That is none of your concern.

358
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:29,796
I brought back his Quincy
powers, it's up to him.

359
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,229
Whether he makes use of
them or suppresses them,

360
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:37,529
it doesn't really matter
if he lives or dies.

361
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:40,196
-What a horrible father.

362
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,229
-I'm a great
improvement over you.

363
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:49,662
-Yeah, I know.

364
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:50,629
[music playing]

365
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:01,996
-I was told to stay quiet here.

366
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:05,896
But there's nothing
for me to do.

367
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:07,162
I'm so hungry.

368
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:18,862
I can't help but
wonder if it was really

369
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:22,862
a good idea for me to come here.

370
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:24,396
I wonder if the
battle got worse,

371
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:26,596
because I healed those people.

[music playing]

373
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:46,362
-No.

374
00:21:46,396 --> 00:21:49,329
But right now, I
have to make them

375
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:52,796
think that I'm of use
to them, no matter what.

376
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:56,262
At least, at least
until everyone

377
00:21:56,296 --> 00:21:58,696
is prepared for battle.

-I wanted to go to
Hueco Mundo, too!

382
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:48,003
-It can't be helped.

383
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:50,203
Our gigai's were destroyed
in our last battle.

384
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:51,169
-What a waste.

385
00:23:51,203 --> 00:23:52,269
-Then let's get
some new ones made.

386
00:23:52,303 --> 00:23:54,669
This time I want a sexy one.

387
00:23:54,703 --> 00:23:57,203
-And I want a handsome one.

388
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:58,436
-Get real.
