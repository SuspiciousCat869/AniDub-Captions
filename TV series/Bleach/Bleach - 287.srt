1
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:15,400
Huh?

2
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,200
Where am I?

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,733
Wait... What the--?!

4
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,366
Why the hell am I
dressed like this?

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,866
[meow]

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,166
Huh? A cat?

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,233
<i>Is that you,</i>
<i>Yoruichi?</i>

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,166
[meow]

9
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:32,568
Okay, So what's
this big important
meeting about?

10
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:35,735
And what's with
these ridiculous
clothes we're
wearing?

11
00:02:36,268 --> 00:02:38,035
I think our
clothes are fine.

12
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:40,068
They're the
same clothes we
always wear.

13
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:42,868
You fall and hit
your head or
something, Chigo?

14
00:02:42,902 --> 00:02:45,135
Chigo? Who the
hell's that?

15
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:50,035
That's sad, even for you.
What, you've forgotten your
own name now?

16
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:53,868
What is this,
what're you
talking about?!
I know my name!

17
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:57,068
It's I-chi-go
Ku-ro-sa-ki!

18
00:02:57,435 --> 00:03:01,068
Yeah, right.
Where'd you come up
with that nonsense?

19
00:03:01,768 --> 00:03:02,702
It's time.

20
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:03,835
Right.

21
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:05,035
Let's go.

22
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,068
Hm? Wait, go where?

23
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:12,035
You wanna tell me what
the hell's going on? Hey!

24
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:19,702
I've had my eye on this
prize for a long time,
I don't want to blow it.

25
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:22,202
We'll have to move
very carefully.

26
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,368
Don't worry, it'll be
fine, Urio.

27
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:26,502
After all, you came
up with the plan.

28
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:29,968
Glad you're on board
with it, Ori Mei,
that's very reassuring.

29
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:32,268
Right?
Isn't it,
Chaido?

30
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:33,202
Mmm.

31
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:38,235
<i>What's with these names?</i>
<i>Urio? Ori Mei? Chaido?</i>

32
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:41,202
<i>These guys have been acting</i>
<i>weird for awhile now...</i>

33
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:42,468
<i>On top of that...</i>

34
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:46,635
<i>When did this giant eel start</i>
<i>pretending to be a camel?!</i>

35
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:52,068
If this is some kind of
joke, I'm afraid I
don't get it, Chigo.

36
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:56,035
Bawabawa's not
pretending to be a
camel, he is a camel.

37
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:58,168
Poor guy.
He's a mess.

38
00:03:58,202 --> 00:03:59,002
Mmm.

39
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:00,035
Agh...

40
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:03,202
Okay, Chigo, here's the plan.

41
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:07,502
We're going to sneak into the
palace of Ura Vira, the
wealthiest merchant in town.

42
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:08,935
We are? Why?

43
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:14,468
Cuz that's where the legendary
Snow Crystal is, the only jewel
of its kind in the whole world!

44
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:18,502
And tonight's the night
we're going to sneak in
there and steal it!

45
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:21,735
You're kidding. So you're
saying we're thieves now?

46
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:23,235
No not thieves,
burglars.

47
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:25,902
Oh, well, that's a lot better,
thanks for clearing that up.

48
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:41,602
[All]
Ooh!

49
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:53,835
Whoa. This place
is straight out
of a dream.

50
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:56,668
Yeah. You're right,
it's just like a dream!

51
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:58,902
Well, that's because
this is a dream.

52
00:04:59,268 --> 00:04:59,868
Huh??

53
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,902
[Uryu]
Okay, it's dangerous
to stay here too long.

54
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,168
So forget everything else,
just find the Snow Crystal.

55
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:07,002
[Chad]
Mmm.

56
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:09,235
Got it!

57
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,735
[Ichigo]
Might help if we knew what
we were searching for.
What's this thing look like?

58
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:14,568
The Snow Crystal...

59
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:18,768
shines with an inner
radiance of such beauty
it fills the beholder
with calm and wonder,

60
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:21,402
and when you touch it,
it's as cold as snow!

61
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:23,335
It's a treasure
beyond compare!

62
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:25,902
You know, this is
all sounding kinda
vague to me.

63
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:29,268
You sure you're not
just making this up
as you go along?

64
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:32,702
<i>[Orihime]</i>
<i>Hey! I think I found it!</i>

65
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:40,102
Can you open it?

66
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:43,202
Stand back and leave
it to me. Hmm-hmm!

67
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:44,235
[click]

68
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:49,902
[oohs, ahhs]

69
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:55,968
Huh??

70
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:58,068
One little lamp,
that's it?

71
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:02,535
Kind of a big treasure
chest just to hold that,
don'tcha think?

72
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:04,902
<i>Huh?... Kon?</i>

73
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:07,402
This looks like Kon--

74
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:10,068
<i>[Uryu]</i>
<i>No, wait, now I get it!</i>
<i>Aladdin and the Lamp!</i>

75
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:16,102
You know, the story from
Arabian Nights, the magic
lamp and the three wishes?

76
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:19,535
<i>This whole dream</i>
<i>is obviously based</i>
<i>on that story.</i>

77
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:23,035
Hold on, Uryu.
What did you just say?

78
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:25,568
Who's Uryu?
My name's Urio.

79
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:28,735
Never mind that!
Is this a dream
we're in right now?

80
00:06:28,768 --> 00:06:31,502
Either you haven't been
paying attention or
you're really obtuse.

81
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:33,402
Of course it is.

82
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,535
If it wasn't a dream,
there's no way things would
be going so smoothly.

83
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:37,368
True!

84
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:38,902
Mmm-hmm.

85
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:43,968
<i>Aah-ha ha ha haaa!</i>

86
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:48,935
Call yourselves burglars?
You're too pathetic.

87
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:52,368
You look a lot more like rats
caught in a trap to me.

88
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:56,968
A dream. Yeah, okay. Now it's
all beginning to make sense.

89
00:06:57,268 --> 00:06:59,202
That's Ura Vira,
the merchant,

90
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:04,002
whose collection of treasure
includes rarities gathered from
every corner of the globe!

91
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:06,102
The richest man in
this whole country!

92
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:09,435
Hello? Who the hell are
you talking to anyway?

93
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:12,368
Oh you poor fools,
use your heads.

94
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:18,235
Did you really think that with
all this priceless treasure
lying around I wouldn't be
prepared for break-ins?

95
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:25,302
[panicked shouts]

96
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:30,768
[Ichigo]
A giant boulder, really?
That is such a cliché!!

97
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:44,735
Laser beams? Oh, come on!
That's a cliché AND an
anachronism!

98
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:50,902
[Chad]
A dead end. What do we do now?

99
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:53,068
[Uryu]
Damn it! We'll have to
fight our way out.

100
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:56,502
[Ichigo]
Fight?? Fight with what?
We're unarmed!

101
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:59,568
[Orihime]
Who says we're
unarmed? Look!

102
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:03,168
That stupid lamp?
What're we s'posed to
do with tha--?!

103
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:05,168
Oh!

104
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:08,268
That's right! If this is one
of those magic lamps, you're
supposed to rub it, right?

105
00:08:08,302 --> 00:08:10,468
To make the
genie come out?

106
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:13,535
(startled reax) ...(alarmed
reax)

107
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:14,902
It's working!
Here he comes!

108
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:18,202
Watch it! It looks
like the whole thing
is about to explode!

109
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,702
Who is it that summons
the genie of the lamp?

110
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:28,535
Rukia?! What are you doing in
there?

111
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,902
I'm not Rukia,
I'm Rukiruki!

112
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:32,502
Don't you start!

113
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:35,702
Hey, listen, you.
If you don't want
anything, leave me alone.

114
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:37,868
I happen
to be very busy.

115
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:41,435
Hey, where the hell're you
going? Come back here,
this is an emergency!

116
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:43,102
Emergency,
emergency!

117
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:48,168
[sigh] What is it?
You're getting to be a pest.

118
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:50,668
Well you're the genie
of the lamp, aren'tcha?

119
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:52,868
So that means you're able
to grant wishes, right?

120
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:55,835
Yes, that's right.
What's it to you?

121
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,835
<i>[thud]</i>

122
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:57,735
Huh?

123
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:01,835
That's right,
break it down.

124
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:04,602
I was going to remodel
this wing anyway.

125
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:09,368
Come on! Help us out,
we're in a real jam here!
Will you grant us a wish?

126
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:12,268
I refuse.

127
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:16,602
For one thing, genie law
prohibits me from granting
wishes to anyone who is not
totally pure of heart.

128
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:20,102
And then there's that
orange hair, that's
completely unacceptable.

129
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:22,668
What's the color of
my hair got to do
with anything?!

130
00:09:22,702 --> 00:09:25,502
Dying your hair is a
sign of delinquency!

131
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,668
Are you a genie or
a vice principal?

132
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:29,668
Anyway, I don't
dye my hair!

133
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,535
I've given you
my answer.
It's no.

134
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:35,702
Okay, fine, fine.
Know what I think?

135
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:36,835
I think you're
full of it.

136
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,335
Rnn!

137
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:40,768
You can't grant any
wishes, can you?
You're just a big phony.

138
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:42,602
I am not!

139
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:44,002
Okay, then show me.

140
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:46,235
I can't, I'd be
breaking the law!

141
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:49,168
Yeah right, that's just an
excuse. You can't do it.

142
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:49,835
Can too!

143
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:51,435
Okay then, prove it!

144
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:53,835
I told you,
genie law
forbids it!

145
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:56,402
Admit it,
getyou're a big phony.

146
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:58,768
All right. You want
to see proof?

147
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:00,768
Well, go on then, make a wish.

148
00:10:00,802 --> 00:10:02,602
Ooh, I've got one!

149
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,435
I wish for a piece of cake!

150
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:08,768
Maybe not the smartest
wish in this situation.

151
00:10:08,802 --> 00:10:10,635
All right!
Coming up!

152
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:14,968
Whoa, amazing!

153
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:18,735
There, are you
satisfied? Is that
proof enough for you?

154
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:22,202
Big freakin' deal, my kid
sister can make a cake.

155
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:25,068
I was thinking of something a
little more challenging.

156
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:29,568
Gah! You get a total of
three wishes, that's it.
You have two left.

157
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:33,468
And again!...
Almost there.

158
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:35,702
This door won't
hold much longer!

159
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:40,068
Rukia! Our second wish is
for you to get us the hell
out of here, and fast!

160
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:44,735
Language. If you want a
favor, you should learn
how to ask for it nicely.

161
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:49,035
Uh, will you get us the
hell out of here please?

162
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:50,935
There. That's
more like it.

163
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:52,902
Here we go...

164
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:05,935
<i>[Chad]</i>
<i>It's cramped in here.</i>

165
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:07,568
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>And it stinks!</i>

166
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:09,568
Hey, Rukia--

167
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,935
Stop calling me that!
I'm Rukiruki!

168
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:15,635
Whatever, okay, listen,
I asked you to get us
out of there and you did...

169
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:18,635
But did you have to stick
us in an outhouse?!

170
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:22,435
<i>[Orihime]</i>
<i>We're all safe and sound,</i>
<i>that's what's important!</i>

171
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:23,468
<i>[Uryu]</i>
<i>Right!</i>

172
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:27,035
For a minute there,
I thought all of us
were done for.

173
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:33,102
What was I thinking?
I should have just used that
wish to wake myself up from
this ridiculous dream.

174
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,068
I'm such an idiot...

175
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:38,702
Okay, I've come this far, I
guess I might as well finish it.

176
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:40,435
So tell me what
your last wish is.

177
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:43,768
All right! I wish for
you to wake me from
this dream right n--

178
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:46,535
[in unison]
Ha! I wish for
the Snow Crystal!

179
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:50,002
What, all three of you?
Okay, majority wins.

180
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:51,368
Hey, hold on a second!

181
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:53,735
I'm the one who
summoned the genie
in the first place!

182
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:57,035
So if anyone gets dibs on
the last wish it should
be me, don'tcha think?!

183
00:11:57,735 --> 00:12:00,435
I never knew you
were that kind of
person, Chigo.

184
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:02,902
Some people are like that,
they're just greedy.

185
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:05,135
Hmm. Some
friend you are.

186
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:07,702
<i>Oh, who cares what</i>
<i>you guys think?!</i>
<i>This is my dream!</i>

187
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:09,935
<i>I get to do</i>
<i>whatever I want!</i>

188
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:12,735
[Uryu]
What are you talking about?
You said yourself the Snow
Crystal was one of your wishes!

189
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:14,868
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>When did I say that?!</i>
<i>I never said that!</i>

190
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,502
<i>[Orihime]</i>
<i>Wait!</i>

191
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,502
I know!
We'll decide it
with a vote!

192
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:20,568
You gotta
be kidding.

193
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:23,168
Who wants to wish for
the Snow Crystal?

194
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,368
Me! / Me! / Me!

195
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:26,835
Wait a second,
waait a second!

196
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:29,668
Hang on, this is
so unfair!
Come on out, Rukiruki,
we've got our wish.

197
00:12:29,702 --> 00:12:31,735
I can't believe
you'd try to gang up
on me like that!

198
00:12:31,768 --> 00:12:33,802
Three against one,
in my own dream!
Hey, what's going on?
She's not coming out...

199
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:43,602
You sure took your time, didn't
you? What's going on in there?

200
00:12:47,102 --> 00:12:50,735
Uh oh, what happened?
That's a totally
different genie!

201
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:53,768
How'd you get in there,
Renji, and how come
you're full-sized?

202
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:56,502
I'm not Renji! I'm Ren Jin!

203
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:59,735
Yeah, never mind,
whatever your name is.
we don't need you.

204
00:12:59,768 --> 00:13:02,568
Our business
is with Rukia.

205
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:06,268
If you mean Rukiruki...
she won't be coming out
any more.

206
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:07,835
[in unison]
Huh?

207
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:12,002
Rukiruki has broken the sacred
laws of the Lamp Society,

208
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:14,235
and for that she will
pay with her life!

209
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:15,602
Huh?

210
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:21,302
She is to be executed tomorrow,
at the stroke of noon.

211
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:25,168
Hey, why does this
sound familiar?

212
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:27,802
And what the hell is
the Lamp Society?

213
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:30,202
This is your fault!

214
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:33,368
She's going to die
because she granted
you those wishes!

215
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:35,768
I should curse you,
but instead I must...

216
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:38,402
swallow my pride and
ask you a favor!

217
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:41,435
Save Rukiruki,
before it's too late!

218
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:44,268
Things sure happen
fast around here...

219
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:46,535
Chigo, what are
you waiting for?
Let's go!

220
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:47,535
Hang on--

221
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:50,802
Hey, don't I get a say in this?
It's my dream!!!

222
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:12,491
[Uryu]
So this is the
Lamp Society.

223
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:16,091
Now all that we have to
do is find Rukiruki...

224
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,191
Huh?

225
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,825
What did I ever do to get
myself mixed up in this?

226
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:24,825
Is something
wrong, Chigo?

227
00:14:24,858 --> 00:14:25,825
Carsick?

228
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:27,358
No, of course not.

229
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:29,358
Yeah, of course
he isn't, Ori Mei.

230
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:30,558
Hm?

231
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:32,625
After all, this isn't a car,
it's a carpet.

232
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:35,691
If he were
suffering from
anything, it'd be
carpetsickness.

233
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:37,458
Ah!

234
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:39,525
Who the hell cares?
That's all kinda beside
the point right now!

235
00:14:39,558 --> 00:14:43,058
Man. All you ever
do is complain,
you know that, Chigo?

236
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,325
Okay, okay,
you're right.

237
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:46,825
[sigh]

238
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:49,491
As long as I'm here,
I might as well see
it through.

239
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,991
I'll stick with you
guys till the end!

240
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,158
[meow]

241
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,125
<i>[Yoruichi]</i>
<i>Well said, Chigo!</i>

242
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:55,558
Huh?

243
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:57,191
<i>Just the words I've</i>
<i>been waiting to hear.</i>

244
00:14:57,225 --> 00:14:58,558
Yoruichi?

245
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:01,258
<i>Why are you looking at her?</i>
<i>I'm right here.</i>

246
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:03,691
Hwahh!

247
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:11,358
Yoruichi!

248
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:14,691
Heh-heh. What's wrong, Chigo?
surprised to see me?

249
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:17,225
Wait, then who is this?

250
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:18,925
That's just
a black cat.

251
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:22,525
Okay, I guess it's time I
brought everyone up to speed.

252
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:31,025
<i>Rukiruki is going to be</i>
<i>executed at a place called the</i>
<i>Solamp, which lies deep within</i>
<i>the Lamp Society's territory.</i>

253
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:35,191
<i>In order to reach it,</i>
<i>we'll have to get past the</i>
<i>Thirteen Court Lamp Squads,</i>

254
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,991
<i>those deadly, highly skilled</i>
<i>guardians of the Lamp Society.</i>

255
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:43,325
Oh, is that all we have to do,
take on 13 Lamp squads, really?!

256
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:46,425
I mean, gimme a break,
I wouldn't even know
where to begin!

257
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:49,825
All right, till
we meet again.
Hopefully alive.

258
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:50,858
[in unison]
Roger!

259
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:55,625
Wait, how are we
s'posed to land?
What happens when we
hit the ground?!

260
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:57,825
Don't worry,
the fall won't
kill you.

261
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:00,391
After all, this is only
a dream, isn't it?

262
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:02,025
Huh?

263
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:08,891
Ngh! Man, that hurt
so much I almost wish
it had killed me!

264
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:12,525
Anyway, I thought you
were supposed to wake
up from a dream before
you hit the ground!

265
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:15,058
Oh, don't tell me...

266
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:19,658
Oh no, oh no!
I have to go
through this again?

267
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:26,925
Not that I've got a
problem with that!
No, consistency is
fine! It's great!

268
00:16:29,025 --> 00:16:32,591
I remember this scene...
Okay, where's the real Zangetsu?

269
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,358
<i>There!</i>

270
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:39,525
Wait a second, the real
Zangetsu has a design to
match this world, too?

271
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,991
[screech]

272
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:04,825
Ow ow! Ow ow ow ow!

273
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,858
Oh! Chigo?

274
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:09,625
Hi.

275
00:17:09,658 --> 00:17:11,725
<i>You idiot!</i>
<i>It took you</i>
<i>long enough!</i>

276
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:16,291
That was cutting it kind
of close, wasn't it?
I could have been killed!

277
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:18,491
Oh come on, aren't you
exaggerating a little?

278
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:20,091
Oww, stop it, that hurts!

279
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:26,158
I could sense you
were there, Byakuya.

280
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:29,825
What the--? Whoa!
Ambassador Seaweed??

281
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:35,358
Oh wow, my big brother... I've
never seen you looking better.

282
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:38,391
If you ask me,
this family needs help.

283
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,891
All right, you can take
off that disguise now!

284
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:48,891
Mmf!

285
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:52,025
Ahahahaha!
Sorry! Sorry!

286
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:54,625
But where'd you
get that outfit?

287
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,725
Ha ha! It sure doesn't
go with your image--!

288
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:02,758
Beware, for it is a
dangerous thing to tread
on another man's pride.

289
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:07,925
Okay, bring it on! I've come
this far, I'm going to see
this through to the end!

290
00:18:20,258 --> 00:18:21,258
[growl]

291
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:39,025
Grrrahh!

292
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:09,058
I concede the match.
You win this battle.

293
00:19:12,591 --> 00:19:15,891
Hey I did it! It's all over!

294
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:19,725
It's all overrrrrrrrrr--!!

295
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:21,758
[crash]

296
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:34,591
Aah, finally! I thought that
dream would never end...

297
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,658
What?! No, no, you've gotta
be kidding! I'm still here?!

298
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:42,391
Ohh man, when am I gonna
wake up already??!

299
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:43,891
<i>[Renji]</i>
<i>Well done, Chigo!</i>

300
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:44,825
Uh?

301
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:51,358
It's thanks to you that
Rukiruki's life was saved.

302
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:53,858
Thank you. I'm very grateful.

303
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:56,491
That's okay.
It was nothing.

304
00:19:56,525 --> 00:19:58,791
It's not like I had
much choice anyway.

305
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:02,825
As a token of my
appreciation, I will
grant you your third
and final wish.

306
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:03,991
Huh?

307
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:05,325
<i>What is it to be?</i>

308
00:20:05,691 --> 00:20:07,658
Oh. Well, let's see...

309
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:12,691
[Uryu]
His wish is that you'll wake
him up from this dream.
Isn't that right, Chigo?

310
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:16,925
[Chad]
Yes. After everything he's
done, he deserves it.

311
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:20,991
[Orihime]
That's right. The last wish
has got to go to Chigo.

312
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:22,858
But, you guys--

313
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:24,691
Well, all right then.

314
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:25,758
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>No, wait!</i>

315
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:29,025
The Snow Crystal!

316
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:30,558
Huh??
Huh??

317
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,591
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>The Snow Crystal?</i>

318
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:35,391
Yeah. Shiny, cold
and beautiful.

319
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:37,391
A priceless
treasure.

320
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:38,691
Really,
Chigo?

321
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:39,825
<i>[Uryu]</i>
<i>You sure?</i>

322
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:44,991
You bet. Why shouldn't I let
you guys have your wish granted?

323
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:48,725
After all, I'll wake up
from this dream sooner
or later anyway, right?

324
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:51,491
Wow, Chigo, thanks.

325
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:52,491
Yeah.

326
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:54,625
Whoa, you're
deeper than
I thought.

327
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,858
<i>Oh, shut up and go with it</i>
<i>before I change my mind.</i>

328
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:58,525
<i>[Uryu]</i>
<i>You may</i>
<i>regret it later.</i>

329
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,691
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>This whole dream's</i>
<i>nothing but regrets.</i>

330
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:05,591
Behold, the
legendary treasure:
the Snow Crystal!

331
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:13,091
Ahh!
Whoa!

332
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,658
So this is the Snow Crystal...

333
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:26,525
White...cold... beautiful...

334
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:29,191
...and squishy?

335
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:34,958
Huh?...

336
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:37,158
What?
Whaaat??

337
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:41,825
It's a fish cake?!

338
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:48,491
Oh, wow, only a dream.
Thank goodness.

339
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:51,558
Why do I keep having these
strange dreams?...

340
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,558
Uh.
