[theme music]

2
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,334
-In addition to
conducting research

3
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:53,467
on the spirit waves left by
the Arrancar and the Espada

4
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:55,834
in the world of the
living, it is imperative

5
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,701
that we devise a
method to simplify

6
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:58,934
the procedure for Gentei Kaijo.

7
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:04,201
-So the head captain
has requested

8
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:07,134
that someone from the Department
of Research and Development

9
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:10,267
go to the world of the living
to gather this information.

10
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:13,101
-What about you, sir?

11
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:16,201
-While I would enjoy gathering
information on the Arrancars,

12
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:19,267
the Espada are what I'm
primarily interested in, and I

13
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:22,167
cannot be certain that
I would find one there.

14
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:24,201
I will save my
visit to the world

15
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:26,601
of living for the
showdown this winter.

16
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:29,734
-This is the assignment.

17
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:31,134
-Hm.

18
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:34,534
Must be nice to be able to pass
down any orders you don't want.

19
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:35,867
-All right.

20
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:37,801
Who wants to volunteer to go
to the world of the living?

21
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,301
[grumbling]

22
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:39,934
-Anyone but me.

23
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:40,567
-Sorry.

24
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:41,767
I have a headache.

25
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:42,334
-Me.

26
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:44,034
-Huh?

27
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:46,401
-Yeah, I'll go.

28
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:49,234
That is, if it's all
right with you, of course.

29
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:50,667
-What a surprise, Rin.

30
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,767
-This is unusual for you.

31
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,801
-Usually you just eat sweets
and look for ways to avoid work.

32
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:57,734
AKON: I guess it's OK.

33
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:58,501
-Huh?

34
00:02:58,534 --> 00:02:59,967
You mean I can really go?

35
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:02,267
-You'll need someone to
guide and protect you,

36
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:05,067
so they're sending along a man
from Squad Four who's already

37
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,801
been to the world of the living.

38
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:07,367
-Yes, sir.

39
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:08,201
I understand.

40
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:09,801
-There's one other thing, Rin.

41
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:11,034
-Yeah?

42
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:13,434
-Give these to
Third Seat Madarame.

43
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,801
They're his replacement molars.

44
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:15,275
-Oh.

45
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:15,757
Sure.

46
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:27,457
So this is the
Senkaimon that leads

47
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,424
to the world of the living.

48
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:30,557
All right!

49
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,790
The world of the living
is like sugar heaven!

50
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:36,090
I've waited my whole
life for this day!

51
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:37,924
I'm going to pig
out on everything!

52
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:40,290
I'll start with candy,
and work my way up!

53
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:42,224
And they've got these
things called cakes.

54
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:44,157
I've never had one, but
I hear they're awesome.

55
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,957
-Excuse me.

56
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,990
Hi, how ya doin'?

57
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:49,957
-Ah!

58
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,424
Whoa!

59
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:52,924
-Whoa!

60
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:57,657
-Excuse me.

61
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,790
Are you all right?

62
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,057
-Sorry.

63
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,690
I didn't mean to
startle you like that,

64
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:04,590
but my name's Hanataro
Yamada of Squad Four,

65
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,390
and I've been given
orders to accompany you

66
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:08,057
to the world of the living.

67
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,790
-I'm Rin Tsubokura
of the Department

68
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:12,324
of Research and Development.

69
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:14,257
Hello?

70
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,457
What kind of store is this?

71
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,724
-It's Urahara's shop.

72
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:21,224
Whenever I need anything,
I can usually come by here,

73
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:23,224
and these guys will help me out.

74
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:25,924
Is anybody here?

75
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:26,890
Huh.

76
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:28,790
Looks like no one's around.

77
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:29,990
Hello?

78
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:30,990
-Oh, wow.

79
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:32,390
Look at all the candy in here.

80
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:36,457
-No, don't eat that!

81
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,457
You haven't paid for it yet.

82
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,724
[laughter]

83
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:42,724
-You really like
this stuff, huh?

84
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:45,990
-What exactly are
you two doing here?

85
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:46,490
-Ah!

86
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:47,424
-Oh.

87
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:48,224
Tessai.

88
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:51,090
Long time no see.

89
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,490
Actually, we're here
for a few reasons.

90
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:55,924
I'm supposed to go along with
Rin while he collects data

91
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:57,924
from the previous battle
sights, so that we

92
00:04:57,957 --> 00:05:00,057
can simplify the
Gentei Kajo procedure

93
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,890
and prepare for the upcoming
battle against the Arrancars.

94
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:04,024
-Ah, yes.

95
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:06,757
Captain Hitsugaya said
something about that.

96
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,990
It's a good idea.

97
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:10,424
In the last battle, it
obviously took far too long

98
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:13,257
to authorize the Gentei Kaijo.

99
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,490
But, first things first.

100
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:17,490
We'll show you the place
where the Arrancars appeared.

101
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:18,190
-Thanks.

102
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:19,357
We appreciate your help.

103
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,757
-I'm sure Yumichiko would
be happy to escort you

104
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,957
to the site.

105
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,424
-What makes you think
that would make me happy?

106
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:27,124
Couldn't somebody else do it?

107
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:29,190
-I thought you'd
jump at the chance.

108
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:30,757
In fact, you were
the first person

109
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,724
Captain Hitsugaya
thought of for this job,

110
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:35,524
seeing as how you have all
this free time on your hands!

111
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,257
-What do you mean?

112
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,457
-It would really help us out.

113
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,524
-Why does this
always happen to me?

114
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,124
Hey.

115
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:50,457
Are you almost
finished down there?

116
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,157
Or do you expect me
to stand here all day?

117
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,324
Do you think maybe you
could hurry it up a little?

118
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:01,757
HANATARO: Are you
getting anything?

119
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,957
-I think so.

120
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,557
There's definitely some
kind of pattern here.

121
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,690
-Yumichika, we're ready for you
to take us to the next site.

122
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:16,824
-Ugh.

123
00:06:16,857 --> 00:06:19,457
Having to walk to get
around is so boring.

124
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,790
-Sorry.

125
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:22,524
If I was better at flash step,
we wouldn't have to walk.

126
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:25,090
[gasp]

127
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:25,590
-Yeah.

128
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:28,824
Yes?

129
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:29,824
What is it now?

130
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,890
-I thought Rin was
right behind me.

131
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:36,257
-He didn't get
himself lost, did he?

132
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:36,957
CLERK: Thank you.

133
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,257
Enjoy your cake.

134
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,857
-You can't just
wander off like that.

135
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,090
We're on a mission.

136
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:45,324
-Well, the cakes in the
window looked so delicious,

137
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:46,924
I just couldn't stop myself.

138
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:48,124
-You bought a cake?

139
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,290
But how?

140
00:06:49,324 --> 00:06:50,690
How were you able
to walk in there

141
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:53,390
and buy a cake when you
don't even have a gigai?

142
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:54,357
-Oh, yeah.

143
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,757
I brought something
along for that.

144
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,490
It's right over here.

145
00:06:58,524 --> 00:06:58,990
-Huh?

146
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:03,190
-It's a device
we've been working

147
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:06,457
on that makes a soul actually
appear to have a physical body.

148
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,390
This isn't exactly what
it was designed for,

149
00:07:08,424 --> 00:07:10,490
but it's pretty handy when
you want to buy a cake.

150
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:14,124
-Quit wasting time, and let's
finish what we came here for.

151
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:14,890
[yawn]

152
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:15,790
-Huh?

153
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:16,757
-Huh?

154
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,724
Ah!

155
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:19,024
-It's a ghost!

156
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:20,557
-It looks like a--

157
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:24,690
YUMICHIKA: A bound spirit.

158
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:34,324
-Uh-- Am I imagining this, or
are you guys really able to see

159
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:34,824
me?

160
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:35,924
-Yeah.

161
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,290
We can see you, 'cause
we're Soul Reapers.

162
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,157
-Ah, wonderful.

163
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,857
That's great.

164
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,057
-It's not great.

165
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,724
In fact, it's just
the opposite of great,

166
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:44,090
because it appears that
you're attached to this store.

167
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:45,657
We can't let you stay here.

168
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,257
It's just too dangerous.

169
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,457
-W-wait a minute.

170
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,490
What are you going to do?

171
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:50,690
Just hold on?

172
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:52,857
-If you stay here,
the Hollows will come.

173
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,424
They're attracted
to souls like yours.

174
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:59,757
When that happens, you'll
become one of them.

175
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,057
Then you'll attack
the ones you love.

176
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:02,557
-No!

177
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,624
Wait!

178
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,357
-In order to prevent
that from happening,

179
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,990
we'll perform a Konso, and
send you to the Soul Society.

180
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:09,690
-No, wait!

181
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:11,124
I'm not ready to go yet!

182
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,290
Please, just let me explain.

183
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:13,790
That's all I ask.

184
00:08:13,824 --> 00:08:16,224
I don't want something
horrible to happen.

185
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:17,457
-It'll be all right.

186
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,990
You'll feel better soon.

187
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:21,390
-Please, don't do this to me!

188
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:22,124
Don't do it!

189
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:23,357
-Get ready!

190
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,724
Hey!

191
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:27,357
-What if he doesn't tell us,
and something horrible happens?

192
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,324
-What's the rush?

193
00:08:28,357 --> 00:08:30,157
Why can't we at
least hear his story?

194
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:37,757
Wow.

195
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,790
What a long chain.

196
00:08:41,824 --> 00:08:44,424
-Normally, earthbound spirits
can't move this far away

197
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,790
from the spot
they're attached to.

198
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:48,357
-So what's your story?

199
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,190
-Well, OK.

200
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:53,324
You see, my name
is Heita Momoyama,

201
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:54,724
and I'm a baker by trade.

202
00:08:54,757 --> 00:08:58,690
And that shop back there
is where I used to work.

203
00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:02,257
I had just left the shop
when I got hit by a car.

204
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,124
I worked hard at my job.

205
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:09,790
The master pastry chef there had
been treating me to bake cakes.

206
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:11,990
-Listen, you're dead.

207
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:14,090
I'm sorry, but you've
baked your last cake.

208
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:15,224
-Hey!

209
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:16,624
You don't have to say
it like that, do you?

210
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,924
-Wow, you must really have
a thing for cakes. 'Cause

211
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:23,124
whenever someone brings them up,
you go right off the deep end.

212
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:25,224
-So, what's keeping you here?

213
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:29,257
I'm not ready to go.

214
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,857
Not 'til mother
knows I'm all right.

215
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:41,357
You see, she still
gets up every morning

216
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,024
when the streets are deserted,
and comes to the place

217
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:47,990
where I died to pray
for my soul to move on.

218
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:49,357
But I'm worried.

219
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,024
She's not looking so well.

220
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:54,090
In fact, my sister's
so worried about her,

221
00:09:54,124 --> 00:09:55,790
she asked Mom to
leave her apartment

222
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:58,357
and move in with
her and her husband.

223
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,257
And I, I thought that
would be good for her.

224
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,424
It's just that with
all of the time

225
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:05,590
I'd been putting in
learning to bake cakes,

226
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:07,757
I'd been working so hard
that my mother never

227
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,290
even got to taste one of them.

228
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,890
It's just not fair!

229
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:20,790
If we all work together,
we can bake the cake.

230
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:22,690
You'll be my hands,
and I can teach you.

231
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:24,024
-Huh?

232
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,224
-Well, she has to
taste one of my cakes.

233
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:29,790
I know that this may
sound completely insane,

234
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:32,190
but if you could make it
exactly the way I tell you to,

235
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:34,424
then it'll be my cake!

236
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,224
-I don't know what to say.

237
00:10:36,257 --> 00:10:38,690
No spirit has ever
asked me to bake a cake.

238
00:10:38,724 --> 00:10:39,890
RIN: Let's do it!

239
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:40,590
-Huh?

240
00:10:40,624 --> 00:10:42,157
-You don't really care.

241
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,690
You just want to do it so you
can eat a bunch of cake, right?

242
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:45,557
-Who cares?

243
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,224
We should help the guy out.

244
00:10:47,257 --> 00:10:49,090
-Besides, it might be
a really good cake.

245
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:49,657
-Yep.

246
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,624
I thought so.

247
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:52,357
I promise you won't regret it.

248
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,024
-This venture will
mark the grand opening

249
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:03,424
of the Urahara
Shop's new kitchen.

250
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:05,490
-Everything is so perfect.

251
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:06,590
-Thank you.

252
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,357
I discussed it
with Tessai, and we

253
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,257
decided to have the entire
kitchen completely remodeled.

254
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,724
-Huh?

255
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,124
Ah!

256
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:19,024
-I'd greatly appreciate it if
you two didn't ruin anything.

257
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:20,324
-Of course.

258
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,624
-I tried to make sure the
kitchen was fully stocked,

259
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:24,924
so feel free to use
anything you need.

260
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:27,190
Although I have to
admit I'm surprised.

261
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:30,457
I never knew Yumichika had such
a keen interest in cooking.

262
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,657
-I do not have a keen
interest in cooking.

263
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,057
-So, are you ready
to bake a cake?

264
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:37,824
-Sure.

265
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:38,924
I'm counting on you guys.

266
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:44,624
-How did I get myself into this?

267
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:52,657
Still, I gotta admit, I make
these clothes look good.

268
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:00,866
-Like this?

269
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,032
HEITA: Good.

270
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,932
But you've beat the cream
'til it forms peaks.

271
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,866
-OK.

272
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,032
-I think something's wrong.

273
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:10,332
I don't know if these eggs
are supposed to be all lumpy

274
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:11,899
and stick together like this.

275
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,132
-No, of course not.

276
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,466
What did you do to them?

277
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:16,566
I told you, the water
in the double boiler

278
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,032
has to be at room temperature.

279
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:19,499
Your water's too hot.

280
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,299
Look, you've got a
bubbling cauldron there.

281
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,466
You might as well cook
them in a hot spring.

282
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:24,232
-I'm sorry.

283
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,199
-Start over again!

284
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:25,699
-Yes.

285
00:12:25,732 --> 00:12:26,899
Of course.

286
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:28,766
-I hope you washed your
finger before you stuck it

287
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,566
in that batter.

288
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,532
They're too big.

289
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:34,066
Cut them smaller.

290
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:34,766
-All right, fine.

291
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,566
How about this?

292
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:37,332
-No, no, no!

293
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:38,732
That's too small!

294
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,332
-If you don't like it, then
why don't you do it yourself?

295
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:42,466
-I can't!

296
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:44,699
If I could do it myself,
I would, but I'm dead!

297
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:49,599
ALL: We're finished!

298
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:51,199
-Now that it's done,
all we have to do

299
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:52,332
is give it to your mother.

300
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:53,499
-We can't do that.

301
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:54,332
-Huh?

302
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:55,666
Well then, why did we make it?

303
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,366
-We still have to taste it
first to see if it's all right.

304
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,332
-Oh.

305
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:01,099
That does make sense, I guess.

306
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:02,999
-Once we're sure that
this one tastes good,

307
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,732
then we can make
another one just like it

308
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:06,232
and give that one to my mother.

309
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:07,432
There's just one problem.

310
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:09,199
Since I'm dead,
I can't taste it.

311
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:14,766
-We've never tasted
a cake before,

312
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,332
so we're not exactly sure
how it's supposed to taste.

313
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,732
-What?

314
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:21,632
-We don't have cake in the Soul
Society, so we wouldn't know.

315
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,966
-So you don't know anyone
who's tasted a cake before?

316
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:25,932
URURU: Excuse me?

317
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:28,799
-Huh?

318
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:29,732
-Rise, Zabimaru!

319
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:35,732
You'll have to move
faster than that.

320
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,199
Well, what do you know?

321
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:43,099
Looks like you're starting
to learn a thing or two.

322
00:13:43,132 --> 00:13:44,566
-Let's do it again.

323
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:46,632
-Fine, then.

324
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,132
Hm?

325
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,899
-That's why I
brought it out here.

326
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:55,132
-So, we're supposed to try it
and tell you how it tastes?

327
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,666
-I've eaten cake
before, but I'm not

328
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:59,532
really sure what I can tell you.

329
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:01,066
-Well, I'm an
expert on everything

330
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:03,899
in the world of the living,
so I can tell you how it is.

331
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:04,799
-Here you go.

332
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,332
-We're going to make it again.

333
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:52,232
-We're never going to make a
decent cake for his mother,

334
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,132
are we?

335
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,366
-Hey, don't say that.

336
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,399
We've just got to keep
trying, that's all.

337
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:06,099
-Aw.

338
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:07,932
-Aw, poor Heita.

339
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:11,132
-He says that his mother's going
to be moving away tomorrow.

340
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,399
-Wow.

341
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:13,766
So I guess that means
tomorrow's the last day she'll

342
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,066
be coming to leave him flowers.

343
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:26,532
-Yes, that's perfect.

344
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,866
Now you're getting it!

345
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,599
You're both doing
so much better.

346
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:33,232
You've really got
the hang of it now.

347
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,032
Excellent.

348
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,866
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

349
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:40,099
-We've got to get it
right before tomorrow.

350
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:41,566
-Huh?

351
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:44,366
-We're going to make your mother
the most beautiful cake ever.

352
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,832
And it's going to be delicious.

353
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:50,099
-Thank you, Yumichika.

354
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,699
Thanks for everything
you've done.

355
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:56,299
-Let's give it
everything we've got!

356
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:57,132
-All right!

357
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:00,932
ALL: We did it!

358
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:06,366
-Now if it just tastes as good
as it looks, we'll be all set.

359
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,632
-The texture is incredible!

360
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,166
-It tastes so good, I
feel tingly all over!

361
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:20,766
-I must admit, it's exquisite.

362
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,332
-Really?

363
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:22,466
You're serious?

364
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:23,232
-Yes.

365
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:24,232
And we'd better get going.

366
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,232
Your mother should
be arriving soon.

367
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:26,866
Come on.

368
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:27,332
-Right.

369
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:36,299
RIN: Excuse me?

370
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:37,266
-Hm?

371
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,132
Yes?

372
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,366
Can I help you?

373
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,032
-You don't know us, but
we're friends of your son.

374
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,466
-We heard that
you're moving today,

375
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:45,866
and you won't be coming back.

376
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,332
-Yes, that's right.

377
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:48,799
He never talked
about his friends,

378
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:53,199
but I appreciate you looking
after him while he was alive.

379
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:55,166
Ah?

380
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,766
-This is Heita's cake, and
he wanted you to have it.

381
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:58,899
-Huh?

382
00:16:58,932 --> 00:17:00,599
-Well, actually, we're
the ones who made it,

383
00:17:00,632 --> 00:17:02,266
but that's not important.

384
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:06,266
You see, it was Heita's recipe,
and we followed his directions

385
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,532
precisely.

386
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:11,232
It's almost like he made
it with his own hands.

387
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:11,732
-Oh.

388
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:12,966
My son?

389
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,066
This is his cake?

390
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,666
-I wish I'd made
it for you sooner.

391
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,766
It is my cake, and I want
you to have it, Mother.

392
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,932
-Thank you for doing this.

393
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:28,066
I'm sorry, but I
can't accept it.

394
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:28,766
-Huh?

395
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,332
But I don't understand.

396
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:32,599
-I can't do it.

397
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:34,932
I can't even look at cake.

398
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,566
It's too painful.

399
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:40,332
Whenever I see a
cake, I think of him.

400
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:41,399
-Oh, Mother.

401
00:17:41,432 --> 00:17:43,832
-I'm sorry you went
to all this trouble.

402
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:45,966
-No, wait!

403
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,499
Give it to me.

404
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:47,999
Mom!

405
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:54,066
Not my cake!

406
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:57,466
I've completely ruined it!

407
00:17:57,499 --> 00:18:01,632
All I wanted was for
her to have one taste.

408
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:02,399
Mom!

409
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:03,899
Wait!

410
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:04,399
No!

411
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:04,899
Mom!

412
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:06,799
Don't leave!

413
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:07,832
[shouting]

414
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:08,366
-No!

415
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:09,466
Stop!

416
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:11,366
[shouting]

417
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:12,799
-Heita!

418
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:15,199
You've gotta calm down!

419
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:19,332
[shouting]

420
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,766
YUMICHIKA: They're
being attracted

421
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,532
by the spiritual pressure.

422
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:25,599
It's coming.

423
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:27,199
HANATARO: It's a Menos Grande.

424
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:27,699
RIN: What?

425
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:34,832
-Getting worked up over a Menos?

426
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:35,632
Give me a break.

427
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:45,066
No!

428
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,532
-Yumichika!

429
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:47,732
-No way.

430
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:49,766
Not after all the work
I put into this cake.

431
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,266
Here.

432
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:50,899
Take this.

433
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:51,732
-Right.

434
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:52,766
I will guard it with my life.

435
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,132
-Are you sure you're all right?

436
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,499
-Shut your pie hole.

437
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:57,199
Instead of worrying
about him, you

438
00:18:57,232 --> 00:18:58,632
should worry about yourself.

439
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,799
-Uh, sure.

440
00:18:59,832 --> 00:19:01,266
-You've got to calm down.

441
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:04,666
You're only making things worse.

442
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:07,199
-What is going on over there?

443
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:08,832
-Mom, don't go.

444
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:11,332
Don't leave me!

445
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:14,066
[crying out]

446
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:15,832
-You don't realize
what you're doing.

447
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:16,532
-Heia!

448
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:17,766
Get a hold of yourself!

449
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:25,266
-Dammit.

450
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,832
It's just a Menos.

451
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:31,066
-All I want is for you
to eat the cake, so

452
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:32,032
why can't you do that?

453
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:33,466
- --you're gonna
turn into a Hollow!

454
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:38,099
Stop it, Heita!

455
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:39,032
Don't do this!

456
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:44,266
All right, that's it.

457
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:47,499
You've left me no choice.

458
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:48,699
I'll do this myself.

459
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:51,066
Has everybody here
lost their minds?

460
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:51,899
-Now.

461
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:53,099
Here I go!

462
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:03,799
Fill!

463
00:20:03,832 --> 00:20:06,232
Hisagomaru!

464
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:06,732
Yeah!

465
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:12,099
Now, Yumichika!

466
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:12,999
Finish him!

467
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:13,899
-Right.

468
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:14,999
Bloom, Fuji Kujaku!

469
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:29,966
-Hanataro.

470
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,699
How did you do that?

471
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,666
-All I did was use my
Zanpakuto, Hisagomaru.

472
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:35,832
-That little thing?

473
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:36,999
-Yeah.

474
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:39,732
Hisagomaru reaches
shikai by absorbing

475
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:41,599
the injuries of
the people it cuts.

476
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:43,466
And once it becomes
fully charged,

477
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:45,399
it releases that energy.

478
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:47,566
-You mean you healed
Heita's wounds?

479
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,566
-That's right.

480
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,566
From the way he was
acting, I figured

481
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:53,632
that the chain in his chest was
actually just a wounded heart.

482
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,466
Since it wasn't
fully open yet, I

483
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:58,032
thought I might be
able to do something.

484
00:20:58,066 --> 00:20:58,799
YUMICHIKA: Hm.

485
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,599
Not bad.

486
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:01,466
-Oh!

487
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:02,899
Mother!

488
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:05,832
Mom, are you all right?

489
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:07,032
Please, say something.

490
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:10,032
Mother.

491
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:14,099
-Heita?

492
00:21:14,132 --> 00:21:15,132
-Thank goodness.

493
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,032
You're all right.

494
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,232
-Is it really you, Heita?

495
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:20,632
-Oh, Mother.

496
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,599
You mean you can really see me?

497
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:26,199
-How did that get turned on?

498
00:21:26,232 --> 00:21:27,566
-I did it.

499
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,832
I finally finished the cake, and
I made one just for you, Mom.

500
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:31,832
-So it's true.

501
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:33,766
It really was yours.

502
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,166
-Unfortunately, the cake
got a little messed up.

503
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:38,232
But I guarantee it'll
still taste great.

504
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:44,999
-It's delicious, Heita.

505
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:46,066
-You mean it?

506
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:46,832
-Of course.

507
00:21:46,866 --> 00:21:48,099
It's wonderful.

508
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:50,866
I can't believe I finally
got to taste your cake.

509
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:55,999
-I'll never say it hurts again.

510
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:58,999
Now I'll be happy
whenever I see a cake,

511
00:21:59,032 --> 00:22:00,732
because I know you're OK.

YUMICHIKA: So that
contraption that

514
00:23:45,272 --> 00:23:48,005
shows the physical form of a
soul doesn't just work on you?

515
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:48,905
RIN: Of course not.

516
00:23:48,938 --> 00:23:49,938
It can work on any soul.

517
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,338
YUMICHIKA: You
mean if we had used

518
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:52,605
that thing in the
first place, we

519
00:23:52,638 --> 00:23:54,138
wouldn't have had to go
through the trouble of baking

520
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:54,938
that cake?

521
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:55,505
RIN: Hey.

522
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:56,238
That's right.

523
00:23:56,272 --> 00:23:57,672
You're so smart.

524
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:58,905
YUMICHIKA: Unebelievable.
