1
00:01:55,252 --> 00:01:58,188
So the next'll be the
last of it-right?

2
00:01:58,222 --> 00:02:01,692
Now, Isshin, you're
sure about this?

3
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:06,130
Well sure I'm sure! How many
times are you gonna ask me?!

4
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:08,999
A father can rob his son
of his future. It's

5
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:11,869
only right that I verify
numerous times that

6
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:13,670
you're really
certain.

7
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:22,613
I know that. So I'm telling you to
stop asking before I change my mind.

8
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:24,915
Well, I suppose
you're right.

9
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:29,620
Let's move on to our final step, then.
Shall we?

10
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:39,196
Okay, just place your spirit
energy in here and it's all done.

11
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,865
Whenever you're
ready.

12
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,201
Right.

13
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:52,809
[grunting and yelling]

14
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:53,610
[gasping]

15
00:02:53,777 --> 00:02:55,179
[grunting]

16
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:59,183
He swings that huge sword as
though it weighs nothing!

17
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,953
[grunting]

18
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:04,888
Uh!

19
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:09,126
Hnh!-I see you!

20
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:12,062
[grunting]

21
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:16,066
You certainly have improved quite
a bit at managing your Fullbring.

22
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,236
And yet...

23
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:20,204
[gasping]

24
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:27,211
You still have a long way
to go.

25
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:37,721
Kugo. We have a visitor.
I'm letting her in.

26
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:45,529
Uh--

27
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:47,764
Huh?!

28
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:50,601
Ah! So the healer's
finally here!

29
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:54,504
Oh! Hi there-How do you do sir?
It's such-- a pleasure.

30
00:03:54,504 --> 00:04:00,544
Skip the greetings. You're just in time
to do a job. Hurry up and go heal him.

31
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:01,245
[gasping]

32
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:04,815
Ichigo!

33
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:08,518
[struggling]

34
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,854
Orihime?!

35
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,623
[grunting]

36
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:25,068
I see... Chad brought
you, didn't he?

37
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:26,670
Yes he did.

38
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,504
I had to.

39
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:28,572
Uh-

40
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,979
I know you didn't want Orihime
to get involved with all this...

41
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:39,583
But from here on, you're
gonna need her help.

42
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:40,484
Mm.

43
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:42,786
Hey, that's enough.

44
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:47,791
I understand. I didn't come here
to interfere with his training.

45
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:52,062
I had Yukio create a separate room
for me with a higher setting.

46
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:56,266
I'll be training there by myself.
If we're going to fight Tsukishima,

47
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,835
I can't be standing
around here getting soft.

48
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:02,806
I like your thinking.
Train hard.

49
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,074
I will.

50
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,123
We're outta here, Tsukishima. And
we're taking Kurosaki with us.

51
00:05:24,194 --> 00:05:27,130
But if you're thinking
you want to make a scene

52
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,534
instead, then I suggest you
stay here and go for it.

53
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,506
[gasping]

54
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:43,013
Damn it!

55
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:48,652
Chad! What's
wrong?! What is it?!

56
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:52,255
I know for a fact that he
cut me... and yet...

57
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:56,593
No one that was there seemed
to notice the attack.

58
00:05:56,626 --> 00:06:04,534
I have no wound, no pain either. Not
even sure if it actually happened.

59
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:10,907
It's just the way
Orihime described it.

60
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:14,678
That ability he has is
unexplainable.

61
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:21,718
I don't know what he did to me...
But I have to

62
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:24,921
make sure I'm ready the
next time I face him.

63
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:30,060
I must get stronger...
as fast as I can.

64
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:37,067
What's taking so long?

65
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,034
Huh?!

66
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:41,271
Isn't he healed yet?

67
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:43,774
Can you please try
to be patient?

68
00:06:43,774 --> 00:06:47,811
I can't wait. You good to
go, Ichigo?

69
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:50,180
[grunting]
Yeah.

70
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,182
You're not ready yet!

71
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:56,653
Hyah!

72
00:06:56,653 --> 00:06:58,989
Orihime--don't!
He'll kill you!

73
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:02,025
You should listen to him!
My Cross of Scaffold

74
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:05,028
will easily break through
your Santenkesshun!

75
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,496
No it won't.

76
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,999
Oh? Let's find out!

77
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,670
[grunting]

78
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:20,010
Shitenkoshun.

79
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:23,980
It diffuses the impact of an attack
by exploding the exact moment it's

80
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:28,518
hit. Then simultaneously responds
with a reactive attack of its own.

81
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:31,922
An automated detonation
shield? That was nasty.

82
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:36,026
You can call it whatever you want. My
advice is that if you don't want to get

83
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:39,796
hurt again, then don't try to
attack me when I warn you not to.

84
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:42,532
Orihime... when
did you--

85
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:48,004
It's been over a year since
you lost your powers Ichigo.

86
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:52,042
And it's not as though Chad and I sat
around doing nothing for 17 months.

87
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:54,644
We never stopped
believing in you.

88
00:07:54,644 --> 00:07:58,815
We both knew, that one day
you would regain your power

89
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:02,619
to fight, and we've been
preparing for that day.

90
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:05,222
Chad and I both made promises
to ourselves that we

91
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:08,024
wouldn't be a burden to you
when that moment came.

92
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:09,960
So focus on the challenge
at hand.

93
00:08:09,993 --> 00:08:15,499
Don't be concerned
about us.

94
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:18,034
This is exactly what we
trained for.

95
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:23,073
So that you could focus your entire
attention on regaining your powers.

96
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:29,045
All right.

97
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:32,516
Thank you.

98
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,884
Orihime.

99
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:36,486
Sure.

100
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:41,057
Ready! Let's get
going, Ginjo!

101
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:44,160
Right.

102
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,511
[grunting]

103
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:08,852
He's figured out my longer
reach makes in-fighting too

104
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:11,988
difficult, so he changed
tactics by moving in closer.

105
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:13,056
[grunting]

106
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,926
You guessed wrong!

107
00:09:15,926 --> 00:09:17,761
[grunting]

108
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:23,934
Maybe you noticed that my sword
has a grip beyond its guard?

109
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:26,870
It allows me to modify
my reach!

110
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:30,774
Is that right?

111
00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:35,912
Still, I'm impressed.

112
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:39,249
He's fighting with much more
efficiency than he had before.

113
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:42,986
Which means I was right to
bring her here for him.

114
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:45,755
He's really at his best
as a fighter when there's

115
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:48,191
someone present that he
feels he needs to protect.

116
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:51,127
But that's not
enough.

117
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:56,066
[grunting]

118
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,640
Riruka.

119
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:07,510
So why are you sitting
on the floor over there?

120
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,180
Um, well, there's nothing
to lean on and there's

121
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,749
no furniture here so
I sat where I could.

122
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:14,551
Ha!

123
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:19,723
Yukio! Make me a table and chair! I wanna
sit and eat my snack here-so hurry it up!

124
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:22,025
Huh?! So he can make
stuff, too?!

125
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:23,760
No way.

126
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,095
What?!??

127
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:30,000
Uh-hi there! If you could make us
some furniture, I'd appreciate it!

128
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:32,035
Hmm...

129
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:32,969
Uh--

130
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:37,007
Okay.

131
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,876
Yukio! Are you
kidding me?!

132
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:44,881
You know, this girl has a very nice way
of asking for what she wants, Riruka.

133
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:47,917
Maybe this is a good time for her
to teach you some good manners.

134
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:51,521
You just wait until
I get out of here.

135
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:57,694
Huh?

136
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:01,631
[swooning]

137
00:11:01,665 --> 00:11:05,502
What're you looking at? Forget
it- these are all mine.

138
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:06,870
Uh-huh!

139
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:09,506

It's so good!!

Well, that's all you get,
so don't eat it too fast!

145
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:30,927
Mm-hmm.

146
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,665
Hey! What did I just say?!
You only get one donut, hog!

147
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:38,068
[whimpering]

148
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:42,872
Whoa! All right, I get it! Go ahead
and take as many as you want.

149
00:11:42,906 --> 00:11:45,942
You have the worst table
manners in the world! I can't

150
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,912
imagine what type of rude
parents you must have had.

151
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:54,250
Oh-! That's funny, I can't
imagine them, either!

152
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:57,554
What's that? Don't
you have parents?

153
00:11:57,587 --> 00:12:00,023
Nope, not anymore. My
older brother said they

154
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,692
were really abusive and
he thought there was a

155
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:06,029
good chance that they'd kill me.
So when I was just a baby,

156
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:09,065
he decided to take me away
with him and we ran away!

157
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:14,571
Oh yeah?...So I guess your pathetic brother
got stuck raising you on his own, huh?

158
00:12:14,604 --> 00:12:16,773
I'd like to meet
the poor slob.

159
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:19,843
Sorry, that can't happen
'cause he's dead.

160
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:22,045
Mmm.

161
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,214
Actually right now-
I have a distant

162
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:26,983
relative that pays for
my living expenses...

163
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:30,887
She says if my grades drop, then my
funds might start dropping, too.

164
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,758
So thanks to her, I really
have to make sure to

165
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:38,194
study, but I'm kind of
glad she's so strict!

166
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:41,564
That's enough! Your stories
are so damn boring!

167
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:42,599
Huh?!

168
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:47,203
How can you talk about something as
depressing as that with such a big smile?!

169
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:49,172
Is there something wrong
with you!

170
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:52,142
[grunting]

171
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,777
No.

172
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,180
I'm able to smile because
Ichigo's already saved me.

173
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:01,518
He helped me change.
Thanks to him, I am able

174
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:04,020
to talk about my past
and laugh about it.

175
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:09,726
Hmph!-That sounds even more stupid!
You never know

176
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:12,962
when to shut up, do you?
God, you're so annoying!

177
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:15,031
Oh! I'm sorry!

178
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:16,533
Later!

179
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:20,703
Wait! Are you really going?! Hey,
there're still lots of donuts left.

180
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:24,607
No thanks! I was getting
sick of those things anyway!

181
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:27,043
If you want them, help
yourself!

182
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:31,147
Thank you!

183
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:35,785
You really are a very
nice person!

184
00:13:42,792 --> 00:13:43,827
Mm.

185
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:47,797
What an idiot.

186
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,834
[grunting]

187
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:52,902
That's strange.

188
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:55,805
I'm not feeling
anything from his sword!

189
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,143
At first I thought it was because I wasn't
used to fighting him, but that's not it. No

190
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:04,113
matter how many times I attack
-I don't feel a thing from him.

191
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:09,919
Like Gin Ichimaru, except in his case his
mind was never focused on me to begin with.

192
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,123
But Ginjo's different. He's looking
straight at me, but there's like a

193
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:17,660
lid on his mind. I'm not
feeling anything from him.

194
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,564
Tsukishima's mind was the absolute
opposite. He barely looked at me, but

195
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:25,168
in every fiber of my being, I
could feel his intention to kill.

196
00:14:27,904 --> 00:14:32,108
Is it because this is a Fullbring
sword instead of a Zanpakuto? Is that

197
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:34,711
why I'm not getting a true
sense of what he's doing?

198
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:37,814
Or is it possible I
can't get a read on him

199
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:40,717
because I don't completely
know his objective?

200
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:47,924
You're too distracted. This is
supposed to be a battle, remember?

201
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:49,926
Guess I need to get your
attention.

202
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:50,894
Uh!

203
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:53,062
Uh!

204
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:57,734
[gasping]

205
00:14:57,767 --> 00:14:59,602
[screaming]

206
00:14:59,636 --> 00:15:01,070
Ichigo!!

207
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:05,675
You want Ichigo to become
stronger?

208
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,044
Then you need to be quiet
and watch.

209
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:11,848
It appears during the time that he
lost his Soul Reaper powers, he

210
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:15,718
also lost his resolve to fully
dedicate himself in battle.

211
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:19,856
Hold on, Ichigo.

212
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,191
I'll drag you back to the
battlefield.

213
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,697
[struggling]

214
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:37,633
Why would
you do that?

215
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,736
Why the hell would you do
something like that?!

216
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:41,603
Shut up!

217
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:45,207
[grunting]

218
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,278
You need to quit your pathetic whining.
It's irritating.

219
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:53,615
What is it that you're
really after?!

220
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:57,152
Are you... Really on my
side or trying to kill me?!

221
00:15:57,185 --> 00:16:02,157
Hey-what are you talking about? I
told you our purpose from the start.

222
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:05,160
Our goal has always been
to help you completely

223
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,130
regain your Soul Reaper powers.
We're teaching

224
00:16:08,163 --> 00:16:11,533
you Fullbring as a prelude to
getting you through that process.

225
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:16,071
And so this is how you're
doing it?

226
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:19,675
After that last attack, I'm
having serious doubts about your

227
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,477
methods, and whether
you're really my ally!

228
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:25,113
Like I said we're
helping you.

229
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,481
Helping me?!

230
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:29,785
If you didn't trust me completely
or believe everything that I'd

231
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:33,288
told you, then why did you ever
agree to do this training?

232
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:34,423
[gasping]

233
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:38,327
Or maybe you were thinking
it doesn't matter

234
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,395
if I trust him or
not-As long as I get my

235
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:44,733
powers back. I bet you thought if things
turn bad, you could get away from us

236
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:47,069
even if you didn't
have your powers.

237
00:16:47,102 --> 00:16:50,172
Fat chance in hell that's
ever gonna happen.

238
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:54,276
Here's your reality right now.
You've lost your sight so when it

239
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:57,346
comes to making any big
moves-you're pretty helpless.

240
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:58,814
You bastard!

241
00:16:58,814 --> 00:17:00,816
What a fool A

242
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:03,719
This whole thing was over
for you the second you made

243
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:06,555
the choice to step onto this
field and challenge me!

244
00:17:07,856 --> 00:17:09,191
[grunting]

245
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:15,163
Damn you!

246
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:18,266
What's with you? Looks
like you want to die.

247
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,336
Better start dodging if
you wanna survive.

248
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:25,407
Hey, Yukio.

249
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:28,744
[alarm sounding]

250
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:31,146
Orihime!! What's wrong?!

251
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:36,752
Oh my! What could have happened to her?
Too bad you can't see for yourself.

252
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:38,286
Ginjo.

253
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:45,694
[yelling]

254
00:17:49,364 --> 00:17:52,534
It's useless, if
that's all you've got.

255
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:55,804
Ichigo! Hold on, I'm
coming!

256
00:17:56,271 --> 00:17:57,139
Koten--

257
00:17:57,139 --> 00:17:58,540
Don't bother.

258
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,808
Hnh?!

259
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:03,145
You can yell all you want, but your
voice won't be heard outside of

260
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:05,347
that cage which by the
way, is unbreakable.

261
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,515
[gasping]

262
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:09,117
Look down at the bottom
near your foot.

263
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:14,189
You are in a restricted area.You
cannot break or go through that cage.

264
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:17,159
You see, that's one of
the rules of this game.

265
00:18:20,262 --> 00:18:21,730
Sorry...

266
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:25,233
But I can't hear what
you're saying either.

267
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:32,607
[struggling]

268
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:36,344
Where is he? On my left
or right?!

269
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:42,350
[grunting]

270
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:44,252
Nice try.

271
00:18:44,286 --> 00:18:45,420
[gasping]

272
00:18:51,293 --> 00:18:54,796
[panting]

273
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,467
I'm impressed. You're dodging
better than I expected.

274
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,206
Even if I can't see... I can sense where
you are by the sound your movements make.

275
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:06,341
By the sound of my
movements, huh?

276
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:07,743
Let's test that.

277
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:09,544
[grunting]

278
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:14,783
What happened? You said
you could dodge me.

279
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:18,553
Gosh, I guess you couldn't
hear me this time.

280
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,856
I let you think you could
keep up!

281
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:23,158
[grunting]

282
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:25,827
You can't dodge me!
Just forget that!

283
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:30,265
I've been going easy on you! I was
letting you get away! You really

284
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:33,101
thought you could elude me
with your level of skills?!

285
00:19:33,135 --> 00:19:38,406
[grunting]

286
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:40,408
This game's over.

287
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:47,215
Guess I'll go kill Chad
and the healer now too...

288
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,418
[struggling]

289
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:52,821
You saw this coming,
didn't you?

290
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:57,159
The moment you realized I
wasn't on your side.

291
00:19:57,192 --> 00:20:01,530
I can't speak...
and I can't see him.

292
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:06,067
Don't worry. I'll come back
take care of you soon enough.

293
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:15,544
Get back here, Ginjo.
I'm not done yet!

294
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:18,780
[struggling]

295
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:25,253
Wait... I can see... Ginjo?
No, that's not...

296
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:30,792
that's not him I'm seeing.
That's his...

297
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:32,694
Spiritual Pressure!

298
00:20:33,662 --> 00:20:38,433
[roaring]

299
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:43,605
Ginjo!

300
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:45,307
Huh?!

301
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,677
[roaring]

302
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,479
[roaring]

303
00:20:58,353 --> 00:21:00,155
Ichigo!

304
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:10,832
Uh!

305
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,274
[gasping]

306
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:25,747
You've done it.
It's complete.

307
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,382
Complete?

308
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,652
Yes... the moment
Fullbring is completed,

309
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:32,520
someone had to take a
risk in order to contain

310
00:21:32,554 --> 00:21:36,424
that massive explosion of
energy that's produced by it.

311
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:40,395
The soul that's been suppressed is
suddenly and violently released all at

312
00:21:40,428 --> 00:21:44,532
once in such a way that the
user's body can't withstand it.

313
00:21:49,671 --> 00:21:53,341
That was why I kept on
pushing you, Ichigo. I

314
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:57,245
needed you to complete
Fullbring in front of me.

315
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,081
Ginjo.

316
00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:04,452
Hey, sorry. I know I was a
bit cheesy as a bad guy.

317
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:09,157
Welcome to X-cution.
Now you're one of us.

318
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:49,790
I think I did pretty well
acting as a villain!

319
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,127
You were terrible. First, you talked
too much-That doesn't cut it when

320
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,862
you're playing the
playing the big bad boss.

321
00:23:54,895 --> 00:23:56,764
Who cares?! As long as I
looked evil!

322
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:59,100
Second, you were playing dirty.
Only a loser that's

323
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,402
been killed too many times
would do such a thing.

324
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:02,303
I was that bad?
