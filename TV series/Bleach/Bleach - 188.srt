[theme music]

2
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:51,485
NARRATOR: Lieutenant Izuru Kira
obtained a forbidden Bakkoto

3
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:54,518
that provided proof of the
Kasumioji Clan's treason.

4
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:58,085
The 13 Court Guard Squads then
stormed the Kasumioji palace

5
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,785
and overcame their assassins.

6
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:03,351
Gyokaku Kumoi took Princess
Rurichiyo hostage and attempted

7
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:06,285
to escape, but he was cut
down by Shusuke Amagai

8
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:07,718
in a surprising blow.

9
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:09,451
Shusuke later
revealed that he was

10
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:11,818
the mastermind of
the Kasumioji treason

11
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:14,751
and had been directing Kumoi
from within the Seireitei.

12
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:17,251
He had been plotting the
assassination of Head Captain

13
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:20,618
Yamamoto for years to avenge
the death of his father.

14
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:23,585
His plan was to create such
a diversion that all Soul

15
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:25,485
Reapers would be
distracted during the raid

16
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:27,985
of the Kasumioji
Clan, and Yamamoto

17
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:30,251
would be left unprotected.

18
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:32,551
Shusuke first used to
the power of the Bakkoto

19
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,618
to neutralize the Head
Captain's Ryujin Jakka

20
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:39,185
and then released his Zanpakuto
to carry out his revenge,

21
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:41,785
but his attack was
blocked by Ichigo

22
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:43,851
who raced to the scene
thanks to a message

23
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:48,618
left by Kenryu, Rukia,
and Princess Rurichiyo.

24
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:51,651
-My time is now!

25
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:53,385
I will avenge my father!

26
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:03,251
Stay out of my way, Ichigo!

27
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:04,051
Enough!

28
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:05,351
-Knock it off!

29
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,818
I've been here the
whole time, and I

30
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:10,718
heard all of your completely
self-centered nonsense.

31
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:13,418
Get your revenge, but
leave her out of it.

32
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:16,085
Don't involve other
people in your business!

33
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:17,585
-You just don't get it.

34
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:19,718
You cannot save her.

35
00:03:24,185 --> 00:03:26,351
Don't act like an idiot!

36
00:03:26,385 --> 00:03:27,518
Move it!

37
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:29,785
-I don't think you
understand what's going on.

38
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:32,885
You say you want me to move?

39
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:35,585
Well, you're going to
have to make me do it!

40
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,985
[wind blowing]

41
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:55,785
-Ichigo.

42
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:05,685
-Rukia, take care of Rurichiyo.

43
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:06,551
-Right, I'm on it.

44
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,051
-Ichigo!

45
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:16,285
Your curiosity will
be your undoing.

46
00:04:16,318 --> 00:04:19,518
I presume this means
you refuse to back down.

47
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,018
-Hmm!

48
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:25,951
Bankai!

49
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:32,218
-How useless!

50
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:53,418
-Haaaa!

51
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:08,751
I thought I told you
my Bakkoto seals away

52
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:11,318
the spirit energy
of Soul Reapers

53
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:14,251
and the power of
their Zanpakuto,

54
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:17,318
therefore your attacks
are no match against me.

55
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,851
Leave the princess
behind and be gone.

56
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:21,085
-Just forget it.

57
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:23,618
I'm not handing over Rurichiyo.

58
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:26,451
-You don't seem to understand.

59
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:27,885
It doesn't matter.

60
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,851
Whatever you do, the
princess's fate is sealed.

61
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:33,585
-How dare you!

62
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:36,451
-There's no way she
can escape death.

63
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:39,851
It's the curse of being born
into the Kasumioji Clan.

64
00:05:39,885 --> 00:05:40,851
-Not happening!

65
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:49,451
-There's no way you'll
be able to win this, not

66
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:53,018
with your weak swordplay.

67
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:53,518
Haaaaa!

68
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:01,018
-Getsuga, ha!

69
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:01,518
Tensho!

70
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:08,551
Damn it!

71
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,051
AMAGAI (VOICEOVER):
What's going on?

72
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:12,651
My Bakkoto should have sealed
away his spirit energy.

73
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:17,785
But his technique
is still strong,

74
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:19,151
even though he's
lost some power.

75
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:22,851
Raika!

76
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:34,251
Sorry, but this fight has
dragged on long enough.

77
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:38,151
Haaaa!

78
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,318
I'm not done yet.

79
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:53,085
-I think you're over confident.

80
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:55,285
-Think again.

81
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:57,751
Haaaa!

82
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:58,251
-Ahhhh!

83
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:03,185
-Ichigo!

84
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:11,685
-Sorry to make you wait.

85
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:13,318
Now it's your
turn, Head Captain.

86
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:23,685
ICHIGO: Is that all
you've got for me?

87
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:25,685
-Huh?

88
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:28,751
-I'm just getting started.

89
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:30,785
-You're a fool.

90
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:31,985
-Yeah?

91
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,985
I thought you said you
sealed my Zanpakuto.

92
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:39,518
Well, here's a surprise.

93
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:43,318
I still have plenty of
energy left for you.

94
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:45,085
-You're all talk.

95
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:47,751
If you'd had the sense
to stay down quietly,

96
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,985
your life would
have been spared.

97
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:52,785
-Shut up!

98
00:07:52,818 --> 00:07:54,885
-If that's how you
want it, you leave

99
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:58,618
me no choice,
Substitute Soul Reaper.

100
00:07:58,651 --> 00:07:59,118
Haaaaa!

101
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:06,485
You expect to defeat me by
skipping and jumping around

102
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:07,251
like this?

103
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:13,751
AMAGAI (VOICEOVER): Incredible.

104
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,818
How can he be exposed
to the power my Bakkoto

105
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,185
and still have this much speed?

106
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:23,151
[grunting]

107
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,718
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Ichigo should be affected

108
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:42,685
by the power of that Bakkoto,
but instead his power

109
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:44,418
is increasing.

110
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:47,585
What's happening?

111
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:49,651
AMAGAI (VOICEOVER): He
uses his spirit energy

112
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,385
to reduce the damage
from my attacks.

113
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:58,218
-[laughing] What's the matter?

114
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:01,518
-Ichigo, what's the
point of you fighting me?

115
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:02,818
What do you gain from it?

116
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:05,151
-I don't know what
you're talking about.

117
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:07,118
-Why would someone from
the World of the Living

118
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:10,118
put so much effort into risking
their own life for this?

119
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:11,951
Why involve yourself
in a fight that

120
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,751
only affects the Soul Society?

121
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:16,985
-None of that makes
any difference.

122
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:18,751
I'm here to protect Rurichiyo.

123
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:20,851
That's a commitment I made.

124
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:22,751
-That's ridiculous.

125
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:25,785
You're telling me you're
prepared to throw away

126
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:27,551
your life for a
complete stranger.

127
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:35,351
-Captain Amagai's spiritual
pressure is rising.

128
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:37,151
He's about to attack.

129
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:39,418
-If that's all
your life is worth,

130
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:44,585
Substitute Soul
Reaper-- then die!

131
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:14,585
-Kenryu!

132
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:16,318
Enryu!

133
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:19,218
Where is Ichigo?

134
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,585
-So much for that.

135
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:24,218
ICHIGO: So much for what?

136
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:24,718
-Huh?

137
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:31,851
-The fight's just begun.

138
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,451
-What's the meaning
that mask, and how

139
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,518
did his spiritual
pressure become so strong?

140
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:44,051
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Hollowfication.

141
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:44,651
I knew it!

142
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:49,051
AMAGAI (VOICEOVER): He's fast!

143
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:00,718
AMAGAI (VOICEOVER):
His power is different.

144
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:02,318
It's stronger and more brutal!

145
00:11:31,118 --> 00:11:33,551
--[laughing] You're
quite surprising.

146
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:52,757
[wind blowing]

147
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:05,285
-Ahhh!

148
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:06,485
Don't underestimate me!

149
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:09,952
Ahhhh!

150
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:24,652
I see now.

151
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:29,985
That's the Hollowfication I've
heard so many stories about.

152
00:12:30,018 --> 00:12:31,452
My Bakkoto is powerful.

153
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:34,052
It suppresses a Soul
Reaper's spirit energy,

154
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:38,418
and in the process renders
their Zanpakuto powerless.

155
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:43,518
But you have the power of a
Hollow, and that's different.

156
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:45,518
AMAGAI (VOICEOVER): It
was because of this power

157
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:48,018
that you were able to
defeat all other Bakkotos up

158
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:49,052
to this point.

159
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:52,885
That power is more
savage and elemental.

160
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:54,418
-Of course.

161
00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:56,085
That's why Ichigo
wasn't hindered

162
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:58,618
by Captain Amagai's Bakkoto.

163
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,652
And now, by completely
Hollowfying,

164
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:04,352
he's been able to reduce
the effects of that Bakkoto

165
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:06,852
even further.

166
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:08,518
He's leveled the playing field.

167
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,952
Right now Ichigo is more
than a match for him.

168
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:18,285
-I'll just have to
find your weakness,

169
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:20,918
and then eliminate you.

170
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:22,418
-What is your problem?

171
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:27,118
Why are you so obsessed
with your revenge?

172
00:13:27,152 --> 00:13:29,052
-I sincerely doubt
you'd understand.

173
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:37,118
AMAGAI (VOICEOVER): The
emptiness of being left behind.

174
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:44,852
The hatred you feel
toward those who remain.

175
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:46,918
The power of these
emotions become

176
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:50,852
so strong you find them more
and more difficult to resist,

177
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:53,385
until your life is
controlled by them.

178
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:56,418
You always have just
one thing on your mind.

179
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:58,085
Revenge.

180
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:01,618
You ask yourself what
am I doing with my life?

181
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:04,018
But no matter how much you
struggle toward the light,

182
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,652
the voice in your head plunges
you back into darkness.

183
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:10,552
It says the only way to
find peace in your heart

184
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:14,518
is to destroy the lives
that destroyed yours.

185
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,785
And so finally,
you're committed.

186
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:19,052
It becomes your life's goal.

187
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:22,318
No force in the universe can
remove you from your path.

188
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:24,252
ICHIGO: Are you that weak?

189
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:25,585
Huh?

190
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:28,552
You possess the ability to
rise to the rank of Soul Reaper

191
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:30,618
Captain, so why can't
you find strength

192
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:34,352
to move past this
obsession with vengeance?

193
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:37,085
-If I could find a way
to have my revenge,

194
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:39,418
I don't mind dying
in the effort.

195
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:40,952
That has always
been my strength!

196
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:45,852
Ahhhhh!

197
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:51,785
Haaaa!

198
00:14:59,185 --> 00:15:02,352
Tell me, why are you so
protective of that mask?

199
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:12,685
-Ichigo!

200
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:19,518
-I'm not going to be
defeated that easily!

201
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:32,918
[gasping]

202
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:34,018
-You bastard!

203
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:12,518
-You're never going to win.

204
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:18,252
I'll take you down with me.

205
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:20,885
They won't find a trace
of you when I'm done.

206
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:23,852
I'm going to completely
incinerate you!

207
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:27,518
Haaaaa!

208
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:33,652
Ha!

209
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:34,818
Goen Ryuga!

210
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:45,518
[rumbling]

211
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:47,485
-What's happening?

212
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:50,452
[rumbling]

213
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:03,785
-Ichigo!

214
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:07,218
-Ahhh!

215
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:32,518
-[gasping]

216
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,018
-Ichigo!

217
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,018
-Lady Rurichiyo!

218
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:37,318
-Ichigio, you have
to stop fighting.

219
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:38,685
You have done enough.

220
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:41,585
I do not want anyone else
to get hurt because of me.

221
00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:43,152
I can't live with it.

222
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:50,385
-(WEAKLY) Don't
worry, Rurichiyo.

223
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:51,785
Uh!

224
00:17:51,818 --> 00:17:58,018
In a few more minutes, I'll
make it so you can rest easy.

225
00:17:58,052 --> 00:18:03,818
You'll never had to worry
about that problem ever again.

226
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:12,952
-You're still coming at me?

227
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:15,852
-You're damn right.

228
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:16,352
-Hmm.

229
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:24,313
-Yaaa!

230
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:33,213
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): What
are you doing, Ichigo?

231
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,213
From the intensity
of your attack,

232
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:36,913
I presume you're
trying to prevent him

233
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:40,546
from firing his weapon, but
he still has plenty of energy.

234
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:43,579
How long can you keep it up?

235
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:45,413
AMAGAI (VOICEOVER): Why
is he so persistent?

236
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,479
-I see what he's trying to do.

237
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:08,279
Captain Amagai's weak
spot i on his right side.

238
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,079
If he can find a way to
get past that huge weapon,

239
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:14,546
he can attack Shusuke directly
and target his Bakkoto.

240
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,979
-I already figured out
what your strategy was.

241
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:46,079
You were trying to
destroy my Bakkoto.

242
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:53,946
-Getsuga Tensho!

243
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:54,479
-Ahh!

244
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:01,913
Ahhhhhh!

245
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:07,379
-Lady Rurichiyo!

246
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:28,979
Where's the princess?

247
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:38,213
-Oh, no!

248
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:40,413
Are the two of you all right?

249
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:42,579
-Don't worry about us, my Lady.

250
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:43,446
We'll be fine--

251
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:47,746
ICHIGO: Rukia!

252
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,279
We're not out of the woods yet.

253
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:52,846
[rumbling]

254
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:00,579
-He survived that?

255
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:02,046
It can't be.

256
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:17,879
-I knew it was too
early to celebrate.

257
00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:22,446
-This will not be over until
I've achieved my revenge.

258
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:32,746
Shigekuni Genryusai Yamamoto,
Rurichiyo Kasumioji,

259
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:39,113
and you, Ichigo Kurosaki, I
swear I will not be stopped.

260
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:41,379
I'm sending all of you to hell!

261
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:42,779
-Forget it, Shusuke.

262
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:45,413
You're in no condition to
carry out your threats.

263
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:47,746
-Don't be so sure.

264
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:51,746
You see, I've dedicated myself
to complete this vendetta.

265
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,846
Beyond that is death!

266
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:55,346
Yaaaaaa!

267
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:04,179
-What is that?

268
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:10,546
-[laughing]

269
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:19,480
[theme music]

270
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:49,361
RURICHIYO (VOICEOVER):
That mask!

271
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:51,295
So Ichigo was no
ordinary soul Reaper.

272
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:53,361
KENRYU (VOICEOVER): That's
right, Lady Rurichiyo.

273
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:56,728
The truth is Ichigo Kurosaki
is a Mod Soul Reaper created

274
00:23:56,761 --> 00:23:58,361
by the 13 Court Guard Squads.

275
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,395
RURICHIYO (VOICEOVER):
Wow, that's amazing.

276
00:24:00,428 --> 00:24:01,561
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Stop it!

277
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:02,995
Stop it!
