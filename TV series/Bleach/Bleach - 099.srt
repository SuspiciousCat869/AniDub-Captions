Alert!

4
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:41,894
Rioters have gathered at
Hakuto Gate and Kukuryo Gate.

5
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:44,127
All citizens are to report
to palace defense positions

at once.

I repeat, disturbances

00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:53,994
Now let's pry open the gate!

We opened up the gate, Kariya.

24
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,061
-Indeed.

25
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,627
Now the next step.

26
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:19,627
-Now forward through
the gate, men!

27
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,794

down once and for all!

None of you shall
enter this gate.

00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:43,261
-What should we do, Kariya?

34
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:47,261
-Huh?

35
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:56,627
-Stop advancing, or
be prepared to die.

36
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:57,661
-Hey, what are you doing?

37
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:58,227
-Don't do it!

38
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:01,161
Stay there!

39
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:02,627
They'll cut you to pieces!

40
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,061

00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:27,827
-You're free to go now.

45
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:29,294
-Huh?

46
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:31,727
-It's time for us to
go our separate ways.

47
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:33,194
-Now, wait a minute, Kariya.

48
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:34,961
What the hell are
you talking about?

49
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:35,927
The whole plan was to--

50
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:38,394
-Your usefulness has ended.

51
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:39,227
-Ended?

52
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:40,027
-What?

53
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:41,227
-What are you talking about?

54
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:44,094
You promised us we'd crush
the Seireitei together.

55
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,961
That's the whole
reason we're here!

56
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,761
-You were merely a
pawn in this game.

57
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:52,994
Or perhaps if I explained
it in a different fashion,

58
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,427
I just needed you
to open this gate.

59
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,661
I knew that Sede Hekki
shuts out all spirit energy,

60
00:04:59,694 --> 00:05:01,827
making it impossible
to use that power

61
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:05,194
to either pass through the
gate, or to destroy it.

62
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:06,394
-You used us.

63
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:08,694
How dare you pull that
on us, you bastard.

64
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:11,494
-You did fulfill your
function admirably,

65
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:14,827
but from here on in this
is my tribe's battle alone.

66
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,994
I wouldn't advise staying
and getting in our way.

67
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:17,661
-Oh, no.

68
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:18,694
No way.

69
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:20,461
-We're not leaving now.

70
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:21,327
-Let's take him down.

71
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:23,361
-You got that right.

72
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:24,961
No one makes a fool out of me.

73
00:05:24,994 --> 00:05:26,927
Let's tear him to shreds, men!

74
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:29,894
[shouting]

75
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:30,827
-Hmph.

76
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:33,894
I told you not to
get in the way.

77
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:34,394
-Whoa!

78
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:53,127
Let's go.

79
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:55,861
-Jidonbo!

80
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,861
-How'd they get
the gate to open?

81
00:05:57,894 --> 00:06:01,594
-Obviously with
that huge device.

82
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,194
ICHIGO: Kariya!

83
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:18,061
-It's falling!

84
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:23,761
-Kariya!

85
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:24,294
-Dammit.

86
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:25,494
They got away.

87
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:34,927
-So much for Soul Reapers.

88
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,894
They don't deserve the name.

89
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:38,861
-The fight has yet to begin.

90
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:42,361
Do not underestimate
the captains.

91
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:45,561
I assigned Mabashi and
Yoshi to create diversions.

92
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:48,094
The riots and confusion they
create throughout the Seireitei

93
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:49,961
will give you two
the opportunity

94
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,861
to crush each of the squad
captains one after another.

95
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:54,494
-What about you?

96
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:56,827
-Our ultimate goal is
to completely destroy

97
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:59,594
the Seireitei in a single,
instantaneous strike.

98
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,861
Don't forget that
they created us,

99
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:04,094
and yet they tried
to annihilate us,

100
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:05,861
to wipe us out of existence.

101
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:10,294
For that, judgment must be
passed upon the Seireitei.

102
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:13,894
But there is one thing we
still need in order to do that.

103
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:16,461
I am going to get
that last element.

104
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:18,261
-Then are you saying
that there's something

105
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:19,927
with that kind of
destructive power

106
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:22,394
right here in the Soul Society?

107
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:23,494
-There is.

108
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,894
-Where is it?

109
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,527
-Research and Development.

110
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:28,894
-What is it?

111
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:30,561
-You'll find out soon.

112
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:34,394
Our final rendezvous will be
at the Sokyoku Hill, as agreed.

113
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,394
Got it?

114
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:38,194
-Hm.

115
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:39,461
-Well, what is it?

116
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:43,194
If you have something
to say, then say it.

117
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:44,194
-It's nothing.

118
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:44,861
Take care, then.

119
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:48,894
-Go, then.

120
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:59,127
-Jidanbo, please.

121
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:00,561
Just wak up.

122
00:08:00,594 --> 00:08:03,427
[groan]

123
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:11,027
-Welcome back.

124
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:12,427
-Hm?

125
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:13,361
It's you.

126
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:14,661
You've returned.

127
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,861
-Do you remember me?

128
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:17,794
-Hm?

129
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:19,661
What happened?

130
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:22,427
Don't tell me you
saved me once again?

131
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,327
-That's not what's
important right now.

132
00:08:25,361 --> 00:08:27,261
Is your arm feeling any better?

133
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:28,561
-Not bad.

134
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:32,294
Soon I'll be as
good as new again.

135
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:33,694
-Ichigo!

136
00:08:33,727 --> 00:08:36,294
Like I thought, it's going to
take some time before the Sede

137
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:37,727
Hekki can be opened.

138
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:40,061
-That's going to be a problem.

139
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:42,327
Unless-- Jidanbo?

140
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:43,427
-Huh?

141
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,661
-I know that you've
been injured pretty bad,

142
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:47,294
but do you think you could
open up the gate for us?

143
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,161
-Of course.

144
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,427
Why wouldn't I?

145
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:50,794
I still have two arms.

146
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,927
[grunting]

147
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:02,027
-Great.

148
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:03,094
You did it, Jidanbo!

149
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:03,627
Let's go.

150
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:08,827
Hey!

151
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:09,861
Are you all right, Jidanbo?

152
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:11,961
-You don't have
to worry about me.

153
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:13,894
But you'd better go now!

154
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:16,561
-The strain has
reopened his wounds.

155
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:18,794
-Then when we standing here for?

156
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:21,494
-He's sacrificing himself,
and we're wasting time.

157
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,294
So come on, let's get
it in gear, everyone.

158
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:26,361
Thank you, Jidanbo.

159
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:27,261
-Huh?

160
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:27,794
Hey, Orihime.

161
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:28,794
Better hurry up.

162
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,161
-Hey, what are you
guys waiting for?

163
00:09:32,794 --> 00:09:35,061
-Sorry, Ichigo, but I have
to stay behind and make sure

164
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:37,094
all Jidanbo's
injuries are healed.

165
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:38,394
-Oh, Orihime.

166
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:42,427
What a kind and considerate
person you are to do that.

167
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:45,727
-But you need to go ahead
with the others, Kurodo.

168
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:48,694
-No!

169
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:49,994
-Orihime, are you sure?

170
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:50,827
-Mm-hm.

171
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:51,794
Don't worry me, Ichigo.

172
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:53,194
I'll be fine.

173
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:54,594
Jidanbo, you can let go now.

174
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,894
I'm going to stay here.

175
00:09:56,927 --> 00:10:00,361
-That's very good news.

176
00:10:00,394 --> 00:10:01,894
-ICHIGO: Be careful, Orihime.

177
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:04,261
-Mm-hm.

178
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:05,161
-No, Orihime!

179
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:05,661
Wait!

180
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:10,527
Orihime!

181
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,294
How can you do this?

182
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:14,961
-She stayed back because she
felt like she was needed there.

183
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:16,161
Stop being so selfish.

184
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,327
-But she left me!

185
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:19,127
-If you would just think
about it for a minute,

186
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,494
you'd realize she had a
reason for doing that, too.

187
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:23,161
-What reason?

188
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:25,494
-Ririn, are you sensing
anything from the Bounts?

189
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:26,394
-Right now?

190
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:27,794
I don't sense anything.

191
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,627
So they must be hiding.

192
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:30,594
-Fine, then.

193
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:32,227
They can't hide
forever and still do

194
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:34,327
whatever it is that
they came here to do.

195
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:35,927
Sooner or later, we
know they're going

196
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:37,994
to have to reveal
themselves to us.

197
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:39,694
And when that happens,
the three of you

198
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:42,561
are the best around at sensing
the Bounts' spiritual pressure.

199
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:46,094
-Well, heh, heh,
that's true, but--

200
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:48,094
ICHIGO: We need
your help, Kurodo.

201
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:50,794
In fact, we're all
counting on you.

202
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:52,227
-Hm.

203
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,594
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

204
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:56,227
You'd be totally
adrift without me.

205
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:58,661
I'll do everything I can to help
you search for these disgusting

206
00:10:58,694 --> 00:10:59,594
Bounts.

207
00:10:59,627 --> 00:11:00,527
Now I see what
Orihime was doing.

208
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:01,794
She was--

209
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,727
-Once he opens his mouth,
he never shuts up, does he?

210
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:04,994
-That's right.

211
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:06,327
-Let's split up now.

212
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,927
We've got to pick up the trail
and hunt the Bounts down.

213
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,194
-Then let's move out.

214
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:12,527
-Are you ready to go?

215
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:14,661
-Yes, sir.

216
00:11:14,694 --> 00:11:15,827
Look, Captain.

217
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:17,427
-A hell butterfly.

218
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:20,094
-Urgent message to the
13 Court Guard Squads.

219
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,327
In accordance with
special order level one,

220
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:25,161
all appropriate personnel are
hereby immediately summoned

221
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:27,327
to a meeting with
Head Captain Yamamoto.

222
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:28,461
I repeat--

223
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:31,061
-Urgent message to the
13 Court Guard Squads.

224
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:32,994
In accordance with
special order level one,

225
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,727
all appropriate personnel are
hereby summoned immediately

226
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,394
to a meeting with
the Head Captain.

227
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:39,661
-What terrible timing.

228
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:42,461
Continue to dispatch the forces
to the suspected incursion

229
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,694
areas.

230
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:46,527
We will keep searching 'til
we locate the intruders.

231
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:49,327
When you make contact,
do not engage the Ryoka.

232
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:52,194
Request backup from all
nearby units and stand by.

233
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:52,827
That is all.

234
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:53,561
-Yes, ma'am!

235
00:11:57,794 --> 00:11:58,894
-Aw.

236
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,627
I'm not picking up any
kind of signal at all.

237
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:02,827
-Stop complaining, and
just keep searching.

238
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:05,727
We have to find Kariya and
his crew before it's too late.

239
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:07,661
-Ichigo, why are you
so hyped up, anyway?

240
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,594
-If there was ever a time
to be hyped up, this is it.

241
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:11,561
-Wrong!

242
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:13,361
You have to calm
down for it to work.

243
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:14,494
-What do you mean by that?

244
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,094
-My sensors don't
work right when

245
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:18,594
I'm close to someone whose
emotions are all worked up.

246
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:20,161
-What, are you kidding me?

247
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:21,161
-No, I'm not!

248
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:22,061
-OK, fine.

249
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:24,061
I'll try to relax.

250
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:25,561
-Anything?

251
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:26,927
-Not yet.

252
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:28,427
-How am I supposed
to sense anything

253
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:30,094
when I'm being bounced
around like this?

254
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:32,861
Your gait is a lot rougher
than Orihime's, you know?

255
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:34,327
-Yeah, and you whine a lot more.

256
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:48,327
[laughter]

257
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:51,227
-Well, now, if it isn't
the punishment force.

258
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:52,694
-Who are you?

259
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:53,894
A Ryoka?

260
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:54,861
-A Ryoka?

261
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:55,361
Hm.

262
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:56,927
Who knows?

263
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:58,827
But you guys are supposed
to be pretty tough,

264
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,294
according to rumor.

265
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,661
Oh, you want a fight, huh?

266
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:06,961
Zeige Dich.

267
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:07,627
Come, Ritz.

268
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:27,694
Take them, Ritz.

269
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:28,294
-As you wish.

270
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,261
[gasping]

271
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,061
-He's getting away!

272
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:50,627
-After him!

273
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:51,161
On the double!

274
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:03,582
-Someone is missing.

275
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:06,248
Where is Captain Ukitake?

276
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:08,082
-He sends his
regrets, Head Captain.

277
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,048
He's feeling a bit ill again.

278
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,148
-I see.

279
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:13,415
Squad 2, Captain Sui-Feng.

280
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:14,815
-Sir.

281
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:17,948
-Let us first hear the report
for the Punishment Force.

282
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,248
-Yes, Head Captain, sir.

283
00:14:19,282 --> 00:14:21,882
I have positioned all units
throughout the Seireitei.

284
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,015
-Excellent.

285
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:24,682
That is precisely the
sort of quick response

286
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:25,982
this situation calls for.

287
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,215
-Sir.

288
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:29,682
-And what progress does
the captain of Squad 10

289
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:32,115
have to report compared to
that of the Punishment Force,

290
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:33,915
I wonder?

291
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:35,882
Considering he's
supposed to be in charge

292
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:37,948
of capturing or
killing the Ryoka,

293
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:39,615
it is shocking
that he has instead

294
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:42,082
allowed them to
invade the Seireitei.

295
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,782
He has some nerve
calling himself

296
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,848
the commander after this.

297
00:14:45,882 --> 00:14:47,915
-I won't make any excuses.

298
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:50,848
The entire fault lies with me.

299
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:51,915
-Take it easy.

300
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:53,848
There's no use
blaming anyone for it

301
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:55,648
now that they've broken in.

302
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:58,882
The important thing now is to
decide what to do about it.

303
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:01,115
-Captain Kuchiki.

304
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:03,415
You are the only one of
us to have actually fought

305
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:05,048
this Kariya.

306
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:06,648
I heard he's their leader.

307
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:08,782
Can you share anything
useful about him?

308
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:10,782
-He is able to control the wind.

309
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:13,082
-The wind?

310
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:15,215
-He can also control reishi.

311
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,648
This, in turn, gives him
great regenerative powers.

312
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:19,615
-I haven't finished.

313
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:21,282
Stop trying to
change the subject.

314
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:23,682
The issue we should
be discussing here

315
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,715
is what to do about the Squad
10 captain's complete failure

316
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:28,315
to fulfill his duties.

317
00:15:28,348 --> 00:15:29,182
-What about you?

318
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:29,982
-Hm?

319
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:31,848
What are you talking about?

320
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:35,948
-What about you and
the Quincy tool?

321
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:37,982
The Ryoka got in because
someone gave them

322
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:40,148
a Quincy tool from
Research and Development.

323
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:45,115
Now, how do you suppose they got
a hold of something like that?

324
00:15:45,148 --> 00:15:48,548
Or are you not responsible for
what goes on in your squad?

325
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:50,315
-Just what are you implying?

326
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:52,215
-Nothing.

327
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:54,348
Just that for someone
with his own shortcomings,

328
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:56,948
you're awfully
quick to find fault.

329
00:15:56,982 --> 00:16:00,648
Try giving a thought to other
people's feelings for a change.

330
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:04,282
-The last thing I need from you
is a lecture on responsibility.

331
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:05,815
In case you hadn't
noticed, things

332
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:07,548
are going quite wrong right now.

333
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:11,715
Just out of curiosity, where did
you hear about the Quincy tool?

334
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:15,315
-I have sharp ears.

335
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:19,415
-This is no time for a
captains to be quarreling.

336
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:20,982
Listen well.

337
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,648
All 13 Court Guard
Squads are to disperse

338
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,082
throughout the Seireitei
with orders to find the Ryoka

339
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:28,348
and destroy them with
extreme prejudice.

340
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:30,548
We have been too
slow to counterattack

341
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:32,515
in these situations
in the recent past,

342
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:34,548
and now it is clear that
the correct response

343
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:37,782
is to deal with the Ryoka
as soon as possible.

344
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:39,748
Therefore each squad
will act independently

345
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:41,615
as their respective
captains see fit.

346
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:44,215
The Squad 10 captain is
hereby relieved of his duties

347
00:16:44,248 --> 00:16:46,915
as temporary commander.

348
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:50,815
You will all report any and
all contact with them at once.

349
00:16:50,848 --> 00:16:51,648
That is all.

350
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:57,715
-Master, are you going to
take care of this yourself?

351
00:16:57,748 --> 00:16:58,982
-Of course I am.

352
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:01,315
No one makes a fool out
of me or my department

353
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:02,682
and gets away with it.

354
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:03,815
How annoying.

355
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:05,282
That ridiculous
captain's meeting

356
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,015
was nothing but a waste
of valuable time All

357
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:09,148
because of the Bounts.

358
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:10,382
Well, they'll pay for this.

359
00:17:10,415 --> 00:17:12,882
I can guarantee it.

360
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,682
While I am gone, you know
what needs to be done, Nemu.

361
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:16,348
-Yes, master.

362
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:16,848
Understood.

363
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:22,282
KURODO: Ow!

364
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:23,548
RENJI: What is it, Kurodo?

365
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:25,748
-I just sensed a Bount
somewhere close by.

366
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:27,148
-Are you sure about that?

367
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:27,948
What direction?

368
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:31,382
-Uh-- now it's gone.

369
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:33,482
-Look, you'd better not
be just making up all

370
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:35,148
of these so-called
Bount sightings.

371
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:35,982
-No!

372
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:37,148
I thought for sure I had one.

373
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,982
-Damn these Bounts,
with all of their hiding

374
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:40,448
and sneaking around.

375
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:42,248
-Fighting an army with
so few, though, they

376
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:45,348
have no choice but to
use guerrilla tactics.

377
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:47,748
It may be hard to
admit, but the Bounts

378
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:49,115
are formidable opponents.

379
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:50,982
-Just whose side are you on?

380
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:51,682
-Sorry.

381
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:53,082
I didn't mean anything.

382
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,415
-Fine.

383
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,948
Let's just go back to the
last place I sensed something.

384
00:17:55,982 --> 00:17:57,148
Now, which way was that?

385
00:17:57,182 --> 00:17:58,282
-Good idea.

386
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:01,848
Go down this way, and
then over to the right.

387
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:03,648
-Argh, this is so
incredibly frustrating.

388
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,115
I keep sensing their presence,
but then it disappears again

389
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:07,548
like a weak flashlight.

390
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:10,048
-For somebody who keeps
telling me to calm down,

391
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:12,215
you're starting to sound
a little wound up, Ririn.

392
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:13,682
-It doesn't matter if it's me.

393
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:16,182
I can get as excited as I want
to and still detect things.

394
00:18:16,215 --> 00:18:18,082
-That's pretty
hypocritical of you.

395
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:19,082
-Are you still talking?

396
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:20,182
-All right, I'll be quiet.

397
00:18:23,882 --> 00:18:25,148
-Anything?

398
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:26,382
-I sense them.

399
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:27,582
-Which way?

400
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:28,248
-It disappeared.

401
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:32,515
-I sense them.

402
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:33,515
-Which wa

403
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:34,182
-It disappeared.

404
00:18:41,282 --> 00:18:41,982
-Hold it there!

405
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:52,515
-Hello.

406
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,648
-Are you Ryoka?

407
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:57,382
[laughter]

408
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,548
-Look how scary you all are.

409
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:00,882
How impressive.

410
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:02,782
-You mock us?

411
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:04,482
-Come, Ritz.

412
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:04,982
-Huh?

413
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:06,448
-Up there!

414
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:06,948
-Over there!

415
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:07,515
Look!

416
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:08,448
-There it is!

417
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,448
-Careful!

418
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,948
-What could that be?

419
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:11,748
-As you command.

420
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:16,715
-Watch out!

421
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:17,715
-Look out, men!

422
00:19:27,148 --> 00:19:28,015
-Mission accomplished.

423
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:28,982
Let's go.

424
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:29,948
-Yes, master.

425
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:35,648
[laughter]

426
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:39,348
-Mabashi is obviously
having great success.

427
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:41,448
Time for me to join
in the game, as well.

428
00:19:56,182 --> 00:19:57,515
-Reporting in, Captain.

429
00:19:57,548 --> 00:20:00,182
Units two and three seem to
have encountered the Ryoka.

430
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:01,848
-With what sort of results?

431
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:03,448
-That's the problem, Captain.

432
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:05,748
We still don't know
what happened to them.

433
00:20:05,782 --> 00:20:07,548
-How irritating.

434
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,715
-My sincere apologies, Captain.

435
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:11,415
-Return to your men
at once, and proceed

436
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,548
to gather all available
units in the Seireitei's

437
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:14,915
northern quadrant.

438
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,315
I will be following shortly.

439
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:16,882

[laughter]

441
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:37,215
-Unit two and unit three.

442
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:38,648
Your report?

443
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:41,415
-Captain, unit two
encountered a single Ryoka,

444
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,815
but he overpowered
us and escaped.

445
00:20:43,848 --> 00:20:44,815
-Captain.

446
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:46,348
Unit three also
cornered a lone Ryoka,

447
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:48,648
but he released some
strange flying creatures,

448
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:49,915
and we failed to detain him.

449
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,382
-How could you do this?

450
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:55,948
The Head Captain has issued
a level one security order.

451
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:58,482
What good will it do us if the
Punishment Force cannot even

452
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:00,315
apprehend a single Ryoka?

-Well, Ritz, I think
it's about time.

00:21:10,648 --> 00:21:12,948
-Here are your new deployments.

456
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:15,915
Units one and two are to
fan out toward the west.

457
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:19,015
Units three and four are to
make a detour eastward and head

to the main road.

Don't let him go!

00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:40,850
to have you lieutenant
out of action?

479

KOMAMURA: It can't be helped.

It's not like he

Do you want to hire
him temporarily?

in here I'm gonna

496
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:20,683
be burned to ashes
by these flames!

497
00:24:20,716 --> 00:24:22,083
Come on, Ryoka!

498
00:24:22,116 --> 00:24:23,716
Come on out and fight!

499
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:30,116
I, Ikkaku Madarame,
will take you all on!

500
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,083
If I didn't know better,
I'd say I was in hell.
