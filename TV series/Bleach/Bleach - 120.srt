[theme music]

2
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:51,568
NARRATOR: Soul Reapers,
the spiritual guardians

3
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,368
to the world of the living.

4
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:56,102
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

5
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:59,202
of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

6
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:01,935
Sosuke Aizen, who
betrayed the Soul Society

7
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:05,968
and left the Seireitei in chaos,
has set his plan into motion.

8
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:09,002
Arrancars have arrived
in Karakura Town.

9
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:12,202
Using the Hogyoku, Aizen
has created these Arrancars

10
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:14,668
by shattering the boundary
between Soul Reapers

11
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:15,968
and Hollows.

12
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,802
The life and death struggle
between the Arrancer Edrad

13
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:21,402
and Ikkaku Madarame,
third seat of Squad 11,

14
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,102
was particularly fierce.

15
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:24,902
-Awaken Volcanica.

16
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:38,235
-Now, watch carefully,
my block-headed friend.

17
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:41,735
Don't tell anybody
you saw me doing this.

18
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:42,235
Bankai.

19
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:47,702
NARRATOR: In order to fight
Edrad's powerful Zanpakuto,

20
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:51,702
Volcanica, Ikkaku was forced
to use his hidden Bankai,

21
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:55,202
the massive blade
Ryumon Hozukimaru.

22
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:56,835
-An impressive display.

23
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,902
-You can decide
if it's effective

24
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,435
or not after I use it to
cut off your ugly head.

25
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:12,602
Hozukimaru is finally awaken.

26
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:14,568
He's such a slow starter.

27
00:03:14,602 --> 00:03:17,768
He's usually asleep
when I use my Bankai,

28
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:20,935
and he takes his own
sweet time getting up.

29
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:24,735
I can monitor his progress
by watching the dragon slowly

30
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:26,902
light up on the blade.

31
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:30,135
When it's completely red, his
power will be at full strength.

32
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,668
And when that happens, I
can start cutting you up

33
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:34,602
like a turkey on a platter.

34
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:42,402
NARRATOR: At the end of
a titanic clash of power,

35
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:45,535
Ikkaku, though badly
injured, finally managed

36
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:46,335
to defeat Edrad.

37
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:03,702
-Rukia.

38
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:13,868
[panting]

39
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:43,068
-Toshiro.

40
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:44,068
He's in trouble.

41
00:04:58,368 --> 00:04:58,835
-Rangiku.

42
00:05:05,202 --> 00:05:08,068
-Hm.

43
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:08,568
-Damn.

44
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:16,835
-So is that all that a
captain's Bankai can do?

45
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,602
What a disappointment.

46
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:19,835
You're really quite pathetic.

47
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:39,568
-I'm not done.

48
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:45,168
-Got to admit that
thing's pretty fast,

49
00:05:45,202 --> 00:05:47,268
considering how
big it is, brother.

50
00:05:47,302 --> 00:05:48,435
Not very effective.

51
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:49,702
-Shut up, will you?

52
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:02,468
[groaning]

53
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,335
[laugh]

54
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:16,268
-Damn it.

55
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:25,102
--[laughing] Don't tell
me that's all you've got.

56
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,935
That's the best
you Bankai can do?

57
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:32,302
How did a loser like you
ever get to be lieutenant?

58
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:35,535
Guess the 13 Court Guards
squads aren't that great.

59
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:37,368
-This fight's not over.

60
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:45,635
-It's not going very well, sir.

61
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:49,702
Hitsugaya and his squad are all
facing very powerful opponents.

62
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:50,835
-Damn it.

63
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,435
Those Arrancars are a
lot more of a problem

64
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:54,868
than we thought they'd be.

65
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:56,235
-At this rate, they'll--

66
00:06:56,268 --> 00:06:58,235
-I'm aware.

67
00:06:58,268 --> 00:06:59,368
We need that authorization.

68
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:06,002
[whimpering]

69
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:13,035
URURU: Danger.

70
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:14,002
Danger.

71
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:15,435
Danger.

72
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:15,935
Danger.

73
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:22,702
-Oh no.

74
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:24,368
Renji's in trouble up there.

75
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,235
-Looks like he's
having a tough time.

76
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:27,602
-Not good.

77
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:28,968
-What do we do?

78
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:33,168
-I have absolutely no idea.

79
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,468
-What's going on up there?

80
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,768
It looks like he's
getting his butt kicked.

81
00:07:40,802 --> 00:07:43,835
-So what's your
plan now, brother?

82
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,868
Well, if you don't want to make
a move, how about I go first?

83
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:07,635
KURODO: What's the
matter, brother?

84
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:08,935
-Think you're smart, huh.

85
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:16,502
-What the?

86
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:17,802
What is that?

87
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:18,868
RIRIN: Now's your chance.

88
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:20,168
-Huh?

89
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:23,235
-I used my powers
to make an illusion.

90
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:26,135
Then Kurodo transformed
to look like you.

91
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:29,002
And now, Noba's teleporting him
around to attack the Arrancar.

92
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:37,868
-Hey, I'm over here.

93
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:39,035
-Stop it now.

94
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,968
There's no way those
attacks will work on him.

95
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:42,402
You're in danger.

96
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:43,268
-Don't worry.

97
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:45,002
We'll handle this.

98
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:46,102
Noba.

99
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:46,602
Kurodo.

100
00:09:01,902 --> 00:09:04,435
-Kurodo, ready.

101
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:10,235
-You think you can take me on?

102
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:21,602
You brat, got you.

103
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:23,068
[scream]

104
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:23,568
-Ririn!

105
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:31,302
-Oh no.

106
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:32,168
Kurodo!

107
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:33,568
Ririn!

108
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:34,068
Noba!

109
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:39,102
-Did you really think
that you could defeat me

110
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:40,202
with tricks like that?

111
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:47,268
-Everyone's getting the
snot kicked out of them.

112
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:47,802
Come on.

113
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:53,302
Huh?

114
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:54,035
Ururu?

115
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:55,802
Why are you awake?

116
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:58,502
I thought I told
you to go to bed.

117
00:09:58,535 --> 00:09:59,002
Huh?

118
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:06,602
Wait a minute, the Arrancar's
strange spiritual pressure

119
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:07,368
is affecting her.

120
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:12,268
What are you-- no!

121
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:13,635
Ururu!

122
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,268
-If you're done
playing games, what

123
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:17,335
do you say we finish our
business here, brother?

124
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:31,568
-What the hell?

125
00:10:31,602 --> 00:10:33,435
Where did that kid come from?

126
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:43,868
-Danger.

127
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:47,868
You are a threat,
a danger to us.

128
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:54,802
You are an enemy, and
enemies must be eliminated.

129
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:07,535
-I don't believe this.

130
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:17,668
-Damn.

131
00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:18,435
You passed!

132
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:27,135
You dare put your hands on me.

133
00:11:27,168 --> 00:11:30,135
Now, you'll pay.

134
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:34,568
No one attacks me and
lives to tell about it.

135
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:37,868
Impale Del Toro.

136
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:53,035
You want to test me?

137
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:56,335
Well, this is what happens
when an Arrancar releases

138
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:57,668
his Zanpakuto, brother.

139
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:10,935
-You bastard.

140
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:22,668
-No!

141
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:32,035
-Run for it.

142
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,835
Get out of here.

143
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:34,335
-OK.

144
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:35,835
Got it.

145
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:40,402
You honestly think you
can stop me, brother?

146
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:41,068
We'll see.

147
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,835
-Save yourself, moocher.

148
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:56,268
[laughing]

149
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:08,902
-Before I finish you off,
allow me to tell you my name.

150
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:14,335
I'm Arrancar number
15, Yylfordt Granz.

151
00:13:25,377 --> 00:13:28,210
[thunder]

152
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:39,085
KOUFANG (VOICEOVER): So
Yylfordt has released his power.

153
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,418
Well, that means
one of two things.

154
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:44,851
Either he lost interest and
decided to wrap things up,

155
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:47,785
or he was injured from an
unexpected counterattack

156
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:49,785
and had no choice.

157
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,618
Hm, I doubt that happened.

158
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:01,218
Pathetic.

159
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:05,985
-It's not over yet.

160
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,251
-Hm.

161
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:36,985
Whipping your tail at me.

162
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:39,085
Such a desperate move, really.

163
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:41,818
Is that the best you
can come up with?

164
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:45,085
This is so disappointing.

165
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:49,051
I can see your ice flower
starting to come apart.

166
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:49,651
-Yeah.

167
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:51,285
What about it?

168
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:53,185
-Temper, young man.

169
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:56,285
I know something
about your powers.

170
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:58,851
As that flower behind
you disintegrates,

171
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:02,885
it serves as a countdown to when
your Bankai's power runs out.

172
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:03,751
I'm correct.

173
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:05,485
Aren't I?

174
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:06,685
You're still young.

175
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:09,485
Your Bankai has yet
to fully developed.

176
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:13,051
Bankai requires enormous
amounts of spirit energy.

177
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:14,818
And even though
you're a captain,

178
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:17,385
it must be difficult to
remain in Bankai mode

179
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:20,518
for long periods of time.

180
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:23,851
So it's remarkable that you've
maintain it even this long.

181
00:15:23,885 --> 00:15:26,351
But now, your original
12 petals have

182
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:29,785
been reduced to just three.

183
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:32,518
And when they have
all withered away,

184
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:35,951
your Bankai will have
completely disappeared.

185
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:41,018
At that point, you will
be powerless against me.

186
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:44,118
It would be easier for
me to wait and defeat you

187
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,451
when you're weak and
your Bankai is gone.

188
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:48,485
But it would be
disrespectful of me

189
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:51,351
to treat a captain
in that manner.

190
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,685
So I'll crush you now
while we are still

191
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:56,851
able to fully engage each other.

192
00:15:56,885 --> 00:16:01,185
That is the sporting
thing to do.

193
00:16:01,218 --> 00:16:03,051
Awaken Snip Tijereta.

194
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:24,785
[gasp]

195
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:29,251
-Huh.

196
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:35,485
[groaning]

197
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:41,818
-Since you're going
to die, I suppose

198
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:43,651
I should tell you my full name.

199
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:49,251
I'm known as Arrancar
11, Shawlong Koufang.

200
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:52,418
Please accept my final
respects, little captain.

201
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:23,785
-Hm.

202
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:26,685
Exactly the kind of response
I'd expect from a captain.

203
00:17:26,718 --> 00:17:29,251
I admire your
courage in facing me,

204
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:32,618
despite the obvious
difference in our powers.

205
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,118
Honorable.

206
00:17:35,918 --> 00:17:38,618
-You say your name
is Shawlong Koufang.

207
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:40,785
I want to ask you something.

208
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:43,718
I understand you're also
known as Arrancar number 11,

209
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:46,318
and every Arrancar has his
own numerical designation.

210
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:49,651
I'm confused about the
significance of those numbers.

211
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:51,851
Does it mean that you're
the 11th strongest

212
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:54,951
Arrancar to be created,
or is it some kind of rank

213
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:56,918
as in the military?

214
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,318
-Nothing of the sort.

215
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:01,018
Our numbers refer to the
order in which we were born.

216
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:05,051
It has nothing to do
with our strength,

217
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:10,051
but that only goes for any
of the numbers above 10.

218
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:11,451
You're confused.

219
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:13,251
Let me explain.

220
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:16,285
The system Lord Aizen
set up works like this.

221
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:19,985
When we Hollows are reborn as
Arrancar through the Hogyuko,

222
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:22,885
we're given a number
from 11 on according

223
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:24,451
to the order of our birth.

224
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:27,185
The ranks one through
10 are reserved.

225
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:30,918
Those of us who turn out to be
exceptionally skilled killers

226
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:33,118
are assigned a
number from one to 10

227
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:36,651
by order of their abilities,
strongest to weakest.

228
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:40,518
Those select 10 are the
Espadas, and their given numbers

229
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:42,385
are inscribed on their bodies.

230
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:45,518
They have the authority
to command the rest of us.

231
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:48,151
Truth is, our powers
don't even register

232
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:50,985
compared to those
of the Espadas.

233
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:53,751
So you know the importance
of this offensive, one

234
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:56,085
of the Espadas has
come here with us.

235
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:59,418
He has remarkable powers,
a ruthless killer.

236
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:05,485
Without question, if one
of you has the misfortune

237
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:09,451
to confront him, that
person's fate is sealed.

238
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:11,851
You might as well
prepare their grave,

239
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,618
for they have no
hope of survival.

240
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:27,885
The sixth Espada is
Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez.

241
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,418
-What the hell?

242
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:50,618
-Hey, are you even
trying, soul reaper.

243
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:52,551
I don't want to waste
the effort of killing you

244
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:54,418
when you're not at
maximum strength.

245
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:56,385
I'm giving you a break, kid.

246
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:59,485
I'm willing to wait until
you summon your Bankai.

247
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:02,185
You better do it, or I'll
punch you full of holes

248
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:04,485
like I did to that
soul reaper over there.

249
00:20:04,518 --> 00:20:05,485
What's the matter?

250
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,485
Too scared to fight.

251
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:08,451
-You bastard.

252
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:14,985
Bankai.

253
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,618
-That's more like it.

254
00:20:32,218 --> 00:20:33,785
-Come on.

255
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:35,285
I can't keep this
up much longer.

RANGIKU (VOICEOVER): Come on.

257
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:46,551
Hurry.

258
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:51,851
-So you're still
breathing, are you?

259
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:05,785
AKON (ON RADIO): Squad 10.

260
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:09,051
Come in, Lieutenant Matsumoto.

261
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:10,918
The restriction removal
has been authorized.

262
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:12,618
Gentei Kaijo is a go.

263
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:19,251
-Message received.

264

Captain, Renji, Gentei
Kaijo has been approved.

265
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:27,885
Go full power.

266
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:29,285
-It's finally come.

267
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:33,951
-About damn time.

268
00:21:45,585 --> 00:21:46,385
-What's this?

269
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:52,218
-Activating Gentei Kaijo.

270
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:54,218
-Activating Gentei Kaijo.

271
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:55,318
-Activating Gentei Kaijo.

KURODO: It's all right.

They can use Gentei Kaijo now.

276
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:52,472
It's a technique that triggers
a kido bomb containing

00:23:52,505 --> 00:23:54,538
huge amounts of compressed
spiritual pressure.

278

The explosion kills
anything, even Arrancars.
