1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,733
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,166
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,200
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:28,066
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,033
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:54,084
That's not good enough.

7
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:08,318
So you're the one.

8
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:25,251
<i>Come back here!</i>

9
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:28,918
You're always turning
your back on reality!

10
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:31,751
Admit to what happened!

11
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:35,918
What are you getting at?

12
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:39,784
You have been betrayed!
By the person you trusted
the most!

13
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:48,984
I couldn't say anything
at the time. But I was
right there, watching as
it happened.

14
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,884
It's frustrating!

15
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:53,718
I see.

16
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:59,451
I can't stand seeing this.
If you keep this up, you'll
end up destroying yourself.

17
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:01,851
Even with me trying
to help you.

18
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:03,851
You're quite harsh.

19
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:06,751
Tell me. Tell me
what to do.

20
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:12,951
You need me to help you.
I wanna put you to sleep
forever, you poor little
thing.

21
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:14,818
Put me to sleep?!

22
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:19,884
Oh, sorry, I forgot. You've
already been asleep for some
time now.

23
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:30,384
Does it hurt?

24
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:34,251
Well, what you're feeling
now, that is the pain of
reality.

25
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:39,718
It's nothing like the
naive world you live in.
Reality is harsh and painful.

26
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:42,184
I'll help to change your
mind.

27
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:57,518
Who knew an old lady like
you could still move. I'm
impressed.

28
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:58,984
What did you call me?

29
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:03,218
Momo!

30
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:09,818
What are you doing?!

31
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,051
Trying to get through to
you. I bet you still
think that you're good
looking, right?

32
00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:14,918
What?!

33
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,284
Women are just like milk.
They all have an
expiration date.

34
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:23,051
So face it. You're way
past your expiration date.

35
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:24,784
You brat.

36
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,784
I've had enough of you!

37
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:31,751
Like you could make me
stop!

38
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,318
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

39
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:38,751
Would you
just stop?!

40
00:05:46,784 --> 00:05:50,984
I thought I would help
you look sexier. But
since your shelf time's
already passed, you're

41
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,518
pretty much done in terms
of appealing to anyone.

42
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:58,318
Hmph! Maybe you
shouldn't be pushing
yourself.

43
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:01,284
Old-lay-dee. Hmm?!

44
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:04,884
You are so dead!

45
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:21,251
There's one more thing I
want to tell you.

46
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:25,751
All of those so called
friends of yours that
you trust...

47
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:27,918
That's all just
a big joke.

48
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:33,418
To be honest, none of them
are really your friends
at all.

49
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:37,451
They're just pretending
to be your friends because
it's a part of their jobs.

50
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,384
For instance, there's
Rangiku Matsumoto...

51
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:49,418
It's obvious that she
only cares about herself.
She couldn't care less
about what you're

52
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:53,418
struggling with. Really.
Is she paying any
attention to you now?

53
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:59,984
Why are you getting so
crazy? If you weren't
such an old lady, you
wouldn't care!

54
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:03,818
It's really sad and
pathetic to see you
acting like this!

55
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:07,218
Now die!

56
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:11,484
You are done!
You old witch!

57
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:20,384
The one who reigns!
Mask of flesh and
blood Universe
soar. The one crowned

58
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:21,984
with man's name!

59
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:26,318
Disintegrate, black dog
of Rondanini!

60
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:31,184
What do you think
you're doing?
Read through, burn away,
claw out your throat!

61
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:34,051
Bakudo Number Nine!
Horin!

62
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:37,018
Your aim is awful.

63
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:39,251
Have you heard
anything I've said?

64
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,218
Shakkaho!

65
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:50,718
What are you aiming
at? Old la---

66
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:01,884
Bakudo Number Nine!
Horin!

67
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:05,484
Let go!

68
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:15,151
Hey! Stop pushing
against me, will you?!

69
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:19,151
You really think I'm the
one in control here?! It's
not me doing---

70
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:23,718
That hurt!

71
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,518
We sure showed them!

72
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:28,451
I hope they paid
attention!

73
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:33,084
What are you saying, old
lady?

74
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:35,018
You mean you planned this
from the beginning?

75
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:42,051
And it worked, too! Do you
really think I'd ever take
anything a spoiled brat like
you said seriously?

76
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:48,718
We knew in order to go up
against our own Zanpakuto
powers, we needed to find a way
to catch you both off guard!

77
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:53,384
We knew if we split you
two up and got you paying
attention to us individually,

78
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:55,418
defeating you
would be easy!

79
00:08:56,451 --> 00:08:58,751
You two deserve each
other!

80
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:00,418
You've gotta
be kidding me!

81
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:03,184
You might want to try to
get along better.

82
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:04,418
Get along with her?!

83
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:14,318
You know, after seeing the
way the two of you treat each
other, I'd have to say I feel
sorry for you girls.

84
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:15,918
And why is that?

85
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:20,784
You're selfish and self
centered. You never think
of anyone but yourselves.

86
00:09:20,818 --> 00:09:22,251
That is not true!

87
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:24,351
Oh no?

88
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:28,384
Don't pay attention to
her. She's just bitter
'cause she's an old lady.

89
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:31,484
You will quit calling me
an old lady right now!

90
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:33,051
<i>It's not a bad thing.</i>

91
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:34,018
Huh?

92
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:39,418
Honestly, I'm looking
forward to growing older.

93
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,418
Huh?!

94
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:41,318
What?!

95
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:44,451
Being young isn't really
all that great.

96
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,484
When you are young, your
heart is still unrefined.

97
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:53,984
Your emotions are at risk
every time someone in your
life gains your respect or when
they turn their back on you.

98
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:57,418
It can feel as though
you're flying at times,
or even drowning.

99
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:03,351
Your emotions are always
getting the best of you
and it's easy to lose
sight of who you are.

100
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:09,351
But as you grow older
your heart and mind are
able to mature.

101
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:14,984
You gain perspective and
develop the ability to
set aside your emotions
to better understand who

102
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:17,051
you really are.

103
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:20,284
That's why I think growing
older is a good thing.

104
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:25,118
Using "expiration date"
when referring to someone's
age, makes you sound simple.

105
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:27,484
Well said.

106
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:29,818
Hmph. You believe that?

107
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:34,251
Oh, well! Girls as
immature as you don't
want to understand.

108
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:38,318
Sure, whatever you say.
Such a touching and admirable
speech.

109
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,318
Yeah, what a joke, right?

110
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:45,384
Hey, what's going on with
you?! Who's side are you on?!

111
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:48,084
Uh, that's my own business,
got it?! Huh!

112
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:51,084
Yeah, like anything goes
on in that head of yours!

113
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,851
What?! When it come to
brains you really shouldn't
talk!

114
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:55,751
<i>Brains don't make you</i>
<i>cute, dummy!</i>

115
00:10:55,784 --> 00:10:57,051
Just shut up!

116
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,266
Your name is Hyorinmaru!

117
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,466
And I am Toshiro
Hitsugaya, I am your
master!

118
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:29,466
Hm. Don't
make me laugh.

119
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,400
A mere boy could never be
the master of such great
power.

120
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:41,766
Are you serious?...Have
you completely forgotten
who I am?

121
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:50,400
You have already wasted
enough of my time. How
could you expect me to
believe such nonsense?

122
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,233
What has Muramasa done to
you?

123
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:08,600
Muramasa has no say in my
actions. Everything that's
happened has been a blur.

124
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:12,500
When I was released from
my master, I lost all my
memories.

125
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:14,766
All of your memories?

126
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,133
I've chosen to continue
working for Muramasa at
this time,

127
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,666
but my real goal is to
find my true master.

128
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,766
Your true master?

129
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,166
That's right. Because of my
enormous power, the one who
uses me must be the most
powerful Soul Reaper of all.

130
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,733
That is why logically, it
could not be a child like you.

131
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,400
It's true that my power
hasn't reached its potential.

132
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:42,266
But that doesn't change
the fact that I am your
owner!

133
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,966
<i>Easy to say.</i>

134
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,100
But if you truly are my
master, then you will show
me proof. Words will not
convince me.

135
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,733
Bakudo Number
Sixty-Three!
Sajosabaku!

136
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:28,433
A wasted effort.

137
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,600
What?!

138
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,733
Toshiro!

139
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,266
Damn it!

140
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:06,333
Stop, Hyorinmaru!

141
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,200
I am the one that
you are fighting!

142
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,466
Hado Number Thirty-One!
Shakkaho!

143
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:22,533
Your attempts are
useless. Do you hear me?

144
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,566
Zanpakuto.

145
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:59,200
I've heard the
Zanpakuto were released
from the Soul Reapers to
fulfill their desires.

146
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:04,733
If that's the case,
Hyorinmaru, what is it
you desire?

147
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,600
What do I desire?

148
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:09,600
That's right, what
is it you want?

149
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:13,533
Only you know what your
soul desires most in
this world.

150
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,833
Have you forgotten even
that?!

151
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,133
It would be a place to
call my own. It would be
home.

152
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,666
A home?

153
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,200
I feel I'm searching
for a home.

154
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,100
Searching...

155
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,333
... for a home.

156
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,800
Why are they afraid of
me?

157
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,333
I haven't done anything to any
of them, but it seems to me
that everyone's afraid of me.

158
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:07,833
Is it my silver hair? Maybe
it's the color of my eyes
that frightens them.

159
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:11,500
Could it be because I'm
distant towards people I
don't know?

160
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:17,700
I'm going to go buy some
snacks. I'll get you some.

161
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:29,500
Grandma's gotten very thin.
Maybe it's a coincidence, but
she seemed to get thin after I
started having those dreams.

162
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,300
<i>Here's your change.</i>

163
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,566
Thanks.

164
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:39,300
If that's all you want,
then get going.

165
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:44,400
<i>Hey you!</i>

166
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,833
That's how you treat a
paying customer!? Just
because he's a kid, you
think it's alright to

167
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:55,233
disrespect him?! I am
surprised as a shop owner
you lack common courtesy!

168
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:57,266
I didn't mean to be
rude.

169
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:02,800
If you ever wanna become
a man...then stop crying
and stand up for yourself!

170
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:07,833
Hey, what happened
wasn't my fault! And
I'm not crying! Now
let go of me!

171
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,233
I said let go!

172
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:11,566
Hey you! Hold on!

173
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,500
That dream...

174
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,400
I hear a voice...
it's echoing.

175
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,700
It feels like it's
crushing me.

176
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,466
It's surrounding me.

177
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:36,566
It feels like lightning
is striking my hand...

178
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:42,300
What's going on?!
Who are you?!

179
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:44,733
Boy! You are my--

180
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:47,600
I can't hear you!
What are you saying?!

181
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,166
My name is--

182
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,766
I can't hear you.

183
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:57,466
Hey!

184
00:17:58,366 --> 00:18:00,066
You're that girl!

185
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,166
You should conceal your
Spirit Energy when you
sleep. You've got your
grandma shivering.

186
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,866
I did that?

187
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,766
<i>You did. You need to</i>
<i>become a Soul Reaper,</i>
<i>boy.</i>

188
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:19,100
When a kid is strong like
you are, they need to
learn how to control
their power.

189
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:24,266
I'll tell you this...
If you continue doing
what you're doing now,
the power you've got

190
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,233
will eventually kill your
grandma.

191
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:27,733
What do you mean?!

192
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
You can hear a voice,
can't you?

193
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,800
Reign Over the Frosted
Heavens.

194
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,100
Hyorinmaru!

195
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:16,233
Somehow you are using my
power! But how?! You're
just a boy!

196
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,633
So you still can't
remember?

197
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,633
Then I will show you.

198
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,466
Though I don't know
what'll happen if I use
this attack in Shikai...

199
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,266
Ryusenka!

200
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,633
Getsugatensho!

201
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:52,433
Toshiro!

202
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,433
Remember!

203
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,766
Remember who it was that
heard your voice.

204
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,733
Remember where you're
from! Remember your
home!

205
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:19,433
Child. Do you think you
are capable of mastering
me?!

206
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:25,533
My name is...

207
00:20:30,933 --> 00:20:32,900
My name is...

208
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,100
You are--

209
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,800
Hyorinmaru!!

210
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,366
Master!

211
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,433
You remembered.

212
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:15,500
But my name... it
is not boy.

213
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:19,133
My name is Toshiro
Hitsugaya.

214
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:51,400
There is no time.

215
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:54,533
It looks as though you
will have to do for now.

216
00:23:46,907 --> 00:23:51,674
Captain! Please let me
borrow Hyorinmaru just
this once! It has always
been my fantasy to put a

217
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:54,041
handsome man on a leash
and walk him like a dog!

218
00:23:54,074 --> 00:23:54,907
<i>No.</i>

219
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:56,941
In return, I'll let you
borrow Haineko!

220
00:23:56,974 --> 00:23:58,874
<i>What? You are really</i>
<i>annoying!</i>

221
00:23:58,907 --> 00:24:01,074
<i>Absolutely not!</i>
