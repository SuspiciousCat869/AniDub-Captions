00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:01,102
-Here in my right hand, the
stone that connects the worlds.

3
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:04,668
In my left hand, the blade
that binds existence.

4
00:02:04,702 --> 00:02:08,302
The shepherd with black
hair, the chair of the noose.

5
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:11,268
I strike the ibis when
the clouds gather.

6
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:26,702
This hole that the Arrancars
come and go through

7
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:28,868
is known as the Garganta.

8
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:31,535
There is no solid ground
beyond this point.

9
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,302
Only a chaos of reishi.

10
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:36,535
Each of you must create his
own path out of that reishi.

11
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:40,068
Go toward the darkness and you
will arrive in Hueco Mundo.

12
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:43,535
-Let's go.

13
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:00,968
-There they go.

14
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:05,068
I cannot believe how
naive that boy can be.

NARRATOR: In order to let
Ichigo Kurosake and his friends

16
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:10,135
rescue Orihime
Inoue, Kisuke Urahara

17
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:12,035
opened the Garganta,
an opening that

18
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,602
connects the world of
living with Hueco Mundo.

19
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:16,302
Even so, there were
still other matters

20
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:18,268
that Kisuke needed
to take care of.

21
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:19,735
This is the story
of what happened

22
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:21,935
in the world of a living
while Ichigo and his friends

23
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:22,902
battled in Hueco Mundo.

-Oh, Rukia.

26
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:50,068
Huh?

27
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,435
Ah.

28
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:55,935
Uh?

29
00:03:59,035 --> 00:03:59,502
-[french]!

30
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:10,635
And that explains just how
Ichigo Kurosake and the others

31
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,735
left for Hueco Mundo.

32
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:16,002
However, just because Ichigo
and the others aren't here

33
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:17,535
doesn't mean the
Hollows have stopped

34
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:20,868
making their appearances
in Karakura Town.

35
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:23,535
Something still needs
to be done about them.

36
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:27,502
But I'm busy with other
matters I need to attend to.

37
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,968
So, after I slept on
this problem last night,

38
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:32,068
this is what I came up with.

39
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:36,202
Protect Karakura Town using
the Konso Cop Karakuraizer

40
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,802
transformational wrist watch.

41
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:43,668
That's a very
unhappy looking face.

42
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:44,768
-What's up?

43
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:46,235
Here's your chance to
appear in the show.

44
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:47,635
-Sure I'm unhappy.

45
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:49,735
Just when I was knocked
out, feeling so good,

46
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:52,168
dreaming about
Rukia, you wake me up

47
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:56,068
with a big elbow
smash to my gut.

48
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:58,068
KISUKE: You didn't think
that was an elegant way

49
00:04:58,102 --> 00:04:59,535
to wake you up?

50
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:00,568
-Elegant, my ass!

51
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:02,102
Don't think that
something's elegant

52
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,168
just because you
say it in french!

53
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:05,635
-Now, now.

54
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:07,835
Don't be like that.

55
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:08,668
Here.

56
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:09,702
Put this on.

57
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:12,035
-Let go!

58
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:14,702
-I've got better
things to do than that.

59
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:16,435
Bug someon else, will ya?

60
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:18,835
-Why are you so gun
shy to try it out?

61
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,235
-Who woul want to?

62
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:22,602
Nothing good happens
when you around.

63
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:24,768
-That's an awful
thing for you to say.

64
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:27,935
If a stranger heard you, he
might get the wrong impression.

65
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:28,735
-Well, guess what?

66
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:29,768
It's the truth.

67
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:31,668
-Come on, don't be like that.

68
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:33,535
Try it on, just
for the heck of it.

69
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:34,202
Why not?

70
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:35,202
Just give it a shot.

71
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,702
-What part of no
don't you understand?

72
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:43,968
-So, you really
won't do it, huh?

73
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:45,735
Even though it's a
really great chance

74
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:47,968
to become popular
with the girls?

75
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:50,635
Well, if you feel that
strongly about not doing it,

76
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:52,635
there's no way I'm going
to be able to push you

77
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:54,635
into wearing this watch.

78
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:55,135
-Whoa!

79
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:56,768
Wait.

80
00:05:56,802 --> 00:05:58,102
-Is something wrong?

81
00:05:58,135 --> 00:05:59,602
-Naw, nothin'.

82
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:01,902
I was just thinking,
you made it sound

83
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:03,835
like I'd really be helping out.

84
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:04,902
All right.

85
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:06,235
I guess I will listen
to your proposal.

86
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:07,635
-Hm.

87
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:08,835
All righty, then.

88
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,302
Let's get this thing on you.

89
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:12,368
-Hold on!

90
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:13,435
I said that I'd listen.

91
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:15,002
-I thought you were
the one who wanted

92
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,968
to be popular with the girls?

93
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,935
And let's face it,
with Ichigo not

94
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:21,368
here, you wearing this
awesome wristwatch

95
00:06:21,402 --> 00:06:23,768
would sure help all
of us out big time.

96
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,668
And by keeping the
peace in Karakura Town,

97
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:28,768
you'll even score some big
points with your sweetie Rukia.

98
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,068
-No way.

99

100
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:32,502
-Oh, Kon.

101
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:34,402
Now I think of you
in a different way!

102
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:40,802
URAHARA: Feel like doing it now?

103
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,368
-When you put it that
way, I guess I'll do it.

104
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,235
But just for a little while.

105
00:06:45,268 --> 00:06:46,435
-Terrific.

106
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:48,368
Then I'd better start
teaching you how it works.

107
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:50,935
Try pushing that button on
the right side of the watch.

108
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,302
It's really cool.

109

-Wait.

Use career change as
the activation code.

113

KON: Huh?

114
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:01,368
-Activate it with
any other code,

115
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:03,002
and I'll shock you to death.

116
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:04,635

-It's the alarm.

123
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:14,702
A Hollow has appeared.

124
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,102
Time to go for it, Kon.

125
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:22,435
I mean, Konso Cop Karakuraizer.

126

-You can just call me Kon.

127
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:28,468
But I just put this watch
on a few seconds ago.

128
00:07:28,502 --> 00:07:31,268
I have to go on a
mission already?

-You'll be fine.

You're already invincible.

-Roger that, boss.

-What?

136
00:07:44,802 --> 00:07:47,602
-Karakuraizer, here we go.

00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:04,035
We'll leave this one to you!

169
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:06,802
-Ow.

170
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:08,002
-Eh.

171
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:10,068
So who the hell are you?

172
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:15,368
-Um, you see, I, uh--
I'm not who I look like.

173
00:09:15,402 --> 00:09:16,602
Sorry.

174
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:17,768
URAHARA (OVER WATCH): Kon,
please hurry and transform

175
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:19,168
yourself into Karakuraizer.

176
00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:19,702
-Oh.

177
00:09:19,735 --> 00:09:20,368
OK.

178
00:09:20,402 --> 00:09:21,635
How does that work?

179
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:23,935
-Kon, you've only got
five seconds to transform!

180
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,768
Or else you'll be
shocked to death.

181
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:27,268
[sigh]

182
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:27,768
-Ah.

183
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:28,502
Got it!

184
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,335
Career change!

185
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:36,902
[coughing]

186
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,690
-I like what I see in you.

187
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:47,824
This just in, Karakura Town is
being protected by a new zero.

188
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,657
-It blew up on me.

189
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,490
Huh?

190
00:09:54,524 --> 00:09:55,957
No-- ah!

191
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:01,957
URAHARA (OVER
WATCH): Now, that's

192
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,190
the way to make an entrance.

193
00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:05,124
-I told you I didn't
want to do this.

194
00:10:05,157 --> 00:10:09,890
And besides-- what's
with these lame clothes?

195
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:15,124
-I personally asked Uryu
to design your outfit.

196
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,990
-Four eyes is no designer.

197
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,357
Why the hell did you
let that idiot do it?

198
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,490
If you would have asked
me, I would have come up

199
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:23,690
with a lot sharper
design than this.

200
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,024
Huh?

201
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:25,657
-Ready?

202
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,790
Set?

203
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:30,557
Pound!

204
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,724
-Why did you do that?

205
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,857
-You talk too much.

206
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,224
-Shut up!

207
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:37,757
A more respectful Hollow would
have held off while I talk.

208
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,024
-Who cares?

209
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,757
But never mind that.

210
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,890
Who are you?

211
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:45,690
-What a stupid Hollow.

212
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:49,590
I'm a hero of justice,
here to defeat you!

213
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:53,490
Konso Cop, Karakuraizer!

214
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:53,990
Ha!

215
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:00,290
-Oh.

216
00:11:00,324 --> 00:11:02,824
-Ururu, good timing on the
placement of that logo.

217
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,090
Kon is sure a lot more
into this than I expected.

218
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,590
-Go on, admit it.

219
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:13,990
You're shocked.

220
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:15,457
-No, not really.

221
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,724
That fake intensity of yours
comes off as overacting.

222
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:19,424
It's a real turn off.

223
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:20,424
-You mean that?

224
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:21,324
-I do.

225
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:23,457
Look at that those
you're striking.

226
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,324
It really sucks.

227
00:11:24,357 --> 00:11:25,957
-Who asked you?

228
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,257
Heroes are supposed to strike
a pose when they first appear.

229
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,224
-Once you transform,
strike a pose

230
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,590
like the letter K
with your whole body.

231
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:35,690
You're going to
explode if you don't.

232
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:37,124
-I swear it.

233
00:11:37,157 --> 00:11:38,324
I'm going to kill that jerk.

234
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:38,824
Huh?

235
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:39,724
-Ready?

236
00:11:39,757 --> 00:11:40,224
Set.

237
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:41,557
Pound!

238
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,924
-I told you to chill
out while I talk.

239
00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:44,624
-Who cares?

240
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:47,324
You left yourself open.

241
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:50,524
[laughter]

242
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:52,024
-You're nothing
but a second rate

243
00:11:52,057 --> 00:11:54,557
Hollow I could KO with
a single good punch.

244
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,690
You are done.

245
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,257
You'll be tost before we
even go to commercial.

246
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,657
-So give it your
best shot, hero!

247
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,557
-You are so going to regret
talking to me like that.

248
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,857
After you're completely dead Ha!

249
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,624
You think you can take me?

250
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:10,857
Are you seeing how high up I am?

251
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,990
Remember, I was originally an
enhanced leg strength model

252
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:14,957
mod soul.

253
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,524
This suit has
powerful fibers that

254
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:17,790
are activated whenever I move.

255
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:20,190
It makes my original
strength, my leaping ability,

256
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:23,324
and the power of my punches
and kicks double in force.

257
00:12:23,357 --> 00:12:25,557
-Yeah, there's no such
function is that suit.

258
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,424
-Say what?

259
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:29,290
-Your leg strength is
already strong enough,

260
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:30,690
so I didn't think
there was a need

261
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:33,557
to go to the expense and trouble
of adding a body strengthening

262
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,790
feature to your suit.

263
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:35,590
You'll be fine.

264
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,057
-You didn't do what?

265
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,757
Whoa!

266
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,224
-Uwagh!

267
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,290
-Now's my chance.

268
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:49,757
[groan]

269
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,490
-Ow!

270
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:53,090
[crying]

271
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:54,457
-Ouch!

272
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,657
That really hurt.

273
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,490
You caught me at the
bridge of my nose.

274
00:12:57,524 --> 00:12:59,757
My sinuses are throbbing.

275
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,224
Owie!

276
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:02,690
You're mean!

277
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:04,290
It's gonna swell up like a ball.

278
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:04,857
-Damn.

279
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,157
That bastard.

280
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,657
He kept that attack hidden
from me, that creep.

281
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,724
Hey, there.

282
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,057
Snarky shopkeeper.

283
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,857
Does this suit have anything
I can shoot this guy with?

284
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,924
-Yeah.

285
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:18,690
It has this great Riser
Beam built into it.

286
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:19,990
You want to use it?

287
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,224
-Yeah, sure, I'll use it.

288
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:22,624
-All right.

289
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:25,224
To do that, you need to use your
body to spell out Riser Beam,

290
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:27,157
then cross your arms
and thrust them out.

291
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,790
-Why use such a
complicated method?

292
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:32,057
-Because if you don't, not
only will the beam not fire,

293
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,357
but you'll be shocked to death.

294
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,157
-All right, then, I'll do it.

295
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,857
-Don't forget to call
out Riser Beam, OK?

296
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,424
-Huh?

297
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:41,624
-Here goes!

298
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:43,390
Special technique!

299
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:46,957
R-I-Z-er Beam!

300
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:00,890
-Stop!

301
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:07,090
-Awesome.

302
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:08,524
-You did it, Kon!

303
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,824
I mean-- Karakuraizer.

304
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:12,724
-I told you, call me Kon.

305
00:14:12,757 --> 00:14:15,590
If you're so concerned about
making a hero look good,

306
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:17,457
shouldn't I do some
sort of victory

307
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,357
pose after I wipe them out?

308
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,757
-Ha ha ha.

309
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,190
You know, you're exactly right.

310
00:14:22,224 --> 00:14:23,790
A heroic character
like you should

311
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:26,190
have some signature pose, but
I never thought you'd win,

312
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:27,457
so I haven't come up with one.

313
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,257
-You never thought I'd win?

314
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:29,957
-Sorry.

315
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,290
What a surprise.

316
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:33,757
I'll try to come up with a
pose for you in a minute,

317
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,524
but for now you can get
a-- [shrieking] huh?

318
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:39,224
-I'm picking up a
reading on a new Hollow.

319
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:40,590
It's very close.

320
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:43,757
[shrieking]

321
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,590
-Damn.

322
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:45,590
Is that what I think that is?

323
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:46,390
-Yep.

324
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:47,757
We've got us another Hollow.

325
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,857
How rewarding to have
such a great job.

326
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,190
-Yeah, great.

327
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,590
-You should get a look at this
one in about five seconds.

328
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,790
Try your best to defeat it, OK?

329
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:57,757
-Thanks for helping me out!

330
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,824
All right, then.

331
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,490
I guess I'll use the Riser Beam.

332
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,324
-Oh, I forgot to tell you.

333
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:05,457
The Riser Beam uses up a lot
of energy when you fire it,

334
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,857
so you can only use it once
for every transformation.

335
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,357
Bye.

336
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:08,890
-Only once?

337
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:12,957
What was that?

338
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,324
[roar]

339
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:20,857
-There's an entire
flock of them up there.

340
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,190
-Powerful Hollows
appearing one after another

341
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,057
in such a short amount of time.

342
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,690
This is highly unusual.

343
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:32,890
It is as I suspected.

344
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:36,690
The time seems to
be approaching.

345
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:37,924
-Damn.

346
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:39,624
Thanks a heap, Kisuke.

347
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:42,424
This watch is about as
useless as a sundial at night.

348
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:43,257
Hold it.

349
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,690
These things are flying Hollows.

350
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:49,024
This suit's got exactly
the right kind of stuff

351
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:52,424
to take down an enemy like them.

352
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:53,357
Here goes!

353
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,557
Special technique, Riser Cape!

354
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,457
URYU: Allow me to explain.

355
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,757
The special Riser Cape has
1 and 1/2 times the number

356
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,357
of pleats as a normal cape.

357
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,424
-Oh.

358
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:07,390
So I can use those
extra pleats to-- huh?

359
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,290
Do what?

360
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:09,657
URYU: Look a lot sharper.

361
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,024
-That's it?

362
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:12,390
-Yeah, that's it.

363
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:13,557
-I can't fly?

364
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,157
-No.

365
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,324
You cannot fly.

366
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:17,157
-Say what?

367
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:17,790
-Hey.

368
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:19,024
Stupid shopkeeper.

369
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:20,557
What is the meaning of this?

370
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:28,290
It's useless to have more
pleats in this suit's cape!

371
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:30,757
Huh?

372
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,590
Ah!

373
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:33,090
Hey!

374
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:33,590
You!

375
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:34,457
Let go!

376
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:34,957
Stop!

377
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:35,447
Whoa!

378
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,313
No!

379
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:37,747
I mean, if you would just-- ah!

No!

Who's that?

And, wah, ha ha ha ha!

You all right, Karakuraizer?

396

We've come to help you.
