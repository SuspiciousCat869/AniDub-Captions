1
00:01:52,336 --> 00:01:56,278
We're here looking for the
guy named Ichigo Kurosaki!

2
00:01:56,312 --> 00:01:57,681
Where is he!!

3
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:00,821
What's with that guy?
Just what era is he from?

4
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,560
I don't recognize
this guy at all.

5
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,466
So here's the
deal Kurosaki!

6
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:12,145
Until you decide to come out
here, me and my boys from
Miyasho High are sealing off
your school gate!

7
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,448
[Uryu]
Excuse me.

8
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:14,250
Huh?

9
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,426
Enough with the outdated
scare tactics. Can't you
see you're making everyone
nervous for no good reason?

10
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:21,598
Now hurry along
and go home.

11
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,769
Huh?!
What's that?!

12
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:25,773
Are you Kurosaki?!

13
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:27,510
What'd you say?!

14
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:28,780
Augh!

15
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,256
Hey! What the
hell was that?!

16
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,494
You asking for
trouble, ya punk??

17
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:37,665
That's exactly what I
was going to ask you.

18
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,707
What part of me
says "Kurosaki"?!

19
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:53,699
So what's with
this Four-Eyes guy?

20
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:57,406
I take back what I just said.
You don't have to leave.

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,179
In fact, don't any of you
think you're allowed to leave.

22
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,720
That idiot! Did he
just come out to
make things worse?!

23
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:05,290
You bastard!

24
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:09,331
- Get Him!
- Yeah!
- Kill Him!
- Come on!

25
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:11,403
Guh!

26
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:15,979
Ow!-Ow! Ow!-Ow!-Ow!
Ow! Ahh! Okay! Okay!

27
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:18,217
Hey! One, two, three, four...

28
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,889
My leg! That hurts!
Okay okay! I give! I give!

29
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:22,393
Six...

30
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:22,928
Agh!

31
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:24,765
Hey what's the
big idea?!

32
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:27,837
Why don't you tell me.
What did you jump in for?

33
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:30,243
What?! It's really
not obvious to you?!

34
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,912
I jumped in to get
you to back off!

35
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:33,984
That! That's the guy, Obuta!

36
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:36,355
Him? Grr!

37
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:37,825
He's the one
who jumped me!

38
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:38,427
Hm?

39
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,295
Hehh!

40
00:03:40,364 --> 00:03:41,366
[Ichigo]
You're that thief.

41
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:41,866
Yaah!

42
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:50,785
The only reason I punched
you is 'cuz you were
rippin' someone off.

43
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:52,289
So what're you
crying about?

44
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:53,859
Ahh!
You shut up!

45
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:57,600
I've already heard enough here!
Ready for your beatdown?

46
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:58,302
Kuros--

47
00:03:58,335 --> 00:03:59,237
Augh!

48
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:04,515
This is none of
your business!

49
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:06,652
they came looking for me,
so back off!

50
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:09,792
This became my
business a while ago,
so you back off!

51
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,930
If you get involved,
it'll turn into a huge mess!

52
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:14,435
Don't forget you're
our class president
ya dumb ass!

53
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:14,918
What?!

54
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,609
[in unison]
What the hell are you
two yapping about?!!

55
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:22,887
Uryu! You've been spending
way too much time hunting
Hollows lately!

56
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:26,694
You're bound to get the
attention of the Soul
Society, what then?!

57
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:27,563
"Hunting" Hollows?!

58
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,739
Actually, I'm
exterminating them!

59
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,645
And I only go when
Kisuke asks me to go.

60
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:36,482
You act like I'm
seeking them out!

61
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:42,695
I guess you've kinda forgotten
that Kisuke was a wanted man
by the Soul Society until
just recently, huh?

62
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:45,868
This isn't the time or
place to bring that up!

63
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:47,438
Text me or something!

64
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,810
[Ichigo]
Right! Like I know
your phone number!

65
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:52,315
Hey! When did you buy
a cell phone anyway?

66
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:56,824
I didn't buy it, Kisuke gave
it to me 'cause I've been
helping out with his shop.

67
00:04:57,826 --> 00:05:00,867
Oh really? What is
that, from 1990?

68
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:01,702
[Yokochin]
Hey Kurosaki!

69
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,504
Hnh!?

70
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,311
[chuckling]

71
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:09,484
[Yokochin]
Ah! I'm glad to see
you're still doing well.

72
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:14,462
- [chuckles]
- You're in trouble now!

73
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,501
You do remember me,
now don't-cha kid?

74
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:21,577
No?

75
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,483
Why you bastard!
I'll kill--

76
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:25,018
Augh!

77
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:26,955
[Thugs]
Yokochin!

78
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:27,823
Huh?!

79
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,028
[rapid punching]

80
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:39,047
You seem to be having fun.
Ichigo my boy!

81
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:41,719
She knows you!
Do you know who she is?

82
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:44,825
[sputter]
My boss!

83
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,934
Always coming up with these
lame excuses not to work for me.

84
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:51,907
Well, this is
the last straw.

85
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:55,047
You're coming with
me right now!!

86
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:56,416
No way!

87
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:57,653
Heh!

88
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:02,696
Eghghghghgh!

89
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:13,586
Amazing. She just
hauled Ichigo off in
one sweeping move.

90
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:14,554
Who is she?

91
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:17,595
So now, what do we do?

92
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:20,567
I think I'll
just lie here.

93
00:06:21,603 --> 00:06:24,409
Hey now! Take this
tape off of me!

94
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:28,751
I'll consider doing that, if
you promise me not to run off.

95
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:30,855
Y'know you're starting to
sound like a kidnapper!

96
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:36,535
Thanks for calling!
It's fast, cheap,
reliable Unagiya!

97
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:42,447
You want two double orders?!
Hey numbnuts! We're not an
unagi eel takeout place!

98
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:46,489
Huh?! I answered the phone
saying "Unagiya" because that's
our shop's name ya idiot!

99
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:47,691
[click]

100
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:50,731
[Ichigo]
Y'know...

101
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:53,571
I keep telling you this,
but why don't you change
the name of this store?

102
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:58,147
What?! just drop my family's
name from the store that was
passed down to me?!

103
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,583
Not gonna
happen!

104
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,992
Listen lady, I'm not
knocking your family name,

105
00:07:03,992 --> 00:07:05,829
I'm just saying you
should change the
name of the store.

106
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:09,905
I won't do it!
And don't call me "Lady"!
Address me as Ms. Ikumi!

107
00:07:09,938 --> 00:07:10,974
Now get to work!

108
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:12,243
Huh?!

109
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:14,080
Look after the Kondos' rabbit
over on Second Street!

110
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:16,552
Then organize Ms. Fukushima's
toy rat collection over on
Sixth Street!

111
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:18,790
And do yard work
for Mr. Yamashita
in South Kawase!

112
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:20,828
And there's a
lot more jobs.

113
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:23,834
While you've been slacking
off, more and more requests
have been stacking up!

114
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,475
Aw c'mon! You can handle
these things by yourself!

115
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,786
Hey Ichigo. Why do you
think that I hired you?
To slack off?

116
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,024
You're here, so you're
gonna work for me!

117
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,129
[Kaoru]
Mom, where are you?

118
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:38,665
Oh crap!

119
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,042
Wagh!

120
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,146
Mommy, I'm kinda hungry.

121
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:49,120
Oh, can I get you
something Kaoru my sweet?

122
00:07:50,122 --> 00:07:53,196
Do you want some spaghetti
with meatballs? Or cheese?

123
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:54,832
I'm okay.

124
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:57,004
Oh! It's stupid
Ichigo!

125
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:58,808
What's he doing here?!

126
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:02,516
I know my Mom's pretty,
but don't try getting too
friendly with her, ya creep!

127
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,054
Bluuh!

128
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,929
Right now go wait in the
kitchen. I'll be there
in a minute, okay?

129
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:10,533
'kay!

130
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:12,570
Nyuuh!

131
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:13,672
That's enough.

132
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,026
I'm sorry. It's so strange
but you're the one person
he just doesn't warm up to.

133
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:26,967
I'm sure you'd like to
tell him what you think,
but try to hold back, okay?

134
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:31,677
"Tell 'im what I think"?
Like I'm not interested
in an old lady like you?

135
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,082
That hurt!!

136
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:34,951
[doorbell]

137
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:36,654
Huh? A customer?!

138
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:39,660
Hi! Please come in!

139
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:42,281
Uh?

140
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:51,285
Hi... Uh... Welcome.

141
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:52,253
[Ichigo]
What are you
doing here?

142
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:54,558
You two know each other?

143
00:08:57,263 --> 00:08:58,567
Not quite.

144
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:03,010
Want some ramen?

145
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:06,584
No thank you.
We've got plenty
of unagi.

146
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:08,321
But we don't serve
freshwater eels.

147
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,761
[Orihime]
Uryu!

148
00:09:14,066 --> 00:09:14,801
Hm?!

149
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:18,876
I heard that Ichigo's
been abducted!
Is it true?!

150
00:09:19,277 --> 00:09:20,947
"Abducted"?

151
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:24,120
I guess it might've
looked like that to
somebody who saw it
from afar.

152
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:26,158
But in reality...
Hey, wait a sec!

153
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:32,037
[Uryu]
He's all right! It was
his boss from his job who
came by and grabbed him!

154
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,375
It was just his Boss?

155
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,916
I'm sure that's
what Ichigo said.
His pushy boss.

156
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,356
Hmm. It wasn't
anyone weird?

157
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,897
Well, I'd say that
she's a little weird.

158
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:48,105
But aren't most of
the people Ichigo
hangs out with weird?

159
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:49,207
Oh!

160
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:54,318
You're right!
You and I are both
kinda weird people!

161
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:56,655
Er, I meant that--

162
00:09:56,655 --> 00:10:02,033
But you know what, for about
two days now I've been sensing
these really strange vibes
floating all around Ichigo.

163
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,839
Did you notice
anything, Uryu?

164
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:05,975
No...

165
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:09,315
I'm not really
feeling that.

166
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:10,819
No?

167
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:15,695
Oh! My job! Gotta go
or I'll get chewed
out by my boss too!

168
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:17,132
I'll see ya
tomorrow! Bye!

169
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,001
See ya.

170
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,412
She's right. Ichigo's Spirit
Energy is supposed to be gone,

171
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:26,953
but there was
definitely something
still there around him.

172
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:29,257
[Uryu]
And I'm sure it was
Spiritual Pressure.

173
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:40,682
[gasp]

174
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,471
Thank you for this food!

175
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:52,974
Hey.

176
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:55,212
[sip]

177
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:58,051
I said hey!

178
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:04,164
Why the hell did you
show up here and
start eating ramen
in front of us?!

179
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,137
When I asked you earlier you
said you didn't want any.

180
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:10,244
And I've gotta eat the
noodles before they
start to get all mushy.

181
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:13,717
Go eat it at your own house!
It's not like this is your
break room! It's mine!

182
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,826
So you don't think this
is a work space, you
think it's a break room?

183
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:21,868
But Ichigo's on the right
track with his question.

184
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:24,875
What're you here for?
You wanna hire us?

185
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:27,981
Of course I do.
I need a job done.

186
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,029
Let's talk.
Ya have any cold tea?

187
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:38,403
[gulping]

188
00:11:38,437 --> 00:11:41,309
So, just what is it
you want me to do?

189
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:46,152
That's a strange thing to ask.
I don't want anything from you.

190
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:50,895
I've been looking for someone
who's willing to take on a
difficult errand for me.

191
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:53,301
And I happened to see
the sign for this place.

192
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:57,510
So I knocked, and you
answered the door.
It's sheer coincidence.

193
00:11:57,877 --> 00:12:01,084
Sure. And you just
happened to have ramen.

194
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,487
Hmph.

195
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,396
So then, is this young
lady here the owner?

196
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,466
Huh?! I sure am!

197
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:14,145
Alright. Here's what I need.

198
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:17,352
[gasp]

199
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,075
Jinta, Home run!

200
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:29,812
Got it!

201
00:12:31,314 --> 00:12:34,822
[Jinta]
Quit hitting a baseball in
front of someone's house!

202
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:35,857
Agh!

203
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:44,041
Ogh... Hey Jinta.

204
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:48,952
And the only one allowed to
hit a Jinta home run, is me!

205
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:49,887
Hrrgh!

206
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:55,499
It is not right to be
throwing a baseball that
hard at someone who
isn't wearing a mitt.

207
00:12:57,436 --> 00:12:58,438
We're sorry.

208
00:12:58,471 --> 00:12:59,908
Is your stomach okay?

209
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:02,413
I know that Jinta can
act so juvenile.

210
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,951
But would you still be willing
to play with him sometime?

211
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:06,255
Yeah...

212
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,192
[both]
Why we'd love to.

213
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:11,399
[Karin]
Is Mr. Urahara home?

214
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:12,100
Hm?

215
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:13,135
[Kisuke]
Yes, here I am!

216
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,411
Well! How unexpected.

217
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:20,150
[Kisuke]
If it isn't
Miss Kurosaki.

218
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:25,261
[Kugo]
I want you to do a background
check on someone for me.

219
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,032
This guy's name is...

220
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:28,334
Isshin Kurosaki.

221
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:31,308
You know him?
Is that a fact?

222
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:32,476
What are you kidding?

223
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:37,553
Isshin Kurosaki is my father!
You wanna know something
about him, then ask!

224
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:39,023
I'll answer
your questions!

225
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:43,399
You mean he's your old man?
What a crazy coincidence.

226
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:45,003
Yeah right.

227
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:49,412
You think you could answer
any question about him?

228
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:52,418
You really sure you know
your dad that well?

229
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:55,091
What's that supposed to mean?

230
00:13:56,093 --> 00:14:00,302
Just exactly that,
I asked you a simple
question, and I need
some answers.

231
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,649
You think you know him,
But besides the obvious,
how much do you really
know about your father?

232
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:13,095
Fact is, there are probably
some really important things not
even you know about your family.

233
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,466
At least, not just yet.

234
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,007
Start by going to
Urahara's Shop.

235
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,014
I think you might find
something of interest there.

236
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:25,989
[Kisuke]
Are your back and shoulders
sore from the burden of
spiritual possession?!

237
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:29,930
Then you need Katakoran Alpha,
the anti-spirit rub!

238
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:33,504
For those times when you don't
want spirits following you, and
also for use in the bathroom!

239
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:36,611
Try Sekirei X, the
anti-spirit repellant spray!

240
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,117
Need instant escape
when a Hollow attacks?

241
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,192
You're good with these
electromagnetic restraining
pills- Zetaborutan!

242
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:44,695
Is there anything
else that you need?

243
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:45,530
Nope.

244
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:49,004
Well what about our
newest product,
Katakoran Theta?

245
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:50,240
How's it different?

246
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,442
It has Vitamin C.

247
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:52,979
Skip it thanks.

248
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:59,025
You sure I don't need
to pay you for this?

249
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:03,100
Yeah we're good. The thing is
I owe your older brother a lot.

250
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,372
I see.

251
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:10,182
So hey. How is your brother
anyway, same as always?

252
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:11,251
Yup.

253
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:13,556
And you're okay with
what's happened?

254
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:15,994
Yeah.

255
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:23,009
It's alright. Ichigo
doesn't need to get his
Soul Reaper powers back.

256
00:15:23,577 --> 00:15:27,418
My brother's always been
fighting for us, even before
he became a Soul Reaper.

257
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:33,230
There was always something or
someone he had to protect.
And he always carried that
burden himself.

258
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,571
So the way it is now,
Is okay with me.

259
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:42,317
From now on, it's our
turn to protect Ichigo.

260
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:44,053
I'll see ya.

261
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:48,663
Hm!

262
00:15:56,814 --> 00:16:00,722
Karin? What's she doing
at Kisuke's place?

263
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:03,828
[Kugo]
Are you worried?
You must be.

264
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:08,572
I mean, seeing your
kid sister visiting
the place of a dodgy
guy like Urahara.

265
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:13,715
Hey, there's nothing
dodgy about him.
Kisuke's the one--

266
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:17,356
That "saved all of us",
is that it? Well?

267
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:18,626
What?!

268
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:22,634
Just how much do you
know about your buddy?

269
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:25,473
And what makes you think
you understand Urahara?

270
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:30,518
Here's some advice.
Act now while you can.

271
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:32,789
That's if you want to
protect your family.

272
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,643
[Ichigo]
So I didn't get your name.
Just who are you?

273
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,447
I'm Kugo.

274
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:47,654
Kugo Ginjo.

275
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:53,800
Kugo Ginjo.

276
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:57,408
Here's what you
need to know.

277
00:16:58,175 --> 00:17:00,614
I'm not buying any of what
you're trying to sell me.

278
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,253
It's your call.

279
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:05,625
Wait. I wanna give you this.

280
00:17:08,698 --> 00:17:09,767
Hm?

281
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,305
See ya!

282
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:13,876
Kurosaki.

283
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:44,306
Where'd that
old man go?

284
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:50,787
If I still had my Soul Reaper
powers right now, I could
trace his Spiritual Pressure.

285
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:52,323
[gasp]

286
00:17:53,426 --> 00:17:54,361
[light sigh]

287
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:57,701
Guess I still haven't
gotten past it yet.

288
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:00,173
[Orihime]
Ichigo!

289
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:00,641
Hm?!

290
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:02,277
Hey, Ichigo!

291
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:10,762
Wanna have some tasty bread?
I've got plenty to share!

292
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:21,919
Hey why are you
fidgeting so much?

293
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:23,422
I-it's just...

294
00:18:23,455 --> 00:18:26,361
Uh, I wasn't expecting
that you would invite
me up to your room.

295
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:29,869
Well it's not like this is
the first time you've been
up here, so what gives?

296
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:31,338
Here ya go.

297
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:33,343
Oh, thank you.

298
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:38,420
So hey, we can't eat
this much bread.

299
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:41,493
Oh... Are you sure?

300
00:18:43,431 --> 00:18:46,303
Only four of us
live here and that's
a ton of bread.

301
00:18:46,704 --> 00:18:48,909
Why don't you just take
some of it home with you?

302
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:52,383
I mean your boss was nice
enough to give you these
odds and ends, right?

303
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:55,623
They're not "odds and ends"!
They're unsold bread!

304
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,326
It's the same thing.

305
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,264
[mouth full]
Not the way you say it.

306
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:03,539
So, hey.

307
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:04,341
Yeah?

308
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,519
I'm wondering.
Has anything happened
to you recently?

309
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:13,494
[sip]

310
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:17,503
Not really.
Why would you ask me
something like that?

311
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:21,511
Well, I just had...
this feeling.

312
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:22,413
You did?

313
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,920
Yeah. It's just that,
how should I say this?

314
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:28,993
I guess I'm concerned
you might be in trouble.

315
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:32,634
Has anyone suspicious
been following you?

316
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:37,310
What's that?
Someone following me?

317
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,716
I guess I'm usually in
trouble of some kind.

318
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,423
But "being followed"?
That sounds more like
your style.

319
00:19:43,457 --> 00:19:45,427
[chuckle] No one's
following me!

320
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:51,574
Oh well. I guess
that feeling I had
was all wrong.

321
00:19:52,576 --> 00:19:56,985
Sorry to bother you.
Guess I was imagining
things and got concerned.

322
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:02,865
Hey, don't worry about it.
You're just looking out for your
friends, that's not a bad thing.

323
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:06,572
Oh hey! Lemme give ya back
that manga I borrowed.

324
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,311
Oh it's okay!
There's no
rush, really!

325
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:19,666
[Uryu]
This Spiritual Pressure
belongs to Orihime.
I guess she beat me to it.

326
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,875
I hope she finds the source of
those feelings she's having.

327
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:26,881
But getting an answer out
of Ichigo's not easy.

328
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:29,020
Instead of just asking
him straight out,

329
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:32,093
maybe I can get him to spit
it out if I take this step
by step.

330
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:33,596
Huh?

331
00:20:40,343 --> 00:20:41,011
[gasp]

332
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,024
Oh no you don't!

333
00:20:56,077 --> 00:20:57,079
There he is.

334
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:08,502
He's fast!
No ordinary human
can move that fast!

335
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:13,947
[Uryu]
I don't see any changes in
the reishi surrounding him.

336
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:17,655
So then how is he able to
accelerate like that?!

337
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,668
Huh?

338
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:27,843
What was that?
A light?!

339
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:29,447
Hm?

340
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:32,861
Ah!

341
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:47,184
It's your call.

342
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:54,032
"X-cution".

343
00:21:54,432 --> 00:21:55,568
[sirens]

344
00:21:55,568 --> 00:21:56,036
Huh?!

345
00:21:57,138 --> 00:21:58,441
That sounds close...!

346
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,604
[Ichigo]
Uryu, lemme see
your cell phone.

347
00:23:47,637 --> 00:23:50,243
[Uryu]
Sure. It works fine here in
the World of the Living.

348
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:52,013
[Ichigo]
Wow! The display's
in black and white.

349
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:53,583
[Uryu]
Pretty rare, right?

350
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,823
[Ichigo]
There's no camera,
or infrared features.

351
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:58,859
[Uryu]
That's 'cuz it's a vintage
phone that can't be found
anywhere else! Isn't it cool?

352
00:23:58,893 --> 00:24:00,694
[Ichigo]
No one sells it
'cause it's so old!
