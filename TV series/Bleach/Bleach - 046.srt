00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,529
I'll see you later,
little Shiro.

00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:30,896
-Mmm!

9
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:32,896
Quit calling me little Shiro,
and don't pat me on the head,

10
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:34,229
either.

11
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:36,629
-When you finally go to the
same grownup school as I do,

12
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:38,529
I'll use your real name.

13
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:40,029
-Forget that.

14
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:42,096
Why would I go to some
stupid Soul Reaper school?

15
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,329
-I'll be staying in
the dorm from now on,

00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:46,729
but I'll come visit you
soon, OK, little Shiro?

00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:47,696
Bye!

18
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:49,729
-All right, thanks
for the warning.

Don't hurry, you bad wetter!

00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:05,296
-Goodbye, mother and father.

21
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:07,562
I'll come visit again soon.

-Great!

Now we're going to be late
to our first day at school.

25
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:14,396
-Don't you blame this on me!

26
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:16,229
What were you doing
sleeping in a tree?

27
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,162
I was looking
everywhere for you.

28
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:19,329
-I'll do whatever I want to.

29
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:21,129
It's none of your business
where I sleep, anyway!

-Oh!

31
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:23,362
I should have just
left without you!

32
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:27,462
It would have served you right!

MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Welcome, new students,

34
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:31,462
to Soul Reaper Academy.

35
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:34,662
You are now part of a proud
tradition, a unique school

36
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:37,829
dedicated to building this
stealth forces in the 13 Court

37
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:40,129
Guard Squads of the future.

38
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:42,596
Apply yourselves
diligently to your studies

39
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,629
and uphold the
honor of our school.

40
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:47,729
-Let me introduce
myself, students.

41
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:50,829
My name is Gengoro Onabara.

42
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:52,862
I'm also pleased to
inform you that of all

43
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:55,962
the incoming freshman, your
test scores on the entrance exam

44
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:57,096
were the highest.

45
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:59,096
In other words, welcome
to the advanced class.

46
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,496
Congratulations.

47
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:02,896
Of course, this means
that expectations for you

48
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:04,129
are higher as well.

49
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,662
You must train hard and
strive to not merely serve

50
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:08,829
your future squad,
but to excel in each

51
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:10,896
of your various pursuits.

52
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:13,229
-Just because you're not
in the advanced class,

53
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:16,162
it doesn't mean you have
less chance of excelling.

54
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:18,096
In the end, what
matters is hard work.

55
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,329
If you train as hard as--

-All right, group
one to the line.

now demonstrate Hado.

00:05:04,062 --> 00:05:05,262
-That was a great shot.

72
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:07,629
How'd you do it?

73
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:09,529
-I only hit the corner.

74
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:10,396
Probably just luck.

75
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:12,296
-Well, I'm still impressed.

76
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:15,662
Most of them didn't even
reach their targets.

-Was that the blonde kid?

00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:26,062
-Amazing shot.

81
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:28,596
I think he hit a
perfect bullseye.

82
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:36,896
RENJI (VOICE OVER): Hmm!

83
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:38,429
That guy's pretty good.

84
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:41,696
I guess now I know my
competition is in this class.

85

Well, whoever

88
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:58,729
he is, I'm not about
to let him show me up.

89
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:03,329
So he destroyed the
target, then I will, too.

00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:17,496

INSTRUCTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Match, [inaudible].

102
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:54,162
-Are you hurt?

103
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:55,062
Can you up?

104
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,262
You didn't have to be so rough!

105
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:58,996
-Izuru, are you all right?

106
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:00,529
-Yes, sir.

107
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:01,029
-Huh!

108

-Hmm?

110
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:15,996
Oh, it's you.

111
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,029
-I wouldn't mind
joining you there.

112
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,496
That OK?

113
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:22,496
-Uh, sure.

114
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:24,329
-Thanks.

115
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:27,662
I got to admit, you really
let me have it in class.

116
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:29,362
I was so overwhelmed
by your strength

117
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:31,529
that I couldn't
even counterattack.

118
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:33,596
My whole arm is still numb.

119
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:35,662
-Well, I'm sorry about that.

120
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:37,162
I didn't mean anything by it.

121
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:39,329
But I kind of messed
up at target practice

122
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:43,396
earlier, so I felt like I
needed to make up for that.

123
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,429
-Zan, Ken, So, Ki.

124
00:07:46,462 --> 00:07:47,929
Each of these four
disciplines must

125
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:51,229
be mastered before we
can become Soul Reapers.

126
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,896
We've definitely
got our work cut out

127
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:55,262
for us if that's
going to happen.

128
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:59,729
-Well, yeah, I guess so.

129
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,996
Name's Izuru Kira.

130

Hi.

131
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,129
It's certainly a pleasure to
meet you, fellow freshman.

132
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,996
-Introduction and
a handshake, huh?

133
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,829
Your family must be from
the good side of town.

134
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:15,262
-Huh?

135
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:17,762
-Manners aren't
exactly my style.

136
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:22,562
But my name is Renji Abarai,
and nice to meet you, too.

137
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:24,429
-Ah, think you, Renji.

[voices]

139
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:25,496
-Huh?

140
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:26,396
What's going on?

141
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:36,662
[chatter]

142
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:38,396
-I can see!

143
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:41,296
-Hey, what is
everybody looking at?

144
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:42,362
-Hmm?

145
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,396
Oh, one of the Court
Guard Squad captains

146
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:47,129
is supposed to be coming here
any minute to review the class.

147
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:47,696
-Really?

148
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:49,629
A full captain?

149
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,596
[chatter]

150
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,096
-Hey, stop pushing!

151
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,396
-A real captain.

152
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:19,629
-I wish you could have
seen him, little Shiro.

153
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:21,829
His spiritual pressure
surrounding him

154
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,629
was different from
anything I've ever felt.

155
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:27,096
Hey, it feels like you're
not even listening to me.

156
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:30,096
-I told you, quite
calling me little Shiro!

157
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:31,496
-Ah!

158
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,096
-Why do you always have to come
home on your days off, anyway?

159
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:37,029
If that school's so great,
you should just stay there.

160
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:39,629
-I come home to visit
you, little Shiro.

161
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,496
-Well, I don't
remember asking you to.

162
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,600
-I know one thing for sure.

163
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:53,300
Someday I'll be in Squad
5 with Captain Aizen.

164
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:54,734
Hey, come on.

165
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:57,100
I'm really serious.

166
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:59,600
[spitting seeds] To

167
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:17,667
-Ahhhh!

168
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,300
Hey!

169
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,467
What was that for?

170
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,000
-All this daydreaming
is a waste of time.

171
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:24,900
You've been here for
six months and you still

172
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:26,867
haven't started taking
your training seriously.

173
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,734
-Oh, yeah?

174
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,167
Well, who are you to--

175
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,734
You look like you're
going someplace.

176
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,600
Are you guys having field
training or something today?

177
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:42,500
-Yeah, we're going to the World
of the Living for a practice

178
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:45,067
fight against dummy Hollows.

179
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,067
-Why you?

180
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,534
Why is it only your class?

181
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,167
Not to mention you shouldn't
be in the advanced class

182
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
in the first place!

183
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,267
-What can I say?

184
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,400
They recognize talent
when they see it.

185
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:56,100
-Oh!

186
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:57,867
-And just you wait.

187
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm better than you already,
and when I come back,

188
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:03,234
there won't even be any
comparison between us.

189
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:04,634
-Yeah?

190
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:07,634
Well, when you come back, I'm
going to be a-- I don't know.

191
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:16,500
-First, allow us to
introduce ourselves.

192
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:18,967
I'm Shuhei Hisagi, sixth year.

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,234
-I'm Kanisawa.

194
00:11:20,267 --> 00:11:21,634
-I'm Aoga.

195
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,367
-The three of us will your
guides for this exercise.

196
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
-Wow!

197
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,267
-They're going to
take us themselves?

198
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,434
-No way!

199
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:29,400
-What's up?

200
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:31,067
Why are they all gawking?

201
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,334
Are they famous or something.

202
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:33,934
-How do you not know?

203
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:36,967
The one in the middle,
everybody knows who he is.

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,500
Shuhei Hisagi.

205
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:41,400
They say he's been assigned to
a post in the 13 Court Guard

206
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,467
Squads even before he graduates.

207
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,234
That almost never happens.

208
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:47,867
He's even supposed to be in
line to become a ranked offer.

209
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,834
RENJI (OFFSCREEN): Huh.

210
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:50,134
No kidding.

211
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,100
-Strangely enough, he also
failed the Academy's entrance

212
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:54,600
exam two times.

213
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:57,434
And given that my exam score
was the highest in our class,

214
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,600
I might be better than him.

215
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:01,300
-Oh?

216
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,634
-Now listen up.

217
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:05,300
We'll split up into groups
of three and get ready to go.

218
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:08,034
Everyone take out the lots you
drew when we first assembled,

219
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:09,434
and then find the
two students who

220
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:12,500
have the same mark as you have.

221
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:15,267
-Ah, so that's what these
little pieces of paper were for.

222
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,600
-You and I are together,
but who's our third?

223
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:21,534
-Excuse me.

224
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,667
I'm your third.

225
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,867
-Oh, it's you.

226
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,000
Hello, Momo.

227
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:28,167
-Welcome aboard.

228
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,300
-All right, not that
everyone's found their groups,

229
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,567
we'll brief you on
today's exercise.

230
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,700
-An advance party of
sixth year students

231
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:37,567
has already entered
the World of the Living

232
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,834
and constructed a
temporary barrier.

233
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:42,367
-Once inside that
perimeter, each group

234
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,634
will engage in practice
combat with dummy Hollows.

235
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,067
-The sixth year
students are here

236
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,067
only to create a combat-ready
environment for you.

237
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,500
They will not assist
in the combat itself.

238
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:54,167
Are we clear?

239
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,000
Then let's go.

240
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:55,767
ALL: Yes, sir!

241
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
SHUHEI (OFFSCREEN): Open!

242
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:09,634
-It's begun.

243
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,700
Maintain barrier strength.

244
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:14,400
Often the dummy Hollows
can attract the real thing.

245
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:15,534
-Right, right.

246
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:18,167
But this is a safe zone,
so it's not likely here.

247
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,300
-Just the same, make sure you
don't let your guard down.

248
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,567
This is part of our
training as well.

249
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,000
-OK, OK.

250
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:50,079
-Damn.

251
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:51,846
All right, Momo,
it's coming your way!

252
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:04,346
-Hado 33 Shakkaho
Red Flame Cannon!

253
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:12,679
Izuru, I missed it!

254
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:14,146
-[yelling]

255
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:25,546
-Good job, Izuru.

256
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:26,213
-Thanks.

257
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:28,779
You, too.

258
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:30,813
-That was even easier
than we thought it'd be.

259
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,146
-It's all because we
worked together as a team.

260
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:35,913
None of us would have done
as well as we did on our own.

261
00:14:35,946 --> 00:14:37,013
-Nah!

262
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:39,379
By myself, I would have
done it much faster.

263
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:42,946
They should let me fight real
Hollows instead of dummies.

264
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:43,779
-Huh!

265
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:44,946
You're nothing but talk, Renji.

266
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:45,713
-Hey!

267
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:46,479
What do you mean by that?

268
00:14:46,513 --> 00:14:48,179
-Come on, Mister Big Mouth.

269
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:48,746
-Hey!

270
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:49,246
-Let's go back.

271
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:49,913
-Stop it!

272
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:51,246
-Yeah, yeah, I know.

273
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,046
-Hey, what's the problem, Momo?

274
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,546
-Oh, it's-- it's nothing.

275
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:14,213
-I think that everyone
has returned safely.

276
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,746
-So the exercise was a success.

277
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:19,446
-This is Hisagi at
the rendezvous point.

278
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:23,179
Barrier Unit, what is
the situation there?

279
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,579
HISAGI (OFFSCREEN):
Barrier Unit, acknowledge.

280
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:27,946
Barrier Unit, can you hear me?

281
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,313
Report in at once!

282
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,179
Barrier Unit, report!

283
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:32,246
-What could have happened?

284
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,479
-I don't know.

285
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:35,913
It certainly is strange
for them not to answer.

286
00:15:35,946 --> 00:15:36,813
-Oh, no!

287
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,613
-You just till we
get back, and--

288
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:41,313
-[scream]

289
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:42,413
-What the hell?

290
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,046
-Who was that?

291
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:44,546
-Let's go.

292
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:45,313
Come on!

293
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,146
-What is that thing?

294
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:53,113
IZURU (OFFSCREEN):
It's-- it's huge!

295
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:01,879
SHUHEI (VOICE OVER): Oh, crap!

296
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:03,679
It's a Hollow!

297
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,979
And a big one, too.

298
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:09,813
But why didn't we
sense it approaching?

299
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:10,679
-You bastard!

300
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:13,213
You killed her!

301
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:14,046
-Aoga, no!

302
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,013
-[yelling]

303
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:19,646
-Aoga!

304
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,046
Freshmen, get out of here!

305
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,846
Run as far as you can!

306
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:23,779
[screaming]

307
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:24,679
-Come on, follow me!

308
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:25,646
Faster!

309
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,679
Come on, everybody,
stick together!

310
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:29,913
-So that's what a real
Hollow looks like.

311
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:30,713
Come on!

312
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:31,379
Are you deaf?

313
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,146
Let's go!

314
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:34,713
Soul Society, come in!

315
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:35,713
Emergency!

316
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,613
Shuhei Hisagi
requesting assistance.

317
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:41,213
I'm in the World of the
Living, coordinate point 1026.

318
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:42,713
Huge Hollow attack
at this location!

319
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:47,513
[screaming]

320
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:48,013
-Run!

321
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:48,513
Let's go!

322
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:49,013
Go!

323
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:55,136
MOMO (VOICE OVER): Why
are they all running away?

324
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:57,936
Someone has to stay and fight.

325
00:16:57,969 --> 00:16:59,702
-Momo, what do you
think you're doing?

326
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,569
We were told to clear the area.

327
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:04,902
You're disobeying
a direct order!

328
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:06,769
-Yeah, but--

329
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:07,902
-Hey!

330
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:11,336
That thing just killed
two sixth year students!

331
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,236
-I know.

332
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:13,736
-Momo!

333
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,469
SHUHEI (VOICE OVER): Damn!

334
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:21,236
I can barely see it.

335
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:32,602
-[yelling]

336
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:41,469
-Is that all you got?

337
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:42,802
Well, bring it on!

338
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,769
You three!

339
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:53,569
-We just wanted to help, sir.

340
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:55,036
Sorry to disobey.

341
00:17:55,069 --> 00:18:00,069
-We came back to save you so
you'll remember to forgive us.

342
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:01,569
-Ruler, the mask
of flesh and blood,

343
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,402
all things in the universe fly!

344
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:06,002
-That which names
all, heat and war!

345
00:18:06,036 --> 00:18:08,702
-Beyond the seas in reverse,
take steps to the south.

346
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:12,302
ALL: Hado 33 Shakkaho
Red Flame Cannon!

347
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:18,569
-I suggest we run, sir!

348
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:19,969
-Right!

349
00:18:20,002 --> 00:18:22,036
-How could such
a gigantic Hollow

350
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,436
manage to sneak up
on us like that?

351
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:25,802
-I don't know.

352
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:27,936
It seems like it was able to
conceal its spiritual pressure

353
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:29,169
somehow.

354
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:30,902
-There's no way we're
strong enough to defeat it,

355
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:33,402
so what do we do,
just keep running?

356
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:36,769
I've already called the Soul
Society and requested back up.

357
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:38,402
Until then, we just
have to stay alive.

358
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:43,469
Hey!

359
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,469
What the hell?

360
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:47,002
Why is everything
getting all blurry?

361
00:18:58,675 --> 00:18:59,608
-Ahhh!

362
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,908
How can this be happening?

363
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,275
-If must have
called its friends.

364
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,875
This whole thing is just crazy.

365
00:19:05,908 --> 00:19:06,741
So many Hollows!

366
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:14,141
-No way.

367
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:14,975
No way!

368
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:18,475
I don't want to die like this.

369
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:21,108
I don't want to die
at all, you guys!

370
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:31,908
[screaming]

371
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,341
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

372
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,641
We got here as
quickly as we could.

373
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:53,041
-It's Captain Aizen,
leader of Squad 5,

374
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:55,075
and his Lieutenant,
Gin Ichimaru.

375
00:20:01,175 --> 00:20:02,775
-You've done very well.

376
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:06,108
I'm sure you were scared,
but you're safe now.

377
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:07,808
We'll take over from here.

378
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:08,875
You go and get some rest.

379
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:15,541
-My, there certainly
are a lot of you.

380
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:17,541
Slay them, Shinso!

381
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:53,475
MOMO (OFFSCREEN): Captain Aizen.

382
00:21:02,475 --> 00:21:12,941
[wind blowing]

383
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:14,575
-Excuse me, guard?

384
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:15,208
-Yeah?

385
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,941
What do you want?

386
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:18,908
[gasp]

387
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:20,841
[music playing]

388
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:51,712
[theme music]

389
00:21:51,712 --> 00:22:34,252
[theme music]

390
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:45,873
MALE SPEAKER (VOICE OVER): Rats!

391
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,373
I'm too hungry to
concentrate on training!

392
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:48,673
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICE OVER):
All right, then, here.

393
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:50,273
Take my emergency rations.

394
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:50,973
MALE SPEAKER (VOICE
OVER): Thanks.

395
00:22:51,006 --> 00:22:51,573
Hey, wait.

396
00:22:51,606 --> 00:22:52,806
What's this?

397
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,740
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICE OVER):
This is chicken nibbles,

398
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,406
and this is to
remove hair balls.

399
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,540
MALE SPEAKER (VOICE OVER):
You're in human form now.

400
00:22:56,573 --> 00:22:57,840
Why are you still
eating cat food?

401
00:22:57,873 --> 00:22:58,473
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICE OVER): Try it.

402
00:22:58,506 --> 00:22:59,306
It's pretty good.

403
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,673
MALE SPEAKER (VOICE OVER): Eww!
