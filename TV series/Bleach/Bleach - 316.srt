favorite, candied beans.

You're kidding right?
You like candied beans?

them, Toshiro.

Thank you for coming such
a long way to visit me.

00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,534
Sure.

47
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:30,734
So that's it! The real
reason you came here was
to visit Granny, huh?

48
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:33,467
That's no business
of yours.

Yeah whatever.

50
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:36,434
Huh?

51
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:37,267
Uh?

52
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,801
Oh, hello Yosuke,
I didn't see you.

53
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:45,001
How long have you
been standing there?

54
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,734
[Karin]
Granny, who is that boy?

55
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:51,101
<i>[Haru]</i>
<i>[chuckle] He's been staying</i>
<i>here for quite a while.</i>

<i>He's a Whole.</i>

57
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:58,001
Don't be shy Yosuke,
you can say hello to
our guests.

58
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,667
Uh.
Mmm.

59
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,367
Hi there!

60
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:03,501
M-mm. Mmm.

61
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:05,434
Huh?

62
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:09,501
[Haru]
Sorry, but you see,
Our Yosuke is...

63
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:13,167
A very shy young man.
And yet...

64
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:18,101
I haven't seen a wandering
spirit that's visible so often,
since when Toshiro was here.

65
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:21,001
I told you,
I'm not a spirit.

66
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:25,634
Yes, of course, I know.
You're a Soul Reaper.

67
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:30,301
Anyway, I must admit,
I've enjoyed having
Yosuke here.

68
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,167
<i>He makes my life</i>
<i>happier.</i>

69
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:35,667
That's nice.
What about your family?

70
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:41,601
Hm, they're all gone.
I've lived alone a
very long time.

71
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:43,767
Ohh, I'm sorry.

72
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:49,467
Well don't be. I have
Yosuke and other spirits
to share my life with.

73
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,967
And sometimes Toshiro
comes to visit,

74
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:56,534
so with all my visitors,
I never feel lonely.

75
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,467
You're so lucky!

76
00:05:58,501 --> 00:06:02,334
It seems like the only
wandering spirits that
ever visit me are the
really annoying ones.

77
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:07,634
So tell us Yosuke, what
exactly is keeping you
from resting in peace?

78
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,134
[sigh]

79
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:13,467
Yosuke has a wish.
He has always wanted
to see snow.

80
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:14,467
Um-hm!

81
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:15,934
"See snow"?

82
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:21,934
Yes. Yosuke and his family
were driving to a ski resort,

83
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:25,034
<i>when they were involved</i>
<i>in a terrible accident.</i>

84
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:28,501
<i>Many people lost their</i>
<i>lives in that wreck.</i>

85
00:06:28,534 --> 00:06:31,634
<i>Yosuke's parents</i>
<i>seemed to pass</i>
<i>over peacefully,</i>

86
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:34,067
<i>but poor Yosuke did not.</i>

87
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:40,767
<i>His desire to see snow for the</i>
<i>first time was so strong, he</i>
<i>wasn't able to rest in peace.</i>

88
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:46,901
<i>And that's when I first found</i>
<i>this dear boy. Just wandering</i>
<i>around, looking so lost...</i>

89
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:48,701
Is that so?

90
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:55,534
But according to our weather
forecast, it's supposed to
snow here this week, so we
are very excited, aren't we?

91
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:56,601
Yeah!

92
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:58,434
[chuckle]

93
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:10,467
[Karin]
Say, Toshiro, Is it
okay to leave that kid
there like that?

94
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:12,367
What'dya you mean?

95
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:17,434
C'mon-don't play dumb.
I've heard spirits that
haven't passed over are in
a pretty risky situation.

96
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:25,267
If they're left alone, I don't
really know why... But don't
they like, turn into monsters?

97
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,234
Yeah, you're right.

98
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:42,501
If he stays here, Yosuke
will probably end up
turning into a Hollow.

99
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:43,967
A Hollow?!

100
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:47,101
What you're calling...
a real "monster."

101
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,967
Well then won't Grandma
Haru be in danger too?!!

102
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:54,901
Toshiro?

103
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,867
It happened to me around
the time when I first
became a Soul Reaper.

104
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:09,401
<i>Before I knew what to really</i>
<i>expect, I was dispatched to</i>
<i>the World of the Living, in</i>
<i>order to gain experience.</i>

105
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:20,634
<i>At the time I was stationed</i>
<i>here, I simply followed my</i>
<i>orders. I spent every day</i>
<i>exterminating Hollows.</i>

106
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:29,401
In those days, the only thing I
focused on was eliminating
Hollows that appeared before me.

107
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,634
<i>[Haru]</i>
<i>That's certainly a fine</i>
<i>sword you have there.</i>

108
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,401
Hnh?!...Oh...

109
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:42,367
My oh my! You are such a little
fellow to be a Soul Reaper.

110
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:47,701
<i>Grandma Haru had Spiritual</i>
<i>Power and she knew all</i>
<i>about Soul Reapers.</i>

111
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:50,034
<i>And she was kind enough</i>
<i>to look after me.</i>

112
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:54,434
[Haru]
I can see you very
clearly today.

113
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,434
<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>I'm using a gigai.</i>

114
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,267
A gigai?

115
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:01,201
It's a body for
eating candied beans.

116
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:06,734
Is that so? Then be
sure to eat plenty of
them before you leave.

117
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:15,334
<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>Grandma Haru lost her family a</i>
<i>long time ago, and ever since,</i>
<i>she's lived alone.</i>

118
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:19,367
<i>People thought she was strange</i>
<i>because she could see spirits,</i>

119
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:21,301
<i>and they kept their</i>
<i>distance from her.</i>

120
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:28,167
So those lost spirits who
surrounded her, were the
only acquaintances she had
to help ease her loneliness.

121
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,534
[sympathetic]
Mmm.

122
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:33,567
Grandma Haru thinks of
Yosuke as a grandson.

123
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:47,567
So, Toshiro, did you make
your trip here to try to
do something for Yosuke?

124
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:53,567
Normally if I found a
spirit in a state like his,
I'd perform a Konso right
away.

125
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:58,567
But I didn't do that,
and now I have to make
sure he doesn't become
a problem.

126
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:01,901
I'm left with no choice
but to watch him.

127
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:06,201
Hm! Y'know for a kid,
you sure do care a
lot about people.

128
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:09,167
Tch! Why do you keep
calling me a kid?!

129
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:13,767
So it seems like you might be
stuck here for a while longer.
Where are you planning to stay?

130
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:15,167
<i>I hadn't really--</i>

131
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:16,901
Then you can stay at our place!

132
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:17,901
Hnh?

133
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:20,767
<i>[Yuzu Kurosaki]</i>
<i>[squeal]</i>
<i>Ooooooh!</i>

134
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:23,434
So Karin, you brought
home your boyfriend?

135
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:24,501
No way!
No way!

136
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:26,701
You two are perfect
for each other!

137
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:31,334
Aw gee! Of all the times
for Dad not to be here,
he's really missing this!

138
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,267
Hey! It's not
what you think!

139
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:37,167
[Karin]
Oh never mind! Anyway,
Toshiro will be staying
with us a while.

140
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,967
[Yuzu]
He will?! Oh my goodness!

141
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:40,967
Well aren't you growing up
faster than I thought!

142
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:42,701
This is big news!

143
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:45,034
And to think just
yesterday you were trying
to be a tomboy playing
soccer with the guys.

144
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,267
Ichigo, would you
please shut her up?

145
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:50,367
[Karin]
Yeah, aren't you and
Toshiro friends?!

146
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,634
[exasperated sigh]

147
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:56,534
Toshiro, who gave
you permission to
date my sister, huh?

148
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:57,601
Rrgh!

149
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,101
[Toshiro]
What're you talking about?!

150
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:07,267
Why is it always the same
problem with your family?

151
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,934
No matter how hard I
try, they won't listen!

152
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,667
Ah c'mon, don't
let it bother you.

153
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:14,234
Yuzu always
acts like that.

154
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:22,201
I was kidding around.
You and Karin took it so
personally, I couldn't quit.

155
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:23,867
But seriously...

156
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,634
Don't get Karin into
any danger, understand?

157
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:33,534
So, are you gonna
keep following me
for much longer?

158
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:38,067
Why not? You're going to
Granny's, right? It's not like
I've got anything else to do.

159
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:40,434
Fine. Suit yourself.

160
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:47,067
Oh how nice. You've come
to see me again today?

161
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:50,634
As I said, I took some
time off to come visit.

162
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:56,701
Well I'm glad you're here.
And I see you brought
your girlfriend again.

163
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:57,401
Hi.

164
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:58,367
Hey!

165
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:02,001
We're not dating!
Not you, too,
Grandma Haru.

166
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:06,667
Why, look Yosuke.
Toshiro and his friend
have come to visit again.

167
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:07,834
Hi Yosuke!

168
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:09,634
Uhh...

169
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:13,301
You really are such a shy boy.
I can't imagine better company.

170
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:15,767
Hey kid.

171
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:17,234

Keep it.

175
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:28,534
Uh... really?
Thanks a lot!

176
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,001
[Karin]
So tell me, Toshiro...

177
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,901
Where in the world did
you find an iced snowman?

178
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:43,534
My Zanpakuto helped me out.
It's an ice and snow type.

179
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:44,567
Huh?!

180
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,267
[Toshiro]
When I want to,
I can manipulate
ice and snow.

181
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,634
<i>[Karin]</i>
<i>So then, you're saying you</i>
<i>made that snowman yourself?</i>

182
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:58,501
<i>Well if you can do that,</i>
<i>then why don't you just</i>
<i>make it just snow already</i>
<i>so you can be done here?</i>

183
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:02,467
It wouldn't be right
for me to use my
power in such a way.

184
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:06,034
Jeez. Why are you being
so serious again?

185
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:10,701
Besides, it's gonna snow soon,
even without me interfering.

186
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:15,567
You think so?! Yosuke!
It's going to be
snowing pretty soon!

187
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,667
When it does, let's make
an even bigger snowman!

188
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:19,601
Great!

189
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,467
Thank you Toshiro.
What a nice present.

been cold quite awhile now.
