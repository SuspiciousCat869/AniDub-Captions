NARRATOR: Gyokaku
Kumoi had grown weary

3
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:54,015
of the failed attempts to
assassinate Princess Rurichiyo.

4
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:57,515
He bestowed his most experienced
assassin and his squad

5
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:59,515
with very powerful
swords, forged

6
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:02,682
by the Kasumioji clan
known as the Bakkoto.

7
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:05,515
Kumoi dispatched them to
the world of the living.

8
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:08,715
Ichigo found himself embroiled
in a battle with Hanza Nukui,

9
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:10,848
the leader of Kumoi's assassins.

10
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,815
Remembering their
previous fight,

11
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:15,748
Ichigo targeted what he thought
to be the Bakkoto Saiga's

12
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:19,348
weakness, but Hanza turned
the tables on Ichigo,

13
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:21,848
trapping him inside
a world of mirrors.

14
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,815
-I already have all your
little tricks figured out.

15
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:41,882
I told you when we
fought before, I never

16
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:43,748
fall for the same move twice.

17
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:46,482
That Zanpakuto uses the light
reflected from its mirror

18
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:49,248
to press the attack, so
once the mirror's broken,

19
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:50,548
the fight is over.

20
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:52,882
-Don't be so sure, kid.

21
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:53,382
-What?

22
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:05,348
-As I told you before,
depending on the spirit

23
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:07,548
energy of its
wielder, this katana

24
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:09,015
can become infinitely power.

25
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:29,182
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Where am I?

26
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:57,415
Are we there yet, mom?

27
00:03:57,448 --> 00:03:57,915
-Hm?

28
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:20,215
-Ichigo.

29
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:20,715
-Mommy!

30
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:26,415
-Big boys like you
shouldn't be crying.

31
00:04:30,915 --> 00:04:33,215
Tell me, Ichigo.

32
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:34,482
-Huh?

33
00:04:34,515 --> 00:04:36,182
-I've been wondering
just what was

34
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:39,215
it that made you want to learn
karate all of a sudden anyway.

35
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:39,848
-Huh?

36
00:04:39,882 --> 00:04:40,548
Oh.

37
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:42,115
Well, that's a secret.

38
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,215
-Oh come on.

39
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:46,148
Don't you want to share
that with your own mom?

40
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:49,015
-Well, uh, I-- uh.

41
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:49,715
Wow.

42
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,448
Look at the sky.

43
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:51,915
It's so pretty.

44
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:52,482
-Oh.

45
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:53,348
You're right.

46
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:54,015
It's beautiful.

47
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:00,715
So, you like sunsets?

48
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:04,215
-Well, I guess they're
pretty, but I don't.

49
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:04,715
-Oh?

50
00:05:04,748 --> 00:05:07,115
Why not?

51
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:10,848
-I guess they make me feel sad.

52
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:12,282
-They're not sad at all.

53
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:14,048
They're nice.

54
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:14,548
-Um.

55
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,448
Wake up, mom.

56
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:38,415
Come on, mom.

57
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:38,915
Mommy.

58
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:45,348
Mom.

59
00:05:52,615 --> 00:05:54,115
-Ichigo Kurosaki.

60
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:56,215
This is the true
power of my Saiga.

61
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:03,515
I will give you a
good taste of fear.

62
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:06,048
You will suffer through your
most terrifying nightmare.

63
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:23,248
-That's why I told her
I don't like sunsets.

64
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:30,782
Why can't you come back mommy?

65
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:31,982
ICHIGO'S MOTHER: Ichigo.

66
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:32,915
I'm so sorry.

67
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,648
-Where are you now, mommy?

68
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:41,148
Mom.

69
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:47,748
Why, mom?

70
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,348
Why can't I find you anywhere?

71
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:58,048
I'm sorry, Ichigo.

72
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:59,015
Sorry I'm late.

73
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,015
Well, let's go.

74
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:05,515
-Mommy.

75
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:06,482
You're here!

76
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:10,682
Mommy.

77
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:12,715
I found you, finally.

78
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:13,448
-Ichigo.

79
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:14,582
-Where did you go?

80
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:17,348
-It's all right.

81
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:20,915
Mommy just got
here a little late.

82
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:22,115
Were you crying?

83
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:24,682
It makes me sad to see that.

84
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:26,582
-No, I'm not crying.

85
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:27,982
But because I didn't, I--

86
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:32,382
-Son, it's OK.

87
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:36,548
-But it's my fault, because--

88
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,682
-None of that really
matters now, right?

89
00:07:39,715 --> 00:07:40,382
OK.

90
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:43,148
Let's just go home now.

91
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:43,948
-OK, mom.

[creaking]

93
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:55,815
-You're squeezing too tight.

94
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:56,948
Mom, stop.

95
00:07:56,982 --> 00:07:58,048
You're hurting me.

96
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:01,815
Let go!

97
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:13,882
-Why did you?

98
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,148
What's going on?

99
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:32,048
This isn't right.

100
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:32,548
Mom.

101
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:40,682
She's dead.

102
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:42,482
There's no way this is real.

103
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:49,115
But I-- Mom.

104
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:55,282
-It's not over.

105
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:57,015
This is just the
beginning, Ichigo.

106
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:02,315
I will make sure this
nightmare of yours

107
00:09:02,348 --> 00:09:04,882
will continue until
you are driven

108
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,215
completely out of your mind.

109
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:18,015
-Stop it, mom.

110
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:18,515
Please.

111
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:26,615
Damn it.

112
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:28,748
This is an illusion.

113
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:30,848
This can't be happen.

114
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:35,148
You really think this is
enough to take me down?

115
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:38,915
-Then why don't you stop her?

116
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:40,915
-You bastard.

117
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,248
-Go on.

118
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,182
Show that you have what it
takes to hurt your own mother.

119
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:53,782
Your resolve can't begin
to compare to ours.

120
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:56,348
We have chosen the path
of blood and strife,

121
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:57,582
no matter what the cost.

122
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,615
This is over, Ichigo Kurosaki.

123
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:27,886
-Hey, Mom.

124
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,086
Stop doing this.

125
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,452
-What is this?

126
00:11:00,252 --> 00:11:01,419
What's he doing now?

127
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,952
That black spiritual pressure.

128
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:04,152
He's breaking free.

129
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,793
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): I want
to tell you--

130
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,019
Hey Mom,

131
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:34,486
we're all fine.

132
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,486
Yuzu, Karin, they're good.

133
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,086
And Dad's still his usual self.

134
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:42,119
Don't worry.

135
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,319
I'm still getting by.

136
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:44,419
I'll be all right.

137
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:51,952
So don't worry.

138
00:11:51,986 --> 00:11:56,486
-How can you be escaping
the nightmare of Saiga?

139
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,886
How can he have such power?

140
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:03,252
-I have to get going.

141
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:04,286
Everyone is waiting.

142
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:08,586
Listen to me, Mom.

143
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:11,586
I'm sorry that I couldn't
protect you that day.

144
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:18,486
But I've always wanted
to tell you, thank you,

145
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,952
Mom, for protecting me.

146
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:37,619
Enough of this.

147
00:12:37,652 --> 00:12:39,719
Whatever gave you the idea
that you have the right

148
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:43,452
to mess with someone
else's memories?

149
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:46,252
[panting]

150
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:52,786
-You-- you insolent fool.

151
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,619
You're through.

00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:57,019
[shout]

00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:02,319
-Argh!

154
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:05,886
-Back off!

155
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:24,652
Gah!

156
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:35,486
[groan]

157
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,719
-What?

158
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:48,752
Are you-- It looks like
your sword's consuming you.

159
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:56,186
-My Bakkoti-- as long as
I feed it spirit energy,

160
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:57,586
its strength is limitless.

161
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:00,052
My pain is unimportant.

162
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:03,619
What is happening to my
body right now is expected.

163
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:05,552
-You must stop this!

164
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:09,152
-You think I will
take orders from you?

165
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:10,452
-Fine, then.

166
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:13,052
So who is ordering
you to do this?

167
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,419
-The Kasumioji clan.

168
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:18,119
I honor them, and will
protect their fine name.

169
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:23,886
From ancient times, the
proud Kasumioji clan

00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,819
distinguished itself admirably
by furnishing the royal family

171
00:14:27,852 --> 00:14:29,452
with the strongest of swords.

172
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:31,319
And for many years,
my people have

173
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:33,219
acted as assassins
for their clan.

174
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,619
We lived as their shadows.

175
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:38,086
[roar]

176
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,052
-Ah!

177
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,486
-Hey, who are you guys?

178
00:14:58,486 --> 00:14:59,919
[scream]

179
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,319
HANZA: To safeguard the
hidden art of our swordmaking,

180
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:14,219
we even fought against
the 13 Court Guard Squads.

181
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:16,086
Even though it was
strictly forbidden,

182
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:22,186
we get did all for one purpose--
to protect the Kasumioji clan.

183
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:25,219
For decades, that has been
the reason for our existence.

184
00:15:25,252 --> 00:15:26,452
To serve them.

185
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:32,086
I fought for their clan
in countless battles,

186
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:35,619
acting on their behalf,
cheating death so many times.

187
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:43,986
And now, I have acquired
this awesome power.

188
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:47,986
Power that only a chosen few
are worthy enough to be granted!

189
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:51,352
-And you really believe
you're one of the chosen?

190
00:15:51,386 --> 00:15:52,352
-That's right.

191
00:15:52,386 --> 00:16:03,852
But you-- you ruined everything.

192
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:06,252
-If your real purpose
is as you say, just

193
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:10,952
to protect the Kasumioji clan,
why did you attack Rurichiyo?

194
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:14,586
-Because the weak have no
right to carry on the Kasumioji

195
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:16,619
legacy.

196
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:17,986
-She's only a child.

197
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:26,219
Rurichiyo is scared, terrified.

198
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:30,086
Even when she smiles,
she's filled with fear.

199
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:33,852
What she wants is
only to be free.

200
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:37,186
-The princess of the
Kasumioji clan has no freedom.

201
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:40,486
-That's not something you
have the right to decide!

202
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,452
-You have nothing
to say about this!

203
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:58,052
[shout]

204
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:07,952
-Ah?

205
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,419
[groan]

206
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,486
-So now, at last, I
see your true power.

207
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,452
Interesting.

208
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:25,952
Argh!

209
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:40,619
Damn!

210
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:52,119
-Getsuga Tensho!

211
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:03,819
[groan]

212
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:04,319
-Not yet!

213
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:18,252
Ha ha ha ha ha!

214
00:18:18,286 --> 00:18:19,586
I cannot lose.

215
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:22,686
The power of the chosen
will see to that.

216
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,219
Saiga!

217
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:26,286
-You've got to stop this!

218
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,819
All you're choosing is to die!

219
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:31,319
-Now you're spewing nonsense.

220
00:18:31,352 --> 00:18:33,319
Gah!

221
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:34,386
-Listen to me.

222
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:36,952
Your sword is consuming you.

223
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:38,952
-Don't be ridiculous.

224
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,652
Ah!

225
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:46,052
-Can you see what's happening?

226
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:50,086
You're being eaten
alive by that thing.

227
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,219
-Just shut up, Soul Reaper.

228
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:53,419
You know nothing.

229
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,286
My power is limitless.

230
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:59,419
This Bakkoto is the instrument
that will destroy you, not me!

231
00:18:59,452 --> 00:18:59,919
-Wait!

232
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:08,819
-Ah-- urk-- agh!

233
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,219
-That guy was insane.

234
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:27,852
MAN: Yeah, no, I get it, yeah.

235
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:29,219
-I said it's impossible.

236
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,486
-Sure sounds like it,
but stranger things--

237
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,486
-Morning, sir.

238
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,752
Mr. Kibune.

239
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:35,652
-Oh?

240
00:19:35,686 --> 00:19:36,586
Yes, good morning.

241
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,286
-Should we ask someone else?

242
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,352
-Let's go ask Lieutenant
Hisagi for advice.

243
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,219
-Third Seat Kibune?

244
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:48,986
Where's he going?

245
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:11,619
Hm?

246
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:14,519
-This is the Kasumioji clan.

247
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:16,552
Why is Third Seat Kibune here?

248
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:23,186
-Aw.

249
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:26,286
Trying to find a bathroom
around here is really tough.

250
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,986
It's almost like
this place is a maze.

251
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,352
It makes it hard to
remember which way to go.

252
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:32,986
Uh-oh.

253
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:35,319
-Looking for
something, Master Shu?

254
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:38,152
-Uh, looking for the bathroom.

255
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:40,652
-You two, get over here.

256
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:41,886
-Uh--

257
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,919
-Both you men know Lord
Kannogi is the master here,

258
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,586
and he is not to be left alone.

259
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,119
-Won't happen again, sir.

260
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:50,252
-Escort him.

261
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:51,252
-Right.

262
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:52,652
-Could they escort
me to a bathroom?

263
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,586
I could sure use one!

264
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:55,086
Aw!

265
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:03,986
-Hm?

266
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:06,986
[panting]

267
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:08,852
-Oh, I see.

268
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:10,886
So Genga is dead.

269
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,186
What about Hanza and Jinnai?

270
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:14,086
-Yes.

271
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,186
They're dead, as well.

272
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:20,886
-They should have
thought things out.

273
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:27,752
-This blade is quite taxing.

274
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,452
The power of the Bakkoto was too
much for Hanza and my brothers.

275
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:34,519
Only I survived.

276
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:36,886
Next time, I will take
Nukui Hanza's place.

277
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:43,486
-Step down.

278
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,286
-But why?

279
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,886
-I cannot be bothered
with the likes of you.

280
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,019
-You!

281
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:53,119
-You are nothing but a fool.

282
00:21:58,819 --> 00:21:59,286
Argh!

283
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:26,498
[theme music]

284
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:49,477
ICHIGO: Orihime, how are
Uryu and the others doing?

285
00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:51,144
ORIHIME: They're all
recovering and doing

286
00:23:51,177 --> 00:23:53,111
fine, but for some
reason, passed out.

287
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:54,277
ICHIGO: They passed out?

288
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:54,977
Why?

289
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:56,077
ORIHIME: I don't know.

290
00:23:56,111 --> 00:23:57,877
I just served them a
mix of tea soaked rice

291
00:23:57,911 --> 00:23:59,377
with bean paste and
tuna fish flakes

292
00:23:59,411 --> 00:24:00,411
to make them feel better.

293
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:03,944
ICHIGO: Well, no wonder!
