[theme music]

2
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:42,853
-Tsubaki.

3
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:43,853
Not this time.

4
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:47,320
Koten Zanshun, I reject.

5
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:48,786
[screaming]

6
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,286
-Tsubaki.

7
00:01:51,513 --> 00:01:52,613
-Stupid girl.

8
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:56,646
What were you thinking,
hesitating like that?

9
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,213
-I have never seen a
move like that before,

10
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:03,546
and yet I sense no murderous
intent behind your attack.

11
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:05,846
Although you might be able
to kill certain Hollows

12
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,846
with that type of
move, I assure you

13
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,146
it will have no effect
whatsoever on soul reapers.

14
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:19,613
This is a battleground, and
by you not fighting to kill,

15
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:21,546
you'll never succeed
in stopping anyone.

16
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,779
-If you want to face an
attack with an intent to kill,

17
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:32,879
then why not fight me?

18
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:35,779
I'm sure you'll find
it here in my bow.

19
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:37,979
It's a thrill I'd
love to give you.

20
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:42,713
-Ah.

21
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,679
Very interesting.

22
00:02:44,713 --> 00:02:48,879
So I guess that
makes you a Quincy.

23
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:49,879
-You're right about that.

24
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:54,913
-Uryu's bow, it's totally
different from the one

25
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:57,846
I saw before, both in
its appearance and even

26
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,479
its spiritual pressure.

27
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,479
And that glove.

28
00:03:02,513 --> 00:03:05,713
He must have been practicing
in order to use it properly.

29
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:11,746
-One uses unfamiliar skills.

30
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:16,346
The other is a Quincy, and
both employ projectile weapons.

31
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,446
And you have both come to this
very place at this very time

32
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,679
to fight against me.

33
00:03:20,713 --> 00:03:22,913
So do I call this an
amazing coincidence

34
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:24,613
or a brilliant twist of fate?

35
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:29,346
Either way I must show you
the true form of my Zanpakuto.

36
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:33,113
Time to spread your
wings, Tsunzakigarasu.

37
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,579
So what do you think?

38
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,113
Time to lament.

39
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:38,479
I am the fourth
seat of Squad Seven.

40
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:44,113
I am Jirobo Ikkanzaka also known
as Jirobo the slicing wind.

41
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:46,913
My nickname, Wind Scythe, proves
that I am the most skilled when

42
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:49,246
it comes to dealing
with projectile weapons.

43
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:52,179
See how my countless
blades dance through space.

44
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:54,779
No one who has seen
my attack has lived.

45
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:56,646
So tell me, do you
like what you've

46
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:59,113
seen of my Tsunzakigarasu.

47
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:01,679
You can't even follow them
with your eyes, can you?

48
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:03,579
They are a prelude to
your glorious death?

49
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:08,879
-Interesting.

50
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:13,646
Unlike the outside world, in
here the most skilled fighter

51
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,313
seems unfortunately
to be the one who

52
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:19,379
ends up the most
long winded whiner.

53
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:20,646
-Absurd.

54
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,346
That was just a fluke.

55
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,779
You're too cocky
for your own good.

56
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:24,946
-You still don't understand.

57
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:31,913
If you're supposed to be
the most skilled one dealing

58
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:34,013
with flying weapons,
then I'd think

59
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:35,713
about getting a new nickname.

60
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:37,679
Because where flying
weapons are concerned,

61
00:04:37,713 --> 00:04:40,179
I seem to be the better man.

62
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:44,146
Unfortunately, Uryu Wind Scythe
doesn't have as nice a ring

63
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:47,046
to it.

64
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,113
-What have you done to my hand?

65
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:51,646
I can't move my fingers.

66
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,579
-Amazing.

67
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:56,146
Uryu is so much
more powerful now

68
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:58,479
compared to that
time he was battling

69
00:04:58,513 --> 00:04:59,513
Hollows alongside Ichigo.

70
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:01,913
He's become a completely
different person.

71
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:04,913
-I expect you are the
one with regrets now.

72
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:07,846
As a fellow practitioner
of flying weaponry,

73
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,746
you must wish you
hadn't met me today.

74
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:13,779
-How dare you insult me,
you insolent little brat.

75
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,679
I'll kill you.

76
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:20,646
What?

77
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:24,613
-You do realize that I missed
you intentionally this time.

78
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:29,313
And also that I won't
miss the next time.

79
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:30,546
-Incredible.

80
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,246
The power.

81
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,613
As hard as it is
for me to admit it,

82
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:37,046
the accuracy and speed
of your attack technique

83
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,579
far surpasses my own ability.

84
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:42,546
I never dreamed I would meet
such a skillful practitioner

85
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:44,546
only to fail.

86
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:48,113
With just a single stroke,
you have defeated me utterly.

87
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:48,779
Torture me.

88
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:49,746
Destroy me.

89
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,179
Do whatever you want to me.

90
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:56,313
Why do you not shoot
me and finish it?

91
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:59,379
Can it be that you
intend to let me live?

92
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:00,013
-Huh.

93
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:01,413
I am a Quincy.

94
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:04,913
Believe me I have no desire to
show mercy to any soul reaper.

95
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:08,313
But I don't make a habit out
of bullying the weak either.

96
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:11,713
Now quit your sniveling
and get out of here.

97
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:16,179
Hurry before I change my mind.

98
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:19,579
-It would seem that you
are a kind-hearted soul.

99
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,046
Too bad-- for you that is.

100
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:26,313
Now what?

101
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:27,913
-As I suspected.

102
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:29,746
You thought that since
you couldn't beat me,

103
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,446
you would attack the
girl, didn't you?

104
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,546
Or were you thinking you
would just take her hostage?

105
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:35,213
-No.

106
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:36,946
How'd you know that?

107
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,246
-As I said, I don't make a
habit of bullying the weak,

108
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,046
but I certainly
don't mind exposing

109
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,113
cowards for what they are.

110
00:06:45,146 --> 00:06:47,579
From the moment we
first encountered you,

111
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:51,046
you were actually
targeting Orihime, not me.

112
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,179
Most warriors would
find it beneath them

113
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:56,646
to attack a girl, especially
when she wasn't looking.

114
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:59,879
No honorable person,
no one with any pride

115
00:06:59,913 --> 00:07:01,813
would ever do such a thing.

116
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:03,346
You coward.

117
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:06,613
I bid you farewell
and good riddance.

118
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:08,579
You're not even worth lamenting.

119
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:20,813
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
Thank you, Uryu.

120
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:21,779
-Ugh.

121
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,613
There's nothing to thank me for.

122
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,913
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Oh
yeah, it was nothing.

123
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,413
Right.

124
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:30,879
Did you kill him?

125
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:31,713
URYU (OFFSCREEN): No.

126
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:33,179
He's still alive.

127
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:36,079
I just destroyed his soul
chain and Hakusui soul sleep,

128
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:38,546
the spots that govern
spiritual powers.

129
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:43,213
He's going to live, but his
spiritual powers are no more.

130
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:46,379
When he awakens, as a
result of this battle,

131
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:48,913
he'll no longer
be a soul reaper.

132
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:50,279
And that's good enough for now.

133
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:53,613
Shall we go?

134
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:56,113
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): OK.

135
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:59,979
I remember something Yoruichi
once told me about Quincys,

136
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,013
that in battle they gather the
spiritual particles around them

137
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:05,013
and use them to fight.

138
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:08,246
I think that's what
Uryu uses the glove for.

139
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,113
The overwhelming
power it gives him

140
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:13,046
must be the reason he went
off to train on his own.

141
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,546
Uryu didn't want to
risk harming any of us

142
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,013
until he was able to master it.

143
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:21,679
And to think he mastered it to
such a degree in only ten days

144
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:23,546
all by himself.

145
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:25,413
Uryu is really incredible.

146
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:28,313
But it does make me
wonder, what did I

147
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:29,679
accomplish in those ten days?

148
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,946
Oh, thanks.

149
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:35,979
-Don't mention it.

150
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:41,979
-I haven't done much.

151
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:44,013
TATSUKI (OFFSCREEN): Orihime.

152
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:45,346
Hang in there, Orihime.

153
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,513
Remember you promised
me you would.

154
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:49,013
-I remember.

155
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:51,179
Thanks for reminding
me, Tatsuki.

156
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:52,346
-What's wrong, Orihime?

157
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,313
Why are you acting so strange?

158
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:55,213
Did you get hurt in
the battle somehow?

159
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:55,713
-No. no.

160
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:56,379
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:57,079
It's nothing, Uryu.

162
00:08:57,113 --> 00:08:58,379
I'm just fine really.

163
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,479
My eyes just got teary-eyed
there for a second.

164
00:09:00,513 --> 00:09:01,946
You know how that
happens sometimes

165
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:03,479
when you look into the sun.

166
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:06,513
It can even make you sneeze,
which is really weird.

167
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,813
But they're not even connected.

168
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:09,246
I mean what is that all about?

169
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,679
Well, we'd better
get moving, Uryu.

170
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:14,079
We've got places to go.

171
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:15,046
-Ugh.

172
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:15,913
Orihime.

173
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:17,379
-What is it?

174
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:19,346
-Are you sure you're all right?

175
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:20,813
-Of course.

176
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:21,846
Why?

177
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,546
-No reason.

178
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:24,913
-Ah!

179
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:27,413
Why is it that no matter
where we go I'm always the one

180
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,979
being chased all over the place?

181
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:30,679
-Come back here, you
sideburned clown.

182
00:09:30,713 --> 00:09:31,979
-You're going to get a beating.

183
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:32,913
-For being so ugly.

184
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:34,279
-Who you calling ugly?

185
00:09:34,313 --> 00:09:36,679
The soul reaper with the funky
eyelashes is a real looker,

186
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:37,913
but that's not my fault.

187
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:39,846
And you guys are no
fashion models yourselves.

188
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,546
-Oh, you're going to
pay for that crack.

189
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,579
-We're going to use your
head for a door knocker.

190
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:46,613
-A really ugly door knocker.

191
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:47,846
-Ichigo.

192
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,046
Just in time.

193
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:51,513
I could really use some
back-up right about now.

194
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:54,179
-Ganju.

195
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:56,046
-You got a mob chasing you too.

196
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,279
Fight them there, Ichigo.

197
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:58,846
I got enough problems already.

198
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,646
And quit waving
at me, you idiot.

199
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,146
You're only making them madder.

200
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:03,213
Back off, I said.

201
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:04,546
You're bringing them toward me.

202
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:10,913
-Ganju, duck.

203
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:11,879
-Huh.

204
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:16,913
[grunting]

205
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:18,213
-This is Iemura reporting.

206
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:21,179
Squad Four relief crew and
Groups One, Six, and 14

207
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:22,579
are approaching enemy position.

208
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:25,146
Captain Iemura over and out.

209
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:25,746
Come on.

210
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:26,546
Let's move out.

211
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:28,246
This is not a drill.

212
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,013
-(GROUP) Yes, sir.

213
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,879
-What are you doing swinging an
overgrown blade so close to me,

214
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:35,879
you moron?

215
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:37,279
You almost took my
freaking head off.

216
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:38,113
-Shut up.

217
00:10:38,146 --> 00:10:39,113
I told you to duck, didn't I?

218
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:40,579
-What good is a
warning if it comes

219
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,746
at the same time as the thing
you're getting warned about?

220
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,746
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
If you didn't

221
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,013
have the reflexes
of a banana slug.

222
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:47,213
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): Just be
more careful, you idiot.

223
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,879
Yeah, but right now, we've got
other things to worry about.

224
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:53,679
They backed off after your
little surprise attack,

225
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:56,646
but I have a feeling that isn't
going to work a second time.

226
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,713
And anyway, we're
heavily outnumbered.

227
00:10:58,746 --> 00:10:59,946
We're going to need a miracle.

228
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:04,846
-I'm totally late.

229
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,713
I'm going to be in big trouble
if I don't get there soon.

230
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:09,379
Maybe I should just
pretend that I never

231
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:12,513
got the message in the
first place and go home.

232
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,546
But then what do I say if
Iemura asks me where I've been?

233
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:17,479
Where is everyone anyway?

234
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:19,013
Huh.

235
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,146
I know.

236
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,179
I'll ask these guys if
they've seen my group.

237
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,146
Excuse me, everybody,
but by any chance

238
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:26,779
have you see Squad
Four Group-- oh!

239
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:27,279
Whoa!

240
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:28,279
-Hey!

241
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,046
-Ow!

242
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:33,279
[grunting and complaining]

243
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:33,779
-Ah!

244
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:39,046
That didn't work out
exactly like I planned it.

245
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,513
-Ichigo, I think I have an idea
how we can get ourselves out

246
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:43,446
of this place.

247
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,846
-Is that right?

248
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,246
Me too.

249
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,513
-So you guys are trying to find
a way to get out of this place.

250
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:54,346
But why would you be trying
to get away from here?

251
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,446
Unless of course, you happen
to be the Ryoka everyone

252
00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:00,013
is so worried about.

253
00:12:00,046 --> 00:12:01,713
-You back off and
let us out of here.

254
00:12:01,746 --> 00:12:03,213
-Or else your little
friend is going

255
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:04,779
to be missing some pieces.

256
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:05,846
-Ah!

257
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,613
But I faint at the
sight of my own blood.

258
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,913
-I've been running
forever, Yachiru.

259
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:13,279
Where are you leading me?

260
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:14,179
-Don't worry.

261
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,979
This is definitely
the right way.

262
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:17,346
I think.

263
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:18,579
-Did you just say "you think"?

264
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,546
-Oh, don't be grouchy.

265
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,046
Hey, turn right up here.

266
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,646
-You better be
correct this time.

267
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,846
-All you do is complain.

268
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,879
If you don't like my
directions, then forget it.

269
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,146
Just go where you want to go.

270
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:30,679
-OK.

271
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:31,613
I'll turn right.

272
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:32,979
YACHIRU (OFFSCREEN):
Good for you.

273
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:33,746
This is it.

274
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:34,879
I'm almost positive.

275
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:36,013
-Almost positive?

276
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,890
-Back off, you punks,
and let us through.

277
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:47,390
-Or else your little
friend is going

278
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:48,657
to be missing some pieces.

279
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,490
-Ah!

280
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:50,624
Do what they say.

281
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:53,424
Do what they say, or
else I'll be, oh--

282
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:59,257
-Not the reaction I expected.

283
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,524
-Maybe they didn't understand.

284
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:02,924
Try again.

285
00:13:02,957 --> 00:13:04,090
-If you say so.

286
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:05,290
-Listen, riff raff.

287
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:06,824
Stand aside and let us through.

288
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:09,624
-Or else my blade is going to
take the life of your friend

289
00:13:09,657 --> 00:13:10,657
here.

290
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,890
Come on, you sound like
you're scared of us.

291
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:13,390
-Yes.

292
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:14,090
Please.

293
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:15,757
I think they mean it.

294
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,590
-Very strange.

295
00:13:17,624 --> 00:13:19,490
-What the hell are
you idiots doing?

296
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:20,657
-Huh.

297
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,357
-What does it look like?

298
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,557
We took a hostage.

299
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,690
-I see.

300
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:26,957
And does he look like
one of us to you?

301
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,057
-He-- who are you?

302
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,690
-We're all on the same side.

303
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:33,990
But I'm Squad Four,
and they're Squad 11.

304
00:13:34,024 --> 00:13:34,824
-So?

305
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:35,957
What difference does that make?

306
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,190
-Ha.

307
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:39,824
I guess these bumpkins
really are from the outside.

308
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:41,857
I shouldn't bother
explaining it to you,

309
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,557
but it's much too insulting
to have you lump us together.

310
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,390
So listen up.

311
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:49,290
There are 13 guard
squads assigned

312
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:50,590
to protect the Seireitei.

313
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:53,590
We of Squad 11 are led
by the strongest captain.

314
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,490
As such, we are the strongest
unit and always the first

315
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:57,190
into battle.

316
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:58,690
SQUAD (OFFSCREEN): Yeah!

317
00:13:58,724 --> 00:14:02,024
-I just noticed these guys all
have weird hair except you.

318
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:02,990
What's your squad again?

319
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:04,390
-It's Squad Four.

320
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:05,824
-Is that a good one?

321
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:06,824
-Well, Sure.

322
00:14:06,857 --> 00:14:08,524
Squad Four is a
great squad to be in.

323
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,690
SHINIGAMI GUARD #1 (OFFSCREEN):
Don't make me laugh.

324
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,924
Squad Four is just the
rear echelon service

325
00:14:12,957 --> 00:14:15,524
that provides first
aid for minor injuries.

326
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,690
That's where all the
loser wimps who can't even

327
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:18,857
wield a sword get assigned.

328
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,724
SHINIGAMI GUARD #2
(OFFSCREEN): That's right.

329
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:22,957
The rest of us can't
stand the little weasels.

330
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,090
SHINIGAMI GUARD #1 (OFFSCREEN):
So whatever you do,

331
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,424
don't confuse them with us.

332
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:28,157
Because when it
comes to Squad Four--

333
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,490
SQUAD (OFFSCREEN): We hate them.

334
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:30,524
SHINIGAMI GUARD #2
(OFFSCREEN): And if you

335
00:14:30,557 --> 00:14:31,924
want to kill this
one, go right ahead.

336
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:34,124
We don't mind.

337
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:35,524
-Wait a minute.

338
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:37,524
Don't you think it's kinda cruel
recommending death for someone

339
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:39,657
just because they have
different responsibilities?

340
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,257
-Hey, that almost makes sense.

341
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,090
Looks like we're in for a fight.

342
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:50,724
-What the hell was that?

343
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,490
-I don't know, and I don't care.

344
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:57,990
What counts is that it just cut
the enemy's numbers in half.

345
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:09,457
[grunting and fighting noises]

346
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,857
-I thought I sensed
Ichigo's spiritual pressure.

347
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,957
It looks like I just missed him.

348
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,324
-Hey, you there.

349
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:19,190
Who are you and what do you know
about all these bodies lying

350
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:20,424
here?

351
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:21,857
-And what's with that stupid
outfit you're wearing?

352
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,090
-Hey, are you with the
intruders we saw earlier?

353
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:27,790
-Intruders you saw earlier?

354
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:29,990
Probably, yes.

355
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:31,890
-If you think you can
answer us in riddles

356
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:33,624
and get away with it,
you're about to pay

357
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:35,090
for that with your
life, intruder.

358
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:37,924
-You're going to get cut
to shreds in five minutes.

359
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:42,024
-I am sorry, but I'm afraid I
cannot give you that much time.

360
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:42,724
-Uh, what?

361
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:44,524
-You crazy or something?

362
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:47,757
-This won't take five
minutes, only two.

363
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,057
[cackling]

364
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,757
-So you're going to
refuse to cooperate, eh?

365
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:09,524
Well, we'll see how long
that lasts, Ikkaku Madarame.

366
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:12,290
-Squad 12 Captain, I'm
sorry, but I must protest.

367
00:16:12,324 --> 00:16:14,257
Interrogation of
patients is strictly

368
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,590
prohibited in the hospital wing.

369
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:17,390
MAYURI (OFFSCREEN):
Mind your own business.

370
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:18,224
-Master Mayuri.

371
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,090
-You shut your mouth too, Nemu.

372
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:23,790
Or maybe you'd like me to have
you pulled to pieces again.

373
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:24,757
-No, sir.

374
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,857
Please forgive me, master.

375
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,390
-It's not that I won't talk.

376
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:30,490
-Huh?

377
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:32,624
-It's just that I really
don't know anything.

378
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,990
I don't know who
the Ryoka are, and I

379
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:37,757
have no idea what
they're planning to do.

380
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,890
-So what you're telling me is,
even though you met and fought

381
00:16:40,924 --> 00:16:43,290
against these mysterious
invaders in the street,

382
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:46,157
you were defeated in battle and
then just retreated like a dog

383
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,524
without learning a single
shred of useful information?

384
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:51,257
-I'm afraid so.

385
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,824
It may seem strange to you, but
sometimes battle is like that.

386
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:59,357
I've not seen this enemy's
face nor heard his voice.

387
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,090
So I'm afraid I have
no information for you.

388
00:17:03,124 --> 00:17:05,024
-You lie.

389
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,524
And now you shall
receive punishment

390
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:10,057
appropriate to your failure.

391
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:14,357
-Interesting.

392
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,024
Since when, I wonder,
are you entitled

393
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:20,290
to discipline members of squads
other than your own, Mayuri?

394
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:20,790
-Zaraki.

395
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,457
Well, since his captain
is here, there's

396
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,424
no need for me to continue
this interrogation.

397
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:33,290
Good luck getting anything
out of him, Zaraki.

398
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:35,724
Don't just stand there,
Nemu, you useless dullard.

399
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:38,957
Let's go.

400
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,590
-Hm.

401
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:43,324
-Captain.

402
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:45,957
-Well, you certainly
got yourself beaten up.

403
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,657
IKKAKU (OFFSCREEN):
Nice of you to visit.

404
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,124
-Oh, we didn't plan to.

405
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:50,924
We just got lost.

406
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:52,857
-I see your lieutenant
is here too.

407
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,590
-We were trying to
find the intruders,

408
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:57,090
but Kenny here was having some
trouble following directions.

409
00:17:57,124 --> 00:17:59,024
So how are you feeling, baldy?

410
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:01,124
-I asked you not to
call me that anymore.

411
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:01,824
-Oh.

412
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:03,224
Should it be Mr. Baldy?

413
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:04,624
-You little brat.

414
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:07,024
YACHIRU (OFFSCREEN): How
about Mr. Shiny Baldy then?

415
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:09,624
-Is it true that you
were defeated in battle?

416
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:11,357
-Yes, that's true.

417
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,390
I'm ashamed to admit it, but
I was defeated by the enemy

418
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:16,524
and then allowed to live.

419
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,490
-Is he strong?

420
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:19,024
-Yes.

421
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,090
Very strong.

422
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:22,224
He appears to be a soul reaper.

423
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:25,690
He wears a shihakusho, has
short orange colored hair,

424
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:29,624
and carries a sword as long as
his body with no guard or grip.

425
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:33,057
By now he is headed towards
the Shishinro repentance cell.

426
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,990
-He shouldn't be hard to find.

427
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:36,690
-I gave him your
description, and I

428
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:39,724
told him to be on the
lookout for you, captain.

429
00:18:39,757 --> 00:18:42,957
My warning about you did
not seem too concern him.

430
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,690
Regardless of
where you meet him,

431
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,090
you will surely enjoy
an excellent battle.

432
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:49,857
He's strong now,
and from what I saw,

433
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,624
I believe his strength
is still growing, master.

434
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:55,257
By the time you
encounter him, it

435
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:59,557
seems likely that he
will be stronger still.

436
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,057
-Excellent.

437
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,057
And his name is--

438
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,024
-I am Hanataro Yamada.

439
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:09,090
-(BOTH) Dude, that
name is so lame.

440
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:10,290
-What are you talking about?

441
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:12,890
I like my name, and it
most certainly is not lame.

442
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:13,957
-Well, you're wrong.

443
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,924
Where I come from,
hana means flower,

444
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:17,657
and there's nothing
lamer than that.

445
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,490
You might as well
yourself Blossom.

446
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:20,724
-Hey, come on.

447
00:19:20,757 --> 00:19:23,090
-Why should we bother learning
the enemy's name anyway?

448
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:24,357
-But I--

449
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,457
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): And why
are you being so friendly

450
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,257
and introducing yourself
in the first place?

451
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,724
-That's a good question.

452
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:29,924
I don't really know why.

453
00:19:29,957 --> 00:19:31,257
-And here's another question.

454
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,490
What did you bring him for?

455
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:33,224
-I couldn't help it.

456
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:34,624
OK.

457
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:35,690
He was sitting there, and I just
picked him up and carried him

458
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:37,090
by accident.

459
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:37,624
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): How do you
pick something up by accident?

460
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:38,257
What are you?

461
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,557
A garbage man?

462
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,257
You just pick up whatever
you see lying on the ground?

463
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,090
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): Shut up.

464
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:42,924
You didn't notice him until now.

465
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:43,924
So what's the big deal?

466
00:19:43,957 --> 00:19:45,357
-This is useless,
you guys, please.

467
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,390
You've got to stop
fighting over me.

468
00:19:47,424 --> 00:19:49,190
-(BOTH) We are not
fighting over you.

469
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:50,224
-OK.

470
00:19:50,257 --> 00:19:51,457
But you need to keep
your voices down,

471
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,724
or you'll lead the
guards right to us.

472
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:56,257
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Anyone out there?

473
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,824
GANJU (OFFSCREEN):
All clear for now.

474
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:01,490
-We're still screwed.

475
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:03,390
Because even if that
bald guy I beat up

476
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:05,057
was telling the
truth about Rukia

477
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,524
being held in some white tower,
we still don't know where it is

478
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,957
or which road we need
to take to get there.

479
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,024
-Hey wait a minute.

480
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,790
What about this map?

481
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:16,090
This would help us avoid
running into any more captains

482
00:20:16,124 --> 00:20:17,624
out there.

483
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:19,957
If only it showed us
where the enemy was.

484
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,090
-This is a map?

485
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:23,557
It doesn't even have any
streets marked on it.

486
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,024
That's just stupid.

487
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:25,790
Huh.

488
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:26,557
What's this here?

489
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,724
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): Please.

490
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:29,590
-You idiot, you drew
this yourself didn't you.

491
00:20:29,624 --> 00:20:30,757
-It's better than nothing.

492
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,124
Where's your map, smart ass?

493
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:33,190
HANATARO (OFFSCREEN):
Uh, excuse me.

494
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:34,190
-Just stay out of this.

495
00:20:34,224 --> 00:20:35,257
Will you?

496
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,557
We're doing some serious
strategizing here.

497
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,157
-Why don't you
just beat it, kid?

498
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,990
You're not going to be
any use to us anyway.

499
00:20:40,024 --> 00:20:40,490
No offense.

500
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:41,857
-Good idea.

501
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,590
HANATARO (OFFSCREEN): It's Rukia
Kuchiki you're looking for,

502
00:20:43,624 --> 00:20:45,424
isn't it?

503
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:46,957
I thought so.

504
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,657
It all makes sense now.

505
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,557
The younger sister
of the Squad Six

506
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,490
captain currently being
held as a capital offender.

507
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:57,724
And that means the white
tower you were talking about

508
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,157
must be the repentance cell.

509
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:06,824
If you'll trust
me, I can help you.

510
00:21:06,857 --> 00:21:11,057
I know a hidden way
into that tower.

511
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,024
-Well, you sure seem
to be happy, Kenny.

512
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:15,024
-Is that so?

513
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:17,024
-Yeah, really happy.

514
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:19,557
Ever since you talked
to Ikkaku back there.

515
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,157
-I suppose you're right.

516
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,224
I am looking forward to this.

517
00:21:23,257 --> 00:21:25,657
This stranger survived
against Ichimaru.

518
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,390
He defeated Ikkaku.

519
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,224
And Ikkaku said he is
strong and will probably

520
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:31,690
become stronger still.

521
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,090
Where are you?

522
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:38,024
I, Kenpachi Zaraki,
am waiting for you.

523
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:39,324
Come out, Ichigo Kurosaki.

524
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:56,427
[theme music]

525
00:21:56,427 --> 00:22:50,694
[theme music]

526
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:51,460
KON NARRATING: Yo.

527
00:22:51,494 --> 00:22:52,227
How you doing?

528
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,727
It's everyone's idol, Kon.

529
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,794
Why isn't it my turn yet?

530
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:56,594
I've been ready and
waiting over here.

531
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:57,794
Hey, are you listening to me?

532
00:22:57,827 --> 00:22:58,860
NARRATOR: If you make
too much of a fuss,

533
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:00,294
you may never get your turn.

534
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:01,060
KON NARRATING: All right.

535
00:23:01,094 --> 00:23:01,594
All right.

536
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:02,994
I'll behave.

537
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:06,694
Hey you, Squad Nine captain, are
you mocking me with that hair?
