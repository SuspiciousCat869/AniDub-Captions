00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:50,768
NARRATOR: Ichigo
and his friends were

3
00:01:50,802 --> 00:01:54,202
on the brink of being defeated
by the formidable Espadas when

4
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:56,668
the captains of the
13 court guard squads

5
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,902
arrived in Hueco Mundo.

6
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:01,268
Under the orders of
head captain Yamamoto,

7
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:05,335
the captains quickly challenged
the Espadas to battle.

8
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:08,135
Byakuya and Mayuri won
their respective fights,

9
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:14,068
but Kenpachi was still locked in
fierce combat against Nnoitra.

10
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:16,668
Nnoitra's Hierro
skin was considered

11
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:19,235
the hardest of all the
Espadas, and Kenpachi

12
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:21,202
struggled to cut through it.

13
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:24,368
However, after watching
Nnoitra dodge an attack,

14
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:26,602
Kenpachi noticed a
weakness in his defense

15
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:28,402
and fought with renewed vigor.

16
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:31,635
Nnoitra, fuming with
anger, attacked Kenpachi

17
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:34,168
with all his strength and
cut off his eye patch.

18
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:45,135
-[sigh] You fool.

19
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:47,635
You never should have
ripped off my eye patch.

20
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,035
After that, I can't hold back.

21
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:52,902
You look alive.

22
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:55,735
Or is it just that
you haven't died yet?

23
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:01,935
-You jackass.

24
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:04,402
Can't you see?

25
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:07,302
There's no chance I'm
going to die here.

26
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:10,068
I am strong.

27
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:12,968
I am not going to die here!

28
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:15,202

Sounded so pretentious.

I never used it.

136

But let me tell you.

137
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:17,935
There was one thing
I took away from it.

138
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:32,902
An important
lesson-- that a sword

139
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:34,935
becomes much more
powerful when it's

140
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:39,768
swung with both hands
instead of just one.

00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:10,203
Hold on!

173
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:14,336
-What do you want?

174
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,269
Quit bugging me.

175
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:19,169
-Where do you
think you're going?

176
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:22,903
This thing is nowhere near over.

177
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:24,269
-Are you dumb?

178
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:27,169
I believe it just ended.

179
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:29,603
And I'm not about to
finish off somebody

180
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,103
who can't even fight back.

181
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:37,703
-Oh, is that so?

182
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:39,569
Then I'll say it again.

183
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:41,736
This thing isn't over yet.

184
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:47,669
Because in case you
haven't noticed,

185
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:49,403
I can still fight you back.

186
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:00,503
What's wrong?

187
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:08,769
Come on.

188
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:11,169
Say something.

189
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:13,169
Or are you just too damn scared?

190
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:18,469
Answer me.

191
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:20,536
Are you scared of
me, soul reaper?

192
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:31,669
-Puh.

193
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:33,536
What a pain in the ass.

194
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,536
Fine, then.

195
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:40,236
Bring it on.

196
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:08,203
-[scream]

197
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:11,703
-Yeah.

198
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:19,469
NELLIEL: Why?

199
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:33,669
The annihilation of this colony
was not part of your orders.

200
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:36,203
Why did you massacre them?

201
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:38,203
-Why don't you shut up?

202
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:41,736
After all, nobody told
me not to kill them.

203
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:46,736
-Lord Aizen exact orders were
to find the Vasto Lordes.

204
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:49,269
He never authorized you
to do any mass killings.

205
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,536
-You know, not everyone
agrees with every order

206
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:57,336
Lord Aizen dishes out.

207
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:00,203
Those that defy us
are renegade elements.

208
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:05,203
Eliminating benefits
Lord Aizen, doesn't it?

209
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:09,103
NELLIEL: You honestly
did this for Lord Aizen?

210
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:11,569
-[snickering]

211
00:17:11,603 --> 00:17:13,269
Doesn't it look that way to you?

212
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:17,036
[screaming]

213
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,436
[maniacal laughter]

214
00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:31,369
Heh.

215
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:33,969
Besides, if I could kill
them off that easily,

216
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:37,469
they couldn't have been
ranked Vasto Lordes.

217
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:40,869
I think I was within my orders.

218
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:42,603
You're just getting
all teary-eyed

219
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:45,803
because 100 or 200 hollows
were killed, aren't you?

220
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:48,503
You're just soft.

221
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:52,903
-I suggest you think
before you speak, Nnoitra.

222
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:55,036
The only difference between
us and those hollows

223
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:58,803
is that we were lucky enough
to evolve beyond that stage.

224
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:01,969
-Oh, you disapprove?

225
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:06,669
Then come at me-- if you think
you've got a chance, that is.

226
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:10,969
-You amaze me.

227
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:18,369
Even after becoming an Espada,
you're still just a child.

228
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:21,803
-What was that?

229
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:22,369
Hey!

230
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:23,336
Get back here!

231
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:30,136
I will not lose!

232
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:34,103
There is no way I can lose!

233
00:18:35,677 --> 00:18:39,717
I am-- I am--

234
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,297
What-- why?

235
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,070
Why did you save me?

236
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:04,337
-I didn't save you.

237
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,670
I merely stopped
your suicidal actions

238
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:08,237
so we wouldn't lose an Espada.

239
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,770
-Nelliel.

240
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:18,670
I truly do hate you.

241
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:23,070
But surely you must
already know that by now.

242
00:19:23,104 --> 00:19:25,570
So answer me why.

243
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:27,770
Why do you keep
following me around?

244
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:39,770
-That's simple.

245
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:45,404
It's because you are
much weaker than I am.

246
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:56,904
NNOITRA (VOICEOVER):
Don't be ridiculous.

247
00:19:56,937 --> 00:19:59,837
Everybody always feels
so much pity for me.

248
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:08,237
Don't they realize they're
only rubbing salt in my wounds?

249
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,470
I will show them no mercy.

250
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:16,137
Whether they're strong
or whether they're weak,

251
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:21,337
whether they're only a child
or some monstrous beast,

252
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:26,604
I will kill them with one
blow so that they'll never

253
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:28,404
have the strength
to pity me again.

254
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,951
I am--

255
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:44,031
I am--

256
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:57,705
-Nnoitra?

257
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:27,799
[theme music] [foreign language]

258
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:51,209
NNOITRA (VOICEOVER):
I was born to fight.

259
00:23:51,242 --> 00:23:55,309
Being pitied by others
is a sign of weakness.

260
00:23:55,342 --> 00:24:01,142
Nelliel, I'll show you that I am
stronger than you in every way.
