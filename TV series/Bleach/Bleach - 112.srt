But Ichigo's little
busy right now.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I always forget to do that.

00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:07,668
Allow me to introduce myself.

You should never

I'm really confused.

20
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:19,668
What happened?

I've seen you, my friend.

00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:01,202
Huh.

37
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:03,068
I see you haven't
lost your touch.

00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:04,635
That's good to know.

It's not like you.

-Oh, come now.

42
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:12,735
I don't want you to blame me
because your spirit energy has

43
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:13,468
withered away.

44
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:14,768
That would be upsetting.

-Ah, well, you
can stop worrying.

46
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:18,202
I wouldn't have blamed
you if it did wither up

all this time.

Some may have seen it that
way, but that's not my style.

Tell me.

50

How's it feel, being a Soul
Reaper once again after 20

-I see.

54
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:35,068
And do you feel better now?

55
00:04:35,102 --> 00:04:39,902
-(BREATHING OUT)
In some ways, yes.

56
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:42,835
Truth is, I never held a grudge
against that stupid Hollow

57
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,702
the first place.

58
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:47,202
If I'm being perfectly
honest with myself,

59
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:48,702
there's only one
thing I've really

60
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:51,835
regretted over
these past 20 years,

61
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:54,735
and that was my lack of power.

62
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:56,802
The fact that, in
spite of everything,

63
00:04:56,835 --> 00:04:58,835
I couldn't save
Masaki that night.

64
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,935
-Yeah, some things never change.

65
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:07,168
It seems your son is much
like you in that regard.

66
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:07,868
-What?

67
00:05:07,902 --> 00:05:09,135
You're wrong about that.

68
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:10,568
-Oh, I don't think so.

69
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,935
-I said, you're
wrong about that!

70
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:16,402
-Then I guess we'll just
have to agree to disagree.

71
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:18,902
While we're on the
subject of your son,

72
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:21,168
did you happen to notice--

73
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:23,235
-Yes.

74
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:25,902
It appears they've
made contact with him,

75
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:27,435
just as you
suspected they would.

76
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:35,968
The masked army, the Visoreds.

77
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,868
-The Visoreds?

78
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:40,268
-What are they?

79
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:43,235
-I don't know, but he
called them the Masked Army.

80
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,035
They're a lawless gang
of former Soul Reapers

81
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,535
who attempted to
obtain Hollow powers

82
00:05:57,568 --> 00:06:00,235
through the use of
forbidden techniques.

83
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:02,568
Their names and
whereabouts are unknown.

84
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:05,902
They've kept their
presence completely hidden.

85
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:08,335
They're obviously dangerous.

86
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,168
At the moment, the
only thing I do know

87
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:11,868
is that the Arrancars
and the Visoreds

88
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:13,502
don't appear to be
working together.

89
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:14,635
-That's helpful.

90
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:16,468
We don't need our enemies
forming alliances.

91
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,002
In one way, we're lucky.

92
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:20,302
The Visoreds don't
trust any Soul Reapers,

93
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:22,202
former or otherwise.

94
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,002
-So I've heard.

95
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:26,035
-In spite of their
hatred for Soul Reapers,

96
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:27,635
they made contact with your son.

97
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,268
That must mean they--

98
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:30,368
-Yeah.

99
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:32,068
If they're willing to
go to those lengths,

100
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:34,835
they must be preparing
for some kind of battle,

101
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:37,002
just like we are.

102
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:39,402
The only explanation
can be that they

103
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:43,102
must have noticed this sudden
change in the Arrancar as well.

104
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:46,935
-So that last Hollow, the one
who was found with the broken

105
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:48,568
mask--

106
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:50,668
-He called it Arrancar.

107
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,268
-Oh?

108
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:54,102
-Is that right?

109
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:57,668
-So, we should be
calling this an Arrancar?

110
00:06:57,702 --> 00:06:58,868
-Mmm.

111
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:01,468
As you already know, we've
been aware of Arrancars

112
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:07,035
popping up from time to
time, but this one, this one

113
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:08,268
surprised me.

114
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,068
This Arrancar's
level of development

115
00:07:10,102 --> 00:07:13,502
was beyond anything
I'd ever seen before.

116
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:17,002
The Arrancars have been stuck
at the same level for decades.

117
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:18,835
But this one had power.

118
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:20,835
Serious power.

119
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:22,668
Something's happened.

120
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:25,135
I didn't take much
to figure it out.

121
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:26,435
I guess you know what it means.

122
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:31,202
Sosuke Aizen must
have made a deal

123
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:33,202
with the would-be Arrancars.

124
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:35,435
He's going to help them
achieve their goal.

125
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:37,935
It's the same goal
he's been chasing.

126
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:41,068
He's trying to create
a true Arrancar using

127
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:43,468
the power of the Hogyoku.

128
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:44,402
-Ehh.

129
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:46,668
Well, according to
my calculations,

130
00:07:46,702 --> 00:07:50,335
I figured it would take
another year for the Hogyoku

131
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:51,668
to reach full power.

132
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:55,802
-I think it's safe to say
that power isn't yet complete.

133
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:58,802
The Arrancar we encountered
was still flawed.

134
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:01,902
His power has surged, but
his spiritual pressure

135
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:04,402
is still imperfect.

136
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:06,768
He was probably a
prototype, sent here

137
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:09,368
to collect data on how well
he could fight at this level.

138
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,868
That's this level now,
but who knows how long.

139
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:17,502
The Hogyoku's power
is immeasurable.

140
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:20,102
There's no question Aizen
will perfect his prototype.

141
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,435
His research must be
very near completion.

142
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,802
Once he has
something that can be

143
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:25,668
used in the front
lines of battle,

144
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:29,402
he'll lead the true Arrancar
an army of Menos Grande

145
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:31,368
and they will conquer the world.

146
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:41,102
How do we fight back?

147
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:43,268
-We'll figure something out.

148
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:45,802
We just have to rise
to the occasion.

149
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:47,502
With the situation
the way it is,

150
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:51,768
everyone will be mobilizing
for war, friend and foe alike.

151
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:58,568
You, me, the Visoreds, and not
to mention the Soul Society.

152
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:01,802
Hey, someone's coming
in this direction.

153
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:03,202
-Eh?

154
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:05,802
I know this spiritual pressure.

155
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:09,135
-Yeah, it's your son, Ishin.

156
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:11,002
If he meets you like
this, I'm afraid it

157
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:13,035
will make things
difficult for you.

158
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:14,168
Listen up, everyone.

159
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:16,035
It's time for us to go home.

160
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:17,402
ALL: All right, we're leaving.

161
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:26,168
-I see.

162
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:27,002
Message received.

163
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:29,135
I'll leave immediately.

You are one of us, Ichigo.

But she didn't do
that, which is proof

It was to somehow recruit
me into your ranks!

reason to be here anymore.

been rough lately.

489
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:18,158
-Good morning to you,
Lieutenant Hisagi.

490
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:19,691
-And to you, my friend.

491
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,391
-That man was a member
of Squad Seven, right?

492
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:23,925
-Yeah, you have a good memory.

493
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,158
We became friends during
the Bount incident.

494
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:27,891
-I meant to tell
you, Tetsuzaemon

495
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,591
has you on his mind, and
not in a positive way.

496
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,558
He said something like,
certain Squad members

497
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:34,425
don't respect me as
much as they used to.

498
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,791
-Believe me, he doesn't need
to be worried about that.

499
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:39,258
-It's hard to believe people
used to respect him at all,

500
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,125
considering.

501
00:24:40,158 --> 00:24:41,525
-That's a pretty cool statement.

502
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:44,458
Aren't you worried
it'll get back to him?
