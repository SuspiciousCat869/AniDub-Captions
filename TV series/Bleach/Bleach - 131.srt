00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:51,215
NARRATOR: In preparation for
their show down with Sosuke

3
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:57,682
Aizen, Ichigo, Chad, and Uryu
have started their training.

4
00:01:57,715 --> 00:02:00,882
Rukia and Orihime have
headed to the Soul Society

5
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:05,082
in hopes of also
getting stronger.

6
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:08,382
Captain Histugaya's team have
remained in Karakura Town,

7
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:11,348
and to their surprise, an
Arrancar-like creature that

8
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,182
can continuously
replicate itself

9
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:15,915
began to appear randomly.

10
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:18,615
If they don't destroy the
original source creature,

11
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:21,115
the Soul Reapers fear
the mock Arrancar

12
00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:24,815
will continue to multiply
until its numbers become

13
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:26,548
overhwelming.

14
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:28,982
AKON: That's probably why the
mock Arrancar was attracted

15
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,048
to her in the first place.

16
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:33,348
Yoi Toyokawa is a clone.

17
00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:35,882
NARRATOR: Yui was used as
bait by the mock Arrancar

18
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:39,215
to lure her brother Shota so
it could absorb his spirit

19
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:39,982
energy as well.

20
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:45,448
-Yui!

21
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:47,148
What's going on?

22
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:47,948
-Shota, don't.

23
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:51,348
You've gotta get away from me.

24
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:52,348
-Yui!

25
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:55,782
-Stay away!

26
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:56,282
-Yui.

27
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,215
-Growl, Heineko!

28
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:02,715
Now!

29
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:09,115
-Yui!

30
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,082
No!

31
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:13,082
Yui!

32
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:14,648
Are you all right?

33
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:15,648
-Oh no.

34
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:24,715
-Is that the--

35
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:26,848
-Shota, get out of here.

36
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:27,348
Run!

37
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:35,148
You have to listen.

38
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:35,915
Run.

39
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:38,915
-Keep quiet, little girl.

40
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:40,282
-I am not gonna run.

41
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:42,348
I won't ever run away and
leave you behind again.

42
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:48,648
-So that's the
original Arrancar.

43
00:03:48,682 --> 00:03:51,815
-You've got to listen to me.

44
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:54,148
If you stay, he'll eat you.

45
00:03:54,182 --> 00:03:55,048
Run away!

46
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:55,715
-No.

47
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:56,648
Not this time, Tui.

48
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:58,315
I'm staying here to protect you!

49
00:03:58,348 --> 00:04:00,282
-It's too late for that.

50
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:01,282
Save yourself.

51
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:05,248
-What's wrong?

52
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:05,748
Yui!

53
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:14,648
I can't-- I can't move.

54
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:16,882
Why won't my body listen to me?

55
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:18,882
Got to save Yui.

56
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:24,415
-This girl.

57
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:28,348
I never expected her to still
have the will to defy me,

58
00:04:28,382 --> 00:04:29,815
but it ends here.

59
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:42,548
-Yui!

60
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:50,148
Yui.

61
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:57,182
-Hado 4, Byakurai!

62
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:03,048
Come on.

63
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:04,915
You need to get a
hold of yourself.

64
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:05,582
-Rangiku.

65
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:08,548
Yui was--

66
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:10,248
-Yes, I know.

67
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:12,648
-Soul Reaper.

68
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:14,948
-It's time for you
to prepare to die.

69
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:19,548
-You got it backwards.

70
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:22,415
When I ate that girl,
I got all her power.

71
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:28,648
-Get behind me
and hold on tight!

72
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:31,515
-Soul Reapers are nothing
compared to the kind of power

73
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:32,815
I've stored up!

74
00:05:42,048 --> 00:05:45,082
-Obviously you
don't know who I am.

75
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,148
I'm the Lieutenant of Squad 10.

76
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:55,882
My name's Rangiku Matsumoto.

77
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:57,582
-A lieutenant?

78
00:05:57,615 --> 00:05:58,615
Good.

79
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:01,082
Now I'm looking
forward to eating you!

80
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:11,315
-Too slow.

81
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,015
Now to finish you off!

82
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,948
Growl, Heineko!

83
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:27,448
-Don't underestimate me.

84
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:34,348
-Where'd he go?

85
00:06:34,382 --> 00:06:38,315
[shouting]

86
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:38,782
-Shota.

87
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,782
I'm coming!

88
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,148
-Now.

89
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,115
Which one of you
should I eat first?

90
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:02,082
-Not gonna happen.

91
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:03,782
HITSUGAYA: Rangiku!

92
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:06,648
Step aside.

93
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:09,748
Rain over the frosted
heavens, Hyorinmaru!

94
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,015
-What's this?

95
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:24,348
-Captain.

96
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:24,915
-Get Shota.

97
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:29,615
-Are you all right?

98
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,415
-Rangiku.

99
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:32,282
-Get ready.

100
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:42,048
-Who are you?

101
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:46,015
-I am the Captain of Squad
10, Toshiro Hitsugaya.

102
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,448
-A Captain?

103
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,282
-Since you seem to
have no idea that we

104
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:53,248
are in the world
of the living, I

105
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:55,682
doubt that you're taking
your orders from Aizen.

106
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:58,082
So then, I guess
that also means you

107
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:00,682
must have mutated after
absorbing the girl's spirit

108
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:02,082
energy.

109
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,148
-You bastard.

110
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:04,982
-Like I said.

111
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:06,715
Prepare to die.

112
00:08:06,748 --> 00:08:08,582
-Uh, uh, are you sure
you want to do that?

113
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:13,848
If you kill me, that girl
will go down as well.

114
00:08:13,882 --> 00:08:16,815
-I know.

115
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:18,915
We already figured that
out based on the results

116
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:21,948
we got from the Soul Society.

117
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:24,715
But you and all of your weak
threats don't mean a thing to--

118
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:25,215
SHOTA: No!

119
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:25,748
-Shota.

120
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:26,382
What is it?

121
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:28,148
-Yui's still alive!

122
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:32,048
She told me to run away, but
I have to try and save her.

123
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:34,748
-I'm afraid I cannot save one
soul at the risk of losing

124
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:35,615
the entire city.

125
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,715
-No, you have to!

126
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:38,315
-Shota.

127
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:38,982
Stop.

128
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:41,948
-Watch out.

129
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:44,348
-Yui!

130
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:45,682
-I have to stay on him.

131
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:55,482
[evil laughter]

132
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:58,882
ARRANCAR: You missed your
best chance to defeat me.

133
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,115
-Oh yeah?

134
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:02,282
ARRANCAR: As long as
I'm in the subspace,

135
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:04,715
you won't be able to find me.

136
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:07,182
But I can hide my
spiritual pressure,

137
00:09:07,215 --> 00:09:11,248
attack souls, and make
as many clones as I want.

138
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:13,582
Behold, my army of servants.

139
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:27,615
-Captain Hitsugaya.

140
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:29,015
-Ikkaku.

141
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:29,848
Yumichika.

142
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:31,615
Where did they all come from?

143
00:09:31,648 --> 00:09:34,715
-No wonder there was no end no
matter how many we destroyed.

144
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:37,148
[laughing]

145
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:41,115
ARRANCAR: I can multiply
by about 16 times in a day.

146
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:44,615
Unfortunately, it took you
too long to realize that.

147
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:48,582
With this many of me, it'll be
impossible to stop them all.

148
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:53,315
Plus, I keep making
more everyday.

149
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:56,715
I've eaten most of the
souls in this town already.

150
00:09:56,748 --> 00:10:01,115
I guess I'll have to
eat the humans next.

151
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:03,682
See you around.

152
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:04,348
-Come back here!

153
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:04,948
-Ikkaku.

154
00:10:04,982 --> 00:10:05,782
Wait.

155
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,015
We're never going to end this.

156
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:09,415
Even if we were to cut
every one of them down.

157
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:11,648
-You may be right,
but we can't just

158
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:14,182
allow them to run around free.

159
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:16,915
-Squad 11 specializes in combat.

160
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:19,682
I'd rather be a man of
action than a man of thought,

161
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:22,982
so let's crush them until
we run out of spirit energy.

162
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:23,748
Let us go.

163
00:10:23,782 --> 00:10:25,115
Please.

164
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:28,848
-In the meantime, you can think
of a way to deal with them.

165
00:10:28,882 --> 00:10:29,348
-All right.

166
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:29,848
Go.

167
00:10:29,882 --> 00:10:31,282
-Come on!

168
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:31,782
-Right.

00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,082

171

HITSUGAYA: We have encountered
the mock Arrancar's main body,

172
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,882
but unfortunately he got away.

173
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,248
Can you track him?

174
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:53,482
-We're doing that right now.

175
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:58,015
-No good.

176
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:00,348
We can't track him.

177
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:01,648
-No support.

178
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:03,515
We've lost sight of him.

179
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:06,582
There are no traces
of distortion either.

180
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:09,748
-He's gone.

181
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,415
I'm so sorry, but--

182
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:12,282
-What's this?

183
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:14,948
-Well, what is it?

184
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:16,882
-We've pinpointed the
location of the sound

185
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:19,748
that the Arrancar
uses to control souls.

186
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:21,515
-What exactly do you mean?

187
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,382
-It looks like the
original creature produces

188
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:25,182
the strange sound
while all of his clones

189
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:28,148
are acting as speakers and
spreading it all over the town.

190
00:11:28,182 --> 00:11:29,515
-How is he doing that?

191
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:32,182
I don't know, but it's as if
the main body and the clones

192
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:33,848
are connected by a
wireless connection.

193
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:35,048
-Huh?

194
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:37,015
-I'm guessing that they
deliver the spirit energy

195
00:11:37,048 --> 00:11:39,815
they absorb back to the
main body the same way.

196
00:11:39,848 --> 00:11:42,615
Maybe we can try to pinpoint
the location of the main body

197
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:45,615
by figuring out the
distribution of the clones.

198
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:48,515
Or not.

199
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:50,582
-All systems, analyze
the distribution

200
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:51,982
of spiritual pressure!

201
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:54,182
-This could work.

202
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:55,182
-Send us the data, Rin.

203
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,648
RIN: Yes, sir.

[sobbing]

205
00:12:00,582 --> 00:12:03,515
-Shota.

206
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:06,015
I want to give you some
information about this Arrancar

207
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:07,148
we're fighting.

208
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:09,682
Originally, they were
identified as Hollows.

209
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:12,948
They're very much
like a fallen soul.

210
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,448
A soul that still has an
attachment to the world

211
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:16,882
and becomes corrupted.

212
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:20,382
It then loses its heart
and becomes a Hollow.

213
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:23,815
We Soul Reapers exist
not only to save souls,

214
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:27,148
but to save Hollows as well.

215
00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:31,415
We do that by cutting
Hollow with our Zanpakuto,

216
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:34,415
but this sends them back
to the Soul Society.

217
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:37,348
It's sort of like cleansing
Hollows of their sins in order

218
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,282
for them to be reborn.

219
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:45,748
I'm so sorry that we
couldn't protect your sister.

220
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,215
But it's not too late.

221
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:52,182
We can still save Yui's soul.

222
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:56,482
-OK.

223
00:12:59,215 --> 00:13:00,715
-This time it's
gonna be your turn.

224
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:05,448
Hold on to this.

225
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:12,615
I think that you and I should
save Yui's soul together.

226
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:13,148
-'Kay.

227
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:22,015
-Are the two of you
finished talking?

228
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,482
Let's get going.

229
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:23,982
-Right.

230
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,902
-Ha!

231
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:37,602
-Heh, heh, heh.

232
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,202
You can't defeat me like that.

233
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,635
You're way too slow.

234
00:13:46,135 --> 00:13:47,135
-Shoo!

235
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:48,435
Beat it!

236
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:49,635
Go away!

237
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:51,935
I wonder if these are the
clones of that Arrancar.

238
00:13:51,969 --> 00:13:59,735
If so-- there are
so many of them.

239
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:01,302
Looks like my chores--

240
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:02,969
-Will have to wait.

241
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:04,235
-Hey, don't slack off.

242
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:11,402
-I knew it.

243
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,902
The clones aren't spread
out over a large area.

244
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,902
I'm calculating the
location out their source

245
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:21,502
by analyzing the distribution
of where they appear.

246
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:24,202
It's in the western
part of Karakura Town.

247
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:26,569
Near the river.

248
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:29,669
-So how do we go about
finding the original Arrancar?

249
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,135
-According to the Department
of Research and Development,

250
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:34,935
the Arrancar is only hiding
his spiritual pressure.

251
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:37,102
-The main body of
the original Arrancar

252
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:40,869
needs to be able to communicate
at all times with its clones.

253
00:14:40,902 --> 00:14:43,002
There's no way that he'd
be hiding in a place that's

254
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:45,535
shut off from the world of
the living, like Hueco Mundo.

255
00:14:48,502 --> 00:14:52,269
-I think he's probably hiding
within a special barrier.

256
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:53,369
-I see.

257
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,102
-I think that if we
were to hit his barrier

258
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:58,535
with our spiritual pressure,
we should be able to break it.

259
00:14:58,569 --> 00:14:59,869
-All right.

260
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:01,569
In that case, I'll hit the
better with my full strength.

261
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:02,202
-No.

262
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,402
I'll do it myself.

263
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,069
In order to pry him open
from his protective space,

264
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:08,635
we need a proportional
amount of spiritual pressure.

265
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:11,102
You take care of the enemy
when it comes jumping out.

266
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:12,835
-Yes, sir.

He's come this far.

if he just aimlessly releases

00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:07,002
Wha-- what?

334
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,802
[struggling]

335
00:19:19,802 --> 00:19:20,669
-My legs!

336
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:24,002
-Rangiku!

337
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:25,302
Finish him off!

338
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:26,135
-Right!

339
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:28,169
Shota, grab a hold of my sword.

340
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:30,535
-OK.

341
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,102
-You and I will save your
sister's soul together.

342
00:19:33,135 --> 00:19:33,602
-Yeah.

343
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:38,602
-I won't be defeated by you.

344
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,102
Huh?

345
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:43,769
-OK, he's stopped moving.

346
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:44,602
Now's our chance.

347
00:19:44,635 --> 00:19:45,102
-Right!

348
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:52,535
-Shota!

349
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:55,502
[shouting]

350
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,935
SHOTA: Yui.

351
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:08,402
[screaming]

352
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,369
-All the souls he devoured
are being released.

353
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:24,869
-What?

354
00:20:24,902 --> 00:20:26,335
-Look at that.

355
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:33,669
-What the hell is going on?

356
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:35,369
-It looks like they
suddenly disappeared.

357
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:45,302
-Shota.

358
00:20:58,402 --> 00:20:58,869
-Rangiku?

359
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,169
Yui got to go to
the Soul Society.

360
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:09,169
Didn't she?

361
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,202
She can be reborn now.

362
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:13,702
Right?

363
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:14,835
-Yes.

364
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:16,002
Yes, she can.

365
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:19,235
I promise you.

366
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:25,602
-Well, then-- I guess
that I should follow her.

367
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:28,502
-Yeah.

368
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:30,369
Are you ready?

369
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:30,869
-Yeah.

370
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:43,702
It really hurts without her.

371
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:25,273
[theme music]

372
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:46,033
ICHIGO: Everyone's going to
be training until winter,

373
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:48,366
but all you want to do is have
fun in the world of the living,

374
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:49,233
don't you, Rangiku?

375
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:50,333
RANGIKU: Not true.

376
00:23:50,366 --> 00:23:51,533
And as proof, we'll
show you our daily lives

377
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:52,633
in the next episode.

378
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,099
ICHIGO: Still sounds
like all you're doing

379
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:54,999
is having fun to me.

380
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:55,999
RANGIKU: It's all right.

381
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:57,266
We've got permission from him.

382
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:58,666
ICHIGO: Who's him?
