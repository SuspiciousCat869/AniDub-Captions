[screaming]

3
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:45,262
-Momo!

4
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:46,262
What is it, Momo?

5
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:49,028
Please, tell me what happened!

6
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:51,695
-That's impossible!

7
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:53,195
-He was murdered?

8
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:02,828
-You can't be dead.

9
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:04,262
You can't be.

10
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:07,095
You can't.

11
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,928
Oh, Captain Aizen!

12
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:13,628
(SCREAMING) Who did this?

13
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:17,028
[sobbing]

14
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:27,562
GIN (OFFSCREEN): What's all this
racket so early in the morning?

15
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:31,528
(UNCONCERNED) Oh, that.

16
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:33,162
Yes, it certainly is a tragedy.

17
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:40,128
-Listen to me, Momo.

18
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:42,228
Be careful dealing
with Squad Three.

19
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:53,495
Especially if you ever
see Captain Aizen go out

20
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:54,495
walking alone.

21
00:03:10,862 --> 00:03:11,795
-It was you!

22
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:39,762
Izuru-- stand aside!

23
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,662
-I can't do that.

24
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:43,662
I'm the lieutenant
of Squad Three.

25
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:46,462
No matter what reason, I
cannot allow anyone to raise

26
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:47,595
their sword to my captain.

27
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:06,928
-He's a murderer, Izuru!

28
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:08,162
Let me go!

29
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:10,928
-You know that I cannot.

30
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:11,962
-(SCREAMING) Stand aside!

31
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:12,862
I'll kill him!

32
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:14,562
-Let him go!

33
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:15,428
-Can't you hear me?

34
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:17,462
I'm telling you to step aside!

35
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:18,562
-Can't you hear me?

36
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:20,362
I'm telling you to
remember your place!

37
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:26,128
-Snap, Tobiume!

38
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:26,628
Deflect!

39
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:46,228
-You dare release
your Zanpakuto here?

40
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:46,995
How reckless!

41
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:52,328
Have you lost your mind, Momo?

42
00:04:52,362 --> 00:04:55,328
You must never confuse
public and private matters,

43
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:55,828
lieutenant!

44
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:08,628
Very well, then.

45
00:05:08,662 --> 00:05:11,395
You leave you no choice.

46
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:14,562
Since you're now a threat,
I must eliminate you.

47
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,028
Raise your head
and prepare to die!

48
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:38,462
-Back away now, both of you.

49
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:39,295
-Toshiro!

50
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:41,828
-Place these two under arrest!

51
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:44,562
-Wait a minute!

52
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,862
-Momo!

53
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:49,095
At a time like this you take
up arms against your own?

54
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:50,762
Especially when
your first priority

55
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:53,028
should have been to take
Captain Aizen's body down

56
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:53,795
from up there.

57
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:01,228
I will report this incident
to the head captain.

58
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:02,962
Get these two out of my sight.

59
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:03,895
Lock them both up.

60
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:35,495
-Thank you, Squad Ten captain.

61
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,895
Sorry you had to waste
your time on one of mine.

62
00:06:41,262 --> 00:06:45,128
-You know, Gin, I
believe that just now you

63
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:46,328
were about to kill Momo.

64
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:59,662
-Now, whatever could
you be talking about?

65
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:02,195
-Play innocent if you
like, but I'll tell you

66
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:06,162
this-- if you allow Momo's
blood to be spilled,

67
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:09,062
I promise you I'll kill you.

68
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,828
-Oh, how scary!

69
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:13,528
But I suggest that you
keep an eye on her.

70
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:16,295
You didn't want any
misfortune to befall her.

71
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,395
-Captain Hitsugaya!

72
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:28,095
Captain Ichimaru!

73
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:30,228
What's happening?

74
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:31,628
Oh no!

75
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:34,328
Captain Aizen, he's-- he's dead!

76
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:35,962
-But how could
this have happened?

77
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:39,228
-Get the captain's
body down immediately.

78
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:39,862
-Yes sir.

79
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,062
-Hanataro, you
disgusting little toad,

80
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:18,862
what the hell are you
doing sleeping on me!

81
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:19,862
I'm no pillow!

82
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:24,595
And what's worse now,
my only pair of pants

83
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:26,162
are all slimy with your drool!

84
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:28,562
I got half a mind to tear
your slobbering head off,

85
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:29,195
you worthless little--
you worthless little--

86
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:29,728
-Give him a break.

87
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:31,628
He's exhausted.

88
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:35,428
A little bit of
drool is no big deal.

89
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:37,328
-Ichigo?

90
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:39,828
Are you feeling as
good as you look?

91
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:43,262
-As a matter of fact, I
am, thanks to Hanataro.

92
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:46,195
He really is pretty amazing.

93
00:08:46,228 --> 00:08:50,028
Looks like your aches and pains
are gone now too, aren't they?

94
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,562
-Well, now that you mention it--

95
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:55,162
-I saw him early this
morning, treating your wounds

96
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:56,895
while you were
still sleeping, even

97
00:08:56,928 --> 00:09:00,328
though I know he had
to be dead tired.

98
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:01,695
-I see.

99
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:04,295
So he's been helping me
without me even knowing it.

100
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:11,462
-Well, what is it?

101
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:13,628
-This mission's only going
to keep on getting harder,

102
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:14,695
you know.

103
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,328
You can bet the enemy's
plenty angry they

104
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:17,562
haven't caught us yet.

105
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:25,828
Is this something that
you're serious about?

106
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:30,862
I hope you're committed
to it, heart and soul.

107
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:45,662
-She's waiting.

108
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:52,628
And I didn't come here
to tour the sewer system.

109
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:59,095
-Uh?

110
00:09:59,128 --> 00:09:59,862
Yaagh!

111
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:00,628
Stop it!

112
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:01,862
Please, get away from me!

113
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:03,662
I don't know what you're
doing, but you have no right

114
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,028
to come onto me like that.

115
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,162
Besides, I'm not that kind of
a squad member, so stop it!

116
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:08,195
I--

117
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:09,128
Oh.

118
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:10,962
Good morning, sirs.

119
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:14,795
-Hanataro, what the hell
where you just dreaming about?

120
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:16,728
-Oh, you wouldn't want to know.

121
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:52,730
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): You're Chad?

122
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,074
-That's close.

123
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:57,341
It's Sado.

124
00:10:57,374 --> 00:11:01,608
-Is it just me, or
are you freaking huge?

125
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:04,708
That's our uniform, but
I've never seen you before.

126
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:07,341
-I was supposed to start
classes at Mashiba High School

127
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:09,608
today, in room 2F.

128
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:11,141
-You're a junior?

129
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:13,474
You mean you're in the
same grade that I'm in?

130
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:14,541
That is so bizarre.

131
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,341
I still don't get why
you didn't hit them back.

132
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,908
But what the hell, I guess
you must have your reasons,

133
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:26,741
so thanks for helping me out.

134
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:27,708
-Wait.

135
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:29,808
Are you sure you
should be standing up?

136
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:31,374
-Yeah, sure, why not?

137
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:32,674
I feel all right.

138
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,874
-Well, you don't look so good.

139
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:37,108
You took a pretty serious
beating back there.

140
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:38,641
-Eh, I've had worse.

141
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:40,508
If they didn't
have rocks and bats

142
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,574
I would have kicked their asses.

143
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:45,374
-These guys are serious.

144
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:48,208
What did you do to make
them so angry at you?

145
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,441
-Nothing I know of.

146
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:51,474
The seniors have had it
in for me from the start,

147
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:53,208
just because they
don't like my hair.

148
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:55,674
Apparently, they don't like
anybody who stands out.

149
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,974
They're totally
close-minded that way.

150
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:00,174
You know.

151
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,174
I'm sure you get it too.

152
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,241
As big as you are, I
bet there are always

153
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:08,174
people wanting to fight you
just to prove themselves.

154
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,808
C'mon, Chad, let's
get a move on.

155
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,341
-Call me Sado.

156
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:15,274
You're obviously
still a little wobbly.

157
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:18,008
-And you obviously don't
like being called Chad.

158
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:18,708
Why not, though?

159
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:20,374
I think it sounds cool.

160
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:21,408
Like the country.

161
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,641
-Never heard of it.

162
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:23,841
Where is it?

163
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:25,341
-It's in Central Africa!

164
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:26,941
And how about hanging chad?

165
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:28,841
-Never heard of
him, either, but I

166
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,808
have heard of Horatio Chadstein.

167
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:31,308
-Yeah?

168
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:32,141
Who's he?

169
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:33,474
Sounds like some dead writer.

170
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:44,641
-Hm.

171
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:45,908
It was a dream.

172
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:47,741
I'm lying here,
dreaming of the past,

173
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:49,341
like some old man
on his porch swing.

174
00:12:52,608 --> 00:13:03,908
[guards shouting]

175
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:05,741
-(THINKING) Good thing
I woke up when I did.

176
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,908
If I'd still been sleeping
when that knock came,

177
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:21,908
this could have turned
into a really bad day.

178
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:34,341
-Hey, what the
hell is that thing?

179
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:37,174
-It's a super nutrition tablet
for reviving and energizing

180
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,774
Squad Four members
whenever they're

181
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:41,274
exhausted but still have
a lot of work to do.

182
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:43,208
Every member of Squad
Four is required

183
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:47,008
to carry a supply of these
in case of emergency fatigue.

184
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,241
-Do they really work?

185
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:50,108
-That has a picture
of a skull on it.

186
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:52,774
Are you sure someone didn't
give you poison instead?

187
00:13:52,808 --> 00:14:06,841
-You just swallow the pill whole
and then-- (TIREDLY) There.

188
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:08,341
I'm energized.

189
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:10,074
I guess we'd better get going.

190
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:10,908
-Wait wait, wait!

191
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:12,241
What are you talking about?

192
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:13,508
-What's the matter, guys?

193
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,074
-It didn't change anything!

194
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:18,308
-That stupid pill didn't have
any effect on you at all!

195
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,208
-No, no, just look at my face.

196
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:24,174
You see how full of energy and
life and vitality it is now?

197
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,141
-It's exactly the
same as before.

198
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:29,108
-You did get yourself cheated
in a big way, little friend.

199
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:39,141
Good.

200
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:42,474
There's nobody around.

201
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,508
-We had a major battle
here just yesterday.

202
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,141
Wouldn't you expect
them to at least

203
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:48,674
have a couple guards posted?

204
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,774
-They probably think
we feel lucky just

205
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,341
to have gotten away
alive, and they

206
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:55,141
figure that this is the last
place we'd come back to.

207
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:57,174
-Yeah, maybe you're right.

208
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,208
-(HALF-HEARTEDLY): Whoa, I
am so full of energy now.

209
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:02,774
-Maybe, but you still
look pretty weak.

210
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:04,674
-Hey, we haven't
heard from the others.

211
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,041
I wonder if they're doing OK.

212
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:08,374
That strange guy with the
glasses and white cape,

213
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,408
and that cutie-pie with
the great big eyes.

214
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:12,374
-A cutie-pie, huh?

215
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:13,841
That word's not exactly hip.

216
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:16,374
-Saying something is "hip"
isn't hip anymore, either,

217
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:18,074
for that matter.

218
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:18,908
Ow!

219
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:20,074
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

220
00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:21,874
I didn't mean it, I swear!

221
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:26,008
-Uryu and Orihime have both
proven a lot smarter than I am.

222
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,241
-Oh, is that right?

223
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,174
So in other words,
you're willing to admit

224
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,208
that you're a lot
dumber than they are?

225
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:33,541
-That's exactly what it
sounded like to me, too!

226
00:15:33,574 --> 00:15:34,474
Aaaaah!

227
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:35,841
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

228
00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:38,108
I didn't mean that, either!

229
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:40,274
-I'm just saying I think
those two know better

230
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:42,908
than to take on an enemy
that they couldn't handle.

231
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,308
They're still all right.

232
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:45,708
I'm sure of it.

233
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:48,041
-What about the other one, the
one that you were calling Chad?

234
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:49,808
-Even less to worry about.

235
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:50,874
-And how do you know that?

236
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:56,574
-Because I can feel it.

237
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:59,474
I've been able to feel his
spiritual pressure, no matter

238
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:02,508
the distance between us, ever
since we fell to the ground

239
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,708
in this place.

240
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:08,508
And besides, I can't
see Chad ever losing.

241
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,408
He's just too strong
and too determined.

242
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:21,674
-I give!

243
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,741
Please, just don't kill me.

244
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:28,841
-Tell me where the
repentant cell is.

245
00:16:28,874 --> 00:16:31,074
-How-- how do you
even know that name?

246
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:34,208
-I asked the last guy I hit
where Rukia Kuchiki was,

247
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:37,041
and that's what he said
just before he passed out.

248
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:40,774
Tell me where it is,
while you still can.

249
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:43,441
-It-- i-- it's-- it's there!

250
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:44,708
It's right there!

251
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:47,774
You see that tall white
tower way up there?

252
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,241
Right next to the mountaintop!

253
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,341
The represent cell
is at the top.

254
00:17:02,174 --> 00:17:04,008
-Very well.

255
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,608
Thanks for your help.

256
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:09,141
-You-- you mean-- you're
really going to let me live?

257
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:17,774
You ought to know better than
to turn your back on an enemy

258
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:18,408
so soon!

259
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,208
I'm sorry!

260
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:31,708
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

261
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:33,674
I don't know what
came over me, I swear!

262
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,174
I promise I'll forget I saw you!

263
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,174
Please don't kill me!

264
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,308
-Fine.

265
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:41,108
Just don't come after me again.

266
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:43,874
-You-- you're gonna
let me go again?

267
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:45,574
Even after I attacked you?

268
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:46,374
Whoa.

269
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:48,008
What a surprise.

270
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:48,941
My begging worked.

271
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:53,341
-At last.

272
00:17:56,741 --> 00:18:00,408
-I thought we'd never get
here, but there it is.

273
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:01,641
the repentance cell.

274
00:18:17,774 --> 00:18:27,574
[sounds of fighting]

275
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:28,941
SHUNSUI (OFFSCREEN,
SINGING): Dee

276
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:38,208
dee doo, doo doo dee-- [humming]

277
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,708
-He's here, captain.

278
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:41,508
It's the ryoka.

279
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:45,308
He must have
overpowered the guards.

280
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:46,441
Captain Kyoraku!

281
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:48,641
-Already?

282
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:52,474
I wasn't expecting
the guy so early.

283
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:54,608
So what the hell,
guess I'd better

284
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:57,008
head out there and give
them a proper greeting.

285
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,474
-I still don't get
why you won't send me.

286
00:18:59,508 --> 00:19:02,141
Though I'm only your
lieutenant, for a single ryoka

287
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,508
I'd be more than enough.

288
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,408
-Nanao, we've been
over this already.

289
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:10,174
This is a direct order
from old man Yamamoto.

290
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,041
He doesn't want anyone
to know we're still

291
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:15,374
having problems with
these pesky ryoka.

292
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:19,741
You know how old folks are
when it comes to losing face.

293
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:23,874
And besides that, I'd never
be able to forgive myself

294
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:26,141
if my little Nanao went
out to fight for me

295
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:28,174
and somehow ended
up getting injured.

296
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,041
-Since when am I
your "little Nanao"?

297
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:32,108
-Ah.

298
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:34,374
You know I love it
when you treat me bad.

299
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:36,441
You're beautiful when
you're heartless.

300
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,141
-Enough with the
meaningless compliments!

301
00:19:38,174 --> 00:19:40,508
If you're going, then just go!

302
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:43,608
-All right then.

303
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,941
Don't look so worried.

304
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:47,074
I'll be fine.

305
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:49,708
It won't take long.

306
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:51,408
I'm just going to
go have some fun.

307
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:30,741
-Dammit!

308
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:32,808
How many freaking steps
does this stupid stairway

309
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:34,741
have anyway?

310
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:36,808
-What difference does it
make how many there are?

311
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:39,208
-What's the big deal
about a few steps?

312
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:40,674
Now do you believe me?

313
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,508
Those nutrition tablets
really did give me energy!

314
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,074
-(BOTH) All right,
all right, already!

315
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:49,374
-Finally.

316
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:50,508
We made it to the top!

317
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,541
-Nobody up here, either!

318
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:58,741
Security seems pretty lax.

319
00:20:58,774 --> 00:21:01,408
All right then, guys, let's just
head straight for the tower.

320
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,574
-What the hell is
this, some kind

321
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:19,641
of impossibly powerful
spiritual pressure?

322
00:21:24,374 --> 00:21:27,408
-What could be-- what
