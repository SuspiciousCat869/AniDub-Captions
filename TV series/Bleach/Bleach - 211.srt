NARRATOR: In the Soul
Society, mysterious deaths

3
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:54,494
began to occur in the Rukon
District where people vanished,

4
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:56,894
leaving only their
clothes behind.

5
00:01:56,927 --> 00:01:59,361
Squad Nine was investigating
these incidents

6
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:00,994
when someone attacked them.

7
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:03,261
During the fight, both
Captain Kensei Muguruma

8
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:06,161
and Lieutenant Mashiro
Kuna's spiritual pressures

9
00:02:06,194 --> 00:02:07,727
suddenly disappeared.

10
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,861
The 13 Court Guard Squads
investigated, and determined

11
00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:13,161
that a worst-case
scenario had occurred.

12
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:16,227
Kisuke Urahara, who had sent
Lieutenant Hiyori Sarugaki

13
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,961
to the scene following a
request from Squad Nine,

14
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:21,894
tried to mount a rescue attempt.

15
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:24,861
-[gasps] Let me, sir.

16
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,127
Please, sir, let me go there.

17
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,927
[breathing heavily]

18
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:31,927
-No.

19
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:33,127
-I have to go!

20
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:35,527
My second in command is
already heading there!

21
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:36,027
I should--

22
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:36,527
-Kisuke!

23
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:40,894
Just control yourself.

24
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,461
You're making a scene.

25
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:45,061
You were the one who made the
choice to send her out there.

26
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:46,927
Can't you see that
you begging to go

27
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:49,827
save her is an insult
to her abilities?

28
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,327
NARRATOR: Ultimately,
five officers

29
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:54,627
were dispatched-- Rojuro
"Rose" Otoribashi, captain

30
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:58,327
of Squad Three; Shinji Hirako,
the captain of Squad Five;

31
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:01,161
Love Aikawa, captain
of Squad Seven;

32
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:04,594
Hachigen Ushoda, lieutenant
of the Kido Corps;

33
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:07,627
and Lisa Yadomaru,
lieutenant of Squad Nine.

34
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,194
Each was a skilled warrior.

35
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:11,261
When the members arrived
at their destination,

36
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:15,327
they were confronted
by a strange figure.

37

-[grunts]

38
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:34,627
-[gasps] Shinji?

39
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:37,661
-Hey, Shinji!

40
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:38,894
-Hiyori, you all right?

41
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:45,194
-Kensei.

42
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:49,094
-[growls]

43
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,894
-Just what the hell
is going on here?

44
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:54,194
-You think that
thing's really Kensei?

45
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:58,094
WIth that mask,
spiritual pressure,

46
00:03:58,127 --> 00:04:01,194
it's almost like
he's become a Hollow.

47
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:03,594
-I'm not sure what
to think either.

48
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:07,461
There's a chance it's
Kensei, but maybe not.

49
00:04:07,494 --> 00:04:08,494
-[growls]

50
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,794
-Anyway, there's one
thing I'm sure of.

51
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:14,661
If we don't draw our swords
right now, we'll be dead.

52
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:21,227
-[growls louder] [screams]

53
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,727
NARRATOR: What
Shinji and the others

54
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,394
saw standing before
them was Kensei,

55
00:04:25,427 --> 00:04:27,894
transformed into something
resembling a Hollow.

56
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:33,061
He had lost complete
control of himself,

57
00:04:33,094 --> 00:04:34,661
and attacked the others.

58
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:37,494
Everyone reluctantly
fought back.

59
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,961
However, Kensei now had
tremendous strength.

60
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:42,727
And when he was joined
by Mashiro, who had also

61
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,894
been transformed,
they both began

62
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,694
to slowly overpower
the Soul Reapers.

63
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:50,661
-Hey, Rose!

64
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:51,661
Behind you!

65
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,127

00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:09,194
-Glad to see you're
alert during your rounds.

74
00:06:09,227 --> 00:06:09,794
-Captain!

75
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,494
Captain Kyoraku!

76
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,294
Is there something going on?

77
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:14,994
You're almost never
out at this hour.

78
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:17,627
-Well, I had a little trouble
falling asleep tonight.

79
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:31,694
Maybe I'm getting
paranoid in my old age.

80
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:32,927
-(BOTH) Huh?

81
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,294
-Forget it.

82
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,894
Looks like Lieutenant Aizen
had trouble sleeping as well.

83
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:44,461
--[both gasp] (BOTH) Have a
good evening, Lieutenant Aizen.

84
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:45,994
-Keep up the good work, men.

85
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:46,794
And stay alert.

86
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:51,161
-(BOTH) Good night,
Captain Kyoraku.

87
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:52,327
SHUNSUI KYORAKU: Good night.

88
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:02,894
-Huh?

89
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,794
-Evening, sir.

90
00:07:04,827 --> 00:07:08,294
-Uh, let me see.

91
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,261
Ah, yes.

92
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:10,327
You're Nanao Ise.

93
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:10,961
Am I right?

94
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:12,661
-Um, yes sir.

95
00:07:12,694 --> 00:07:15,094
I'm honored that you
remembered who I was, sir.

96
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:19,561
-Of course. [laughs] Well,
you are the youngest child

97
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:21,427
we have around here now.

98
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:23,527
I try to make it a
special point to remember

99
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:26,494
the names of every girl
that's training with us here.

100
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:29,161
And in your particular case,
that was especially easy,

101
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:30,994
since you come to
see me every month.

102
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,627
Oh, that's right.

103
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,427
The first of the month
happens to be today.

104
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:37,061
-Yes.

105
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:38,627
I'm aware of that.

106
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:41,294
I was on the way to see
Lieutenant Yadomaru because she

107
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,494
offered to read with
me again this month.

108
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:45,727
-That makes sense.

109
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:50,827
But I'm afraid it will
be impossible You see,

110
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:54,094
Lieutenant Yadomaru
isn't here tonight.

111
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:56,261
-Nobody told me What happened?

112
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:59,427
-She's on an important mission.

113
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:00,761
-Oh.

114
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:02,727
-But don't worry.

115
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,827
She'll be back in the morning.

116
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,227
You can count on it.

117
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:10,561
-[grunts]

118
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,061
-Stop this, Kensei.

119
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:21,727
What's happened, my friend?

120
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:24,227
This is completely out
of character for you.

121
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,927
You've never been
the kind of weakling

122
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:27,861
who would strike a girl.

123
00:08:27,894 --> 00:08:30,294
-[growls]

124
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:33,515
-Are you going to
be all right, Lisa?

125
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:33,986
Are you hurt?

126
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:35,253
-I got this.

127
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:37,386
-Don't try to be strong
if you're injured.

128
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:39,392
It puts us at risk.

129
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:40,892
-I'm fine.

130
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:43,792
-I'm not sure it matters
one way or the other.

131
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:47,459
If things keep on like this,
we're all going to be defeated.

132
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:50,859
-Hachi, is there any other
way we can neutralize him?

133
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:53,092
-Yes, there is.

134
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,259
But there's a problem.

135
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:58,692
He easily broke
through Sajo Sabaku.

136
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:02,525
This time, we'd have to go
at him with maximum force.

137
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,025
And to do that,
I'd need all of you

138
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,559
to create a surefire opportunity
for me to use my Bakudo.

139
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,325
That's the only move
I can see that would

140
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,959
have a chance of working.

141
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:16,392
However, the problem is that
my Bakudo could take all of us

142
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:17,892
with it as well.

143
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,859
-Is that all?

144
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,225
LISA YADOMARU: Love?

145
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,892
-I'll try to distract
him, all right?

146
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:24,259
While I'm doing
that, you'll have

147
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,125
to find a way to capture him.

148
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,492
-I'm going along with you.

149
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,859
-And me as well.

150
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:30,325
-With the injuries
you've suffered?

151
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:32,492
You've both gone crazy.

152
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:34,125
I'll handle it myself.

153
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,225
I need you to watch my back.

154
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,959
-Big showoff.

155
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:38,792
-Look who's talking.

-A level 90 Bakudo without
an incantation, eh?

169
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,959
That was a nice trick.

170
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:36,292
-Yes, well, I outdid
myself this time.

171
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,225
-OK then.

172
00:10:39,992 --> 00:10:43,359
How are we supposed to
reverse his condition?

173
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,825
Are you able to do
something using Kido?

174
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:48,559
-Even if I could, I'm not
sure what got him this way.

175
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:50,225
I might damage it
even more before I

176
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:51,459
could get him back to normal.

You feeling all right?

Hachi, forget about
Kensei for now.

181
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,892
We'd better start
healing our friend here.

-Hold on a minute.

199
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,492
Kaname.

200
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:03,192
Tell me, why did you
do that to Kensei?

201
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,959
You betrayed him,
your own captain.

202
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:11,392
SOSUKE AIZEN: He
didn't betray him.

203
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:19,725
He's actually quite loyal.

204
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,892
As a matter of fact,
Kaname was just

205
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:24,925
loyally following my orders.

206
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,025
You of all people
can understand that,

207
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:32,259
so please don't hold it
against him, Captain Hirako.

208
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:38,959
-Sosuke I should have
known it was you.

209
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,259
-You mean you were onto me?

210
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,359
That was very good.

211
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:44,259
-Of course.

212
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:46,059
That's why I'm a captain.

213
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:47,325
-When did you suspect?

214
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,659
-From the beginning.

215
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:50,825
From the time you were
in your mother's womb,

216
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:53,692
and maybe even before then.

217
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:55,559
-How witty of you.

218
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:58,259
-To be perfectly
honest, I always

219
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:01,659
felt you were someone dangerous,
someone who could never really

220
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:03,625
be trusted.

221
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,225
And as long as we're
telling the truth here,

222
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,825
that's the real reason I
chose you to be my lieutenant.

223
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:14,759
I only did it to keep
an eye on you, Sosuke.

224
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:20,125
--[chuckles] Yes, I must thank
you for that, Captain Hirako.

225
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,659
I depended on your
deep distrust of me

226
00:13:22,692 --> 00:13:24,692
to make sure you kept watching.

227
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:27,025
That's what made
misleading you so simple.

228
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:28,959
-You were never out of my sight.

229
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,059
What are you saying?

230
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:32,725
-You were keeping an
eye on the wrong person.

231
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,625
-[gasps]

232
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,592
SOSUKE AIZEN: During
this past month,

233
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,492
when you were so
aware of my presence,

234
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:43,425
it wasn't me who
was following you.

235
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,025
-What?

236
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,592
SOSUKE AIZEN: I have
a very useful ability.

237
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,992
I can make anyone
mistake any phenomenon

238
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:52,159
for something else at will.

239
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:57,592
That is the true power of my
Zanpakuto, Kyoka Suigetsu.

240
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,625
I refer to it by
the common term,

241
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:03,725
complete and utter hypnosis.

242
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,825
-You're saying
you hypnotized me?

243
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:12,025
-You are a sharp
intellect, Captain Hirako.

244
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,792
But you're suspicious, and
that gave me an opening.

245
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:17,225
You never received me as your
second in command the way

246
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:18,959
the other captains did.

247
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,392
If you had, perhaps
you might have

248
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,725
been able to see through me.

249
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,592
However, you did not.

250
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,792
And because you didn't
trust me, you always

251
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:32,259
kept me at arm's length,
never opening up to me

252
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,525
or giving me information.

253
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:37,425
And of course, you never
tried to get closer to me.

254
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,192
That's why I was able to take
advantage of you so easily.

255
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:47,159
The fact is, you never realized
that at a certain point,

256
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,792
I switched places with a
completely different person.

257
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:55,959
I made sure the man who took
my place memorized everything

258
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:59,025
about my normal behavior
patterns, and especially

259
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:00,759
my patterns of
interaction when dealing

260
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,692
with you and the
other squad members.

261
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:08,625
If you had really been
paying attention to me,

262
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:11,292
even slight differences
in habits or behaviors

263
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:13,692
would've seemed out
of place to you.

264
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:17,825
You were too arrogant to
believe that I was smart enough

265
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:20,459
to be one step ahead of you.

266
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:22,425
Because you never
really knew who I was,

267
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:24,925
you now lie there
completely helpless.

268
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,725
Do you understand the
depths of your situation

269
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,225
now, my dear Captain Hirako?

270
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:38,825
-[breathing heavily] Sosuke.

271
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:41,592
-Oh, and one more thing.

272
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,625
Let me enlighten you
about your assertion

273
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,159
that you chose me
as your lieutenant

274
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:46,792
in order to keep an eye on me.

275
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:49,025
Actually, you're mistaken.

276
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:50,525
It was the other way around.

277
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,792
-What are you talking about?

278
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:56,659
SOSUKE AIZEN: Think back to
the start of our relationship.

279
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:59,359
Just as captains have the right
to select their lieutenants,

280
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:03,559
squad members have the right
to refuse an assignment.

281
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:07,559
And while that right is very
rarely exercised, particularly

282
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,725
when you're starting
out, it still exists.

283
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,359
I had the choice of not
becoming your lieutenant.

284
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:15,692
So why didn't I do that?

285
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:21,425
Because it was the
ideal situation.

286
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:23,425
You didn't realize
it at the time,

287
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,725
but your excessive
suspicion and wariness of me

288
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,925
was just what I needed.

289
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,392
It played perfectly into
the successful completion

290
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:30,759
of my plans.

291
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:33,425
Now do you understand what
I've been talking about?

292
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,792
You did not choose me.

293
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:38,292
I chose you, Caption Hirako.

294
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:43,659
I suppose when it
comes right down it,

295
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:46,425
that you owe your
friends here an topology.

296
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,359
Because you were chosen by me,
they ended up on the ground

297
00:16:49,392 --> 00:16:51,959
as casualties, through
no fault of their own.

298
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:57,292
-Sosuke!

300
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:04,725
-I wasn't actually sure it would
work, but thank you, Captain,

301
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:07,525
for going for my cheap taunt.

302
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,492
-What's happening to me?

-As we thought, it appears
that an agitated state

313
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:53,746
helps to accelerate the
Hollowfication process.

314
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,680
-Hollowfication.

315
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:58,446
What have you done to us?

316
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,180
-I see no reason to
explain, Captain.

00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:18,546
-Yes sir?

321
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,046
-No!

322
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,546
Don't!

323
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:34,046
I don't know what's
going on here,

324
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,446
but if you think everything is
going to go smoothly according

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,380

-Hmm?

327
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,146
Surprising resistance,
considering

328
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,280
the progress of
the Hollowfication.

329

What was it that Sosuke
said a few minutes ago?

331
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,913
-As we thought, it appears
that an agitated state

332
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:57,813
helps to accelerate the
Hollowfication process.

-That was it, which means
that I maintain my composure,

this transformation

SHINJI HIRAKO
(VOICEOVER): No wonder

352
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:21,846
we had such a hard time
dealing with Kensei,

353
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,146
even when we outnumbered him.

354
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,980
But at this rate, I
may have a chance.

But don't worry,
I'll finish him now.

-Don't concern yourself over it.

359
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,746
I actually expected
this would happen.

360
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,813
In fact, I theorized
that the speed

361
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,680
at which Hollow
transformation would occur

362

would differ from
individual to individual.

interesting process to observe.

00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:10,880
However, your continued
existence is immaterial.

366

I believe it's time to finish
you off, dear Captain Hirako.

In the end, I hope you'll
remember one thing.

Any betrayal you
can see is trivial.

What is truly frightening,
and much more lethal,

is the betrayal you ca see.

Goodbye.

372
