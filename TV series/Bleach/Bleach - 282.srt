1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,600
Let's cut loose!

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,100
Ahhh!

3
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:13,333
[grunting]

4
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:20,533
Ready? Get 'em,
Stark.

5
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:15,547
You will regret your
insolence toward me! I
will turn you all to
dust!

6
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:24,447
I am the emperor!
Barragan Ruizenban!

7
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:32,147
I am the god of Hueco
Mundo!

8
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:38,647
[grunting]

9
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:48,281
As you are about to
discover, the only thing
that is absolute in this
world is my power!

10
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:59,647
The fact is, I am
supremely powerful. And
as such, the world should
be under my control.

11
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:06,354
What? What's happening
here?

12
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:09,821
<i>You're the one who gave</i>
<i>me the idea.</i>

13
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:13,587
That is your own power,
the only thing that is
absolute in this world.

14
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:14,554
[gasping]

15
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,421
You bastard! What have
you done with your right
arm?!

16
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,854
What game are you
playing?!

17
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,087
It's no game. My arm's
inside you!

18
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:39,887
Curse you, you ant! How
dare you defy a god in
this way?!

19
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:49,921
Your insolence will doom
you to destruction!

20
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:55,954
Your insolence will doom
you to destruction!

21
00:03:56,054 --> 00:04:02,894
Farewell, King of Hueco
Mundo. In the end, it
turned out you shared the
same concerns as most mortals.

22
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:06,929
...A desire to avoid
aging, coupled with a
great fear of death.

23
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:14,361
My goodness, it appears
the Soul Reapers have
actually defeated him---

24
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:18,827
You should pay attention,
or those may be your last
words.

25
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:23,094
There's always time to
die. Why are you in such
a hurry? I'm not going
anywhere.

26
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:33,961
Hm.

27
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:44,227
Our Number Two just
died... and he doesn't
give a damn.

28
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,761
Shameful.

29
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,761
Rose! You can come out
now!...

30
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:59,527
Hachi crushed him!

31
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:05,834
Easy!

32
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:08,167
Aw, come on! Quit
goofin' around and
come out!

33
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,701
Hey!

34
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:11,367
You can let go!

35
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,867
There's a certain
artistic style required
when it comes to climbing
out of rubble!

36
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:20,867
Oh yeah? Well why
don't you work on the
art of not getting buried
in the first place?

37
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:25,967
So Hachi did it, huh? His
opponent looked pretty
powerful too.

38
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:30,967
<i>Yeah. But I would have</i>
<i>liked it if we had</i>
<i>settled things a bit</i>
<i>sooner.</i>

39
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,967
And why's that?

40
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,767
You don't know?

41
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:40,867
Once your comrade falls
in battle, you're gonna
want revenge.

42
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:44,701
You think so? He doesn't
seem like the type to me.

43
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:49,167
That what's unnerving
about him.

44
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:54,134
I mean who wouldn't be
affected by the death of
a comrade in arms?

45
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:59,334
If he's shaken up by his
death, we should strike
while his guard is down.

46
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:04,174
And if he's seething with
anger because of it, we need
to attack him before he snaps.

47
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:09,907
So then what you're
saying is that the more
losses they suffer, the
stronger they become?

48
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:14,974
Well, if that's the case,
perhaps we should consider
our next move cautiously.

49
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,307
Well, we can
talk all day.

50
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:21,907
Or we could
strike first!

51
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,041
Time to kick ass!

52
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:28,141
Slam Tengumaru!!

53
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,207
[roaring]

54
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:40,307
That won't work!
No way!

55
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,041
[grunting]

56
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,207
Hm?!

57
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,974
You won't escape!

58
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:05,314
He's moving slower than
before. Guess he is the
type that gets shaken by
his comrade's death.

59
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,047
Damn it.

60
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:14,147
<i>Stark? Stark!</i>

61
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:18,847
<i>Stay focused will you!</i>
<i>I thought you were going</i>
<i>to handle avenging</i>
<i>Barragan's death?!</i>

62
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:21,147
<i>You are pathetic!</i>

63
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:25,981
I told you revenge is not
my thing. I've had enough.

64
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:30,714
And it looks like Lord
Aizen has no intention of
helping us out either.

65
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:38,081
They're strong. I get
that. I've done all that
I can here.

66
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:41,914
If we continue to fight
them, someone's going
to die.

67
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:45,114
Let's just go home and
take a nap.

68
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,581
<i>Stark!!!</i>

69
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:52,247
What are you, stupid?!
You're Espada Number
One! Start acting like
it!

70
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:57,681
Up until now, all you've
been doing is trying to
act cool. You haven't
been seriously fighting

71
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:02,621
those wimps at all!
Have you completely
forgotten that Lord Aizen
made you number one?!

72
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:11,054
That means he's counting
on your power!

73
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:16,621
So if you don't want to
see all of your comrades
wind up dead and gone, then
you gotta get up and fight!

74
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:24,221
Fine!-Just lay there! Do
whatever you want. But
I'm doing my own thing!

75
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,187
Hm?

76
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:29,854
You got him?

77
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:33,187
Not exactly. He's just
not moving around yet.

78
00:08:33,987 --> 00:08:36,987
He's either watching us
or planning something.

79
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:42,121
Whatever he's up to, we
can't really make a move
until all that dust clears.

80
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:48,954
So you have now lost your
chance to attack him,
because you botched your
previous attack.

81
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:50,787
I'm truly amazed.

82
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:54,687
Shut up! I'll still get
him, just wait and watch.

83
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:57,121
Huh?

84
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:02,727
There he is!

85
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,627
Yeah thanks! Man! Why
is he shooting like
that?!

86
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:09,627
Hey! Would you stop
firing like that!

87
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:10,794
<i>Get ready-he's coming!</i>

88
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:13,861
Only because you
decided to act up.

89
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:17,127
[yelling]

90
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,727
You kept me waiting up
there.

91
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:25,061
<i>We didn't mean to keep</i>
<i>you in suspense!</i>

92
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:26,994
Huh?

93
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:30,527
<i>Up until now, you've</i>
<i>made it difficult for us</i>
<i>to attack you, you</i>
<i>coward!</i>

94
00:09:30,627 --> 00:09:32,927
<i>Stop playin' hard</i>
<i>to get!</i>

95
00:09:33,027 --> 00:09:37,727
Wha--? You have a talking
gun? Now, that's what I
call weird.

96
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:43,827
<i>What of it?! It's</i>
<i>nowhere near as weird as</i>
<i>that star-shaped hairdo</i>
<i>of yours, ya jerk!</i>

97
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:45,894
I told you to
calm down.

98
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:50,161
<i>You've got to be kidding</i>
<i>me! I'm the only one</i>
<i>taking any action here!</i>

99
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:51,561
Hey!

100
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,994
<i>[yelling]</i>

101
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:03,434
The timing between his
shots is completely
different than earlier.

102
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:08,167
Does that mean he's not
the one doing the
shooting?

103
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:10,434
Stop it!-Stop shooting!

104
00:10:10,534 --> 00:10:12,067
<i>No!-Why should I??!</i>

105
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,434
<i>Bulls eye!</i>

106
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,734
[grunting]

107
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:26,801
Ah-ha! I knew it! I
had a feeling you weren't
the one calling the shots!

108
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,134
What's your point?

109
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:33,034
Why is it you won't
attack me? Too stricken
with grief?

110
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,801
Yeah-something like that.

111
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:45,167
<i>You idiot! Your opponent</i>
<i>is reading your every</i>
<i>emotion! You're an open</i>
<i>book!</i>

112
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:46,967
Just shut up!

113
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:52,434
What a surprise! I was
under the impression that
Hollows ever had any
emotions or feelings!

114
00:10:53,234 --> 00:11:00,534
You're one to talk. You
act like a Hollow yourself.
If I remember right, you
had a mask on earlier.

115
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:05,474
Oh, yeah. You're right.
You talkin' about this?

116
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,807
Let's cut loose!

117
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:17,374
<i>Hey, come on! Do</i>
<i>something! NOW!</i>

118
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:19,341
[grunting]

119
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:25,641
<i>What are you waiting</i>
<i>for?! Go after him!</i>

120
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:28,841
You know he's trying to
trick us into chasing him...

121
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:30,541
<i>So what?!</i>

122
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:32,874
<i>There's no way you'd</i>
<i>lose to that clown!</i>

123
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:37,874
Guess I have no choice.

124
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:43,574
Well hello there!

125
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,607
<i>Now Stark!</i>

126
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:50,374
Right.

127
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:52,874
Whoa!

128
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:55,074
Time to Play.
Kinshara!

129
00:12:00,707 --> 00:12:05,947
You're late! If we don't
coordinate our attacks
better, there's no point
in fighting him two on one!

130
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:13,014
Sorry. As I've explained
to your earlier, there's a real
art to making an impression
in any kind of situation.

131
00:12:13,114 --> 00:12:14,681
I don't care!

132
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,647
I'd say, he looks a
bit more motivated now.

133
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:20,281
I'm not too
sure about that.

134
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:24,481
Fighting cowardly types
who lack motivation is
just not my style.

135
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:28,014
It's not as satisfying
when we finally defeat
them!

136
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:33,681
Ahhh!

137
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:37,014
<i>Stark!-Dodge it! Move!</i>

138
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:38,614
I know what to do.

139
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:41,681
You're not in
the clear, yet!

140
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:51,947
That blast of yours
is not powerful enough to
knock out my Kinshara.

141
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,381
What?!

142
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:56,914
Nice work, Rose!

143
00:12:57,547 --> 00:12:58,447
Huh?!

144
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:00,714
Here we go, Tengumaru.

145
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,721
It's about to get a lot
hotter, so deal with it.

146
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:07,287
Hifuki no Kozuchi!

147
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:34,335
[yelling]

148
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:38,335
[grunting]

149
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:44,668
Is she gone?! I think
not!

150
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:46,302
There you are!

151
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:51,302
If you think that's
enough to fake me out,
you're stupid!

152
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:55,902
[screaming]

153
00:13:58,535 --> 00:13:59,902
What are you doing?!

154
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:04,542
Come on, what am I doing?!
What exactly do you think
you're doing, idiot?!

155
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:08,797
I've been charging at
this one for hours,
trying to lure her in for
my finishing blow!

156
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:13,308
You've got some nerve
interrupting my big plan,
shorty!

157
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:14,242
Huh?!

158
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:19,808
Hey Lisa! Just what you
do think you're doing?!

159
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:24,675
You two lovebirds can
settle your quarrel
later, after I finish
this battle.

160
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:26,275
What did you say?!

161
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,875
What was that? Do you
really believe you can
handle me all by yourself?

162
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,908
No-of course not.

163
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:38,275
Well then, if that's not
what you're thinking... are
the three of you going to
fight me?

164
00:14:38,808 --> 00:14:40,808
No, that's not my
plan...

165
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:45,608
Enough already! This is
getting annoying, Lisa! I'm
ready to get this done!

166
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:49,742
Well, I'm aware of
that. I was making
sure.

167
00:14:49,842 --> 00:14:53,808
Do you mind filling me in
on exactly what it is you
guys are talking about?

168
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:56,408
It has nothing to do with
you.

169
00:14:56,508 --> 00:15:00,508
That's where you're wrong.
You two may be used to
fighting together,

170
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,142
but I haven't fought with
either one of you.

171
00:15:03,242 --> 00:15:09,664
If the three of us are
going to fight together,
I need to know what
your plan is, so we can

172
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:12,444
coordinate our attacks to
achieve a successful
result...

173
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:18,415
What are you talking
about, shorty?! Nobody
said Lisa and I are used
to fighting together.

174
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:19,515
Huh?

175
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:21,748
Our personalities
are completely different...

176
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:26,848
And yet, there's one simple
understanding that both of
us do share.

177
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:30,615
The actual time we can
fight full power is very
limited.

178
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:35,215
That's why first, we needed to
find out what our opponent's
fighting style was.

179
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:38,615
[gasping]

180
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:43,082
You thought that three of
us would be fighting you.
Well you're mistaken.

181
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:46,415
There's two of us, and
one Soul Reaper. Got it?!

182
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,682
Hm. How amusing.

183
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:03,648
<i>Are you all right?</i>

184
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:08,155
No-I am not alright.
These two guys are
really strong.

185
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:10,488
<i>There ya go-you're</i>
<i>whining again!</i>

186
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:16,388
I can't help it. When
they put on those masks
their Spirit Energy more
than doubles in intensity

187
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:18,288
and besides that,
there are two of them!

188
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:20,788
And I'm here by myself.

189
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:22,688
<i>You're not by yourself.</i>

190
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:24,688
Hm?

191
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:28,488
<i>The reason you were able</i>
<i>to make this far, is</i>
<i>because you weren't by</i>
<i>yourself.</i>

192
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,155
<i>Long ago, you were</i>
<i>alone.</i>

193
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,422
<i>But ever since then,</i>
<i>we've always been</i>
<i>together.</i>

194
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:41,288
<i>If we just fight</i>
<i>together, we can easily</i>
<i>beat those two.</i>

195
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:42,688
Maybe you're right...

196
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:45,222
I get it.

197
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:46,422
<i>Ready?</i>

198
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:48,488
Let's do it.

199
00:16:58,322 --> 00:17:01,522
There's been a change
in his Spiritual
Pressure...

200
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:02,722
Where is he?

201
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,728
Look-he's above us!

202
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:07,695
Huh? Up there,
what's that?!

203
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:21,562
[howling]

204
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:29,562
What the hell
is he doing?

205
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:32,162
Hey...

206
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:33,362
What?

207
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:34,695
You see that?

208
00:17:34,795 --> 00:17:37,295
<i>Yeah, I know-He's</i>
<i>unarmed.</i>

209
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:39,362
Where did his gun go?

210
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:42,362
Who the heck knows? I'd
say he's taunting us.

211
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,595
He's saying he doesn't
need a weapon!

212
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:54,095
Ready? Get
'em, Stark.

213
00:17:58,662 --> 00:17:59,962
He's coming!

214
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:01,262
I can see that!

215
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:08,168
[growling]

216
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:11,268
Slam! Tengumaru!

217
00:18:13,435 --> 00:18:16,002
Play. Kinshara!

218
00:18:26,602 --> 00:18:30,602
These things are like
flames! There's no end to
them!

219
00:18:30,702 --> 00:18:37,502
How troublesome! I've
always hated peculiar
magic like this. It's
very annoying!

220
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:47,235
Kinshara Sokyoku,
Number 11.

221
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:50,035
Izayoi Bara.

222
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:58,202
It appears your technique
is even more like magic!

223
00:18:58,302 --> 00:19:01,335
Surely you jest! My
technique is an art!

224
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:04,475
Magic and art have
similarities, but are
quite different.

225
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:07,175
Hm?!

226
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:17,175
Ah!

227
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,242
Move around all you want.
I'll still crush you!!

228
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:24,408
What?!

229
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:35,142
[coughing]
Damn it! Hey Rose!
Can you hear me?

230
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,442
What is it?

231
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:40,275
I figured it out! They're
not flames! They're a
Cero!

232
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:45,442
Every one of those wolves
came out from the
magazine of that Espada's
gun! Each one of those

233
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:48,942
creatures is a Cero that
he deliberately fired.

234
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:52,142
And they're dangerous
when they explode at
close range!

235
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:52,842
[howling]

236
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:53,908
[gasping]

237
00:19:57,075 --> 00:19:58,608
Damn it!

238
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:05,315
They are not Ceros.

239
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:11,315
Regular Ceros don't have
enough power to mortally
wound Hollows with the kind
of strength that you possess.

240
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:18,915
I took my own soul and
tore it into pieces and I
have made those pieces
obey me like partners, so

241
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:22,248
that now I may use them
as weapons to destroy
you.

242
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:27,048
These wolf-shaped
warheads are a deadly
combination of both of
us.

243
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:32,048
You see-that is our
Ressureccion, the true
power of Espada Number 1,

244
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,982
Coyote Stark and
Lilinette Gingerback.

245
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:47,115
[groaning]

246
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,215
<i>Stark.</i>

247
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,315
What is it?

248
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:53,182
<i>Looks like they can't</i>
<i>handle our power.</i>

249
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:56,115
I'd say that
you're right.

250
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:57,882
<i>Let's finish this-now!</i>

251
00:20:57,982 --> 00:20:59,182
Okay.

252
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:00,482
Get ready...

253
00:21:05,955 --> 00:21:07,755
[howling]

254
00:21:08,855 --> 00:21:09,988
[growling]

255
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:11,355
[gasping]

256
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:12,388
[gasping]

257
00:21:16,222 --> 00:21:17,988
<i>Let's go.</i>

258
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:38,188
[panting]

259
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:42,855
This game's over. Run
and I'll let you live.

260
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,455
We don't run.

261
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:49,388
I see.

262
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:55,355
There's no choice. I
don't like the term
'finishing blow'.

263
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:58,422
But that's exactly what
this is..

264
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,128
[gasping]

265
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,576
I'm not alone...

266
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:51,876
I'm not alone...

267
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:57,976
No, I'm not alone
anymore...
