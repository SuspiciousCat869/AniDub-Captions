1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,300
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,966
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,500
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,700
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:31,633
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,916
Stay out of our way.

7
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:28,216
Brother, why?!

8
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,649
Hey, c'mon now! Aren't
you going to finish them
off?

9
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:39,082
It sure looks to me like
you were having fun, right?

10
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:42,949
What are you all doing
here?

11
00:02:42,982 --> 00:02:50,216
Is that any way to greet
us? Muramasa said to lend
you two a hand, so we all
came to help with things.

12
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:56,349
Beat those Soul Reapers
to death-Do it now!

13
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:03,916
Get going, Rukia! I'll
stay here and hold them off!

14
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:06,149
As weak as you are?
Don't be ridiculous!

15
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:07,216
Go!

16
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:09,882
Enough chitchat! Your
lives will soon be over!

17
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:13,549
And there will be two
less Soul Reapers to--

18
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:19,049
What the hell is this?!

19
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:20,582
<i>Don't move!</i>

20
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:23,416
No one move!

21
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:25,982
Hey!-Up here!

22
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,149
You're gonna beat who
to death?

23
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,582
Damn bastards!

24
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:40,682
Rukia! You all right?

25
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:45,582
Byakuya.

26
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:08,482
Well it looks like these
guys have us completely
surrounded.

27
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,682
After all that commotion
it's not too surprising. They
were bound to discover us.

28
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:24,482
Byakuya Kuchiki and you
six Zanpakuto... We are
here to take you into
custody.

29
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:30,616
Is that so? But there are
so many of us gathered in
one spot.

30
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,116
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather fight us?

31
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,016
What was that?!

32
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:40,116
If that's your wish, we
will oblige you. We are
ready to go at any time.

33
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,982
<i>Don't let them</i>
<i>get to you!</i>

34
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:45,749
We'll start by forming
a perimeter so they can't
escape from the area.

35
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:48,949
After that, we can take
them on one at a time.

36
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:51,982
Ha! o~ Why make it all so
damn complicated?

37
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:58,049
If we're gonna do this, then
let's just do it! None of us
are going to run away and hide
like cowards!

38
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:02,649
He's right, what are we
waiting for?

39
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:09,749
Hold your ground! And
do not let them escape
the boundaries of the
Squad Six barracks!

40
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:22,716
Anyone with a death wish,
come on, come at me! It'd
be my pleasure to cut you
down with my blade!

41
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:29,749
What?!

42
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:35,282
Sorry. I can't just
stand back and let you
run wild any longer.

43
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:36,582
Is that right?

44
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,682
All right. This time,
there's no one to get
in between us.

45
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:47,582
How about we finish what
we started the other day?

46
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:50,116
Ha. So you want to
settle the score?

47
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,716
I'm not gonna hold
anything back.

48
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:54,416
Then we might have fun!

49
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:05,649
Halt!

50
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,216
Thank you, Tenken.

51
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:21,616
Two against one? Fine
with me.

52
00:06:26,482 --> 00:06:29,549
It's been a while. How
are you doing?

53
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:32,216
Oh, not bad. And you're
looking well.

54
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:37,149
Well, only thanks to you.
I was able to get away from
the cause of my stress.

55
00:06:37,182 --> 00:06:42,416
Hold on. I haven't
identified myself. How
did you know it was me?

56
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:47,716
Oh, I could tell
immediately. The moment
I laid eyes on you I felt
disgusted.

57
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,849
Fujikujaku.

58
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:55,082
Do you mind not calling
me that name? It offends me.

59
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,016
My real name is
Ruriirokujaku.

60
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:02,282
If you insist on calling
me otherwise, I'll kill
you.

61
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:05,582
Well okay then, give it
your best shot.

62
00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:10,549
Rukia! Renji!

63
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:13,949
Don't worry about me.
I'm okay, but Renji's
worn out.

64
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,516
It's not that bad.

65
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:21,849
Well you can stand down
now. I'm gonna bring
these guys to their
senses.

66
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:34,716
Leave him to me. You
return to Muramasa.

67
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:37,149
Very well then.

68
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:39,349
Byakuya!

69
00:07:42,316 --> 00:07:43,816
Stand back!

70
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:45,849
I will not let you
through.

71
00:07:53,716 --> 00:07:55,549
What do you want?

72
00:07:56,716 --> 00:08:00,482
Captain. I'm not finished
talking with you just yet.

73
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:03,449
You still don't
understand that it's
useless?

74
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,916
I'm gonna stop you even
if it means giving my life!

75
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:08,716
<i>Easy Renji!</i>

76
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:13,916
Hmph.

77
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:17,649
We don't want to give
you the impression that
we have nothing left.

78
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,216
Yeah, that's right. In
fact, we haven't even
begun to get serious yet.

79
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:25,449
Thanks guys, I appreciate
it.

80
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:35,849
Scatter.

81
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,016
Not gonna happen!

82
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:42,682
Shikai isn't enough? In
that case...

83
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:44,349
Bankai!

84
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:49,482
Bankai!

85
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,782
Getsugatensho!!!

86
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:06,316
Hmph.

87
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,982
Say, you look pretty good
holding that sword.

88
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,582
Huh?

89
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:17,149
And that feather on your
face... it's probably
faux, but still it's a
nice look.

90
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:22,182
I hadn't gotten the
chance to really check
you out, but so far I am
loving your style.

91
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:24,482
What're you talking
about?!

92
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:27,882
Now, if you would make
the effort to coordinate
with genuine accessories,

93
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,416
I think you'd come
across even better.

94
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:33,982
Then again, you don't
want to overdo it and
look trashy or cheap.

95
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,382
Is there a point to any
of this?

96
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:42,249
I've got it! My
feathers are the real
thing. How about I give
you one of these?

97
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,016
Forget it, they're
ugly.

98
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:48,649
Also, it might be nice to
add a few extra flourishes
to your uniform.

99
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:50,116
Fabulous!

100
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:51,382
Hey!

101
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:55,982
Huh, but how to
compliment your lovely
complexion? Hmmm.

102
00:09:57,382 --> 00:10:02,182
Cut it out will you!!
You're mocking me, and
I do not appreciate it!!

103
00:10:02,216 --> 00:10:04,516
Hmph. I don't know
what you mean.

104
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:09,916
Well you look hideous.
Your face is the absolute
worst.

105
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:14,282
Whatever, be as insulting
as you like, it doesn't
matter to me at all.

106
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:17,849
Do you have any idea why
I took the trouble of
choosing this location,

107
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:20,449
far from everyone else
for our battle?

108
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:25,582
I assume it's because
you don't want anyone
else to see my powers.

109
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:27,316
Exactly right.

110
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:30,716
That confidence... you
might come to regret it.

111
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:37,749
I never regret anything.
That's just the way
that I do battle...
Fujikujaku.

112
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:44,349
I told you, if you keep
calling me by that name,
I will destroy you.

113
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:07,416
Looking for somebody?

114
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:14,516
Well done. As I'd
expect from the leader of
the Stealth Force.

115
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,049
What's the matter?

116
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:23,616
It's been bothering me
for a while now... But
whose Zanpakuto are you?

117
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,849
I am Gonryomaru!

118
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:28,416
Sorry, never heard of
you.

119
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:34,249
My name is Gonryomaru!
The Zanpakuto of Squad
One lieutenant, Chojiro
Sasakibe!

120
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,116
Ah! So you're his
sword!

121
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:39,549
You're so boring, I
couldn't tell.

122
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:44,382
What?! How dare
you! Huh?

123
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,416
Don't worry, Tenken.

124
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:52,982
I'm all right. Chojiro is
the one to blame for all of
this

125
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:55,682
for not having a
presence in his
own squad.

126
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,916
Oh I see, so that's the
reason you betrayed your
master?

127
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:01,716
Shut up!

128
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:04,982
Well that's pretty stupid.
Not that it'll matter in
a couple of seconds.

129
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,949
When I immobilize you, you
can say whatever you want
to your master.

130
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:10,849
I won't go down that
easy.

131
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,382
What is this?

132
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:31,382
What's the matter? For someone
who talks a big game, all you're
doing is running away, coward!

133
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,449
What was that? A
coward?

134
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:40,249
Damn right! Last time, you
couldn't beat me either so
you just ran away! That makes
you a true coward!

135
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:44,082
Battles are waged,
according to the specific
situation.

136
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:46,816
I don't consider
pulling back cowardice.

137
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:51,116
Forcing a fight you
cannot win, that's
just foolish.

138
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:54,716
Man, you sure do talk
a lot of nonsense.

139
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:59,016
Whatever. This time
I'll slice you to bits
before you can run.

140
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:05,349
I'm finding it hard to
believe you're really
Shuhei's Zanpakuto.

141
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:06,749
What?

142
00:13:08,316 --> 00:13:11,516
Well if that's the truth,
I have to assume Shuhei must
have been suppressing his

143
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:14,982
negative energy without
even realizing it.

144
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:20,382
You're a manifestation
of his stress. His darkest
impulses. Isn't that right?

145
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:25,249
What the hell are you
saying?! You think
I'm stress!?

146
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:26,782
Am I wrong?

147
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,816
Don't mess with me!

148
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:36,982
Hado number Thirty One:
Shakkaho!

149
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:55,349
See, Shuhei has always
had my back, no matter
what. So I owe it to him
to get his revenge.

150
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:57,716
Damn you.

151
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:17,182
I'm not finished with
you yet!

152
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:22,949
Extend! Hozukimaru!

153
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:24,082
Huh?

154
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:29,249
Oh. So you've
regained your Shikai
then, partner?

155
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:30,449
Uh-huh!

156
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,682
What's wrong? Don't
tell me you're outta
gas already.

157
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:03,416
You're weaker than you
were the last time around.

158
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:07,649
Not even close. You think
I've been giving it a
hundred percent?

159
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:12,082
Oh yeah. I do remember
you being sort-of slow to
get going.

160
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:16,549
Fine then, how about
I light a fire under you
right now!

161
00:15:46,182 --> 00:15:48,549
What's the matter? Is
that all you've got?

162
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:52,682
<i>Bankai.</i>

163
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:28,122
Don't push your luck,
partner.

164
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:35,422
So you've finally
gotten serious.

165
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:37,822
Then the real fight
starts now!

166
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,155
<i>Over here!</i>

167
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,222
Damn!

168
00:16:56,622 --> 00:16:58,722
And I've got plenty
more!

169
00:17:09,989 --> 00:17:12,522
Come on. That all you
got?

170
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:22,622
No, you idiot. Now I'm
just getting warmed up.

171
00:17:22,655 --> 00:17:28,322
Your spirit is impressive.
But still, you're gonna need
more than that to take me down.

172
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:35,122
Go on, cling to your
silly stubbornness, but
in head-to-head battles
you'll always get crushed.

173
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:36,989
What'd you say?

174
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:42,622
If you're gonna act
like a badass, you
should probably have the
skill to back it up.

175
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,955
Bastard!

176
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:57,789
I warned you and you
still fell short. Are
you stupid or something?

177
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:01,689
Heh. You're the
stupid one.

178
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:03,555
That right?

179
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:08,355
How did you--?

180
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:14,822
What you said about me
before... you're right,
I am pretty stubborn.

181
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:17,789
But still, I'll stick
to the way I do things.

182
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:22,955
I'll fight the way I
always do and still tear
you apart!

183
00:18:23,955 --> 00:18:29,255
Because when you get
right down to it, a man's
not a man if he can't be
himself in battle!

184
00:18:29,922 --> 00:18:35,322
Now you're talkin', partner.
Go on, give it your best shot
and defeat me!

185
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:38,322
You don't have to tell
me twice!

186
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:23,289
You, you're pretty good.
Just what I expected from
my own Zanpakuto.

187
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:29,089
Same here. That's why
I'm at full strength.

188
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,689
Hmph.

189
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:39,422
Huh?

190
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:41,122
What are
you up to?

191
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:46,755
This is the end. I
won't back away past
this line.

192
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:51,989
Hozukimaru, I'll take
all your force and send
it right back at you!
That's a promise!

193
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:56,522
You realize how
powerful this attack
is going to be, right?

194
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:58,189
That sounds perfect.

195
00:19:58,222 --> 00:20:00,355
Come at me, Hozukimaru!

196
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:35,755
I am the Third Seat of
Zaraki's Squad.

197
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,389
Ikkaku Madarame!

198
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:04,455
Pretty good, partner.

199
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:07,322
Yah you're damn right.

200
00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:21,955
Heh. I told you,
didn't I?

201
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:30,189
Lieutenant Iba!

202
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,555
Oh, Lieutenant Kotetsu.

203
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:34,655
What's the situation?

204
00:21:34,855 --> 00:21:38,555
Captain Soi Fon and the
others are fighting at
the Squad Six barracks.

205
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:43,755
We've gotten reports that the
Stealth Force has the enemy
surrounded and is preventing
them from escaping.

206
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:48,722
I see. Then I suppose
we should hurry to their
position and give them
some backup.

207
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:52,755
I agree. Apparently, there
are many fighters who have
been wounded already.

208
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:55,189
What the---
what's wrong?

209
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:56,555
Over there!

210
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:06,089
What is that?

211
00:23:47,123 --> 00:23:51,557
After Shuhei, Marechiyo,
Rangiku, Momo, it'll
be my turn!!

212
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,457
Bring it on, Zanpakuto!

213
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,457
<i>Tetsuzaemon, what was</i>
<i>your Zanpakuto's name</i>
<i>again?</i>

214
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,223
Come at me Zanpakuto!!

215
00:23:58,257 --> 00:23:59,223
<i>You forgot didn't you?</i>

216
00:23:59,257 --> 00:24:01,723
Come on, Zanpakuto, fight
me!!
