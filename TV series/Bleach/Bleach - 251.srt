1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,900
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,600
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,466
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,466
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper,
and dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,266
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:21,962
Damn it! He was able to
revive him.

7
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:23,428
Let's move, Ichigo!

8
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:24,328
Right!

9
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:37,462
He is powerful!

10
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:40,595
It's amazing---How can
the man still have so
much power...

11
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:43,328
...after being sealed
away for so long?

12
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:47,762
You've awakened...
finally!

13
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:53,895
Koga, I've waited for
this moment for so long.

14
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:57,895
Together, we can now
complete the task we
began all those years
ago.

15
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:01,095
Mura... masa.

16
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:07,795
Why... Koga?

17
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:19,895
About now, I'd say Koga
must be feeling pretty
frustrated, having been
locked away in a dark

18
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:22,228
prison cell somewhere.
[chuckling]

19
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:25,362
What a shame, but it
serves him right.

20
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:28,595
[chuckling]
That's very true.

21
00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:32,362
Remember how proudly he
used to boast to everyone
about his power?

22
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:37,362
I bet he isn't boasting
anymore. I just wish I
could see his defeat with
my own eyes.

23
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:40,562
[chuckling]
That's so mean of you!

24
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:45,562
I must tell you... When I
first heard about this plan,

25
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:48,695
I had serious doubts about
whether or not it would work.

26
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:53,195
However... He fell for
it hook, line, and sinker.
[chuckling]

27
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:55,662
He won't be bothering us
anymore.

28
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:58,095
You're right. He's now
irrelevant!

29
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:08,362
What's the problem?

30
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:13,428
Huh?
[terrified reax]

31
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:19,662
Koga!

32
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,562
What?! Koga!
How did you--?!

33
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:41,595
Pardon the interruption!

34
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:44,528
What is it?

35
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:48,062
Sir! Third Seat Kuchiki
broke out of the barracks
jailhouse!

36
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:53,128
He killed the three Soul
Reapers who had him
arrested---He cut them to
pieces.

37
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:20,762
Are you satisfied?

38
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:25,428
Was it not enough?

39
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:30,095
No. When I think back
about what they did, it
still makes my blood
boil.

40
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:31,795
It's time for us to
forget.

41
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:36,962
Those men are no longer
around to torture you.
Let's use this opportunity
to forget the

42
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:40,362
past, and live our lives
looking forward.

43
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:06,062
Sir Ginrei...

44
00:06:07,795 --> 00:06:09,562
Stop, Koga...

45
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:12,662
You must know why I've
come looking for you.

46
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:17,462
Tell me... why did
you have to kill
those men?

47
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,528
I presume you must have
had a reason!

48
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:29,528
Because they betrayed me.
And they did it on purpose!

49
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:38,095
I thought they were
misguided. I assumed
they made a mistake about
my intentions, and were

50
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,828
feeling guilty about
their behavior...

51
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:42,062
I was wrong!

52
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:45,895
They knew what they had
done, and were laughing
about it!

53
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:48,395
Killing them was the only
option!

54
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:53,795
But it didn't help.
Even though it was just,
it didn't make the empty
feeling go away!

55
00:06:54,695 --> 00:07:00,062
I still feel like an
outcast! And what am I
supposed to do now?!

56
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:05,195
By your actions, you've
lost any chance of proving
your innocence before a
tribunal.

57
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:12,028
If you had reflected on
your situation, and remained
in your cell until a proper
investigation could be

58
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:15,662
conducted, you might
have had a chance.

59
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:19,095
Locked iIn a cell?!Why
should I have done that?

60
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:21,195
I didn't do anything!

61
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:25,095
You may not have done
anything at first...
that is true.

62
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:28,595
But what about your
actions now?

63
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:33,128
You may even have
had good cause...

64
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:37,395
But you committed the grave
crime of killing men whose
swords were not drawn.

65
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:41,495
It's likely you
will be put to death.

66
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:53,062
I am well aware of the
tremendous scope of your
abilities.

67
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:58,728
However, you still lack
the heart to make the
most effective use of
those powers.

68
00:08:00,128 --> 00:08:04,395
You were not set up---It
was your overconfidence
that brought all this
about.

69
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:11,495
You bear the name of our
clan. And responsibility
for your actions taken on
its behalf.

70
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:20,028
[screaming]

71
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:25,628
Ginrei....

72
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,028
Hmmm?

73
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:31,195
I get it now.

74
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:33,462
You have the same
attitude!

75
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:35,528
You're just like those
other men!

76
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:40,328
You pretend you're on my
side! You 'befriend'
me! Put me off-guard!

77
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,828
However... That's not
how you really feel!

78
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:51,162
The truth is you hate me!
/You and the others are
jealous of my power!

79
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,528
Koga!

80
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:56,095
Whisper... Muramasa!

81
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:11,962
Ginrei! You bastard!

82
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:15,562
You can't escape so
easily! Undo that
barrier!

83
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:19,228
Damn!

84
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:24,528
Well, fine! I can
wait! I'll just save
killing you for last!

85
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:27,928
I have big plans! There
are plenty of others I
need to kill!

86
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:06,895
What happened to my
sword?

87
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,928
Koga... Koga....

88
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:37,562
Koga...

89
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:42,228
Why is your soul in such
an agitated state?

90
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:44,495
I'm surrounded by
enemies.

91
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:49,228
It's obvious everyone
hates me. I'll have to
kill them, all of them.

92
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:52,462
I have to do whatever is
necessary to survive.

93
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:57,395
You should try and forget
about the past. It's better
for you to live your life
looking forward.

94
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:01,095
Why does everyone around
here hate me so much?

95
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,562
Is it because they're all
jealous of my power?

96
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:08,362
Koga.. Let's you and I
create a new world.

97
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:10,362
I'll help you do it!

98
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:14,028
That has to be the
reason... they wanna
bring me down.

99
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:17,395
I'll just have to strike
back at them first.

100
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,062
Koga...?

101
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,962
There's only one way to
deal... (voice fades...)

102
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:34,495
Koga...

103
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,528
I can't hear your voice.

104
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,628
[laughing]

105
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:01,462
Now whisper...
Muramasa!

106
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:08,328
Muramasa... that's
an order!

107
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:28,169
Head Captain, I have
news. As of yesterday,
Koga Kuchiki has killed
several dozen Soul Reapers.

108
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:33,369
Because of his unique
abilities, even veteran
squad members seem to
have no defense against

109
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:38,636
his assaults. They lose
control of their swords,
and are unable to fight
back.

110
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:40,569
There is one defense.

111
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:48,169
The only way to resist
and overcome Koga's
illusion-type Zanpakuto,
is to understand the

112
00:12:48,203 --> 00:12:53,669
nature of his power, and
close your mind to the
assault at the moment
he turns it on you.

113
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:58,336
But in order to
effectively block his
attack, one must possess
considerable Spiritual

114
00:12:58,369 --> 00:13:02,003
Energy, and an
unyielding mental
fortitude.

115
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:06,803
Aside from myself, if
there is one other person
in our ranks who could
cross swords with Koga,

116
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:12,969
while holding off the
effects of his powerful
Zanpakuto, we might have
a chance to defeat him.

117
00:13:13,736 --> 00:13:15,069
Volunteers?

118
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:26,269
In that case, we have no
choice. I shall personally
help you seal Koga away.

119
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:41,069
Koga...?

120
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,836
Oh, it's you.

121
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:50,536
Why did you kill all
those innocent people in
the Rukon District?

122
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:53,036
The reason was simple.

123
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:56,503
I wanted to send a clear
message to the Soul
Society.

124
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,069
A message? What for?

125
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:05,269
To show the hopelessness
of ostracizing me from
this world. And to show
everyone how helpless the

126
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:09,869
Soul Reapers are in the
face of my power.
[chuckling]

127
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:14,169
To accomplish that, you
go out and kill innocent
people on the street?

128
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:18,269
I don't see why that's
necessary to help create
our vision of an ideal
new world.

129
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:20,036
It seems pretty
excessive.

130
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:21,669
"Our vision...?"

131
00:14:24,803 --> 00:14:28,569
What do you mean by the
word 'our'? You've got
a lot of nerve!

132
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:32,203
Tell me something---Do
you actually consider
yourself my equal?

133
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:33,936
Koga...

134
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:37,936
Let me remind you, you're
my sword! So don't get
too cocky!

135
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:40,236
Just do as you're
told and keep your
mouth shut!

136
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:47,469
You're obviously
exhausted. You
should rest.

137
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:52,269
Stop talking! You're
nothing but a sword, so
quit trying to give me
orders!

138
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:10,736
Well, well---What brings
you two senior citizens
out in the rain?

139
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:14,636
Let me guess---Did you
come to kneel down before
my power?

140
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,569
Apparently, that's not
the reason.

141
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:21,903
<i>Koga...</i>

142
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:26,236
Weren't you always planning
to use your power to help
make your ideals come true?

143
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:31,869
Ideals? Don't make me
laugh... There are no
ideals in this world.

144
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:39,169
We're all left with only
one thing... The despair
of not being able to make
those ideals come true.

145
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:44,369
But... I've now
discovered that despair
releases my true power.

146
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:50,603
Despair is the force that
breaks my shackles and frees
my heart to do as it truly
wishes!

147
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:55,469
Koga... you are
greatly misguided.

148
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:59,336
Those with power are the
ones who get to impose
order on this world!

149
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:03,969
And in the midst of
chaos, that order
prevails, right or wrong!

150
00:16:04,003 --> 00:16:09,103
If that power is
victorious. Even if it's
dark, black will become
the color of what's right!

151
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,403
Koga...

152
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,969
You're wasting your time,
Ginrei...

153
00:16:14,003 --> 00:16:16,669
This man is completely
consumed by power!

154
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:19,203
He can no longer
hear what you're saying!

155
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:37,403
How interesting! I
always hoped I'd have the
chance to cut the two of
you down to size, one day!

156
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:47,803
Tell me, Ginrei, do you plan
to close off your mind again
in order to fight me this time?

157
00:16:47,836 --> 00:16:52,303
I'll let you know now that
you won't be able to use
all of your strength that
way!

158
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:04,103
Bakudo Four... Hainawa!

159
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:18,469
Have you forgotten, Koga?
I know the extent of your
powers better than anyone
else in the Soul Society.

160
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,169
Damn you all...!

161
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:23,536
Whisper...

162
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:26,169
...Muramasa!

163
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:32,236
What's the matter with
you? I command you to
appear!

164
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:35,303
I am your master, and I
order you to release!

165
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:38,203
Muramasa! I know you can
hear me!

166
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:40,769
You're my sword, and you
must do as I say!

167
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:43,269
Something's gone wrong
with Koga's powers!

168
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:45,403
We have to strike! At
once!

169
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:46,769
Yes!

170
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,836
When you're
ready... Ginrei.

171
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:09,869
Right!

172
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:36,869
Good!

173
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:41,503
Shiso... keppu!

174
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:56,003
[screaming]

175
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:00,803
<i>Forgive me...</i>

176
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:09,403
[screaming]
Muramasa!!!!

177
00:19:21,303 --> 00:19:22,903
Koga...

178
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:39,336
Tell me, Koga. Why did
you...

179
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:42,503
...do this to me?

180
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:47,369
What the hell?

181
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:50,336
What in the world
is going on?

182
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:56,303
Koga...?

183
00:19:58,303 --> 00:20:01,203
You never... answered
me when I called.

184
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:07,769
When I was on the verge
of being sealed away, I
called for you.

185
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,603
But I never heard that
call!

186
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:16,469
I called over and over,
but you never came to my
aid.

187
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:21,036
How could it be? I
didn't hear you? Koga...

188
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:27,436
Your voice did not reach
me. Not even one time.

189
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:32,536
And there I was,
waiting so patiently
to receive your call.

190
00:20:35,003 --> 00:20:39,303
If I had heard even one
word, I would have come
to you at any time.

191
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:44,436
I would have assisted you
with all the power within
me. That is how I felt.

192
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:50,003
But for so long... I
never heard your voice.

193
00:20:51,469 --> 00:20:56,036
Eventually, of course,
I learned that you had
been sealed away.

194
00:20:56,936 --> 00:21:01,769
You have to believe me
Koga, from that time to
this... every day...

195
00:21:03,736 --> 00:21:06,003
...I've tried to break
that seal.

196
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:13,003
If you had been there in
the first place, I would
never have been sealed
away!

197
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:23,036
As a Soul Reaper and your
master, I was the one who
gave birth to your power!

198
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:27,369
All you ever needed to do
in your life after that,
was simply obey me!

199
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:31,903
But Koga... weren't
we both of one spirit?

200
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,136
One spirit...?

201
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:37,536
To me, you've always been
nothing more than a sword!

202
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:43,669
Simply a tool of mine!
And a mere tool shouldn't
be so conceited!

203
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:59,236
Koga, you call your own
Zanpakuto nothing but a
tool, and then you try to
kill it...?

204
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:05,403
Disgraceful---You have no
right to call yourself a
Soul Reaper.

205
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:52,546
I don't get it. Muramasa
wanted Koga, Koga stabbed
him, then Byakuya appeared.
What's the deal?

206
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:57,846
<i>You can straighten it all</i>
<i>out when Senbonzakura</i>
<i>explains it to you. Even a</i>
<i>monkey can understand him.</i>

207
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:00,513
<i>A brilliant idea, thank</i>
<i>you so much, Byakuya.</i>

208
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:02,779
Wait a minute, he's
makin' fun of us!
