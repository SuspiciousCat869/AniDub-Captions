NARRATOR: Ichigo
and his friends had

4
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:54,641
entered Hueco Mundo to
rescue Orihime Inoue.

5
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:57,674
But one by one, the powerful
Espadas took them down.

6
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:01,807
Running out of
options, they were

7
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:04,607
shocked to find themselves
saved by Soul Reapers who

8
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:08,207
were supposed to have pulled
out of the battle earlier.

KENPACHI ZARAKI:
What's going on here?

I could more than handle this

by myself.

00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:28,541
No one hears or
believes what I say.

16
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:38,374
So you finally attack.

17

Unh!

-Huh.

26
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:57,074
After all, no matter
what, I'll crush you.

27
00:02:57,107 --> 00:03:00,241
Finding out your name would
really just be a waste of time.

28
00:03:00,274 --> 00:03:01,774
-Oh, really?

29
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,941
And yet I'm thinking it could
end up being quite a problem

30
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:07,407
if I don't get
your name from you.

31

-Why is what?

32
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:09,741
-Why?

33
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,741
Only an idiot would ask that.

34
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,541
It should be rather obvious why.

35
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,707
So that when I stuff
you into a jar,

36
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:19,807
I'll be able to write
your name on the label.

-Hm.

38
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:25,674
I've decided after all that
I will ask you your name

39
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,407
so you'll have a pet name
when you become my marionette.

44
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:43,607
Zommari Rureaux.

45
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,207
Under Zommari's
overwhelming power of Amor,

46
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:48,974
Byakuya gradually lost
control over his own body.

47
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,741
When Byakuya could
not be swayed,

48
00:03:55,774 --> 00:03:58,341
Zommari was forced to
change his mode of attack.

49
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:04,107
He turned his
attention to Rukia,

50
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:05,941
who was still
unconscious following

51
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:09,041
her battle with Aaroniero.

52
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:13,241
Zommari took control of
Rukia's mind and subsequently

53
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:15,741
her entire body.

54
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:18,974
He used Rukia to cut
down Hanataro Yamada, who

55
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:23,341
was trying to offer her
emergency first aid.

56
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:26,641
Then Zommari resorted
to a most cowardly move,

57
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:30,041
setting sister against brother.

58

ZOMMARI RUREAUX: Don't move.

Did you ever stop to
consider what you're doing?

122
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:08,774
You go around so
righteously killing

those who live in existence
of complete futility.

124

Have you thought
about what you do,

about the meaning
of killing Hollows

like us as though it
was a natural thing?

Soul Reapers kill us Hollows
without the slightest

were a natural thing to do.

do you think you are?

a bunch of gods or something?

Who gives you the
authority to kill?

132

Why do you target us Hollows?

133
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,741
Is it because we devour humans?

134
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:47,607
Yes, it's true, we
do devour humans.

135
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,941
But who gave the Soul
Reapers the right

136
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:52,374
to protect human beings?

137
00:10:52,407 --> 00:10:54,041
Did someone give you that right?

138
00:10:54,074 --> 00:10:55,241
I don't think so.

139
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:57,241
The answer is no!

140
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:01,607
No one has given you any such
right to protect the humans.

141
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:04,207
You label us as evil creatures
and go to great lengths

142
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:07,207
to try to get rid of us, and
all because you arbitrarily

143
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:11,207
decided that justice is on
the side of the Soul Reaper.

144
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:13,341
That's the arrogance I speak of.

I would kill you

BYAKUYA KUCHIKI: The reason
I'm killing you is simple.

152
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:47,507
It's because you aimed your

Come on out.

166
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:45,774
Isane Kotetsu, did
Captain Unohana send you?

167
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,141
-Yes.

168
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:48,874
We sensed from a
spiritual pressure

169
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:52,007
that the Seventh Seat Yamada
had been seriously injured

170
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,641
in battle.

171
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:54,174
-I see.

172
00:12:58,374 --> 00:12:59,441
Take care of them.

SZAYELAPORRO GRANZ: [laughs]
How very disappointing.

180
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:57,068
I mean, really, I expected
much more from a captain.

181
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:07,735
Before my power, you
are completely helpless.

182
00:14:07,768 --> 00:14:08,502

-Unbelievable.

190
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,935
-Not Captain Kurotsuchi as well.

191
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:28,402
-Down on your knees,
unslightly for a captain.

192
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,235
That venomous outward
appearance you

193
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:33,268
have is all just a big show.

194
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:36,102
-How dare you?

195
00:14:36,135 --> 00:14:37,668
You will pay for this!

196
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:40,668
No one can do this to
me and get away with it.

197
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:43,568
Do not underestimate me!

-Aren't captains
supposed to be strong?

202
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:54,602
All of you have been
such disappointments.

wildest dreams that I would end

00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:21,835
up here, dying in
a place like this.

-It can't be!

[roars with laughter] This is
so easy it's become boring.

221
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:46,135
I thought there would
be more to it than this.

222
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:47,302
-I got you!

223

-I don't get it.

How are you still
standing in front of me?

-Uh?

00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:26,968
-I'm getting awfully tired
of that parlor trick.

239
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:29,168
Get up, Nemu.

240
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:31,168
-Yes, sir.

241
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:32,668
-I never thought
that the Captain

242
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:35,502
could be defeated
easily, but this?

243
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:37,635
Let me tell you
something, it's sick

244
00:16:37,668 --> 00:16:39,802
that he could endure
that much pain.

-It can't be!

261
00:16:57,402 --> 00:16:59,535
I smashed your organs
and your muscles,

262
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:01,935
so why aren't you dead?

263
00:17:01,968 --> 00:17:04,568
Just what kind of
power do you have?

264
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:06,768
-Stop being such a loudmouth.

265
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:09,402
It's not about the
power that I have.

266
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:14,302
It's just that the power that
you have is pretty damn boring,

267
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:15,868
that's all.

268
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,368
-What?

269
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:19,402
Boring?

MAYURI KUROTSUCHI:
See that Quincy?

271
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:26,668
I have a very cautious nature.

272
00:17:26,702 --> 00:17:30,235
When I fight someone
new, I always

273
00:17:30,268 --> 00:17:34,168
try to lay a trap
during the battle.

274
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:37,235
A favorite is when I
infect my enemy's body

275
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:41,302
with infinite quantities
of surveillant bacteria.

276
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:42,835
-You what?

277
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:44,502
MAYURI KUROTSUCHI:
Through the bacteria

278
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:47,368
I was able to observe
every battle that you had.

279
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:54,102
Therefore, just
before coming here

280
00:17:54,135 --> 00:17:56,002
to take part in this
battle, I created

281
00:17:56,035 --> 00:18:01,568
replicas of every single
organ and muscle in my body.

282
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:02,802
-Ridiculous!

283
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:05,402
I mean, not even a full hour
has passed since I first

284
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:07,802
revealed my power to the Quincy.

285
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:10,368
You couldn't have done
it in such a short time.

286
00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:12,502
It's not possible.

287
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:14,435
You lie!

288
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,835
-On the contrary, I can, I
did, and that is why I'm here.

-Oh boy, here comes
another speech.

293
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:28,035
-You're damn right.

294
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:31,002
I've got something to say
and I'm going to say it.

295
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:31,935
Bacteria?

296
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:33,402
When did you infect me?

297
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:35,402
During our battle?

298
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:38,135
I don't appreciate being
spied on like that.

299
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:40,202
How much did you
observe, anyway?

300
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:42,368
You can't spy on
my private life.

301
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:45,868
That's against basic human
rights, an invasion of privacy!

302
00:18:45,902 --> 00:18:48,068
I demand that you remove
the bacteria right now.

303
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:49,668
Hey, what's with you, anyway?

304
00:18:49,702 --> 00:18:52,068
Are you listening to me?

305
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:53,235
-Quiet, you fiend.

306
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,735
-I was going to call you that!

307
00:18:58,768 --> 00:19:03,468
You're the fiend, you-- you--

308

RENJI ABARAI: Stop it, Uryu.

309
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:06,602
Don't get yourself so worked up!

310

URYU ISHIDA: Don't
stop me, Renji!

311
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:10,435
RENJI ABARAI: But why do you
have to discuss this now?

312
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:12,335
URYU ISHIDA: If
not now, then when?

313
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,335
[rumbling]

314
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:16,802
-Hah.

315
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:22,235
-Oh no!

316
00:19:22,268 --> 00:19:24,935
-Careless again, you
so-called captain.

317
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:29,168
You didn't pay enough attention
to your subordinate's foothold.

318
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,068
-It seems to me
that you're possibly

319
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:32,835
under the wrong impression.

320
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:36,302
True, you can capture me, but
I'm useless as your hostage.

321
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:37,402
-Silence!

322
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:39,068
You will only speak
when spoken to, captive!

323
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:47,602
Are you listening,
so-called Captain?

324
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:50,868
I'm speaking to you.

325
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:53,968
MAYURI KUROTSUCHI: My goodness.

326
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:57,035
Everyone keeps chattering.

327
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:58,202
It's so noisy.

328
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:04,568
Bankai.

329
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:10,002
