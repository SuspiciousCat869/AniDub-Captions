ICHIGO: Ever since the
powers of the Soul Reaper

2
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:10,866
were thrust upon me, my
whole world has changed.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,866
Now I'm Ichigo Kurosaki,
Substitute Soul Reaper,

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,266
and I'm combining my
powerful spirit energy

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,833
with this blade in order
to protect my friends!

00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:01,216
-What exactly do
you think they want?

8
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,182
-Huh?

9
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:16,682
-Ichigo, what's going on?

10
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:19,516
-How'd my Gigai get
all the way out here?

11
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:22,182
ICHIGO: You think Urahara
could have left 'em there?

12
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:24,182
-You can't leave them
out there in plain sight.

13
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:26,482
You'll have to return to
them before someone comes.

14
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:27,382
-Right.

15
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,849
-Boy, what a pain.

16
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:36,816
Why does this have
to be so hard?

17
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:41,616
I hate this.

18
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,516
Why does it have to
be so uncomfortable?

19
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:44,882
-We'll have to be more careful.

20
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,216
[laughter]

21
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,116
-Huh?

22
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:48,649
-Now that you've
finally arrived,

23
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:51,282
it's time for me to explain
the rules of the next game.

24
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:53,282
-I'm really gettin'
sick of this.

25
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:55,616
-Now, that's not a polite
way to greet someone.

26
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:57,616
Especially when I came
all this way to help.

27
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:59,916
I just thought you might
like to know that one of you

28
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:02,649
has been replaced
with an impostor.

29
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,749
-An impostor?

30
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:06,182
-What are you talking about?

31
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:10,316
[laughter]

32
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,482
-Wait a minute.

33
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:13,182
What happened to the third guy?

34
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:15,616
The one who can turn
himself into other people?

35
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:16,982
-Yeah, you're right.

36
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:19,016
Do you think it's possible that
he could have traded places

37
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:20,082
with one of us?

38
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,949
-Yeah, but-- when
could he have done it?

39
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:24,516
-I've got it.

40
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:25,082
-Hey!

41
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:27,182
Hey!

42
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:29,582
I think you ought to take
a look at Chad and Orihime.

43
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:32,049
After all, the enemy would have
had all the time in the world

44
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:35,316
to switch places with either
one while they were captured.

45
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,649
-No way.

46
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:40,082
-Well, there is one
undisputable way

47
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:43,116
to find out if Orihime
is real or not.

48
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:45,116
All you've got to do is
give me one little kiss,

49
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:48,216
and I'll know if
it's the real you.

50
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:49,549
[mumbling]

51
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:50,716
-Put a sock in it.

52
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:52,782
[laughter]

53
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,249
-It's some kind of trick.

54
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:55,516
I say you're bluffing.

55
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:56,849
-I'm not.

56
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:58,616
And instead of
arguing, I suggest

57
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:00,416
you find the impostor quickly.

58
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,549
If you don't find it soon,
your friends at school

59
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:04,416
will all disappear.

60
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:05,882
-Listen, you little brat.

61
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,416
We're not going to play these
stupid games of yours anymore.

62
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:12,216
[laughter]

63
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:13,749
-You'd better not
waste anymore time,

64
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:16,016
because the game
has already begun.

65
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,649
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
Man, that was fast.

66
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,782
She's definitely not normal.

67
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:22,216
RIRIN: Now, I'll explain
the rules for you.

68
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:24,716
It's a little after 8:00, so
you've got less than four hours

69
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:26,082
to figure out who
the impostor is

70
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:28,049
before the clock strikes noon.

71
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,216
If you guess who it is
before time runs out,

72
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,449
you win the game.

73
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:33,649
But if 12:00 comes
and you guess wrong,

74
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:37,082
then everyone in the whole
school is going to disappear.

75
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:38,449
-What do you mean, disappear?

76
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:39,749
-You know.

77
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:40,716
Poof.

78
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:43,849
As in to vanish,
or no longer exist.

79
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:45,782
They'll evaporate into thin air.

80
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:49,149
Your friends will be gone, and
you'll never see them again.

81
00:04:49,182 --> 00:04:51,182
[laughter] Oh.

82
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:53,649
And you only get one guess.

83
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:57,582
Let me know when you've decided.

84
00:04:57,616 --> 00:05:00,116
-Hey!

85
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:02,016
You really think they've
got the kind of power

86
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:04,316
to make everyone in the
whole school disappear?

87
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:05,716
-Who knows?

88
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:08,349
But they didn't seem to have a
problem with Chad or Orihime.

89
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:09,749
-You've got a point.

90
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:13,749
But still, she's talking about
all the students in the school.

91
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:14,982
-What do you guys think?

92
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:15,982
Could she do it?

93
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,449
Do you have any
recollection of what

94
00:05:17,482 --> 00:05:20,549
happened after you got
sucked into that gate?

95
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:21,916
-I'm sorry.

96
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:25,082
But I don't really
remember anything.

97
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,316
-I remember I was
floating in darkness.

98
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:31,249
That's all I know.

99
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:32,382
-Come on, Uryu.

100
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,682
You can always figure
these things out.

101
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:36,149
-Not this time.

102
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:38,649
But it must somehow be
connected to the gate.

103
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:41,249
All I can think is that it
must be some kind of portal

104
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:43,182
to an alternate
dimensional space.

105
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:45,316
-What are you talking about?

106
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,649
-A world beyond anything we're
capable of comprehending.

107
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,116
The number of people may be
of no consequence at all.

108
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:54,216
What I'm worried about is
that unlike the time when

109
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:56,416
Chad and Orihime were
abducted, this time they

110
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,982
said they would make
everyone disappear.

111
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:00,482
-You think it's something else?

112
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:02,182
You think they're gonna--

113
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,516
-Yeah.

114
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:08,082
I think it's safe to assume
that they plan on killing them.

115
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:09,949
-Hm.

116
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:11,982
-This isn't funny anymore.

117
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:13,482
I'm not gonna let that happen.

118
00:06:16,782 --> 00:06:17,982
What are you doing?

119
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:19,749
-Aw, why so tense, Ichigo?

120
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:20,949
You gotta relax.

121
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:21,816
-Good morning.

122
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,149
-It's true.

123
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,449
You can just see the stress
written all over your face.

124
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:26,849
In fact, if I
didn't know better,

125
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:28,282
I'd say you've
been out all night.

126
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:29,616
Ah!

127
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:31,082
That's it, isn't it?

128
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:32,582
You went out and
partied without me.

129
00:06:32,616 --> 00:06:33,649
I wanna die!

130
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:35,582
-Well, that's not
exactly how it happened.

131
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:37,049
-Orihime.

132
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:38,549
-What's going on, Tatsuki?

133
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:40,549
-Orihime, where's your uniform?

134
00:06:40,582 --> 00:06:41,482
-Hey, what's the deal?

135
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,549
Why's this guy still here?

136
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:44,516
-Well--

137
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:45,916
-I bet you're
related, aren't you?

138
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:46,449
-Huh?

139
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:46,949
-Yeah.

140
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:47,916
That's it.

141
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,582
Right?

142
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,149
-What?

143
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:50,149
What are you, crazy?

144
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:51,116
-Sweet!

145
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,816
So how long you
planning on staying?

146
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,682
-Uh, well, I hadn't really--

147
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:56,049
-You don't go to
school, or what?

148
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,482
-No, not right now.

149
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:58,482
-Then where do you live?

150
00:06:58,516 --> 00:06:59,416
What do you do?

151
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:00,716
What kind of girls do you like?

152
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:01,549
-Shut up, already.

153
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:02,682
-I knew you two were related.

154
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:04,316
You're so much
alike, it's scary.

[school bells]

156
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:12,482
-We're late.

157
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:13,682
-What was that for?

158
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:14,682
What did I do?

159
00:07:14,716 --> 00:07:15,349
-Out of the way!

160
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:15,849
I'm late!

BOY: Keigo, are you all right?

163
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:20,349
-We should go too, Orihime.

164
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:20,849
-Oh.

165
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:21,349
Yeah.

166
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:25,249
-So what now?

167
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:26,382
You have a plan?

168
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,716
-We haven't got a choice.

169
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,282
If it weren't for us, those
guys wouldn't even be here.

170
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:33,682
So it's our responsibility
to find the impostor

171
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:34,816
and keep our friends alive.

172
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,316
-Chad, where are you going?

173
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:43,582
-I was planning
on going to class.

174
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:46,649
If people get suspicious,
it'll just slow us down.

175
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:48,182
-That makes a lot of sense.

176
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:51,416
Besides, we're not getting
anything done here.

177
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:52,949
And it would probably
be a good idea

178
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:55,682
to call Urahara's shop
as soon as possible.

179
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:56,616
-Why?

180
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,382
-To ask about your
body, and why it

181
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,449
was left on the school grounds.

182
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:01,449
-Yeah.

183
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,216
Good idea.

184
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,649
-TEACHER: Now then, I think
it's important that you fully

185
00:08:05,682 --> 00:08:08,749
understand this question before
you attempt to answer it.

186
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:11,849
This question points to the fact
that two juxtaposing factors--

187
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:14,182
-(VOICEOVER) When was there
time when someone could have

188
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:17,216
switched places with one of us?

189
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:19,116
- --under certain conditions.

190
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:20,516
We've already established that--

191
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:21,749
-(VOICEOVER) Damn.

192
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,949
How am I supposed to figure
out who the impostor is?

193
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:25,582
TEACHER: --Captain
Ahab in "Moby Dick."

194
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:28,949
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Is it Uryu?

195
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:31,049
Orihime?

196
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,182
What about Chad?

197
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:36,616
RENJI: Hey.

198
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,616
That copycat guy is pretty
good at becoming someone else.

199
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,282
Isn't he?

200
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:42,682
-What are you doing in here?

201
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:43,682
Are you crazy?

202
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:44,949
-No, I'm just bored.

203
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,516
-You're the crazy one.

204
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:48,882
-Get out, or you're
gonna blow it.

205
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:49,782
-Relax.

206
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:51,549
Don't be so uptight.

207
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:52,582
Hm?

208
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,616
Whoa.

209
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,349
So this is what a
textbook looks like.

210
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:56,882
-Would you get the
hell out of here?

211
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,916
And why do you always have
to get so close to me,

212
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,749
and breathe all over me
with your disgusting breath?

213
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:03,116
-You're a nutcase.

214
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:05,382
I just looked at your book,
and you go totally ballistic.

215
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,449
-Oh, you want to see
ballistic, do ya?

216
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,349
-Ichigo, if you and your
brother want to fight,

217
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:14,916
then you can do it outside.

218
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:17,616
-Why does this always happen?

219
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:18,182
Dammit.

220
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:19,616
-Heh, heh, heh.

221
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:20,716
You got detention.

222
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:21,416
-Oh, yeah?

223
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:22,582
Well, you got it, too.

224
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:24,749
-Heh, heh, heh.

225
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:25,882
-(VOICEOVER) This is weird.

226
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,482
Even for him.

227
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,349
Was he ever this messed up?

228
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:33,982
Could he-- is the the impostor?

229
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:34,749
OK, Renji.

230
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,282
-Huh?

231
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:37,049
-Take it off.

232
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:38,016
-Huh?

233
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:39,749
-Just take it off, already.

234
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:41,116
-What are you talking about?

235
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,716
ICHIGO: I said, take it off.

236
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,949
If you don't, I'll
take it off for you.

237
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:46,082
-Wait, what are you doing?

238
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:49,316
-You know what
I'm talking about.

239
00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:50,849
-Hey, get off me, will ya?

240
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,316
-I'll rip it off of you.

241
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:53,549
Just hold on.

242
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:55,016
I've waited long enough.

243
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:55,949
RENJI: Get off me.

244
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,582
ICHIGO: I told you
to take it off.

245
00:09:57,616 --> 00:09:58,549
RENJI: Stop!

246
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:00,516
-Their old forbidden love.

247
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:03,449
How sweet.

248
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:05,416
-Take it off.

249
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:08,949
-Ichigo's acting a little
unusual, don't you think?

250
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,382
-He's just laying there.

251
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,949
-That's not it!

252
00:10:11,982 --> 00:10:12,749
His Gigai.

253
00:10:12,782 --> 00:10:14,082
Don't you get it?

254
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:16,182
I thought if I could get him
to take off his Gigai, that

255
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,416
would be a sure way to figure
out if it was really him

256
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,782
or not, because it would be
almost impossible to change

257
00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:21,916
into a Soul Reaper.

258
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:23,516
-I see what you're
saying, but we still

259
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:27,316
don't have any idea how
powerful his copying ability is.

260
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:30,916
You can't make rash
decisions like that.

261
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:32,482
We can't rule out
the possibility

262
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:34,682
that he has the power to
copy someone's abilities

263
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:35,882
as well as their appearance.

264
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:47,616
[laughter]

265
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,882
-They're thinking.

266
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:55,682
Now then, maybe it's time
for me to turn up the heat.

267
00:10:55,716 --> 00:10:57,649
[school bell]

268
00:10:57,682 --> 00:10:59,149
-Hey, wait up.

269
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:00,649
Hey, can I borrow your--

270
00:11:03,182 --> 00:11:05,182
-Aw, man.

271
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:09,516
They gotta get more girls'
bathrooms in this school.

272
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:10,849
Huh?

273
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:12,782
I thought everyone
went back to class,

274
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:15,116
and I was the last one here.

275
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:15,749
Hm.

276
00:11:15,782 --> 00:11:16,916
Is someone there?

277
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,316
Is someone in there?

278
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:24,816
Hello?

279
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:36,616
Huh?

280
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:48,882
[scream]

281
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:08,247
-I'm issuing orders
to temporarily cut off

282
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:09,814
all passage to the
world of the living

283
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:12,247
for at least the next few hours.

284
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:14,614
Sentaro, give the order
to close the gate.

285
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:15,281
-Yes.

286
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:17,281
On the double, sir.

287
00:12:17,314 --> 00:12:18,781
Close the gate!

288
00:12:18,814 --> 00:12:20,081
MAN: Close the gate.

289
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:20,914
MAN: Close the gate!

290
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:21,981
MAN: Close the gate!

291
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,247
YORUICHI (VOICEOVER):
That's right.

292
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:33,181
I asked Ukitake to
close the Senkaimon.

293
00:12:33,214 --> 00:12:35,847
Sui-Feng, I mumst ask a favor.

294
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:38,214
I need you to come here
before they close the gate.

295
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:40,481
It's of the utmost importance.

296
00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:41,247
-Yes.

297
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:42,114
Of course, Lady Yoruichi.

298
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:45,881
-Listen up.

299
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:48,447
Today in PE, the boys
will be playing baseball,

300
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:50,647
and the girls will
be running track.

301
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:52,947
-Aw.

302
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,081
COACH: Quiet down, everyone.

303
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:56,747
OK.

304
00:12:56,781 --> 00:12:58,014
Who's absent today?

305
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,814
-Well, uh, Tatsuki's
not in class today.

306
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,714
-I saw her earlier.

307
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:04,281
Does anyone know where she is?

308
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:05,047
Oh, well.

309
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,747
She's probably just tardy.

310
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:08,481
RIRIN: I've already got one.

311
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:11,947
Better find the fake soon
or more will disappear.

312
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:12,914
-What do you mean?

313
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:13,914
[laughter]

314
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:15,881
-Hey, wait a minute!

315
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:17,881
Oh, no.

316
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:20,014
COACH: What's going on?

317
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:21,014
-Orihime.

318
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:21,881
Orihime!

319
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:22,914
Wait!

320
00:13:22,947 --> 00:13:24,981
-Where do you four
think you're going?

321
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,114
-We suddenly came
down with something.

322
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,281
So we're going to the nurse.

323
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:29,181
COACH: Wait a minute.

324
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:30,247
Get back here!

325
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:31,614
You expect me to swallow
a story like that?

326
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:32,547
-Do you know what's going on?

327
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,014
-I haven't got the
slightest idea.

328
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:38,447
-Tatsuki!

329
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,247
Tatsuki was wearing this.

330
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,981
-Orihime--

331
00:13:50,014 --> 00:13:51,214
-She didn't do anything.

332
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,047
She has nothing to do with this.

333
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,281
-Take it easy.

334
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:56,147
At this point, we don't
really have any proof

335
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:57,881
that they've actually taken her.

336
00:13:57,914 --> 00:13:59,347
-No!

337
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,347
-Orihime--

338
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,981
-How dare you tell
me to take it easy.

339
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:05,847
Aren't you worried
about Tatsuki?

340
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:10,614
Maybe it was you!

341
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:12,981
I can't take it anymore.

342
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:14,981
I can't trust anyone.

343
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:16,714
Why is this happening?

344
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:20,081
Which one of you
is the impostor?

345
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:21,581
What have you done with her?

346
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:23,547
What have you done with Tatsuki?

347
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:25,547
Bring her back!

348
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:26,947
-Orihime, stop it.

349
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:32,314
The enemy is doing this in order
to turn us against each other.

350
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:34,414
Tatsuki's going to be all right.

351
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:36,381
I'll take care of it.

352
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:38,847
-Please, Ichigo.

353
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:40,347
-Trust me, Orihime.

354
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:41,747
I won't let her disappear.

355
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:42,381
RIRIN: Aw.

356
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,214
Isn't that sweet?

357
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:46,181
But the question is,
can you back it up?

358
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:48,181
All of your talk
won't do any good

359
00:14:48,214 --> 00:14:50,014
if you can't find the impostor.

360
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:51,881
The clock is
ticking, and it won't

361
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:55,414
be long now before all your
other friends disappear.

362
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:56,314
-Why did you take her?

363
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:58,047
We still have time!

364
00:14:58,081 --> 00:14:58,781
-Don't worry.

365
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,881
She's safe enough.

366
00:14:59,914 --> 00:15:02,047
Though at least now
you know we're serious.

367
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:05,214
But you've only got an
hour to figure it out.

368
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:07,514
See ya later!

369
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:09,814
-Wait a minute!

370
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:12,147
-They're good at running away.

371
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:13,314
-Damn.

372
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:16,647
[phone ringing]

373
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:18,281
-I can't believe this.

374
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:19,081
What a pain.

375
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:21,014
[phone ringing]

376
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:22,647
-Yeah, yeah, hold your horses.

377
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:25,781
I'm comin'.

378
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:26,614
Hello.

379
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:29,481
Urahara's shop.

380
00:15:29,514 --> 00:15:30,147
Yeah, right.

381
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,447
The spiky haired guy.

382
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:32,614
What do you want?

383
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:33,647
Huh?

384
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,781
What about Yoruichi?

385
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:37,147
I don't know.

386
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:39,047
She was here this morning.

387
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,214
That's right.

388
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:41,047
What?

389
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:43,947
How should I know where she is?

390
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:44,847
I don't know.

391
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:47,581
The owner is always-- huh?

392
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,414
Aw, what a pain.

393
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:50,014
Yeah, fine.

394
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:50,581
Whatever.

395
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:51,481
I'll tell him.

396
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:54,414
Later.

397
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:55,747
-They're not there.

398
00:15:55,781 --> 00:15:59,981
Yoruichi and Urahara have
been gone since this morning.

399
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:00,781
Renji.

400
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:02,381
Find anything out?

401
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:04,514
-I don't know what's going
on, but for some reason

402
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,981
I can't contact
the Soul Society.

403
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:10,014
That means I can't
collect any information.

404
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:11,781
-Oh, no.

405
00:16:11,814 --> 00:16:13,081
-What now?

406
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:14,847
We're starting to
run out of options.

407
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:16,514
-This sucks.

408
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:18,714
-Let's try to stay calm, OK?

409
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:20,547
So far we've been
trying to distinguish

410
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:22,814
who the impostor is
by their behavior.

411
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:24,347
Since that hasn't
worked, maybe we

412
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:27,014
should try to solve this
from a subconscious level.

413
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,447
-What are you talking about?

414
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:31,681
-I'm talking about intuition.

415
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:33,014
-Intuition?

416
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:35,514
-We all trust our intuition,
and if our choices match,

417
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:39,614
then that person is
obviously the impostor.

418
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:42,214
-So, just trust my intuition?

419
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:59,181
Based on my intuition, the
impostor-- the impostor

420
00:16:59,214 --> 00:17:01,581
is you, Uryu!

421
00:17:01,614 --> 00:17:02,081
-Me?

422
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:02,747
No way.

423
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:04,847
That's impossible.

424
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:05,381
Wait.

425
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:05,981
Watch this.

426
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:19,147
I'd like to see the
impostor do this technique.

427
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:21,481
It's obvious to me
who the impostor is.

428
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:22,781
It's him.

429
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:24,614
We've known him the
shortest amount of time,

430
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:27,647
so we'd be less likely
to notice any changes.

431
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:28,714
-That's just stupid.

432
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,614
Everyone knows that the
least suspicious one

433
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,047
is the most suspicious.

434
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:33,181
And that's you.

435
00:17:33,214 --> 00:17:35,714
That's the way it always is.

436
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:36,614
-But I'm suspicious.

437
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:39,547
He's less suspicious than I am.

438
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:41,514
Just look at his innocent face.

439
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:42,281
-What?

440
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:44,181
How can you think it's me?

441
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:46,981
If it wasn't for you, we
wouldn't be in this mess

442
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:48,314
right now.

443
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:50,981
I think you planned the whole
thing just to confuse us.

444
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:51,514
You impostor.

445
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:57,014
-Argh!

446
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:58,581
I hate this!

447
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:01,181
Which one of you is
the freakin' impostor?

448
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,181
-Stop it, all of you!

449
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,147
I can't take anymore of this!

450
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:05,647
[laughter]

451
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:08,214
-Not having much luck, huh?

452
00:18:08,247 --> 00:18:10,381
You'd better hurry,
because time's almost up.

453
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:11,381
Go ahead.

454
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:12,314
Look outside.

455
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:17,214
BOY: Come on, Keigo, step it up!

456
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:19,481
BOY: Hey, batter,
batter, batter!

457
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:20,247
BOY: All right!

458
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:21,214
BOY: Oh yeah, we got this!

459
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:22,581
-I got it, I got it!

460
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:24,147
Huh?

461
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:25,081
BOY: Where'd he go?

462
00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:26,014
COACH: Aw, come on.

463
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:27,014
How could you miss that?

464
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:28,447
-I'm tired.

465
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:29,981
I'm just gonna cut class.

466
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:30,814
-You can't.

467
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:32,981
You'll get weekend detention.

468
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:34,981
Huh?

469
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,447
[gasping]

470
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:37,147
GIRL: What?

471
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:37,881
GIRL: What's going on?

472
00:18:37,914 --> 00:18:38,947
GIRL: What happened?

473
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:40,447
-They're gone.

474
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:42,247
-How could you do that?

475
00:18:42,281 --> 00:18:43,947
-What the hell do you
think you're doing?

476
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:48,581
-What's going on?

477
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:50,181
What's everyone screaming about?

478
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:53,414
[screaming]

479
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:56,181
-Huh?

480
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:57,581
-You-- how could you?

481
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:59,947
-A lot more disappeared
than I expected.

482
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:01,181
-I'll get you for that!

483
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:07,914
RIRIN: We're not
playing tag right now.

484
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,847
I sure hope you're ready,
because you've only

485
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,181
got a few minutes left.

486
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:13,281
Although it's not like you'll
be able to figure it out,

487
00:19:13,314 --> 00:19:14,947
no matter how much
time I give you.

488
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:16,147
-This isn't fair.

489
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:17,581
-Hurting them would
be meaningless,

490
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,414
and it won't
accomplish anything.

491
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,981
They're not what you came
here for, so just let them go.

492
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:24,814
-No, I have to abide by
the rules of the game.

493
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:28,214
Well, if nothing else, you've
got a one in five chance.

494
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,647
I guess you've got no choice
but to leave it to luck.

495
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:32,581
Either that, or
you could give up.

496
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:34,547
If you're willing to
do that, I might just

497
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:37,481
be able to come up with a way
to get all your friends back.

498
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:38,781
-You could really do that?

499
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:40,214
-Tell us what we have to do.

500
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:41,614
-Oh, that's easy.

501
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,181
To save the lives of your
friends, all you have to do

502
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,214
is give up your lives
in exchange for theirs.

503
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:47,614
-What?

504
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:49,547
-I think that's fair.

505
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:51,814
'Cause after all, you're
the one playing the game,

506
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:53,047
and none of your
friends would have

507
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:54,881
had to disappear if
you'd been smart enough

508
00:19:54,914 --> 00:19:56,514
to figure out the answer.

509
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:58,181
You need to take your
battles seriously.

510
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:06,108
What was that for?

511
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,011
-Yoruichi?

512
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:11,744
Hey!

513
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:12,671
Yoruichi!

514
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,490
Yoruichi!

515
00:20:16,244 --> 00:20:18,578
-Yah!

516
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:20,711
-I thought they were
coming to save us?

517
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:23,278
-I wonder where they were
going in such a hurry?

518
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:24,378
-That was scary.

519
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:30,878
-Hey, Chad?

520
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:33,144
-Uh-- yeah, Ichigo?

521
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:35,978
-You have any idea what
that was all about?

522
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:37,378
-No.

523
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:40,644
But that is one tough lady to
attack us all alone like that.

524
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:42,144
-Huh?

525
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:43,444
-Come on, already.

526
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:45,144
I can't wait forever.

527
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:46,978
Are you gonna make
a choice or not?

528
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:47,811
-Yeah.

529
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:49,144
Sorry about that.

530
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:49,844
I've decided.

531
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:51,644
-Huh?

532
00:20:51,678 --> 00:20:54,844
-So Chad, I can think of
a pretty good explanation

533
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,311
why you don't know.

534
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:59,744
You see, Yoruichi has the form
of a cat while she's over here,

535
00:20:59,778 --> 00:21:01,878
but you wouldn't
know what, would you?

536
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:03,244
It's not possible.

537
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:05,711
You could only know that if
you'd been to the Soul Society,

538
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:09,711
and you've never been there.

539
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:10,611
Game's over.

540
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,844
You're the impostor.

541
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:16,244
[laughter]

542
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:19,211
-So, you finally figured it out.

543
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,944
Very good.

544
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:23,511
Mind telling me what it
was that tipped you off?

545
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:25,711
I thought my
transformation was perfect.

546
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,244
-Chad would never have been
frightened that easily.

547
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:30,111
You should've known better.

548
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:32,344
-I appreciate your input.

549
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,511
It seems I still
need improvement.

550
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:37,078
-You're gonna pay
for what you've done.

551
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:39,411
-Playing with people's
lives is not some game.

552
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:41,178
It's time you understood that.

553
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:43,111
-I don't care whether
you understand or not.

554
00:21:43,144 --> 00:21:44,544
I'm going to beat you to a pulp.

555
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:46,278
-Wait, can't we discuss this?

556
00:21:46,311 --> 00:21:49,111
-Shut your face!

557
00:21:49,144 --> 00:21:51,278
KURODO: I'm so sorry.

558
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,144
I must have let my
guard down a bit.

559
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,411
-You're doing very well.

560
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:56,578
The score is two to zero.

561
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:57,811
-Tatsuki and all our friends!

562
00:21:57,844 --> 00:21:59,744
Give them back to us now!

563
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,611
RIRIN: They're safe
for the time being.

564
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:03,778
But we have one
more game to play.

565
00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:05,611
-We've had enough of
your stupid games!

566
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:08,178
Go play by yourself!

567
00:22:08,211 --> 00:22:11,411
RIRIN: I'm sorry to
hear you feel that way.

568
00:22:11,444 --> 00:22:13,844
Maybe you haven't noticed that
since the impostor replaced

569
00:22:13,878 --> 00:22:18,511
the big boy, the real one's
not with you right now.

570
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:19,844
Yes.

571
00:22:19,878 --> 00:22:22,011
We've been taking very good
care of him all this time.

SUI-FENG: Lady Yoruichi,
I've taken the canned food

574
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:07,667
you gave me and
officially employed it

575
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,067
for use in the Stealth Force.

576
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:10,367
YORUICHI: Marvelous, isn't it?

577
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:11,867
Ichigo, can I
interest you in one?

578
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:14,067
ICHIGO: I told you
before, that's cat food.

579
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:15,267
SUI-FENG: Silence!

580
00:24:15,301 --> 00:24:16,867
Don't criticize Lady
Yoruichi's culinary choice.

581
00:24:16,901 --> 00:24:19,867
ICHIGO: She'll have
you on catnip next.

HITSUGAYA: Golden.

00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:34,567
-Captain Hitusgaya.

586
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:36,534
-What's the meaning
of this, Ukitake?

587
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,734
Why are you closing
the Senkaimon?

588
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:41,101
-Well, I've received
word from Yoruichi

589
00:24:41,134 --> 00:24:44,834
about some disturbing events
in the world of the living.

590
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:47,267
I almost completely
forgot that I have snacks.

591
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:47,801
-Huh?

592
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:48,601
-Here.

593
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:49,501
Take these.

594
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:51,934
Oh, and I've got candy, too.

595
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:53,401
And if you come
by my room later,

596
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:55,234
there's plenty more
where that came from.

597
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:57,301
I've got oodles and
oodles of snacks.

598
00:24:57,334 --> 00:25:00,534
-Why does he always
give me this stuff?
