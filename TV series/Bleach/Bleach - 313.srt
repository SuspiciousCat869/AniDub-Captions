1
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:06,949
Huah!

2
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:08,216
Heh!

3
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:09,149
Hnnh!

4
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:08,118
<i>[attack yells]</i>
<i>Huaah!</i>
<i>Eyaah!</i>

5
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:09,052
<i>Tchaa!</i>

6
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:15,352
Huaaah!

7
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:19,452
Gaah!

8
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:22,218
Are the two of you
finally done?

9
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:25,118
Ichigo just went flying,
so I guess this fight is over.

10
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:27,252
I did not
go flying!

11
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:30,352
I just slipped!
This match isn't over!
Come on, Renji!

12
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:31,585
If that's what
you want.

13
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,585
Raah!

14
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:38,252
Ugh. What a waste.

15
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:47,185
Honestly! How'd I get
dragged into this mess you
call a training session?

16
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:51,285
You never stop complaining,
yet you certainly appear
to enjoy yourself.

17
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:53,185
And you're not even a
member of Squad 11.

18
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:54,718
Well, neither are you.

19
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:56,452
Just so there's no
misunderstanding,

20
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:59,885
I definitely had a winning
strike against you earlier,
Ichigo.

21
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:02,885
Yeah, in your dreams!
You never touched me!

22
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:05,152
You have a big bruise on
your forehead, buddy.

23
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,185
You have one, too, in
case you haven't noticed!

24
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:08,118
I do not!

25
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:10,818
Grr!
Grr!
My, don't the two of
you get along well!

26
00:03:10,852 --> 00:03:12,318
[in unison]
No we don't! Not at all!

27
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:15,718
Well, In regard to this
training exercise,

28
00:03:15,752 --> 00:03:19,652
Renji's experience allowed him
to dominate, and therefore
made him the winner.

29
00:03:19,852 --> 00:03:21,052
S'cuse me?!
Mmm-hmm.

30
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:24,352
It wasn't a battle with
actual Zanpakuto, but still.

31
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:27,318
That was one fight.

32
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:31,285
So! How 'bout we settle
this once and for all
in the next round?!

33
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:32,518
Sure, fine with me.

34
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:33,385
Grrr!

35
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:35,185
Uh... hm?

36
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:38,752
Here you go.

37
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,118
Gee, thanks
a lot.

38
00:03:41,152 --> 00:03:42,318
Very thoughtful.

39
00:03:43,185 --> 00:03:44,752
Hey, Seizo!

40
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:47,252
We need some tea, too!

41
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,052
Right!

42
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:57,918
Hm?

43
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:08,918
I sense a faint
Spiritual Pressure
from a Hollow!

44
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:09,818
Let's go find it!

45
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:10,752
[all]
Right!

46
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,885
So tell me again,
why are you coming
along with us?

47
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:16,652
I happen to be free
right now, so I'm just
going with the flow.

48
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:19,518
You sure have odd interests.
You're not even in Squad 11.

49
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,152
Hey pal,
neither are you.

50
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:29,785
[moans and cries]

51
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:33,252
[sobbing]

52
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:38,985
We were too late to stop this.

53
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:41,952
It appears the Hollows
attacked this village
as a group.

54
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:46,085
When they sensed our
troops were nearby,
they ran off together
in a coordinated move.

55
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,952
It's very rare for them
to be so organized.

56
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:50,452
Yeah, you're right.

57
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:53,652
Listen up! Our priority is
to rescue any survivors!

58
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:54,785
Are you serious?!

59
00:04:54,818 --> 00:04:56,752
We're not gonna
chase them down
and kick some ass?

60
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:59,118
Did you not hear
my orders?!
Get moving!

61
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:00,685
Imbeciles!

62
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:05,818
He should have called
Squad Four for a
clean-up job like this.

63
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:10,352
We have Seizo, why bother them?
They wouldn't be anywhere near
as efficient.

64
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:16,918
Seizo, over here!
We have another one!

65
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:17,552
Coming!

66
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,085
There's gonna be a
lot more people you
have to look at.

67
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:23,952
Lucky for us you're
part of this squad.

68
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:27,052
Certainly makes our
lives a lot easier,
I'll tell you that.

69
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:32,985
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Okay, there you go.</i>
<i>You're all finished.</i>

00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:34,718

your help.

71
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:35,352

You're welcome to use this.

00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:47,052
Mmh.

<i>Seizo! Get over</i>

78
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:50,118
Right!

79
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:51,618
Go ahead.

80
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,285
What 's the matter?

81
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:56,052
Do you know
that Soul Reaper?

82
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:58,185
Huh? You mean Seizo?

83
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:02,185
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>I've never met him, but</i>
<i>he seems different from</i>
<i>the rest of these guys.</i>

84
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:05,352
It's kinda got me wondering
why he's in Squad 11.

85
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:09,318
Now that you mention it,
he is quiet. He doesn't
really stand out, does he?

86
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:14,052
But he's been like that
ever since I've known him,
back in the day when I
was a member of Squad 11.

87
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:16,718
[Ikkaku]
What are you guys
jabbering about over here?

88
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:20,118
Ikkaku. You've
known Seizo a lot
longer than us.

89
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:21,585
Has he always
been this quiet?

90
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:22,352
Huh?

91
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:30,018
Beats me.

92
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:31,485
Hmmm.

93
00:06:40,185 --> 00:06:41,018
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

94
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:42,052
Hm?

95
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:46,052
I wanted to thank you for
giving me this earlier.
Here you go.

96
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:49,085
Sure! Thanks for
bringing it back.

97
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:54,718
By the way, do you
need any help?

98
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:56,018
No thanks.

99
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,252
After all this time, I've
discovered that no-one else
in Squad 11 can do this
work as fast as I can.

100
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:02,552
Really?

101
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:06,152
Besides, why would you
want to waste your time
doing this drudge work?

102
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:08,318
Wouldn't you have
more fun, training
with the others?

103
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:09,952
Why do you think it's fun?

104
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:11,952
<i>Because I could tell</i>
<i>just by watching you.</i>

105
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:16,718
When you were in there,
training with everybody,
you looked truly happy.

106
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:19,885
That was just me, getting caught
up in the flow of things.

107
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:22,452
But I do have one
word of advice.

108
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:26,918
The practice match you had
was a fight using wooden
swords, instead of Zanpakuto.

109
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:30,152
In which case, it becomes
a contest of sword skills,

110
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:32,085
not the amount of
your Spirit Energy.

111
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,418
So what are you getting at?

112
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:36,352
A tree with weak roots
is easy to topple over.

113
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:39,218
Especially when it
has a lot of fine
branches at the top.

114
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:41,952
Roots, you say?

115
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:45,518
A sword is nothing but
the tip of a fine branch.

116
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:48,118
What I'm saying is that
putting your strength
into your sword,

117
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:52,418
is meaningless if your roots,
your lower body parts, aren't
firmly planted in the ground.

118
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:55,718
I see.

119
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:00,385
Hup!

120
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:02,918
Yaaaaahh!

121
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:09,652
Huh?

122
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:13,052
HYYYAAAAAHHH!

123
00:08:15,652 --> 00:08:17,552
Agh! Oww!

124
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:20,552
What's your problem?
You totally overdid
that attack.

125
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:24,552
Sorry about that.
I couldn't help myself.
Ha ha ha ha!

126
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:26,718
Where did you pick up
that move, anyway?

127
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:28,352
Natural talent.

128
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:29,685
Is that so?

129
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:31,452
Eh?
Eh?

130
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:33,585
Oh. Seizo.

131
00:08:33,618 --> 00:08:34,585
Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot.

132
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:36,285
I wanted to--

133
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:37,385
<i>Hey, Seizo!</i>

134
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:38,018
Ut!

135
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:38,952
Yes!

136
00:08:44,218 --> 00:08:45,052
<i>[Yumichika]</i>
<i>Seizo?</i>

137
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:48,985
Oh! You mean
Seizo Harugasaki!

138
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:52,485
So that's his last name.
Now that I think about it,
I never really knew it.

139
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:55,118
And so, what is it you
want to know about him?

140
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:56,818
Why is he in Squad 11?

141
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:01,818
Maybe I'm outta line here, but
most of the members of Squad 11
are rough, vulgar, and crude.

142
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:05,052
You may not feel that way
about it, but that's been
my impression for a while.

143
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:06,718
I don't know if I
should be offended.

144
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:09,685
I mean don't forget, I'm
a member of the squad, too.

145
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:11,652
I didn't necessarily
mean you.

146
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,252
You didn't exclude
me, did you?!

147
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:16,485
[sigh] This guy, Seizo,
seems very nice.

148
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:20,085
He's kinda mild-mannered,
yet the people in the squad
treat him just terribly.

149
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:22,352
Well yeah, because
he's physically weak.

150
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:26,585
Squad 11 is a combat squad.
Its members are in training
to be aggressive.

151
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:29,418
Someone who's weak is
gonna end up getting
treated badly.

152
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:34,318
I guess that makes sense.
It doesn't feel like he
has much Spirit Energy.

153
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:38,485
But somehow, he just
doesn't seem like an
ordinary person to me.

154
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:39,818
Hmh.

155
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:43,818
Good instincts.
He joined the same
time as Ikkaku.

156
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:45,318
He's been here that long?

157
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,485
<i>[Yumichika]</i>
<i>Back then, he was regarded</i>
<i>as a promising Soul Reaper.</i>

158
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:53,018
<i>I can tell you from first-hand</i>
<i>experience, his sword skills</i>
<i>were a sight to behold.</i>

159
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:54,185
Huaaah!

160
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,618
<i>His style of fighting</i>
<i>was dynamic, yet steady.</i>

161
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:59,185
<i>He was straightforward,</i>
<i>never resorting to tricks.</i>

162
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:03,218
<i>And his skills always stood</i>
<i>out, even against more</i>
<i>experienced opponents.</i>

163
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:04,985
Away you go!

164
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:07,518
<i>But in the end, it turned</i>
<i>out his fighting style</i>
<i>didn't match up well</i>

165
00:10:07,552 --> 00:10:11,718
<i>against men who were used to</i>
<i>taking advantage of every</i>
<i>weakness they could uncover.</i>

166
00:10:11,752 --> 00:10:13,685
<i>He lost repeatedly to Ikkaku.</i>

167
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:15,418
You haven't figured it out,
have you?

168
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:19,852
There's no way you can take me
on and hope to win, without
using some sort of ploy.

169
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:24,418
I know it's impossible.

170
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:27,318
But no matter what happens,
I won't give up!

171
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:30,485
Who would ever believed
he was that good?

172
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:33,218
This brings up an obvious
question, Yumichika.

173
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:37,285
Why is someone with his
raw skills as a warrior,
being treated like some
kind of gofer?

174
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:39,452
Hmm.

175
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:45,985
<i>It started back when he</i>
<i>and Ikkaku were first on</i>
<i>the same team, trying to</i>
<i>track down a Hollow.</i>

176
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:48,852
Something's wrong here.
Our scout hasn't come back.

177
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:52,285
Ikkaku! I'll go find him.
You and the others cover me!

178
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,818
Don't be ridiculous, Seizo!
I'm the one who should be
going out to search!

179
00:10:55,852 --> 00:10:59,318
Just think! How often
have you lost to me when
we fought head to head?

180
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:01,552
I never lost to you!
Those were draws!

181
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,385
Heh! I've heard
of sore losers,
but this is nuts!

182
00:11:04,418 --> 00:11:05,718
<i>[fear scream]</i>
<i>HUAAAHH!</i>

183
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,218
The Hollow!

184
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:08,752
Takashige!

185
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:09,785
Damnit!

186
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:11,118
Wait a minute, Ikkaku!

187
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:13,218
What for? The weak
follow the strong!

188
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:15,485
That's the rule
at Squad Eleven!

189
00:11:17,418 --> 00:11:19,685
Hyaaah!

190
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:23,385
Heh! That was easy!

191
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:25,818
Heh!

192
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:26,852
Huh?

193
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:29,118
What the hell?
I can't pull it out!

194
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:32,518
Your Spirit Energy
is mine!

195
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:33,118
Whaa?

196
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:37,852
[big scream of anguish]
HUAAAAHH!

197
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:41,885
<i>[Yumichika]</i>
<i>That Hollow possessed the</i>
<i>ability to suck away a</i>
<i>person's Spirit Energy.</i>

198
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:47,852
Seizo lost most of
his Spirit Energy
fighting that beast.

199
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:51,385
<i>Since then, he's</i>
<i>never really been</i>
<i>able to get it back.</i>

200
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:54,752
Now I understand
what happened.

201
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:58,385
Once his Spirit Energy was
depleted, everything changed.

202
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,752
He could no longer fulfill
his duties as a combatant
Soul Reaper.

203
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:06,252
<i>And yet, in spite of that,</i>
<i>he refused to transfer to</i>
<i>another squad.</i>

204
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:09,718
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>I heard what happened.</i>

205
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:10,618
Hmm?

206
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:13,518
I hear, you're pretty
awesome with a sword.

207
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:16,152
Nahh.

208
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:19,418
You talked about me having
strong roots, and how
happy I looked in combat.

209
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,918
It sounded patronizing,
and I began to wonder.

210
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:25,952
How can a man who's been
trained as a warrior, be happy
doing this kind of work?!

211
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:27,352
Uh! Sorry.

212
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:28,485
It's all right.

213
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:31,885
I have to believe you
want to swing a sword.

214
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,485
And fight, as well.

215
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:37,152
So if that's truly the case,
why are you smiling and doing
odd jobs for everybody?

216
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:39,752
And what is it
with Ikkaku?

217
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:43,385
I mean, I guess he bears a
lot of blame for the loss
of your Spirit Energy.

218
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:46,085
Beats me.

219
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:47,685
But what's with the attitude?!

220
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:49,885
Uhh...

221
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:02,085
At this point in time,
Third Seat Madarame is
way too far above me.

222
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:04,918
And the fact is,
I really have no
strength left to fight.

223
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,552
I'm sure I don't even
enter his thoughts.
And I understand that.

224
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:12,118
Why would he be
interested in
anything I do?

225
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:13,585
'Cause you're part
of the squad!

226
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:15,518
Not for...
much longer.

227
00:13:15,985 --> 00:13:17,918
In three days,
I will be discharged.

228
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:18,752
What?

229
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:24,018
I have only one option.
I have to leave quietly.

230
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:27,152
If you only have three
days left, then that's
all the more reason--

231
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:28,018
Enough, already!

232
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:07,258
[Ikkaku]
Huh??

233
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:10,658
You want me to have
a match with that
bastard, Seizo?

234
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:12,124
Yeah.

235
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:14,824
You have got to be kidding!
I'm not interested in
fighting that weakling!

236
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:16,224
Well he may be weak.

237
00:14:16,258 --> 00:14:18,858
But from what I
understand, he was
strong at one time.

238
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,191
That was long ago.

239
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:24,124
And believe me, there's no
way he would want to have
a match with me now.

240
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:28,924
Even if I was willing,
shouldn't you be trying to
convince him instead of me?

241
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:33,924
For cryin' out loud!

242
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:35,691
As I told you,

243
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,758
No. I have no intention
to fight him.

244
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,491
And why not?!

245
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:42,791
I know if you were willing to
enter into a match, Ikkaku
would agree to, as well!

246
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,558
Even if I did, I can assure you,
I would only disappoint him.

247
00:14:47,024 --> 00:14:48,924
I prefer that he remember me...

248
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:53,658
<i>as I was back then, when I</i>
<i>had confidence in my skills.</i>

249
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:59,258
So please understand.

250
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:02,791
You need to stop
now, Ichigo.

251
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:03,858
But Renji...

252
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:06,258
Seizo, I want
to apologize.

253
00:15:06,524 --> 00:15:08,891
Lieutenant Abarai,
please don't let
it bother you.

254
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:10,924
I get what
you're saying.

255
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:12,324
Then how about this?

256
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:13,791
Let's you and I
have a match!

257
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:16,558
If I lose, I back off.
If I win, you fight Ikkaku!

258
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:18,558
You don't understand
a damn thing, Ichigo!

259
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,858
I'm confused.
You ask for a match,

260
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:23,358
But I just told you
I don't have the
strength left to fight.

261
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,491
What would be the point?

262
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:29,691
I heard you. But this match
isn't going to consist of
conflict, in the usual sense.

263
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:31,424
Huh?

264
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:38,224
Doing the laundry,
putting bandages away,
and cleaning!

265
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:40,958
The one who finishes all
these chores first, wins!

266
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:43,458
Really? I do these
chores every day!

267
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,324
I would definitely
have the advantage!

268
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:47,824
We won't really know
until we try! Ready?!

269
00:15:56,324 --> 00:15:57,524
Hyyaaa!

270
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,591
[panting]

271
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:04,424
That's it.
Seizo wins.

272
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,558
Gyahh!

273
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:06,358
Damn it!

274
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:09,091
Wasn't even close, buddy.

275
00:16:09,124 --> 00:16:11,391
I'm sorry, Ichigo.
So are we done?

276
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:13,691
No way! I'll take you
on again tomorrow!

277
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:14,791
Say what?

278
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:16,424
Ichigo.
What's going on?

279
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,424
What do you mean?
I never said I'd give
up after one try!

280
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:23,291
Don't you understand?
You can't beat me, no
matter what you do.

281
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:26,758
I know it's impossible!
But no matter what,
I won't give up!

282
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:27,758
[gasp]

283
00:16:28,124 --> 00:16:29,158
Augh!

284
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:38,291
You haven't figured it out, have
you? There's no way you can take
me on and hope to win, without
using some sort of ploy.

285
00:16:40,924 --> 00:16:42,424
I know it's impossible!

286
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,091
But no matter what happens,
I won't give up!

287
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:49,824
Yumichika?

288
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:50,858
We're heading
out now.

289
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:55,624
Those damn Hollows have finally
re-appeared. We need you with
us for logistical support.

290
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:59,291
Right! Sorry, but it
looks like a rematch
is out of the
question for now.

291
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:00,224
Ready?

292
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:00,991
Let's go!

293
00:17:02,558 --> 00:17:03,624
Auugh!

294
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:04,658
Take this!

295
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:15,858
Damnit! They're all
getting away, Ikkaku!

296
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:17,624
This isn't happening!
Men!

297
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:20,491
The logistical support team
will attend to the casualties!

298
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:22,591
Those of you who can
move, follow me!

299
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,624
Ichigo, let's do it!

300
00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:24,324
Right!

301
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,958
Go, Ichigo!
We can handle
everything here!

302
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:28,724
Sorry!

303
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:34,124
Are you all right?

304
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:38,458
This wound is nothing, Seizo!
I'm not a weakling, like you!

305
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:45,224
He he ha ha ha ha!

306
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,591
[chuckles]

307
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:50,824
Ragh!

308
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:56,491
He he he he!
What a bunch
of fools!

309
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:59,758
Yeah, they never realized
we had doubled back here.

310
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,191
What the hell?!

311
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:03,724
We moved way too
fast for them!

312
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,724
Now that they're on a
wild goose chase, we've
come back for our meal!

313
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:10,458
But don't worry.
We're very thorough.

314
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:13,891
We'll chew you up real good
before we swallow you!

315
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:21,724
Rrgh!

316
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:25,124
<i>[Seizo]</i>
<i>Five Hollows.</i>

317
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:30,758
<i>How can I take them on?</i>
<i>It would be impossible</i>
<i>to fight them all!</i>

318
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:35,524
I know it's impossible!
But no matter what happens,
I refuse to give up!

319
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:36,258
[gasp]

320
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:50,591
Ha ha! Is that
your only weapon?

321
00:18:50,624 --> 00:18:55,524
You'll never be able to
take on the five of us
with that one puny sword!

322
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,558
Yes, it's impossible!
But you'll have to kill
me before I give up!

323
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:02,491
Haaah!

324
00:19:07,491 --> 00:19:09,224
Hyaah!

325
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:18,291
<i>[panting]</i>

326
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:33,491
I never expected you
to give us so much
trouble, with your
meager Spirit Energy.

327
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:36,658
But this is the
end of the line!
Prepare to die!

328
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:40,724
<i>I guess this is the end</i>
<i>of the line for me.</i>

329
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:46,224
<i>But that's okay.</i>

330
00:19:47,391 --> 00:19:49,424
<i>Thank you, Ichigo Kurosaki.</i>

331
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:54,691
<i>You helped me regain my honor</i>
<i>as a Soul Reaper, here in my</i>
<i>final moments of existence.</i>

332
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,391
Here I come!

333
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:11,024
What's happened?
Ikkaku, you've returned!

334
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:12,458
Oh no, Seizo.

335
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:13,558
Huh?

336
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:17,024
It's you, my friend,
who's returned.

337
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:24,024
Let's take these guys out
together, whaddya say?

338
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:24,724
Right!

339
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,058
Hyaaah!
Hah!

340
00:20:53,124 --> 00:20:55,624
Hyaaah!
Hyaaah!

341
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:08,658
Huh?

342
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:16,791
The two of you came out
here to see me off?

343
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:17,658
Yeah.

344
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:21,558
Thanks, I appreciate it.
You both take care of
yourselves now.

345
00:21:22,224 --> 00:21:24,058
And you, as well.

346
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:24,958
Thanks.

347
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:33,324
For Seizo Harugasaki.
Bow!

348

349

<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Hey, Ikkaku. Where did</i>
<i>Kenpachi go, anyway?</i>

350
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:51,751
<i>[Ikkaku]</i>
<i>Now that you mention it,</i>
<i>I haven't seen the Captain</i>

351
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:53,584

352
00:23:53,618 --> 00:23:55,884

<i>It's probably that time of</i>
