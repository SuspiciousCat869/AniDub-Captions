2
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:52,966
-Rukia Kuchiki.

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,433
Yes, we finally found you.

4
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,133
-Then give me that
blade, Soul Reaper.

5
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,166
-My name is Rukia,
Rukia Kuchicki.

6
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,766
-Hey, can I ask you something?

7
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,266
Do you have a crush on Ichigo?

8
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,766
--Huh?

9
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,033
-I'll be sitting
next to you from now.

10
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,733
My name is Rukia.

11
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:31,733
-[gasps].

12
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:35,366
It's-- it's you.

13
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,666
-Tell me, how do I
drink from this thing?

14
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,600
-Uh, you gotta
poke a hole in it.

15
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:41,300
You just use the sharp
end of your straw.

16
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,666
-[laughs].

17
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,166
-[groans].

18
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,233
-My goodness.

19
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,866
I better get you to
the nurse's office.

20
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,133
-That's all believable to
me, along with flying pigs

21
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,333
and the Tooth Fairy.

22
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:58,566
-Anyway, Rukia, tomorrow
I'll be sure to bring some

23
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,566
of my other yummy desserts so
you can try them out yourself.

24
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,366
Then we can enjoy them together.

25
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,833
-OK, I'll think about it.

26
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:09,866
-Aww, that's the same thing
you said to me last time.

27
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,800
You keep saying that,
Rukia, I'll think about it.

28
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:13,966
-Oh, really?

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,300
I guess I do.

30
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,066
-I did not.

31
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,866
Take that back right now.

32
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,100
-Do you want more?

33
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,366
RUKIA NARRATING: If I'm
going to leave here one day,

34
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,233
all these memories will only
be a burden, compassion,

35
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:31,366
friendship and affection.

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,666
-Ichigo and I are just friends.

37
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,900
That's all there is to it.

38
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,700
RUKIA NARRATING:
They're a nuisance.

39
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:41,100
All these feelings aren't
necessary for a Soul Reaper.

40
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:44,700
They're unbecoming of me.

41
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:47,833
I've remained in world
for far too long.

42
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:49,233
It's time to move on.

43
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:58,066
RENJI (OFFSCREEN):
finally get it, don't you?

44
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,566
-Huh?

45
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,100
-But you know, I really
gotta hand it to you.

46
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,433
I'm very impressed.

47
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:08,966
By skulking around so
long here in this world,

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,700
you actually managed to prolong
what little life you have left,

49
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,533
Rukia.

50
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:16,200
-Renji.

51
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,166
What in the world
are you doing here?

52
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,900
-So you're telling me you
had two hunters from the Soul

53
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,233
Society lurking
right behind you,

54
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:45,900
but you were so lost in thought
that you didn't even notice,

55
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:47,800
huh?

56
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,066
I'll grant you that you
spent the last few months

57
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,500
in that Gigai, but
still, don't you

58
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,766
think you've grown
just a little too lax?

59
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,466
Spit it out, Rukia.

60
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,966
So where is the human who
took all of your powers

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,933
away from you?

62
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:12,800
-What are you talking about?

63
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,466
Just because I'm inside
a Gigai right now,

64
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,766
it doesn't mean I've
lost any of my power.

65
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,200
And anyway, why
would you even think

66
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,800
it was a human who
took that power?

67
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,200
-It was a human.

68
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,133
It's obvious.

69
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,466
Just look at you.

70
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,700
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
that stupid human expression

71
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,266
on your face.

72
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,700
-[gasps].

73
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:39,966
-You're a runt from the
Rukon district like me.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,300
And yet, you were taken in by
the noble house of Kuchiki.

75
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,166
They put a lot of time
and money into making

76
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,800
you the perfect Soul
Reaper, one of the elite.

77
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:50,300
Huh?

78
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,400
Am I wrong?

79
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,600
You're the great Rukia
Kuchiki, aren't you,

80
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:56,000
gaping like some
worthless human.

81
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:58,133
What the hell is
the matter with you?

82
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:05,200
Right, Captain Kuchiki?

83
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:13,933
-Huh?

84
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:26,333
Byakuya.

85
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:30,200
It's you, brother.

86
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:30,700
-Rukia.

87
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:47,766
-Passing your Soul Reaper powers
to a human is a grave sin.

88
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,166
Be glad the higher-ups
were compassionate

89
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,200
and let us handle this,
instead of the execution squad.

90
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:58,700
Now, tell us where
this human is, Rukia.

91
00:06:58,733 --> 00:06:59,933
It's over.

92
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:02,300
We're taking you
in, and then, we're

93
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:07,433
going to find the human who
stole your powers and kill him.

94
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:08,933
Don't even try to protect him.

95
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:10,700
You know what just happened.

96
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,600
The only reason you
dodged my attacks

97
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,500
is because I let you dodge them.

98
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:18,300
The next move I make with
this blade will be fatal.

99
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,900
-[groans].

100
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:49,733
-This is it.

101
00:07:59,233 --> 00:07:59,700
Huh?

102
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,366
[grunts]

103
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,300
-Two armed men attacking
a defenseless young girl?

104
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,433
I have to tell you,
it's not a pretty sight.

105
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:25,800
I don't know.

106
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,033
Just isn't my style.

107
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:30,033
Know what I mean?

108
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:30,900
-All right, kid.

109
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:32,733
You can see us.

110
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:36,033
So tell me, who
the hell are you?

111
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:38,866
-Hmm, just a classmate.

112
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,600
-Classmate, huh?

113
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:42,133
-One who hates Soul Reapers.

114
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:52,033
-Uryu Ishida, what
are you doing here?

115
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:55,033
-Just passing by, nothing
for you to worry about.

116
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:58,500
But if you must know,
I had a sudden urge

117
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:01,066
to go to Sunflower Seams,
this all-night thread shop

118
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,266
I frequent.

119
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,000
So I happened to be out
for a stroll this evening

120
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,433
and came across
your little party.

121
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:08,166
I mean come on, it's
not like I sense

122
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,066
the presence of Soul
Reapers in the city

123
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,700
and then ran off into the
night carrying a bag of needles

124
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,600
and thread with me
to use as an excuse

125
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:16,700
when I finally
caught up with you.

126
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:19,400
RUKIA (TO HERSELF): That's
the worst lie I ever heard.

127
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,800
He's not that stupid.

128
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,600
-Although I understand
if you're skeptical.

129
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,733
RENJI (OFFSCREEN): Hey, I
just asked you a question.

130
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:32,466
I said, who the
hell are you, kid?

131
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,400
Hey, that's fine.

132
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:37,066
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

133
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,633
We could just skip ahead to
the part where I kill you.

134
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,233
-Wait a minute, Renji, he's
got nothing to do with it.

135
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,633
-Just what are
you talking about?

136
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,300
I already gave you an answer.

137
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,033
As I already told you, I'm a
classmate of Rukia's, and I

138
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,800
hate Soul Reapers.

139
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,566
-Well, I don't care
much for your answers,

140
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,800
so why don't you try again?

141
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,933
-Uryu Ishiga, it's a pleasure.

142
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:04,766
-Huh?

143
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,933
What with you all of a sudden?

144
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:10,300
-Well, I just thought
you had a right to know.

145
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,600
You may be a Soul
Reaper, but you

146
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:15,500
should know the name of the
one who's about to kill you.

147
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,000
-That settles it.

148
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm going to cut you in half.

149
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,500
-When in the hell is Rukia
planning on coming home

150
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,566
tonight?

151
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,633
I mean it's already
2:00 in the morning.

152
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,100
Ah, well, it's not so bad.

153
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:40,633
At least I can get a break
from the Soul Reaper business

154
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,200
tonight.

155
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:42,066
[muffled cries]

156
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,966
-What the hell?

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,833
OK, what's that noise?

158
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,766
[muffled cries]

159
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,266
-Back here.

160
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,500
You?

161
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:56,900
[muffled cries]

162
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:57,400
-Kon?

163
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,700
Just what exactly are
you doing back here?

164
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:05,700
[muffled cries]

165
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,866
-I thought you were
taking a little trip.

166
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:18,900
-Man, thanks for the solid.

167
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:20,666
You totally saved my ass.

168
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,433
-Don't mention it.

169
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:25,233
-I couldn't even see who was
coming in tied up like that.

170
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:27,600
I was trying to figure
out if it was you or not,

171
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:31,300
and all I had to go on was
sound, you know? [chuckles].

172
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:31,800
[screams]

173
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,533
What the hell did
you do that for?

174
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:38,700
Is that how you treat a
best friend right after he's

175
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,566
been through the worst
suffering of his life?

176
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,566
-Shut up.

177
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,433
We're not best
friends, and you stink.

178
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:45,200
-Look, it's not my fault.

179
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,466
Rukia was the one.

180
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,266
Oh my gosh.

181
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,366
That's right, Ichigo.

182
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,333
Rukia's in trouble.

183
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:52,300
-Get out of my face.

184
00:11:58,566 --> 00:11:59,733
-Look at this right here.

185
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,700
Are you telling me you've
been home all this time,

186
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,366
and you didn't see this, pal?

187
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,300
-Yeah, so what is it?

188
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,800
-What's the matter with you?

189
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,666
It's obviously a farewell note.

190
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,033
-Farewell note?

191
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:12,300
-So then what were you doing
goofing around in the bathroom?

192
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,966
Shouldn't you have
already hit the road?

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,633
-What?

194
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,333
Are you even awake?

195
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:18,133
I didn't write the damn letter.

196
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,700
Rukia did, you fathead.

197
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,733
After that whole
incident with the dress,

198
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:23,800
I wanted to come back here
and say goodbye to her

199
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,133
before hitting the road.

200
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,966
And it wasn't with my
tail between my legs, OK?

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,600
I just thought it was the
honorable thing to do.

202
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,733
So I decided I'd pop in.

203
00:12:36,566 --> 00:12:37,033
Rukia?

204
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:45,400
You see, Rukia,
she's-- she's left us.

205
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,600
She's left us for good.

206
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,800
-What do you mean?

207
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,800
She left without even
telling me she was going?

208
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:51,966
-Shut up.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,600
Shut up.

210
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:53,800
How should I know?

211
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,766
I was right here with her
when she decided to go.

212
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,733
She just up and left
here without offering

213
00:12:57,766 --> 00:12:59,400
even the slightest explanation.

214
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:02,133
Who the hell cares about you?

215
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,866
Oh, Rukia. [sobs].

216
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,000
-Oh, man.

217
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:07,166
Just what is this?

218
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Damn, Rukia, what the
heck are you thinking?

219
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,666
"Enjoy decoding.

220
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,133
Before besir beten bereasons,
I befear I must bego."

221
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,033
Ah, what the hell?

222
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:29,966
"Here's a hint."

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,133
What the frig is this?

224
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,933
Son of a-- Why are there
so many Bs in this,

225
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,333
and what's with the damn bunny?

226
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:37,800
Oh, I get it.

227
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,100
Lose the bunnies.

228
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,633
"For certain reasons, I must go.

229
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:55,466
Do not look for me
and do not worry.

230
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,366
After you read this, make
sure that you burn it.

231
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,300
And also, if you can, keep
yourself hidden for a while."

232
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,833
I don't get it.

233
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:09,566
I mean, she doesn't even
give a reason for leaving.

234
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,633
-Don't you understand?

235
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,866
Something must have happened.

236
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,066
She said to burn the letter
and keep ourselves hidden.

237
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,000
What could be so
terrible that got

238
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:21,400
Rukia this worried about us?

239
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,700
Isn't it obvious?

240
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,200
Something's happened between
her and the Soul Society.

241
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,266
Use your head a little.

242
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,833
Rukia's is the
middle of something,

243
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,633
and she doesn't
want us involved.

244
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:34,000
So she-- she struck
out on her own.

245
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,900
-Ah.

246
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:38,466
-Poor Rukia.

247
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,733
What if she's, uh, dead.

248
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:42,166
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
That's enough.

249
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,600
-Huh?

250
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,966
-We can't just go jumping
to conclusions, OK.

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,966
Let's just think for a minute.

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,333
All of this
yammering isn't going

253
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:52,300
to help us solve anything.

254
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,933
-Ichigo?

255
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,800
-Let's go come, Kon.

256
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:00,200
I'm changing into a
Reaper and finding Rukia.

257
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,500
-All right, I'm with you, buddy.

258
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,133
Uh, do you mean again?

259
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,333
-I don't have another choice.

260
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:10,066
I've got to get that
gikongen out of your belly.

261
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,933
-No, no wait!

262
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:13,433
[screams]

263
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,333
-Hold it.

264
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:19,500
-Forget it.

265
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:20,366
-Knock it off.

266
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,633
I don't have time for this.

267
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,433
Rukia's in danger right
now, and I can't do anything

268
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,900
to help her unless
I'm a Soul Reaper.

269
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,533
-(MUFFLED) Well,
that's not the point.

270
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,866
Who in the right mind would
want a hand shoved down

271
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,266
their throat?

272
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,733
-This suck just as bad for me
as it does for you, you idiot.

273
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,666
MR. HAT-AND-CLOGS
(OFFSCREEN): Hi, there.

274
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,033
Boy, it looks to me like
you're in a bit of a bind

275
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,433
this evening.

276
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:44,033
Is there anything I can do to
help speed things along here?

277
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:50,100
-[groans].

278
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:56,266
-Well, well.

279
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,900
Looks like you were
nothing but talk.

280
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:02,800
RUKIA (TO HERSELF):
Renji's strong.

281
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,566
He's even stronger than before.

282
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,000
I can barely move,
let alone stop him.

283
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:13,166
-Now then, let's finish
this off, shall we?

284
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Remember this as you
depart this world,

285
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:23,266
Renji Abarai is the name
of the man who killed you.

286
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,033
-Hold on.

287
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,633
-Pleasure knowing you.

288
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,200
So who in hell's name are you?

289
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,233
-The name is Ichigo.

290
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,433
I'm the one who's
gonna beat your ass.

291
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:39,266
How's it going?

292
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,633
-Wearing a shihakusho.

293
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,200
I don't know you.

294
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:48,600
What squad are you from?

295
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,966
Check out that
overgrown zanpakuto.

296
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,100
-Oh, yeah?

297
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,166
So you're saying I
got a big one, huh?

298
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,233
It's funny.

299
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,500
To tell you the truth,
I've been thinking

300
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,733
this thing looked kind of
big next to Rukia's blade.

301
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:03,333
But you know, I've got
to say, up until now, I

302
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:06,533
haven't had anything
else to compare it to.

303
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:09,933
-The size of it reflects a
Soul Reaper's spirit energy.

304
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:13,566
How did a snot-nosed little
brat get a sword that size?

305
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,300
Is he for real?

306
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,533
-Ichigo, you fool.

307
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:20,900
Why did you come?

308
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:23,466
-Oh, I get it.

309
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,900
You're the lowly human
who took Rukia's powers,

310
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:28,200
aren't you, Carrot Top.

311
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:28,700
-Huh?

312
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,066
-Come on.

313
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,700
Come on.

314
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:39,700
What's wrong?

315
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,600
You got a big sword
just for show?

316
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,100
Huh?

317
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:44,600
Huh?

318
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:45,100
Huh?

319
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:06,866
-Ichigo!

320
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:15,066
-Don't go.

321
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,566
-Uryu.

322
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,933
-It's over.

323
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:25,100
Very soon, you'll be dead, and
Rukia will get her powers back.

324
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:28,633
And then, Rukia will go back
to the Soul Society to die.

325
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,733
Man, you are as
dumb as they come.

326
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,866
Rukia came out here
on her own, just

327
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,533
so you wouldn't have
to get involved.

328
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,133
You should have
stayed put at home,

329
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,866
but you had to
come play the hero.

330
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,666
Just what did you think
you could accomplish here?

331
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,666
You're not a Reaper.

332
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,533
You're a fake.

333
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,133
There's no way you could
hurt a real Soul Reaper.

334
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,300
You couldn't even lay
a scratch on one of us.

335
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,533
-Sorry about that.

336
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:08,066
I know you were in the
middle of saying something,

337
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,333
but you left yourself
so wide open there,

338
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,566
I just couldn't help myself.

339
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,433
I apologize.

340
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,033
Why don't you continue?

341
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:18,333
Were you saying something
about a scratch.

342
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,133
-You punk.

343
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:24,600
[growls]

344
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:27,266
CAPT. KUCHIKI (OFFSCREEN): You
let your guard down, Renji.

345
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,733
-Captain Kuchiki.

346
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:31,900
-This young man here,
Ichigo Kurosaki,

347
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:34,033
I believe I've seen him before.

348
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:37,033
There was a report from
the Secret Remote Squad.

349
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:39,900
He dealt the Menos Grande
quite a serious blow

350
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:42,933
and forced it back to
Hueco Mundo as well.

351
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:00,700
-Huh?

352
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,466
-You've got to be kidding me.

353
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,666
Man, the Secret Remote
Squad must really

354
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,366
be slipping these days.

355
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,500
This kid wounded a Menos Grande?

356
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:13,566
Who in their right mind would
believe that load of crap?

357
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,366
I mean look at him, Captain.

358
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,200
And that zanpakuto.

359
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:20,166
It's nothing but an
overgrown piece of junk.

360
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,266
He obviously can't
control his spirit energy.

361
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,333
So tell me, what's the
name of that monstrosity?

362
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:28,133
-Huh?

363
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,266
What's its name?

364
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,500
-You didn't even ask, did you?

365
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:32,066
-What?

366
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,366
You mean Rukia?

367
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,133
Wait, are you guys telling
me you all name your swords?

368
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,433
-I knew it.

369
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:40,966
You're not even able to ask
your zanpakuto its name.

370
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,966
And you really think you
could fight me as an equal?

371
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,733
Come back in 2,000 years.

372
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:48,666
[roar]

373
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,200
-Roar, Zabimaru.

374
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,266
Now open your eyes.

375
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,600
See what lies before you
and fall upon your prey.

376
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:11,700
[chuckles]

377
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,966
It's all over, you little runt.

378
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,133
You've lost to Renji Abarai
and will die where you stand.

379
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:48,433

KON NARRATING: It's time once
again for Kon's Bleach Triva.

381
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,800
Soul Reapers in the Soul
Society belong to 13 Court Guard
Squads

382
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,533
Byakua Kuchiki is the
captain of Squad 6.

383
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:56,933
Renji Abarai is his
second-in-command.

384

ICHIGO NARRATING: Just shut
up and do the preview already.
