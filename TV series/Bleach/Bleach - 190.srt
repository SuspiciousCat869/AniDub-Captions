NARRATOR: Sosuke
Aizen was the man

3
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,196
who revolted against
the Soul Society

4
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,196
and brought Hueco Mundo
under his control.

5
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,629
Aizen set out to
create a key that

6
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:04,163
would open a portal to the
Soul Society's Royal Palace--

7
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:07,229
a key known as the Oken.

8
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:09,329
Karakura Town is
the location that

9
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,896
was targeted as the site
for the Oken's creation.

10
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:15,463
When Ichigo and the
13 Court Guard Squads

11
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:17,963
caught wind of his intent,
they began training

12
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:20,263
for a winter showdown
with the Espada,

13
00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:22,629
as they would need all the
strength they could muster.

14
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,963
However, after learning
of Orihime's ability

15
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:31,529
to reject all
forms of phenomena,

16
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:34,096
Aizen ordered
Ulquiorra to kidnap her

17
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,496
from the world of the living.

18
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:45,796
Determined to rescue
Orihime, Ichigo, Renji, Uryu,

19
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:49,363
Chad, and Rukia broke into
Aizen's stronghold, Las Noches.

20
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:55,729
But what awaited them was
a battle more demanding

21
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:57,263
than they could
have ever imagined.

22
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:09,029
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
I'm going at this guy

23
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:13,529
with everything I've got!

Ungh.

Impossible.

-Impressive.

35
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:41,329
Even using both my hands,
I couldn't stop it.

36
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:44,729
I am quite surprised.

37
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:45,796
Was that it?

38
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:47,363
Finished, Ichigo?

39
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:48,496
-[gasps]

40
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:49,096
You can't.

41
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:56,363
-Hm.

42
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,063
How unfortunate.

-[groaning]

44
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:29,629
-It's time to give up.

45
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,663
Ugh!

-[panting]

47
00:05:35,663 --> 00:05:37,129
I'll never surrender.

[panting]

49
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:44,463
So it's very simple.

50
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:47,029
What I have to do is
defeat you in battle,

51
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:48,763
then this war is
as good as over.

52
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:53,063
-I see.

53
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:56,929
It looks as if you
have been misinformed.

You're the fourth.

57
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:15,363
-Correct.

58
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:19,096
Espada number 4,
Ulquiorra Cefir.

59
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,229
Of all the Espada, my
power is ranked fourth.

60
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:28,696
-Ugh!

61
00:06:31,496 --> 00:06:32,596
Uhh.

62
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:35,929
ULQUIORRA: Ichigo
Kurosaki, it is pointless.

63
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,296
You cannot defeat me.

64
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:42,163
Even if you were lucky
enough to succeed,

65
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:44,663
there are three
Espada ranked above me

66
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:51,129
or much stronger than I. Try
as many times as you like--

67
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:51,629
-Uhh.

68
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:52,129
Ugh.

69
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:58,696
---the results will
always be the same.

70
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:06,329
This is the end, then.

71
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:09,263
If you can still move
in that condition,

72
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,263
leave Hueco Mundo immediately.

73
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:15,129
If you can't move,
then die there.

74
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:27,396
-Hmmm.

75
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:28,263

You don't have to win. [sobs]

And you don't have
to fight for me.

Just don't get hurt.

You're finished, Ichigo.

ICHIGO: Now, you make me sick.

I'm going to wipe that

want, I'll eat you all,

I got news for you.

And then I'm going to take Rukia,

and Chad,

I'm going to take Orihime!

All of my friends!

147
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,763
And bring them
home safe with me!

148
00:13:19,796 --> 00:13:21,263
I won't lose to you!

---hurt?

157
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:07,791
I was going to I ask you that.

158
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:08,758
I'm fine.

159
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:17,858
Good.

160
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:18,525
That's a relief.

Well, you know me, I'm
made of pretty tough stuff.

163

Even when I was a kid, I never
caught colds and-- [gasps]

00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:32,058
Ichigo, what are you doing?

165
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:33,458
Get me down.

166
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:34,291
-Well, yeah.

167

That's what I'm trying to do.

168

With all this rubble
everywhere, it

169
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:40,558
would be much easier to carry
you than look for a stairway.

170
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:42,391
-But I'm, oh, oh--

There are rules you
got to stick to when

-You're not just going
to leave us here?

-Nah, I wouldn't do that.

Just come with me.

You've already lost.

You say you're
some kind of king?

But killing everyone
you happen to dislike

makes you a king
