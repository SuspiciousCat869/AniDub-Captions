1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,766
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,566
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,900
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:29,400
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper...
And dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:32,400
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:59,945
We seem to be
outnumbered. The rebel
forces are growing daily.

7
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:03,445
Have you thought of
how we should proceed?

8
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:07,278
There's no time to come
up with a plan. I'm going
down there.

9
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,678
Don't be rash.

10
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:12,978
This is war. It can't be
waged by one person.

11
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:19,878
That's true... But we
both know if I don't do
something, we're likely
to lose the battle.

12
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:22,212
Your reaction seems odd,
Father.

13
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:25,845
Koga, in battle, you will
address me appropriately.

14
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:29,912
My apologies, Sir Genrei.
I'll be going then.

15
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:35,612
Always willing to rush
headlong into danger...

16
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:40,645
Who's he?!

17
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:42,645
Identify yourself!?

18
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,512
Wait! I know him!

19
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:49,678
Is... he one of the
Kuchiki's?!

20
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:57,212
Surround him!
He's our enemy!

21
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:05,278
You will curse your
misfortune for having ever
laid eyes on this sword.

22
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:10,645
Don't be afraid! He's
one man, that's all!

23
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:12,312
Is everybody ready?

24
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:13,378
Let's get him!

25
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:18,678
Whisper, Muramasa...!

26
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:22,978
<i>[struggling]</i>
<i>What's this?!</i>

27
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:26,412
My sword! What's
happening to it?!

28
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:27,445
<i>What's wrong?!</i>

29
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,012
I don't know! My
Zanpakuto is moving
on its own!

30
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,512
Stop that! What's come
over you?!

31
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:35,712
Ah, what the---?!

32
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,878
Have you gone
completely crazy?!

33
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,978
Of course not! My
Zanpakuto has a
mind of its own!

34
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:44,512
That's ridiculous!

35
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,712
What do you take me
for, an idiot?!

36
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:51,478
What?! Impossible!

37
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:55,245
My own sword is
turning on me!

38
00:04:56,345 --> 00:04:59,745
No! Stop this! No!
No! No! No!

39
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:17,045
Raise up your head, Koga
Kuchiki...!

40
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:19,112
Sir...

41
00:05:20,145 --> 00:05:23,212
Your work on our behalf
has been quite impressive.

42
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:28,045
The rebellion in our land
is still far from over.

43
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:32,345
But today, we
made progress toward
restoring peace.

44
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,445
You are too kind,
Head Captain.

45
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:40,112
There is great turmoil
in the Soul Society over
this revolt.

46
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:45,278
The challenges that we
face are going to test
our resolve.

47
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:50,678
We will soon learn if we
are truly capable of bringing
eternal peace to our world.

48
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:56,112
In order to succeed in
our mission, we will need
great strength like your own.

49
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:59,712
Please continue to further
your efforts for this cause.

50
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:04,112
Yes, sir. I pledge my
life in an effort to
bring peace to this world.

51
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:10,312
<i>Did you hear</i>
<i>about Sir Koga?</i>

52
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:12,112
No. What
happened?

53
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:15,912
<i>Everyone's talking about</i>
<i>it. He took out several</i>
<i>dozen rebels by himself!</i>

54
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:18,378
<i>Are you kidding?!</i>
<i>That's amazing!</i>

55
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:22,578
The rumors are that a
Third Seat position is
being secured for him.

56
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:27,412
<i>He probably deserves it.</i>
<i>But why does he dress</i>
<i>just like the people of</i>
<i>the Kuchiki clan?</i>

57
00:06:27,445 --> 00:06:29,978
<i>Come on, you mean</i>
<i>you don't know his</i>
<i>background?</i>

58
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:34,612
He's an accomplished
scholar and warrior. He
married into the Kuchiki
clan.

59
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:38,845
What's wrong, Sir Ginrei?
You seem upset.

60
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,812
Is it something I've
done?

61
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:44,378
Yes. Let me ask you
something...

62
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:48,512
During the battle, why
did you launch an attack
on your own?

63
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,645
I was confident I could
handle the situation.

64
00:06:55,612 --> 00:07:01,245
I knew I could defeat the
enemy... as long as I
could wield the power of
my Zanpakuto, Muramasa.

65
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:05,278
Koga...

66
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:08,878
I don't think you realize
what is happening...

67
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:13,612
People who have access
to great power need something
extra in order to control it.

68
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:15,045
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what that is?</i>

69
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:16,745
I'm not sure,
father.

70
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:17,945
They need heart.

71
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,178
What do you mean?

72
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:22,712
Power must always
be controlled by
its possessor.

73
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:25,912
And at times, power is
too great to wield.

74
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:30,178
In order to obtain balance,
you will require a heart
that is sensitive to the

75
00:07:30,212 --> 00:07:33,245
use and limitations
of that power.

76
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:37,978
I am well aware of the
tremendous scope of your
abilities.

77
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:44,012
However, you still lack
the heart to make the
most effective use of
those powers.

78
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:47,745
You should use this
incident as a warning
to yourself.

79
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:50,845
Don't forget you bear the
title of our clan, and

80
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:53,878
responsibility for your
actions on its behalf.

81
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:54,912
But...

82
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,512
That is all.
You may leave.

83
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:01,912
Thank you, my lord.

84
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:22,112
<i>Why do you seem so</i>
<i>troubled, Koga?</i>

85
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:24,112
What makes you
think I'm troubled?

86
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:26,778
<i>I can sense that something</i>
<i>is bothering you...</i>

87
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:30,445
Heh! That's just your
imagination.

88
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:34,245
<i>You cannot hide from</i>
<i>me. We are one.</i>

89
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:38,578
<i>Our trust in each other</i>
<i>is what makes us strong.</i>

90
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:44,412
Tell me. Am I using my
powers incorrectly?

91
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:51,012
<i>I don't know. Your power</i>
<i>has not yet reached its</i>
<i>full potential. There's</i>
<i>no telling how much of it</i>

92
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:54,345
<i>you can produce, or what</i>
<i>you may be able to to do</i>
<i>with it.</i>

93
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:56,612
I see...

94
00:08:56,645 --> 00:09:01,045
<i>But let me say this. We</i>
<i>are a Soul Reaper and a</i>
<i>Zanpakuto that were meant</i>
<i>to be together...</i>

95
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,012
<i>Trust in me, and at the</i>
<i>same time, trust in</i>
<i>yourself.</i>

96
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:16,378
You're right. Trusting in
myself is the answer.

97
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:19,012
And that, in turn,
will lead to peace.

98
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:53,745
Sir. Is there anything
else I can do before I go?

99
00:09:57,745 --> 00:10:00,378
What is Sir Ginrei
thinking?

100
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:02,878
<i>What are you talking</i>
<i>about, Koga?</i>

101
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:07,112
He never seems to accept
me, no matter how great
my achievements may be.

102
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:10,445
In fact, he seems to look
down on me.

103
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:14,712
<i>Have confidence.</i>
<i>You are strong.</i>

104
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,312
Do you have a
moment, father?

105
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:25,545
Huh?

106
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:27,678
It's about Koga.

107
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:34,645
He's been acting different
lately. And he refuses to
talk to me about anything.

108
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:42,112
Try not to worry, my
dear child...

109
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:49,178
Koga is a sensible man. And
as a Soul Reaper, his powers
are far greater than my own.

110
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:56,012
He just needs more time
to develop them properly,
and learn how to use them
responsibly.

111
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:58,045
<i>Run for it! Retreat!</i>

112
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:04,078
From all the reports
coming in, it appears
that most of the rebel
forces were suppressed

113
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:05,645
after the last
battle!

114
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:08,178
Great work, Sir Koga!

115
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:12,878
We're very proud to be
working with you, sir.
You're an inspiration to all
the men under your command.

116
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:16,445
Thank you, men. But
there's no need to
flatter me.

117
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:19,145
I'm not doing this
for the recognition.

118
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:23,112
I want order restored to
the Soul Society. Huh?

119
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:32,245
I wonder what
that was about...

120
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:36,212
I'm not sure who those
guys are, but I've seen
them skulking around.

121
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:38,745
I guess they enjoy
keeping secrets.

122
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:41,812
They're probably jealous
of your accomplishments,
Sir Koga.

123
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:52,278
You want my help? I'm
honored that you would
ask, Head Captain!

124
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,512
This is the
issue, Koga.

125
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:59,812
I am in the process of
organizing a Special Task
Force to deal with the
remaining Rebel Units.

126
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:04,245
I want you to become its
leader, to make sure the
job gets done properly.

127
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:06,245
Of course, Head Captain!

128
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:11,378
Sir Ginrei...!

129
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:14,845
Head Captain Yamamoto has
put me in charge of his
Special Task Force!

130
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:16,645
I'm supposed to begin
immediately!

131
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:22,578
I see. Try not to tarnish
our Clan's name in the
process.

132
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:26,045
Are you not unhappy to
hear this?

133
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,612
Your son-in-law...
of the Kuchiki Clan...

134
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:32,412
... now has an important
assignment to carry out!

135
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:38,978
I understand your
enthusiasm. But be careful
not to misinterpret the
Head Captain's intention.

136
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,078
I shall leave you now.

137
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:01,912
Koga Kuchiki. I don't
know why he was chosen,

138
00:13:01,945 --> 00:13:05,778
but the Head Captain
has picked him to head
up the Special Task Force.

139
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:10,178
We're close to restoring
order within the Soul Society.

140
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:15,278
If he continues to
accumulate power, it will
be difficult for our faction
to override his position...

141
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,678
That's right. He's
already surpassed his
contemporaries.

142
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:22,512
At this point, there may
not be anything we can do.

143
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:26,545
Not true. I
have a plan.

144
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:36,845
<i>Sir Koga...!</i>

145
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:38,812
It's over!

146
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:40,812
The rebellion's been put
down!

147
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:43,245
You did it, Sir Koga!

148
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:49,412
What is this?!

149
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:51,078
Have you
gone mad?!

150
00:13:55,445 --> 00:14:01,078
Koga Kuchiki, our master has
decided that you shall die as
a casualty of war!

151
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:04,245
I am ready for
you. Attack.

152
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,012
We will!

153
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,212
You're finished!

154
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,745
You won't defeat me with
sheer numbers!

155
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:15,078
Mukojochu! Muramasa!

156
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:22,078
What's he doing?!

157
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,312
Is that--?!

158
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,046
Who the hell
is that guy?!

159
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,179
I doesn't
matter! Get him!

160
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:48,446
Hear my voice.

161
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:53,146
What's happening?!

162
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:55,179
My Zanpakuto...!

163
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:58,013
What the hell?

164
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:59,679
Who are these guys?!

165
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:03,113
They're manifestations of
each of your Zanpakuto!

166
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:08,046
They have heard my voice,
and it has awakened the
desires within their
consciousness...

167
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,446
What?!

168
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:14,646
You will be unable to
touch us, and in a few
moments, you will die at
the hands of your own

169
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,846
individual weapons.

170
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:31,646
It appears everything's
been settled.

171
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,746
Yes.

172
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:33,979
Don't move!

173
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:38,279
What is this?

174
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:42,046
We have you surrounded,
Koga Kuchiki!

175
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,879
You have finally gone too
far, Sir Koga! These
warriors are not part
of the rebel faction!

176
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,346
They were members of
the Court Guard Squads!

177
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:53,213
Is it true?! Did you
attack and kill your
own allies during this
battle?!

178
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:55,479
That would have been
absurd! Of course not!

179
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:59,446
They showed up out of
nowhere and attacked me,
so I defended myself...

180
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:02,613
Koga. What
have you done?!

181
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:03,913
Sir Genrei!

182
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,713
It's a good thing you
came by. This is a bad
situation!

183
00:16:07,746 --> 00:16:12,979
Your son-in-law Koga, who
married into the Kuchiki
Clan, has murdered his
fellow Soul Reapers!

184
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:18,446
It's true... He
attacked us!

185
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:23,813
He had no provocation.
We just wanted to ask
him a few questions.

186
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:27,913
He did it to show off
his power in front of
the other Soul Reapers!

187
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,046
You're lying!

188
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:32,946
He's out of control, I
tell you! He's mad with
power!

189
00:16:33,513 --> 00:16:35,079
You bastard!

190
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:38,446
Arrest him! Arrest Koga
Kuchiki and take him away!

191
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:41,713
Just wait! Listen,
this is not what happened!

192
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:46,613
What now, Koga?

193
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:48,413
Damn it!

194
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:50,213
<i>Stop, Koga!</i>

195
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:54,979
Just stand still Don't
make any sudden moves.

196
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,746
Sir Genrei!
But why?

197
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,613
Do as they
say for now.

198
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:04,646
Koga...?

199
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:41,913
Koga. Your punishment has
been decided. They asked
me to come and tell you
in person.

200
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:48,746
After much discussion, it
was decided that you will be
deprived of the position you
have held for the last century.

201
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:52,346
Your Zanpakuto has been
deemed dangerous, and
will be neutralized.

202
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,013
What?!

203
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:58,113
Sir Ginrei, you can't be
serious! Do you believe
these accusations?

204
00:17:58,146 --> 00:18:01,579
Do you think I killed
those men just to satisfy
my own ambition?!

205
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:05,546
You should know that
I'm not one to make
rash decisions.

206
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:06,813
Right...

207
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,379
Your superiors are
not worried about you...

208
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:15,279
They believe that the
power of your Zanpakuto
is an urgent and growing
problem.

209
00:18:15,313 --> 00:18:19,546
They believe that
Muramasa will eventually
gain control over you.

210
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:22,713
What?! They're worried
about Muramasa?!

211
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:30,046
As I told you before,
Koga, those with power
must have a heart that is
sensitive to its limitations.

212
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:37,679
You were overconfident in
your Zanpakuto's powers,
and you were blindly making
the wrong decisions.

213
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:45,746
You lost balance. And
that is the reason Sir
Genryusai placed you
under his direct command.

214
00:18:46,313 --> 00:18:50,646
This is unbelievable! I
was set up by those who
were jealous of my power!

215
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:52,413
<i>No!</i>

216
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:56,579
You are wrong! It was
your overconfidence that
brought all this about!

217
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:01,746
What choice did I have?!
The men who confronted me
were there to kill me!

218
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:06,013
They made that perfectly
clear! What, was I supposed
to stand there and be murdered?!

219
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,046
Calm yourself.

220
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,713
There's still time until
your punishment is carried
out. Use that time to show
some patience.

221
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:17,313
It might be hard to
understand, but this
will do you good.

222
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,579
I hope he was
paying attention.

223
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:35,846
Either way, I must do
something quickly. If I
don't, the boy will indeed
lose his powers.

224
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:38,879
And the end result
will be catastrophic!

225
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:51,113
I don't get it!

226
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:54,713
He completely dismisses
me! My own father-in-law!

227
00:19:55,413 --> 00:19:58,646
He doesn't respect my
power! He doesn't
believe in me!

228
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:03,246
The fact is, you don't
need him to believe in
you. Believe in me.

229
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,879
And more importantly...
believe in yourself.

230
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:12,613
Muramasa! How? How have
you manifested?!

231
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:17,379
I'm here because of you.
Your anger, your inner
desire, has reached out
to me...

232
00:20:17,413 --> 00:20:18,546
...and I came.

233
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:20,446
My desire?

234
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:26,579
When you call to me,
Koga, I'm compelled to go
wherever you are. I am your
Zanpakuto, after all...

235
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:30,146
You must live.. and
follow your desires.

236
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:38,946
What's happening?!

237
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,313
Let's go... Koga.

238
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:51,379
You don't need to abide
by the rules of a world
that despises and envies
your power.

239
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:55,379
There's a simple solution.
You should use that power
to change the world.

240
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,146
Let me make one thing
clear, Muramasa

241
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:09,379
I am the master
here.

242
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:11,946
And as such,
I am in charge!

243
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,513
I will not be ordered
around... by a Zanpakuto!

244
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,113
Damn it, he was able
to revive him!

245
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:25,579
Let's move, Ichigo!

246
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:26,646
Right!

247
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,613
He is powerful.

248
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:42,813
It's amazing. How can
the man still have so
much power...

249
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:45,313
... after being sealed
away for so long?!

250
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:50,013
You've awakened...
Finally!

251
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:56,146
Koga. I've waited for
this moment for so long.

252
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:00,079
Together, we can now
complete the task we began
all those years ago...

253
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:03,213
Mura... masa.

254
00:22:08,213 --> 00:22:10,079
Why... Koga?!

255
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:51,260
In the next episode,
you'll witness our
perfect teamwork!

256
