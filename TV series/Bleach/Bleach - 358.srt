1
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,620
Hello there..

2
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,355
[growling]

3
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:05,967
How impressive! In such a very short
time, you increased your power ten fold.

4
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:07,769
I did it to defeat you!

5
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:10,271
[yelling]

6
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:17,712
Mm.

7
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:19,747
Now, Orihime, do it!

8
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:22,684
Tsubaki!

9
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:25,486
[gasping]

10
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,592
I don't know why this
is happening to me.

11
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,862
Well, I suppose it's about
time for you to wake up.

12
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,698
So now-who am I?

13
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:37,899
[gasping]

14
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:40,602
[screaming]

15
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:41,936
Damn you...!

16
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:46,507
You bastard! Just what
did you do to her?!

17
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:52,180
What did I do? The
same thing I did to you.

18
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:53,581
[gasping]

19
00:02:57,485 --> 00:03:05,493
[panting]

20
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,795
Damn it, I'm too late.

21
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,631
[panting]

22
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,768
Orihime and Chad's
Spiritual Pressures...

23
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:17,372
It doesn't appear they've
been injured, but...

24
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,406
[exhaling sharply]

25
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:24,545
I sense another Spiritual
Pressure!

26
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:34,822
Okay. Break time's over.

27
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:36,257
Right.

28
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,112
Yukio.

29
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,293
I'm on it.

30
00:03:39,227 --> 00:03:41,462
Loading 'Invaders
Must Die'.

31
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,866
We're almost there, guys.
After this, we can

32
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:47,302
finally get rid of our
cursed powers and become

33
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:49,637
human again. Count on it.

34
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:52,907
Good. I'm beside myself
with excitement.

35
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:03,451
... and then the squirrel ran down my pant
leg and it was gone. Hey, look, it's Uryu.

36
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:07,488
Are you coming back?

37
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:10,325
Not yet, but I had some paperwork
I had to take care of.

38
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:12,427
I heard you got hurt
pretty bad from falling

39
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:14,495
out of a tree while
trying to save a cat, of

40
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:15,797
all things.

41
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,565
I couldn't believe it!

42
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:21,469
I got hurt trying to save a cat?
Great. What

43
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,939
kind of story did
Ryuken tell these guys?

44
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,607
[gasping]

45
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,476
That Spiritual
Pressure.

46
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:30,845
Uh--

47
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:35,350
By the way, Keigo... While I was gone,
did you come across anyone suspicious?

48
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:36,617
Uh...

49
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:39,220
Oh. Those punks stopped
coming around.

50
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:42,590
They were after Ichigo and he hasn't
been here for the past couple of days.

51
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,926
He's probably off doing one
of his part-time jobs.

52
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:47,195
Hey, what do you say
we go bug him at work?

53
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:48,496
Think I'll pass.

54
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:55,803
The other Spiritual Pressure
that I felt where I

55
00:04:55,803 --> 00:04:58,339
last sensed Orihime's
and Chad's presences...

56
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:02,377
It definitely belongs to the
guy I was following. And

57
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,581
just now, I felt it coming
from Keigo and Mizuiro, too.

58
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:09,684
But it doesn't add up.
Why did he approach

59
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,887
them? They don't possess
any special powers.

60
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:17,759
And what was that odd
sensation I picked up,

61
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,194
that was mixed in with
each of their Spiritual

62
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:24,465
Pressures? What is he plotting?
I have to find out.

63
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:31,506
No. Ichigo didn't come
home yesterday, either.

64
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:33,741
I see.

65
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:35,710
This will sound kinda
strange...

66
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:37,879
...but has anything really
unusual happened to

67
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,314
him, or to anyone else in
your family, recently?

68
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:41,616
Huh?

69
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:45,553
For example, have any of you experienced
anything you can't explain?

70
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:48,956
Huh, that kinda stuff
happens to us all the time.

71
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,760
But Ichigo's been kinda numb when
it comes to things like that.

72
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,196
I swear, there could be a
ghost or monster in front

73
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,331
of his face and he probably
wouldn't notice it.

74
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:59,333
[chuckling]

75
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,502
Really...

76
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:02,737
Uh--

77
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,772
Do you know where his
part-time job is?

78
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:07,308
I'll get you the address.

79
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:11,779
Here you go!

80
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:15,283
Unagiya...?

81
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:17,585
If you find Ichigo
there...

82
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:20,788
...tell him everything's fine here at the
house. He doesn't need to rush home.

83
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:23,825
[gasping]

84
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:24,826
What's wrong?

85
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:27,728
Sorry, it's nothing.
Thanks for the address.

86
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,363
[lightly grunting]

87
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:51,853
Who was that? Was it
Ichigo's friend?

88
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:54,222
Yeah. It was Uryu.

89
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:57,959
That's the first time I ever spoke to him,
but he's exactly like Ichigo described him.

90
00:06:58,192 --> 00:06:59,494
Oh, yeah?

91
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:00,528
Huh?

92
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:08,569
[grunting]

93
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:12,840
Okay, you've been hitting it pretty
hard for an hour. You can stop now.

94
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:16,611
[grunting and exhaling]

95
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:20,515
[panting]

96
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:22,517
What's the matter? You
aren't talking...

97
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,353
I expected you to
complain.

98
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:27,488
So, how 'bout starting up
another set, then?

99
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,890
Mm?!

100
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:34,629
I'm messing with you. I presume you've
built up some stamina after all that.

101
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,230
Stamina?

102
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,431
That's right...

103
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:40,635
Fullbring puts a lot of pressure
on your flesh and blood.

104
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:44,639
To fully control it, you need to
have a crazy amount of stamina.

105
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,676
I see. That's why you've had me
jumping through all these hoops.

106
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:49,710
Mm-hm.

107
00:07:49,744 --> 00:07:54,182
And I see you recover
fast. That's important.

108
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:58,486
Tell me... When your Fullbring was finally
complete, you saw something, right?

109
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,420
Mm!

110
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,663
I knew it. You should
have seen me glowing as a

111
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:11,966
Spiritual Being, even with
your vision destroyed.

112
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,869
That's why, to make sure I
was on the right track,

113
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:17,505
I forced you to fight
me without your sight.

114
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:21,509
It was a way to prove to you that your Soul
Reaper powers were starting to come back.

115
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,476
Uh!

116
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:25,880
You look confused so let
me explain a little

117
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,748
better. After you lost
the bulk of your Spirit

118
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:32,753
Energy, the remnants inside of you lay
dormant in one location for a long time.

119
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:36,490
We believed that, through
Fullbring, we could use

120
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,759
the Spirit Energy that
flowed inside of you from

121
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:43,965
your Combat Pass, to stimulate
your remaining Spirit Energy.

122
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:46,634
Once you build up your
stamina and learn to fully

123
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:48,803
control Fullbring, your
Soul Reaper powers

124
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:51,973
will merge with it on
their own...

125
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:55,876
...and you will then gain powers
beyond that of a Soul Reaper.

126
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,548
Take this.

127
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,682
Mm!

128
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,284
Give it a try...

129
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:06,921
Let's see what you can do. Your Fullbring
should be fully functional already.

130
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:19,700
[inhaling]

131
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:22,563
Yukio!

132
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:23,964
Yeah, I'm on it.

133
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:29,704
Uh!

134
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,345
[roaring]

135
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,790
[roaring]

136
00:11:08,743 --> 00:11:10,344
How's that?

137
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:14,315
Very impressive. Not bad,
kid.

138
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:18,752
Now you're going to need a name...
for your Fullbring.

139
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:38,243
Don't see their car. Must
be out.

140
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,296
Welcome back. You managed
to master your Fullbring.

141
00:11:59,331 --> 00:12:02,234
I had to plug my system in.
You were taking so long, I

142
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:05,070
was worried the battery in
this thing would run out.

143
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:07,305
Yeah. Sorry for all the
trouble.

144
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:08,240
Mmm.

145
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,244
Apart from all that...

146
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:15,580
...You should go home for
today and see your family.

147
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:19,017
I assume they must be worried...
after not hearing from you.

148
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,487
Right! I haven't called
since I started training!

149
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:25,023
How many days has it been
since I began all of this?

150
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:27,159
Just about 24 hours, in
total.

151
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:28,994
Huh?

152
00:12:29,027 --> 00:12:31,396
You didn't know, but I
fast-forwarded time while

153
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:33,598
you were inside. You
should be thanking me.

154
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:39,938
So you should head on home now. I'm sure
your family is anxiously awaiting you.

155
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:46,645
Now, I'll be able to
protect them...

156
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,283
My friends...

157
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:54,419
...my family... everyone.

158
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:03,662
It's strange. I can sense
that odd Spiritual

159
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:06,498
Pressure hanging around.
But none of the people I

160
00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:09,401
met today seemed to be aware of it.
And I couldn't

161
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:12,103
ask them if they remembered
meeting that guy.

162
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:17,209
Orihime said she was attacked by the
same guy who attacked me. I wonder

163
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:21,246
if it's possible that all of this
is happening because of his powers.

164
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:28,353
If that's the
case, then...

165
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:30,622
[laughing]

166
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:33,625
Now that was really impressive!
The kid was

167
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:37,195
actually able to complete
his Fullbring training.

168
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:42,400
With that completed, we can all finally
say goodbye to our cursed powers!

169
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:48,473
The question, though... is how
Tsukishima will act. We'll see.

170
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:50,008
[gasping]

171
00:13:57,282 --> 00:14:01,319
What's wrong with you guys?
Aren't you happy about this?

172
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:06,191
It's just that we finally
remembered...

173
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:07,626
About what?

174
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:11,096
About exactly what we're
supposed to do.

175
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,965
[gasping]

176
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:18,937
Damn it!

177
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:21,006
Dirty Boots!

178
00:14:25,644 --> 00:14:27,979
Looks like they're still
up...

179
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:30,215
They must have been
worried about me.

180
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,452
I'm home!

181
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:37,355
Huh?

182
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,625
Welcome home!

183
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,228
Thank goodness you're
finally back, Ichigo!

184
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:44,629
Yeah, I'm sorry I'm so
late...

185
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:46,298
We were all waiting for
you!

186
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:47,232
Whose shoes are these?

187
00:14:47,232 --> 00:14:49,634
You won't believe who
came by to visit us!

188
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:51,636
Hey, don't pull! Who is
it?

189
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:54,239
[giggling]
You have to guess!

190
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,107
You have to at least give
me a hint!

191
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:59,644
All right, fine. Here's the hint.
He's one of our cousins.

192
00:14:59,644 --> 00:15:00,512
A cousin?

193
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:02,947
Right! Now you have to
guess his name!

194
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:07,919
That's going to be hard. What cousin
would drop by here unexpectedly?

195
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:09,521
He finally came home!

196
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:12,490
Uh!

197
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:25,937
Hi Ichigo...

198
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:28,673
It's been a while.

199
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:33,611
See? I told you you'd be surprised, Ichigo!
It's cousin Shu!

200
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:36,481
We haven't seen or heard
from him since Grandpa Rin's

201
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:39,084
memorial service, and how
long has that been?!

202
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:42,620
He came by earlier this evening, and
we all had a nice dinner together! It

203
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:45,357
was so nice to catch up with
him after all these years!

204
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:50,261
Yeah, but it would've been nicer if you
actually told us you were stopping by.

205
00:15:50,295 --> 00:15:53,198
I have to say, Shu, that part
of you hasn't changed much.

206
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:54,632
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,268
Was I too much trouble?

208
00:15:57,302 --> 00:16:00,238
[gasping]
No, of course not.

209
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:02,374
[struggling]

210
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:05,176
What are you waiting for,
Ichigo? Come and say hi!

211
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,245
Tsukishima!

212
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,281
You bastard! What are you
doing in my house?!

213
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:11,116
Ichigo?!

214
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:12,350
What's wrong with you?

215
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,586
Stop it Ichigo! What's
gotten into you?!

216
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:18,089
Yuzu's right! Have you gone crazy?!
Let go of his collar!

217
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,924
You're hurting him!

218
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,394
Are you mad that he dropped
by without calling?!

219
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:24,362
Hey, it's not that big a
deal!

220
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:27,031
What have you
done... to my sisters?!

221
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:28,466
Stop it, Ichigo!

222
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,604
It's all right, girls.
I understand.

223
00:16:32,637 --> 00:16:35,273
Ichigo's always so
serious.

224
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:39,644
I figure... He's just angry
at me for staying so late.

225
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:42,113
Answer me!

226
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,951
[doorbell ringing]

227
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:49,554
[gasping]

228
00:16:49,587 --> 00:16:51,623
Um, Yuzu... would
you mind?

229
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:54,359
Okay...

230
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,227
[breathing hard]

231
00:16:57,095 --> 00:16:59,030
I bet our friends
are here.

232
00:16:59,063 --> 00:16:59,631
[gasping]

233
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:02,367
Hi Yuzu! Long time, no
see!

234
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:05,103
Hi! Here, go ahead and
use these slippers.

235
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:06,504
Thanks a lot!

236
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:09,607
You have enough for
everybody?

237
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:12,377
Shu, we're here!

238
00:17:12,377 --> 00:17:14,245
Huh? Oh, I see Ichigo's
here, as well!

239
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:15,680
Oh, yeah.

240
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,584
Hey, Ichigo! We hear you've been
staying out late for a few days!

241
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:22,187
You should be more sensitive
to your sisters! You've been

242
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,621
leaving them here all
alone each night!

243
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:26,090
It's okay. We all right
without him.

244
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:26,925
Come on, Karin--

245
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,227
I asked everybody to
come.

246
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:34,098
I wanted to see the whole gang,
since it's been such a long time.

247
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:37,101
Don't give me that scary
look.

248
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:39,938
I'm sorry about inviting
everyone so late,

249
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:42,907
but tomorrow's Sunday,
so, it's okay, right?

250
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:44,976
You know what...?

251
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:49,247
Maybe I'll call Chad and
Orihime, as well...

252
00:17:57,088 --> 00:18:00,625
Hi Orihime, it's me.
That's right, Tsukishima.

253
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,362
Huh? What are you talking
about?

254
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:06,397
I just ran into you the
other day...

255
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:12,136
Actually, I'm at Ichigo's
place right now...

256
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,606
[roaring]

257
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,541
[grunting]

258
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:17,909
What the hell?!

259
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:19,244
Tsukishima!

260
00:18:20,111 --> 00:18:22,981
All right, Tsukishima...

261
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:25,617
Tell me what in the hell
did you do to everyone?!

262
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,052
Tsukishima, are
you hurt?

263
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:31,089
No, I'll be fine.

264
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,191
You're not fine! You're
bleeding!

265
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:34,359
Tsukishima!

266
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,494
Ichigo! What's
wrong with you!?

267
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:38,530
[gasping]

268
00:18:38,563 --> 00:18:41,065
I have no idea why you're
acting like this, but that's

269
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:43,368
no way to treat a relative
you haven't seen in years!

270
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:45,637
What relative?! No! This
guy is---

271
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,307
I don't wanna hear your excuses!
Just apologize to him!

272
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,610
Wait a minute! You don't
understand---

273
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:55,113
You need to say you're
sorry right now!

274
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,614
[grunting]

275
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:06,624
What's the matter?

276
00:19:07,158 --> 00:19:08,960
Ichigo...!

277
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:11,162
What's gotten into you?
You're not acting like

278
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:13,298
yourself at all! It's
like you've gone nuts!

279
00:19:13,331 --> 00:19:15,033
I've never seen you like
this!

280
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,935
Ichigo...!

281
00:19:16,968 --> 00:19:20,405
Why are you so upset? What
did he ever do to you?

282
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:22,240
You're being so mean!

283
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,575
Just apologize!

284
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:25,143
Come on, Ichigo!

285
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:26,978
Why are you so angry?

286
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:28,313
Talk to me! What's going
on?!

287
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:29,080
What's wrong?!

288
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,214
This is all your fault!

289
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:31,282
Yuzu's right!

290
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:32,483
Apologize!

291
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,557
Ichigo?

292
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,093
[panting]

293
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:46,898
What's happening?! I don't understand!
Is this Tsukishima's power?!

294
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,375
Is that you, Ichigo?
What's the matter?

295
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,644
[panting]

296
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:09,887
Look at you, you're all drenched in sweat.
Did something happen?

297
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,135
Here, drink this.

298
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:26,104
It'll help calm you down.

299
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:30,308
If you feel like talking,
I'm here to listen.

300
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:37,115
Thanks so much... I
appreciate it.

301
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:44,622
Mm.

302
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:46,357
What are you
doing?

303
00:20:46,357 --> 00:20:48,526
Just relax and be quiet!

304
00:20:58,102 --> 00:20:59,303
[doorbell ringing]

305
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:03,007
Who could that be at this
hour?

306
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:05,643
Coming!

307
00:21:07,378 --> 00:21:10,281
How am I supposed to
tell her what happened?

308
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:12,617
There's no way she
would understand.

309
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:18,623
She doesn't know about Soul Reapers,
or Hollows, or Fullbring. Telling her

310
00:21:18,623 --> 00:21:21,426
about that stuff out of the
blue would just frighten her.

311
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:22,493
Ichigo!

312
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:24,228
[gasping]

313
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:29,567
It's your lucky day, Ichigo! Your friend
Tsukishima's here to pick you up!

314
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:35,306
[gasping]

315
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:39,243
What is this?! What the
hell's going on?!

316
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:41,279
Somebody!

317
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:43,581
Anybody!

318
00:21:43,614 --> 00:21:47,351
Isn't there anybody left...
who's still sane?!

319
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:51,589
Ichigo!

320
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:53,624
[grunting]

321
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:56,360
Ginjo!

322
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,965
He got them! Riruka...
Kutsuzawa...

323
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:03,468
Yukio... and Jackie!

324
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:07,472
All of them. Tsukishima
got them all!

325
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:09,207
[gasping]

326
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,193
Ichigo, don't forget to give that
Fullbring a name by the next episode.

327
00:23:50,193 --> 00:23:52,128
What?! I don't even know
where to begin!

328
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:55,165
If you don't have anything, we can
name it, but it'll be embarrassing.

329
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:58,535
Wait, I have something!
[whispering]

330
00:23:58,568 --> 00:23:59,703
That's a good one!

331
00:23:59,736 --> 00:24:01,271
Huh?! Wait, I couldn't
hear that!
