00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:07,817
[theme music]

2
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,263
NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

3
00:01:50,296 --> 00:01:52,863
who was kidnapped
by the Arrancars,

4
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,696
Ichigo, Chad, Uryu,
Rukia, and Renji

5
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,430
have all snuck into Hueco
Mundo, the realm of the Hollows.

6
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:03,096
The journey to Aizen's
fortress, Las Noches,

7
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,530
has been hard fought, as
our heroes have struggled

8
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:08,396
against endless attacks
from the Arrancar forces.

9
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,230
They enter a room with
strange spiritual pressures

10
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:15,530
and five separate doorways
leading into the fortress.

11
00:02:15,563 --> 00:02:18,530
-As we approach the
crucial battlegrounds,

12
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:21,196
believe that our blades
will not shatter,

13
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,963
believe the result
will not weaken!

14
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:27,063
Though out paths may
diverge, our iron hearts

15
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:28,463
will remain together.

16
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:31,630
Swear that, though land
itself may break asunder,

17
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:34,963
we will come back here alive.

18
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:48,596
NARRATOR: Ichigo
proceeded down this path,

19
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,896
unaware that Arrancar 103,
Dordoni, was waiting for him.

20
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,196
Ichigo was initially confused
by the strange actions and words

21
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,696
of this triple digit
Arrancar, but when

22
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,830
Ichigo decided to take
the fight seriously,

23
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:04,330
Dordoni's whole persona
seemed to change.

24
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:11,563
-My, my.

25
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:13,663
Never judge people by their
appearances, [spanish].

26
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:20,730
We are a group known
as the Privaron Espada.

27
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:24,963
In other words, any Arrancar
with a three digit number,

28
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,930
including me, used to be
a member of the Espada.

29
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,296
Whirl, Giralda!

30
00:03:57,596 --> 00:03:59,830
Don't tell me that's
all you got, nino.

31
00:04:16,163 --> 00:04:17,796
-The spiritual pressure.

32
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,596
It feels like Ichigo.

33
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,896
Damn.

34
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,396
I sense a terrible presence
emanating from this place.

35
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,230
Wha-- What is-- What
the hell is that?

36
00:04:29,263 --> 00:04:31,196
[grumbling]

37
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,063
[shouting]

38
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:35,396
-Don't speak up on me like that.

39
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,530
It's really annoying.

40
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:38,196
And what are you
doing here anyway?

41
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,196
-Ne-- ne!

42
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,996
-Ne?

43
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,096
What about [?

44
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,763
Ne?

45
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:43,696
Spit it out, will you?

46
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,296
-Nel!

47
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,796
I'm looking for Nel, know
what I'm talking about?

48
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,530
-Then why are you wasting
your time running after me?

49
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:51,063
Wait.

50
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:51,563
I know.

51
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:52,430
You're lost.

52
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:53,863
You got lost, didn't you?

53
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:56,096
-Where is Nel, man?

54
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,330
-What are you asking me for?

55
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,630
I don't know.

56
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:00,763
But even if you are lost,
this doesn't make any sense.

57
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:02,130
I mean, you don't
have any reason

58
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:04,163
to come after me, do you?

59
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:05,163
-But Nel.

60
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:08,263
Nel went after Ichigo!

61
00:05:08,296 --> 00:05:12,496
If we don't hurry and find
Nel, it'll just be terrible.

62
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,496
-Stop it.

63
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,796
If she's with Ichigo,
then she's safe.

64
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,130
Now stop crying already.

65
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:18,463
It's weirding me out.

66
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:20,463
That's not why I'm so upset.

67
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:24,463
You see-- You see, if we-- If
we don't find Nel quickly--

68
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:25,796
[sobbing]

69
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,596
-I-- If we don't find Nel
and stop her, then Nel will--

70
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,263
Nel will--

71
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:34,730
[screaming]

72
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:35,830
-He's running away.

73
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:36,963
Wait up.

74
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:38,863
Why do you keep
running away from me?

75
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,096
-Because you're chasing me.

76
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,096
It's a reflex.

77
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,930
Your face is-- How
should I put this?

78
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:45,596
That face of yours is
scaring the crap out of me.

79
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,263
Please stop running
away and listen!

80
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:49,996
If you just give
me a chance, I'll

81
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,530
tell you the good
part of the story.

82
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:53,263
-You stop, then I'll stop.

83
00:05:53,296 --> 00:05:54,463
Besides.

84
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:56,063
If you're looking for Nel,
you need to turn around.

85
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:57,496
She's the other way.

86
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,196
DONDOCHAKKA: Nel!

87
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:23,330
-Ichigo!

88
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:30,230
-Tonto.

89
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:34,596
Well?

90
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,063
Come on, come on, come on.

91
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,563
Do it!

92
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:38,996
Use your Bankai, nino.

93
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,063
Or you'll die!

94
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:51,763
Why are you saving
your spirit energy

95
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,830
against an opponent like me?

96
00:06:57,996 --> 00:07:01,530
A sentiment as sweet as
chocolate, but foolish.

97
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:03,730
Don't you understand
what's going on here?

98
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:22,230
You're being very
unreasonable, nino.

99
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:24,696
Why not use your Bankai?

100
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,963
I'm interested to see
you at full power.

101
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:33,863
-Getsuga Tensho!

102
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:44,063
-Well?

103
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:51,196
-Ichigo!

104
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,630
Are you all right?

105
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:55,363
Ichigo, be careful.

106
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:57,196
-Ah.

107
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,563
I applaud the power
your displayed just now.

108
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:04,596
But still, you know what
you're facing here, right?

109
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,530
At this rate, you haven't
got a chance of winning.

110
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:10,730
-I wouldn't be so sure of that.

111
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:12,096
-I'm not making
assumptions here.

112
00:08:19,563 --> 00:08:21,996
I'm merely stating the truth.

113
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:36,163
-Getsuga Tensho!

114
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,096
Not again.

115
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,230
-Now, check this out.

116
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,130
I'll just keep
beating you like this

117
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,330
until you change your mind.

118
00:08:58,363 --> 00:08:59,830
This pains me, nino.

119
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:03,763
Correction.

120
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:07,196
Hardly pains is what
I really meant to say.

121
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,396
Let's see your Bankai.

122
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,796
And soon.

123
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:17,196
Because if I don't keep
holding back, nino, you die.

124
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,230
Got it?

125
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:21,363
What a waste.

126
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:23,530
All this would be for
nothing if that happens.

127
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:32,863
-Ichigo!

128
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,330
Ichigo!

129
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:42,796
This is bad!

130
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,763
If you don't do something,
you're gonna die!

131
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:47,730
Ichigo!

132
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:48,230
Ichigo!

133
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:56,196
-Look, now you have upset little
baby and it's all your fault.

134
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,563
Come on, nino.

135
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,263
It's time to use your Bankai.

136
00:10:02,396 --> 00:10:02,863
Ah.

137
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:10,063
-Getsuga--

138
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:11,496
-I already told you!

139
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,163
Don't underestimate me, nino!

140
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,296
-Bastard!

141
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,730
-Naughty boys who don't
listen will be punished!

142
00:10:26,663 --> 00:10:27,130
Cero!

143
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:44,783
Cero!

144
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:08,783
[gasping]

145
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,717
-Nel.

146
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,650
What the--

147
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:17,650
-What did she just
do to my Cero?

148
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,417
-Gah!

149
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,283
She swallowed it!

150
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:37,350
-What the hell?

151
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:40,050
You just-- are you
gonna be all right, Nel?

152
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:43,983
-Wah!

153
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,517
Listen, you!

154
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,050
Don't you be mean
to Ichigo again.

155
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:06,283
Ah!

156
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,450
-Oh, no!

157
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,417
-Heh.

158
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,083
I don't know who
you are, [spanish],

159
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:21,850
but you are impressive.

160
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:25,083
I never thought that someone
could deflect my Cero

161
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:27,817
while I was in my released form.

162
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:36,417
However, unruly children
need to learn their place.

163
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,550
Now get lost!

164
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:54,617
-If you want to
see it that badly,

165
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,383
then I guess I'll
show it to you.

166
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:59,750
I hope it was worth the wait.

167
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:03,683
Let me introduce
you to my Bankai.

168
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,483
-It's about time.

169
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:09,850
I knew you'd have to
use it eventually.

170
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:12,750
-Ichigo--

171
00:13:12,783 --> 00:13:15,750
[coughing]

172
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:19,017
ICHIGO: Nel, I'm sorry.

173
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,017
You got hurt because
I was being stubborn

174
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,983
about something that
doesn't even matter.

175
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:29,350
When I came here I wanted
to do things right,

176
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:31,050
so I decided that
in order to fight

177
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,317
on the level of the
Espada, I shouldn't

178
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,417
use my Bankai
against anyone else.

179
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,917
That was stupid.

180
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,383
-You think so?

181
00:13:43,417 --> 00:13:47,483
I think it's important for those
who want true strength to learn

182
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:51,317
to restrain themselves and
master the art of control.

183
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,717
I think it's a highly
empowering exercise.

184
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,783
-If my friends get
hurt because of it,

185
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:59,350
then the exercise becomes
stupid and pointless.

186
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:00,650
DORDONI: Wait a minute.

187
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:03,050
Are you saying that you're
not doing this for yourself?

188
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,283
You truly believe
there's no point

189
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:08,017
in being strong or powerful
other than to protect

190
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,050
your friends?

191
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,383
That's so kind, nino.

192
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:15,050
I think you must be a saint.

193
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:19,417
And yet, you have a
stronger form, don't you?

194
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,283
I know all about
your Hollowfication.

195
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,917
We're aware of what goes on
in your world of the living,

196
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,150
and all the battles
that you fought there.

197
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:33,483
You possess a technique that
makes you more like a Hollow,

198
00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:36,150
and experimentally
increases your battle power.

199
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:37,550
I've seen it!

200
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,450
Now you'll need to use it!

201
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:54,817
Interesting.

202
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,083
Impressive spiritual pressure.

203
00:14:57,117 --> 00:15:02,250
Still, I told you, I want to
see you release right now.

204
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:06,050
Show me your full power!

205
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,417
Do it now!

206
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,317
Or I'll force you to, nino!

207
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,750
ICHIGO: You bastard.

208
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,617
-Heh.

209
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,317
What's wrong?

210
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,617
Are you mad, nino?

211
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:34,483
What are you so upset about?

212
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,217
You're fulfilling
your saintly goal

213
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,350
of protecting your
little friend.

214
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:41,083
And my goal is simply
to defeat you in battle

215
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:43,583
when you're at full strength.

216
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:45,950
It's not a difficult concept.

217
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:49,050
If I can't get what I
want going after you,

218
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:53,017
I'll go after that
[spanish] instead.

219
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,083
-Is that so?

220
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:56,617
Don't you have any shame?

221
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,817
-Of course I do!

222
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,717
I'm ashamed of myself
for not getting

223
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,183
you to fight at full
strength before now!

224
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:11,350
Any other shame is
meaningless compared

225
00:16:11,383 --> 00:16:13,250
to battling with you, nino.

226
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,317
-All right, then.

227
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:28,583
Nel, give me a little room.

228
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:29,550
That's fine.

229
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,850
You'll be safe there, Nel.

230
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,217
Don't worry.

231
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,950
I don't plan on letting any
spiritual pressure get past me.

232
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:42,883
-Ichigo--

233
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:43,850
-Let's get started.

234
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:53,650
-Sorry, but I can only show
it to you for an instant.

235
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:56,650
-Oh, really?

236
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,583
-Really.

237
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,050
Trust me.

238
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:01,883
It'll be enough.

239
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:22,073
[laughter]

240
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,639
-That's more like it!

241
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:26,606
What powerful
spiritual pressure!

242
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:29,573
I'm excited by the
prospect of what's to come!

243
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:32,039
At last, I will
fight a worthy enemy!

244
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:32,873
Come on!

245
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:35,106
The time is finally here!

246
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:37,039
Let the great battle commence!

247
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:39,706
Now, at full strength, fight!

248
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:40,673
Fight, nino!

249
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:48,106
Oh?

250
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:49,606
What's happened?

251
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:51,073
What's going on?

252
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:58,506
-I told you.

253
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:02,473
Only an instant.

254
00:18:02,506 --> 00:18:03,939
-What a shame.

255
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:17,506
In my heart, I knew that
once we got the Hogyoku,

256
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:21,373
the former Espada would in
fact become ineffective.

257
00:18:21,406 --> 00:18:23,473
Totally useless.

258
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:27,106
And yet I stayed
on with Lord Aizen.

259
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:31,939
Even knowing all
of that, I stayed.

260
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:32,439
Still.

261
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:46,373
[groan]

262
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:47,206
-Urk!

263
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:51,173
[shout]

264
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:54,573
-What the-- what the hell
do you think you're doing?

265
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:56,173
-Just drooling all
over your face.

266
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:58,106
-I figured that out myself!

267
00:18:58,139 --> 00:18:59,973
What I want to
know is exactly why

268
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,206
you are drooling
all over my face!

269
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,806
-Quit your moaning, will ya?

270
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,239
I mean, it wasn't
that bad, Don Panini.

271
00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:07,306
-It's Dordoni!

272
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,639
Do I look like a
delicious sandwich to you?

273
00:19:10,673 --> 00:19:12,573
-Nel's drool is
no ordinary drool.

274
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,839
It's got all kinds of
healing properties in it.

275
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:16,173
Isn't that right?

276
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:17,139
-Yeah, that's right.

277
00:19:17,173 --> 00:19:19,106
All Nel has to do is this.

278
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:22,206
-Blech!

279
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,973
-Gah!

280
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:23,739
Disgusting!

281
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:25,573
-It's only saliva, silly.

282
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:26,139
-No way!

283
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:27,006
That was vomit!

284
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,273
I saw!

285
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:30,806
-Whenever Nel's uvula gets
squeezed, a lot of saliva

286
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:31,506
comes out!

287
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:32,873
-Saliva or vomit!

288
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,773
A real lady doesn't spray
that stuff on someone's face!

289
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:37,273
-I'm a girl.

290
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:38,739
-Huh?

291
00:19:38,773 --> 00:19:40,739
-Now, this is vomit.

292
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:41,706
Urk!

293
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:46,139
[scream]

294
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:56,839
-I have lost.

295
00:19:56,873 --> 00:20:00,139
And yet it feels good.

296
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:03,206
So much power was
running through my being.

297
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:05,906
I was completely overwhelmed
with an obsession

298
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,639
to defeat you in battle.

299
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,239
I knew I could block
any of your attacks,

300
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:16,239
and after that, my counter
attacks could finish you off.

301
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:21,573
I did not let my guard down,
and yet, I never saw it coming.

302
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:29,006
You are strong, nino.

303
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:33,539
-I'm not as strong as you think.

304
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:42,939
DORDONI: I suppose I wanted
to become an Espada again.

305
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:44,173
-Huh?

306
00:20:44,206 --> 00:20:48,073
-The Espada are Lord Aizen's
most dedicated servants.

307
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:51,339
But Lord Aizen views
the Espada another way.

308
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:55,806
He sees them as nothing more
than a tool to fight with.

309
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,006
I know that's how it
is, but still, that

310
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,939
has not changed what I want.

311
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:06,773
Those who have stood at the
top never forget the view.

312
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:10,539
I felt so incredibly
alive being up there.

313
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:14,539
I thought that if I defeated
you when you were at full power,

314
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:18,206
Lord Aizen would once again
acknowledge my strength,

315
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:20,706
and I'd be able to
take my rightful place

316
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:22,973
as a warrior of
the Espada again.

317
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:27,373
I wanted to force you to
complete your Hollowfication.

318
00:21:27,406 --> 00:21:30,939
I wanted it so badly.

319
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:33,606
And that has not changed!

320
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:37,073
[laughter]

321
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:38,573
-You bastard.

322
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:40,473
-Are you really surprised?

323
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:42,573
How could you be foolish
enough to allow someone

324
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:44,139
to heal your enemy's wounds?

325
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:46,339
You honestly think
now that I'm restored,

326
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,806
I'm not going to
attack you again?

327
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,839
-That's insane!

328
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:51,273
You're barely in one
piece, and now you

329
00:21:51,306 --> 00:21:53,406
wanna come back for more?

330
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:56,873
-Wounds can injure one's
body, but not one's spirit!

331
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:59,039
As long as my will to
fight remains strong,

332
00:21:59,073 --> 00:22:02,173
my physical wounds
are insignificant!

333
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:05,839
You're just as sweet
as the chocolate, nino!

334
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:15,373
[theme music]

335
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,506
GIN: In our next
episode, there's

336
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:46,273
a stage show for the Quincy
boy that involves whips.

337
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:48,906
AIZEN: Please make sure I've
got a good seat, and a nice cup

338
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:50,439
of hot tea.

339
00:23:50,473 --> 00:23:51,439
CIRUCCI: Ah, ha ha ha!

340
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,439
Take that, and that, and that!

341
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,473
URYU: Really!

342
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:58,006
How can I approve
of a show like this?
