Where the hell have you been?

-Where have I been?

What are you talking
about, Ichigo?

00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:00,908
You're the one who
took off without me.

-Shut up.

11
00:02:02,142 --> 00:02:04,142
You need to help me
find Yuzu and Karin.

00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:05,542
-What's the big deal?

13
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:06,642
They're back home.

14
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:08,008
I just saw both of them.

-Yeah, I'm sure.

They're safe and sound.

00:02:10,642 --> 00:02:12,508
So what you been up to?

19

-Good.

20
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:15,408
Then I'll go find Uryu.

00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:16,575
You take care of my sisters.

-Geez, if I knew they were
gonna make us clean up,

24
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:28,342
I never would have come
to see what happened.

25
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,775
Instead of lecturing us, why
not make the ones responsible

26
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:33,408
do the grunt work?

27
00:02:33,442 --> 00:02:35,842
-It's because you made
such a big deal out of it.

was acting kind of strange?

-What the-- what's
up with Orihime?

34
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:51,775
Orihime, you keep looking
so cute and spacey,

35
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:53,608

-Oh, guess what?

You guys, there's
this TV show I watch.

43
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:06,208
It's a new episode
I don't wanna miss.

44
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:07,008
So let's go home.

-Huh?

-Let's hurry.

I'll make us curried
popcorn, Tatsuki.

-Hey, what's the rush?

49

Take it easy, Orihime.

-I don't wanna be late.

51
00:03:14,942 --> 00:03:16,775
It's gonna start any minute.

52
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:23,175
The first thing I thought
was, I wish I didn't notice.

53
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:27,542
Then I thought, we have
to get away from here.

54
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,508
I'm certain of it now.

55
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,908
If we stay here,
we're in danger.

56
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:35,608
Somehow, every cell in my
body is tingling, warning me.

57
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:39,842
We've got to get away before
the situation gets worse.

58
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,808
But I have to appear calm.

59
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:44,108
I don't want the others
to know something bad is

I'll be there in no time.

it was that just hit me,

but I'm bleeding.

Still, it doesn't
really hurt that much.

adorable when you're crying.

you people doing?

ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Tatsuki.

143
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:27,408
-Hey, Orihime, about
that thing over there.

144
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:29,608
I should've noticed it sooner.

145
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:32,108
-So you can see that
creature as well?

146
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:34,508
-No, I don't see it.

147
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,575
But I can sense its presence.

148
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:39,875
I know exactly where that
thing is that made you cry.

149
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:40,842
Hey.

150
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,342
Yeah, you, you big blob.

151
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,142
You picked a fight with
the wrong person this time.

152

See, we have this
longstanding arrangement.

153
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:52,208
Anyone who makes Orihime cry
gets the snot beat out of them.

-You don't say?

155
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,375
-Move back.

00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:02,308
Ha.

157
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:05,675

who can give me a fight?

-So how do you feel now?

00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:33,042
The seed I shot
into you has begun

to take root in your body.

00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:38,475
And in just a little bit,
it'll take control of you.

Soon your body will be
mine to manipulate at will.

171
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:44,775
Now how shall I make you suffer?

172
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:46,208
-Shut up.

173
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:47,675
-What?

174
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,875
-I said, shut up.

175
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:55,342
Let go of her now.

176
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,675
-Don't you realize the
position you're in right now?

177
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:02,075
Soon, you'll have almost
no control of your body.

178
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,375
Here, I'll show you.

179
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:04,475
See?

180
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:07,108
[screams] What do you
think you're doing?

181
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:07,708
Let go.

182
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:09,075
Leg go.

183
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:10,008
Do you hear me?

184
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:13,008
I said let go!

185
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:14,475
You're not worth controlling.

186
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:15,475
Now die!

187
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:19,942
-Tatsuki!

188
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:25,842
-O-- Orihime.

189
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,308
Please, don't cry.

190
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:28,808
Ori--

191
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:40,675
[spluttering]

192
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,342
-Orihime, you have
such beautiful hair.

193
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,142
It's so long and shiny.

194
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:57,975
-That made me so happy.

195
00:09:58,008 --> 00:09:59,008
But when school started--

196
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:01,775
-What's with that
ridiculous hair?

197
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:05,542
We'll teach you to
be such a show off.

198
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:08,375
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): I
couldn't tell Sora the truth.

199
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,808
-What happened?

200
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,608
Why did you cut your hair?

201
00:10:11,642 --> 00:10:13,008
-I just felt like a change.

202
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:14,442
That's all.

203
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:19,708
He died soon after that, and I
just got lonelier and lonelier.

204
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:20,775
-Hello?

205
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:23,608
Earth to Orihime,
anybody home in there?

206
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:24,975
Hey, so what do you say?

207
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:27,642
Let's go home.

208
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:28,142
-Uh-huh.

209
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:34,842
You know, it's
because of you that I

210
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,408
was able to grow
my hair long again.

211
00:10:38,442 --> 00:10:42,642
And I'll never
cut my hair again.

212
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,908
That's because my long
hair proves something.

213
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:49,308
It proves my trust
in you, Tatsuki.

214
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:51,008
Thank you for doing
everything you

215
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,242
could to protect me until now.

216
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:59,208
So please, don't cry!

217
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,208
-Orihi-- Orihime.

218
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:05,675
-Tatsuki, this time,
I'll protect you.

219
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:10,642
-Impossible!

220
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:19,575
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
Tatsuki said to you,

221
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,608
you picked a fight
with the wrong person.

222
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:24,475
That's not quite right.

223
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:28,975
What she should have said was,
you picked the wrong person

224
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:29,942
to hurt.

225
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:37,308
Anyone who tries to hurt Tatsuki
will have to answer to me.

226
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:55,260
-Just what exactly are you?

227
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:56,826
Using those strange powers.

228
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,560
But how?

229
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,660
-Huh?

230
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:04,493
Who are you?

231
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:05,693
-Come on.

232
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,793
Don't tell me you didn't
notice us until just now.

233
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:09,293
-Sure, she noticed us.

234
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:12,893
I'm certain she knew
that we existed.

235
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:14,660
-Hmm?

236
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,426
-After all, once
you think about it,

237
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,393
haven't we always been
the ones closest to you?

238
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,793
Hello, Orihime.

239
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,560
We are the Shun Shun Rikka, your
six princess-shielding flowers.

240
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:37,160
And we've come here
to protect you.

241
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,626
-Now, wait a second.

242
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,893
Why are there a bunch of
little fairies flying around,

243
00:12:44,926 --> 00:12:46,093
talking to me?

244
00:12:46,126 --> 00:12:47,326
-Geez, that was some reaction.

245
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,293
But to be accurate,
we're not fairies.

246
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:51,526
-Huh?

247
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,260
-You see, we are the powers
from inside your soul.

248
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:57,526
And each one of us
is a part of you.

249
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,860
And only you are able to see us.

250
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:04,060
Uh, well, maybe people like
Ichigo Kurosaki can see us too.

251
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:06,060
-Ichigo?

252
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:07,526
Why him?

253
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,460
-Well, it's because of
him that we were born.

254
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:10,393
-You talk too much.

255
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,126
All right.

256
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,460
Listen up.

257
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,760
You don't need to know who
we are or where we came from.

258
00:13:17,793 --> 00:13:20,860
All you need to know is that
we're a part of your powers.

259
00:13:20,893 --> 00:13:23,693
-You're pretty bossy
for somebody so tiny.

260
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:25,093
-Real funny.

261
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:27,493
Just shut up and learn
how to use us right now.

262
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:28,726
-Learn how to use you?

263
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,826
-That's right.

264
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,760
-You can use our power
to construct a shield

265
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:33,426
to reject any spirit attacks.

266
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,026
-In order to
activate this shield,

267
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,960
you must use your heart and
our kotodama, a spirit chant.

268
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:40,760
-K-- kotodama?

269
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:41,826
-Wait a second.

270
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,460
It's coming.

271
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,726
-So what are you doing
mumbling to yourself?

272
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,660
Tell me, young girl.

273
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:53,826
-It's time, Orihime.

274
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,893
Now, call out our names!

275
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,426
-I am Hinagiku.

276
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,493
-I am Baigon.

277
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:00,593
-My name's Lily.

278
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,493
-Stay calm.

279
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:06,260
You must summon them
with your kotodama.

280
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:07,893
Now repeat after me.

281
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:10,260
Hinagiku, Baigon, Lily, hurry!

282
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:16,660
-Hinagiku, Baigon, Lily.

283
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:18,093
-[speaking japanese].

284
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:19,526
I reject.

285
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,460
-[speaking japanese].

286
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,426
I reject.

287
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,260
-What?

288
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:30,160
-Their powers let them
create a shield between you

289
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:32,926
and your enemy and then reject
what's outside that shield

290
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,893
so they're able to protect
you from any outside attack.

291
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:41,060
You see, we have the ability to
reject what is within a shield.

292
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:43,260
We are able to make a defined
space with our shield.

293
00:14:43,293 --> 00:14:44,893
And then we can
reverse any damage

294
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,893
that has been inflicted
inside that space.

295
00:14:47,926 --> 00:14:49,293
Now, say our names.

296
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:50,660
I am Shuno.

297
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:53,460
-And I'm Ayame.

298
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,693
-Shuno, Ayame.

299
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:57,693
SHUNO (OFFSCREEN): Now
recite our kotodama.

300
00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:59,193
-[speaking japanese].

301
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:00,193
I reject.

302
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:09,160
Tatsuki.

303
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:10,026
-Quit it.

304
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,726
This is no time for tears.

305
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,226
I'm up next, missy.

306
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,660
I'm able to reject on both sides
by blowing a hole in the enemy

307
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:21,060
and creating a shield inside,
which cuts the enemy in half.

308
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:22,560
Now you must say my name.

309
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:24,393
It is Tsubaki.

310
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:26,660
Then recite my kotodama.

311
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:27,660
-Tsubaki.

312
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:32,060
[speaking japanese] I reject.

313
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:33,526
[growls]

314
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,826
-Impossible.

315
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,993
[screams]

316
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:47,993
[panting]

317
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:49,493
-I did it.

318
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,626
-Orihime.

319
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,460
-Orihime.

320
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:54,726
-Orihime.

321
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,126
-Oh, well.

322
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,426
I guess using all of our powers
at once was too much for her.

323
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,226
-On the other hand, Orihime
did really well, didn't she?

324
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:33,693
[panting]

325
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,660
-Huh?

326
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,693
The man's not here.

327
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:39,093
-Are you sure that
this is the place?

328
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:40,393
-I'm sure this is it.

329
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:42,693
The man was beaten up and
left lying right here.

330
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,726
ISSHIN (OFFSCREEN): Karin,
I cannot believe this.

331
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,226
You are such a liar.

332
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,293
-I'm not a liar.

333
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:49,526
The guy was right
here, and he was hurt.

334
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:53,626
-That's all right, Karin.

335
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,526
I think I know what
you're doing here.

336
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,660
Daddy's been so busy
with his work lately,

337
00:16:57,693 --> 00:16:59,593
he's had almost no
time for you, has he?

338
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:02,326
But there's no need to
make up wild stories just

339
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,760
to get your father's attention.

340
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:10,826
Karin, come on over and give
your hunky dad a big old hug.

341
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,826
That-a girl.

342
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,593
-You're an idiot, Dad.

343
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,960
-I think maybe we
should go home now.

344
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:19,793
This place gives me the creeps.

345
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:22,126
-My nose.

346
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,460
-You're hopeless.

347
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:26,626
-Looks to me like
another happy ending.

348
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,126
Good.

349
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:32,160
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Chad?

350
00:17:32,193 --> 00:17:33,326
-You're up.

351
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,426
Good morning.

352
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:34,993
-Hi.

353
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:36,993
Good morning.

354
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:38,426
Um, Chad?

355
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,293
So where are we?

356
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,426
-Don't know.

357
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,760
MAN (OFFSCREEN): I see
you're finally awake.

358
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:48,726
-Him?

359
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,226
-I'm not too sure.

360
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,660
But apparently, this guy must've
been the one who saved us.

361
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:56,826
-Well, I suppose that's
one way to look at it.

362
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,726
Now then, where should I begin?

363
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:04,093
-Damn it.

364
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,626
Damn that Uryu.

365
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,393
I'll make him pay
for doing this.

366
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,793
-I can't kill them with
just one shot anymore.

367
00:18:17,826 --> 00:18:18,926
Something's wrong.

368
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,293
I'm losing my strength,
and there are far too

369
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:24,326
many Hollows coming for
that small amount of bait.

370
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,893
It's as if they were lured here
by an even greater force yet

371
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:30,126
to reveal itself or its purpose.

372
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,926
But none of that matters.

373
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,093
Sensei, I swear to you I
will avenge your death.

374
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:41,993
- Hakuro , number four.

375
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:42,493
Yakura .

376
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,726
Damn it.

377
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,960
These Hollows are small
fry, practically harmless,

378
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:53,660
yet I can't beat them.

379
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:55,493
After two months in
this Gigai, I still

380
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:57,560
don't have my strength back.

381
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:58,060
Huh?

382
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,060
Is that Ichigo?

383
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:12,226
-I've wanted to do
this for so long.

384
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,593
-You're Kon, right?

385
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:18,526
-It even feels good to
get kicked like this.

386
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,360
-Kon, this is no time to
be acting like an idiot.

387
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,626
Wait.

388
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,293
If you're back in
Ichigo's body again,

389
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:27,660
then Ichigo must've gotten
transformed into a Soul Reaper.

390
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:28,960
-Check it out, sis.

391
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:30,293
Look behind you.

392
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:32,026
-What?

393
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,926
-That's a good sign.

394
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,593
Apparently, this area's safe.

395
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:37,926
Rukia Kuchiki.

396
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,526
So this is actually
the first time

397
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,826
I've spoken to you face to face.

398
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,826
-Is he ignoring me?

399
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,293
[growls]

400
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:45,726
Ow.

401
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,660
-I get it.

402
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,626
So this is all your doing.

403
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,860
-Yes, I started this contest
between me and the Soul Reaper.

404
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:53,093
-Now what?

405
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,460
-No need to worry.

406
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,893
I have no intention of letting
any innocent bystanders die.

407
00:19:57,926 --> 00:20:00,493
Ichigo may run out of
strength during the battle.

408
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:02,760
But even if he
does, I will protect

409
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:05,060
the citizens of this town.

410
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:08,260
Then, while the Soul Reaper
stands by and watches,

411
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:10,326
I alone will kill the Hollows.

412
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,693
-Huh?

413
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:14,326
-If I can't accomplish
that, then this whole battle

414
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,960
is meaningless.

415
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:19,393
-I hope you mean it.

416
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,760
-Now just what are
you saying here?

417
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:32,060
-Excuse me, but all this stuff
about Soul Reapers and Hollows

418
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:33,993
is just so sudden.

419
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,460
-Then tell me, do
you deny the fact

420
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:38,826
that you were attacked just now?

421
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,593
-Well--

422
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:40,860
-Um--

423
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:44,026
-Ichigo Kurosaki, a Soul
Reaper, is fighting Hollows

424
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,526
even as we speak.

425
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,493
And the strong
spiritual energy he

426
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:50,860
has released during that fight
has had an influence on you.

427
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:54,360
So now you know.

428
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:56,926
However, it's all up
to you whether or not

429
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,326
you choose to open the gate
that has appeared before you.

430
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,193
-Oh.

431
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:03,626
-Excuse me, boss.

432
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,560
-Hmm?

433
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,826
-The Sky Rift is
beginning to open.

434
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,560
-And the preparations?

435
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:09,393
-All set.

436
00:21:09,426 --> 00:21:11,560
-Well, then, let's go.

437
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:17,960
You did want proof?

438
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:20,993
Then come see for yourself
what lies beyond the gate.

-So I found you, Uryu.

I never felt this empty before.

And if I ever need
someone to come along,

who's gonna comfort
me and keep me strong?
