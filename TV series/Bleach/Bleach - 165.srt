Mundo and infiltrated

Aizen's fortress,
known as Los Noches.

Upon entering the fortress,

by some of Aizen's
most deadly Arrancars.

Renji was confronted
by Szayelaporro Granz

they would have to team up to
take on the powerful Espada

Put yourself in my

ORIHIME (VOICEOVER):
There's an incredible amount

of spirit energy swirling
around Ichigo's wounds.

-It was Ulquiorra.

when you sneak up on me

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,323
and get in my face
like that, it feels

like I'm going to
have a heart attack.

There's no guarantee.

Ichigo is a very focused person.

Whenever he tells you
something this important,

202
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,503
he says it like he's
swearing an oath.

203

He did that when he
appeared before me

He does it to reassure us,
but more than that, he's

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,036
making a promise to himself.

213
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,370
He makes a promise to
himself, and then he

214

recites it out loud so
it will become a reality.
