1
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:13,333
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:20,900
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,466
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,533
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:31,533
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:22,526
You better watch your
mouth Ichigo! Talk like
that will get you in
trouble around here!

7
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:25,826
Try taking a deep breath
Lieutenant Abarai.

8
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,593
I beg your pardon sir, but I
find it completely inconceivable
that Captain Kuchiki would ever
betray us!

9
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:34,326
There must be a
plausible reason for
his actions!

10
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,926
I don't know what his
reasoning is...

11
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,560
But I do know that
Byakuya is working with
his Zanpakuto.

12
00:02:55,193 --> 00:02:59,360
This is great. We still
haven't been able to
locate Old Man Yama,

13
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:02,593
and now Captain Kuchiki
has turned against us?

14
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:05,860
So what other surprises
are out there waiting for
us?

15
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:06,893
Captain.

16
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,793
The only good news is
that after quite an ordeal,
Captain Hitsugaya was able
to recover his Zanpakuto.

17
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:18,926
<i>But the battle he fought</i>
<i>cost him. He will not be</i>
<i>able to fight for</i>
<i>sometime.</i>

18
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,793
Now we know how to
reclaim our Zanpakuto.
But we cannot afford to risk
such injury in every fight.

19
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:31,360
I'm afraid I must share
more distressing news
from Squad Twelve
regarding this subject.

20
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:37,293
After testing the samples
we provided, they learned
that there would be
serious consequences if a

21
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:40,593
Zanpakuto were destroyed
by anyone other than its
master.

22
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,326
It appears that if
Zanpakuto are destroyed
that way, they could be
lost for good.

23
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,093
Really?

24
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:50,993
Then what are we going to
do when we're fighting
against someone else's
Zanpakuto?!

25
00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:53,660
I guess we'll have to
go easy on them.

26
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,693
How do we do
that? We're barely
beating them now!

27
00:03:56,726 --> 00:04:02,093
You're right-this is a
tough one to figure. It
sure seems the enemy's
plan is to have us

28
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:04,393
destroy our own
Zanpakuto.

29
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:09,693
Sir.

30
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:14,526
I suggest we keep Captain
Kuchiki's defection a
secret from all personnel
except our captains.

31
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,926
Nope. If we start
keeping secrets now, the
rumors will start and
create problems that

32
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,993
might affect troop
morale.

33
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:23,860
It's not easy to keep
people from talking.

34
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,326
And so how do you propose
that we explain this to
Rukia?

35
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,260
I'll take care of that.

36
00:04:30,293 --> 00:04:32,160
<i>Captain Ukitake.</i>

37
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:36,260
She'll be fine. Rukia
will have to accept the
truth as we have.

38
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:43,293
Byakuya did what?!

39
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:48,160
It's true. Byakuya
Kuchiki has joined the
rebellious Zanpakuto.

40
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:57,426
We shouldn't jump to
conclusions, it could just
be he's trying to handle
the matter on his own.

41
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,026
Yes. That could be it.

42
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:07,793
<i>Byakuya.</i>

43
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:35,560
Byakuya Kuchiki!

44
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:37,860
What's this guy doing
here?

45
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:39,526
What's going on?

46
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,693
Muramasa, what is the
meaning of this?

47
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:44,626
Why did you help me?

48
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:47,760
Senbonzakura.

49
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:52,093
Explain why a man of your
rank turn against the
Soul Reapers?

50
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,560
<i>He turned against his own</i>
<i>people?</i>

51
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:57,826
You mean he's on our
side now?

52
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:03,560
The reason I have come to
this decision, is strictly
based on my own pride.

53
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:08,460
Ha! Your own pride, my
ass! I don't believe this
guy for a second!

54
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,793
But his actions prove
it-he helped us to
escape.

55
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:21,560
What is this?!

56
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:23,760
What do you think
he's here for?!

57
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:28,760
Wait, why are
you doing this?

58
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,326
All of us are here
because we've grown
weary of our Soul
Reapers.

59
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,060
Expecting us to accept
you into our group would
go against everything we
have fought for...

60
00:06:40,093 --> 00:06:43,993
That's for sure. Besides,
he could just be a spy.

61
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:50,426
Byakuya Kuchiki, if you
are indeed serious about
defecting from the Soul
Reapers, then you need to

62
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,793
do something to prove it
to us.

63
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:55,460
So what is it you want me
to do?

64
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:03,760
Slay your sister's
Zanpakuto, Sodenoshirayuki,
right here and now.

65
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:11,093
Hey, hold on! What
are you talking about?!

66
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,326
You want him to slay one
of us?!

67
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,460
A Zanpakuto killed by
someone other than its
wielder, never returns to
its original form.

68
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:22,660
This test will certainly
show us where his true
loyalties lie.

69
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,693
Ha! This oughta be good!

70
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:29,460
He really does love this
Rukia Kuchiki, more than
anyone.

71
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:33,393
So then you're saying
there's no way he would
slay her Zanpakuto.

72
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:35,193
Hey wait!

73
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:37,893
So from the start, you
never intended to let him
join us.

74
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:39,960
No, of course
we didn't!

75
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:45,093
This farce will end here.
Time to settle this,
Byakuya.

76
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:51,226
You want her slain now,
you say?

77
00:08:01,793 --> 00:08:03,926
Hey! Looks like he means
it.

78
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:17,126
<i>Tsuginomai!</i>

79
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:19,360
Hakuren!

80
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:24,226
<i>Hado number four.</i>
<i>Byakurai!</i>

81
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:33,426
He's going to
finish her!

82
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,460
Even if you really want to
kill me, you don't have the
strength to defeat me in your
present condition.

83
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,860
Somenomai!...Tsukishiro!

84
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,726
Tsukishiro!

85
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,860
Stealth Hoho. Shiho
Number Three.
Utsusemi.

86
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,793
Rikujokoro.

87
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:19,193
This can't be!

88
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:24,793
If it is for the sake of
my pride, there is nothing
I won't destroy.

89
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:43,326
I don't believe it!

90
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,293
Have you lost your mind!?

91
00:09:57,326 --> 00:10:01,993
No-not at all. You
could never even begin to
comprehend my mind.

92
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,260
What was that?! Are you
mocking me!

93
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:06,826
That's enough.

94
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,426
<i>Muramasa.</i>

95
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:17,126
We all know, a Soul
Reaper who's lost her
Zanpakuto is as good as
dead.

96
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:23,460
And even knowing that, he
callously snapped his
sister's sword without
hesitation.

97
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:27,426
You are free to join us.
I accept your resolve.

98
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:32,926
What the hell is going
on??

99
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,326
<i>Relax, Kazeshini.</i>

100
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,626
If Muramasa says that
he's all right, we need
to accept that.

101
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,693
Keep this in mind
Byakuya, if you waiver for
even a second, I will slay
you without hesitating!

102
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:52,260
Know that I'll always
be right here, watching
your every move!

103
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,060
Now then, Byakuya
Kuchiki. If you are
truly going to be
joining us...

104
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:05,260
There is a certain,
matter I want you to take
care of for me.

105
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,693
Thanks, Renji.

106
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:21,026
Don't mention it. I
was thinking about doing
the same thing.

107
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:24,726
The Captain may have left
behind some clues in his
office.

108
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:31,260
Rukia, I'm sure Byakuya
will be back soon.

109
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:34,860
He's too good a man to
ever be a traitor to us.

110
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:38,793
Yeah. I believe that as
much as you do.

111
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:43,626
<i>Lieutenant Abarai, sir!</i>

112
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,393
We're ready to change
shifts sir.

113
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:47,360
Good! Be right there!

114
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:50,093
Rukia. Try not to
work too hard.

115
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,226
Okay thanks.

116
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,426
See ya.

117
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:17,026
Byakuya. You always sat
alone,

118
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:20,826
What were you thinking?

119
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:52,393
I must've dozed off.
feel worn out.

120
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,060
It's his spiritual
pressure!

121
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,817
Byakuya.

122
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,817
Rukia.

123
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,750
Did you--?

124
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:42,750
It's been a long time.
What are you doing here,
Byakuya?

125
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,683
<i>Where have you been?</i>

126
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,917
Why is it that you
won't answer me?!

127
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:51,250
This is his answer!

128
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,750
Who are you?

129
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:57,383
Sodenoshirayuki!

130
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:02,183
I don't sense her
Spiritual Pressure! Did
he actually---?!

131
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:07,617
With your Zanpakuto,
Sodenoshirayuki gone, you
have no means to fight
us.

132
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,050
Impossible.

133
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:23,283
You will stay out of our
way.

134
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,250
Byakuya. What have you
done?

135
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,583
<i>I'll be glad to show</i>
<i>you.</i>

136
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:33,983
Renji!

137
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,017
Damn it!

138
00:14:38,183 --> 00:14:41,183
Captain! I need to know
what has happened to you!

139
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,950
Are you really on their
side? What reason could
you have to betray us?!

140
00:14:56,417 --> 00:15:03,783
Captain Kuchiki, I have no
choice but to detain you as
a material witness in the
Zanpakuto Rebellion incident.

141
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:08,583
Stand aside. Or you
will suffer the results
of obstructing my path.

142
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:10,083
I will not!

143
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:22,650
Damn it!

144
00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:24,017
Roar!

145
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:29,450
I heard you used
Higazekko in a previous
fight, so I know what
shape you're in.

146
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:33,683
Which means that, you can't
even use Shikai with that sword.

147
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:37,150
<i>Who can't use their</i>
<i>Shikai?</i>

148
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,383
Oh. It's you two!

149
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:51,050
In the larger scheme of
things now that both of
us have manifested,
whether Renji can use

150
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,417
Shikai or not, really has
no importance here.

151
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,483
Yeah-that's right.

152
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:57,983
I'll take care of this.
You return to Muramasa.

153
00:15:58,617 --> 00:16:01,817
Oh, so you think you're
ready to take us on?

154
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,350
Sounds good, maybe we can
finally settle that unfinished
business of ours.

155
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:12,217
I would not be so confident
if I were you. With your skills,
you will be lucky just to
survive.

156
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,017
Heh! Sounds like
you're underrating our
abilities!

157
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,750
Come on, let's
do it, Snake.

158
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:19,217
I'm with you, Monkey!

159
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:22,983
Roar!

160
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,417
Wait up!

161
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,650
<i>Byakuya-Don't go!</i>

162
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:43,883
You and I are not
finished yet!

163
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:47,183
I do not have the time
to explain all of this to
you.

164
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,917
It's clear that talking
to you does no good.

165
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,550
Shakkaho!

166
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:37,017
So this is how you fight
when you can't use Shikai.
Well, it will not be good
enough to defeat me.

167
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:42,417
Yeah, you're probably right.
But it might just work well
enough for me to capture you!

168
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,383
Take this!

169
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:18,117
Shakkaho!

170
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:28,783
Hado number four.
Byaku---

171
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:32,650
Bakudo Number Four!
Hainawa!

172
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,917
You're going to tell me
everything!

173
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,017
I want to know what
could've caused you to
turn your back on all of
us!

174
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:51,917
My turn!

175
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:58,183
Jerk!

176
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,450
There's nowhere to run!

177
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:08,517
You mean for you?

178
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,483
What?!

179
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,483
Bankai!

180
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:19,583
Hihio Zabimaru!

181
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:24,083
You need to explain why
you've done this!

182
00:19:24,383 --> 00:19:29,283
I'm gonna force you to
explain it! To all of the
Captains and to Ichigo!

183
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:34,183
You're gonna explain it
to all of Squad Six's
members!

184
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:36,517
And to your sister Rukia!

185
00:19:37,283 --> 00:19:39,783
Hikotsu Taiho!

186
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:54,583
What?!

187
00:19:55,617 --> 00:19:57,117
Bankai.

188
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,483
Scatter.

189
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,450
Renji!

190
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,217
Are you all right?

191
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:29,350
Byakuya.

192
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:33,650
This is your final
warning. Stay out of
our way.

193
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,583
Brother, why?!

194
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,617
Hey, come on now, aren't
you going to finish them
off?

195
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:50,183
It sure looks to me like
you were having fun, right?

196
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:54,317
What are you all doing
here?

197
00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:01,383
Is that any way to greet
us? Muramasa said to lend
you two a hand, so we all
came to help with things.

198
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,917
Beat those Soul Reapers
to death! Do it now!

199
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,950
What's wrong? You
not gonna do it?

200
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,083
Well then, if you
won't do it...

201
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,250
We're happy to
do it for you!

202
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,450
Get going, Rukia! I'll
stay here and hold them
off!

203
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:29,917
As weak as you are?
Don't be ridiculous!

204
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,983
Go!

205
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:34,183
Enough chitchat! Your
lives will soon be over!

206
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:37,783
And there'll be two
less Soul Reapers to--

207
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,917
What the hell is this?!

208
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,250
<i>Don't move!</i>

209
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,417
No one move!

210
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,683
<i>Hey! Up here!</i>

211
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:52,917
You're gonna beat who
to death?

212
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,450
Damn bastards!

213
00:22:02,717 --> 00:22:04,583
Rukia! You all right?

214
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:09,283
Byakuya.

215
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:52,440
Byakuya Kuchiki. As
proof that you are one of
us, you'll wear a mask
identical to mine.

216
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:53,207
<i>Why?</i>

217
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,074
Because Muramasa approved
it.

218
00:23:55,107 --> 00:23:56,374
<i>Why?</i>

219
00:23:56,407 --> 00:24:00,407
It's a fine mask. It
will help you feel the
spirit of the samurai.

220
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,307
<i>Why?</i>
