00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:50,547
NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

3
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:53,214
who has been kidnapped
by the Arrancars,

4
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,747
Ichigo, Chad, and
Uryu have snuck

5
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:59,047
into the world of the
Hollows, known as Hueco Mundo.

6
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:02,081
They crushed the Arrancars
who were trying to stop them,

7
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:05,447
headed to Sosuke Aizen's
headquarters, Las Noches.

8
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:09,347
They came across odd
Arrancars named Nel, Pesche,

9
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:11,881
and Dondochakka, and
wound up traveling

10
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:13,947
with the strange companions.

11
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:15,947
Ichigo go and his
friends hurried on,

12
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:18,514
but the Guardian of the
White Sand, Runuganga,

13
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:21,081
appeared before them
and blocked their way.

14
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:24,114
Faced with an enemy who was not
affected by physical attacks,

15
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:26,147
they were in a
perilous situation,

16
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,147
and could not defend themselves.

17
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,014
They were in grave trouble.

18
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:31,014
But at that moment--

19
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:47,114
-Why did you go off on
your own to Hueco Mundo?

20
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:48,914
Why couldn't you have
just waited for us

21
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:50,814
to come back and help you?

22
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:54,181
-Because, I had no idea if you
were actually going to come

23
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:54,847
back or not--

24
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:56,681
-Of course we were!

25
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:59,081
No matter what!

26
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:01,214
Renji and I were
planning on coming back

27
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,114
from the very beginning.

28
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:05,681
Why didn't you wait for us?

29
00:03:05,714 --> 00:03:07,247
Why couldn't you trust us?

30
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:13,081
I thought we were supposed
to be your friends, Ichigo.

31
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:25,114
NARRATOR: Despite the fact
that Runuganga was utterly

32
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:28,781
defeated in battle, he appears
before Ichigo and his friends

33
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:29,514
once again.

34
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:39,814
He's still alive?

35
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:42,414
We're going to have some
problems with this guy.

36
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:43,647
-It can't be!

37
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,847
I standard him
into 1,000 pieces.

38
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:48,414
-Stop right there.

39
00:03:48,447 --> 00:03:50,147
You'll go no further.

40
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:54,314
I won't let you take another
step toward Las Noches.

41
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:56,647
-Runuganga is made of sand.

42
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:00,414
So it makes sense for there
to be more than one of him.

43
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:04,147
-So this is a second body.

44
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,681
-Dance, Sode no Shirayuki.

45
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:14,281
Tsugi no mai, Hakuren.

46
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:21,714
[roar]

47
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:22,481
-Rukia!

48
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:25,581
-Want are you doing?

49
00:04:25,614 --> 00:04:26,614
-Sorry.

50
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:28,181
I got too excited.

51
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:29,681
[scream]

52
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:33,647
-You hurt him, lady!

53
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:34,147
-Whoa!

54
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:19,514
[screaming]

55
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:20,014
-Damn.

56
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:27,481
-Huh?

57
00:05:27,514 --> 00:05:29,481
What's that?

58
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:29,981
-Whoa!

59
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:42,481
-Hey, you guys, is
everybody all right?

60
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:43,947
-You could say that.

61
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:46,914
-Seems we're all right.

62
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,481
-Thanks a lot, Bawabawa.

63
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,847
[mumbling]

64
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:55,514
[scream]

65
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:57,214
-Boy, that hurts.

66
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:59,281
-Watch where you're
fallin', Nel!

67
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:02,514
PESCHE: An unfortunate
fate awaits you, evildoers!

68
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:03,014
-Look out!

69
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:03,981
Step aside!

70
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:09,147
Now, that was really close.

71
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:11,414
-Excellent reflexes, bad guys.

72
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:12,414
-Hell, yeah.

73
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:14,781
-Can you believe
that perfect landing?

74
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:19,847
-Dammit.

75
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,181
Whatever.

76
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,314
Where the hell are we?

77
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,147
URYU: Underground.

78
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,081
Right?

79
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:31,514
ICHIGO: We fell from up there.

80
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:32,014
Didn't we?

81
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:37,381
-Hm.

82
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:38,747
What's this?

83
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,014
-Hey, what's up?

84
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:41,614
Something wrong?

85
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:43,514
URYU: This is a tree.

86
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:44,581
ICHIGO: A tree?

87
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:45,781
-That's right.

88
00:06:45,814 --> 00:06:48,214
It's the same as the ones
growing above ground.

89
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:48,914
Hm.

90
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:50,314
I see.

91
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:52,581
The trees above
ground are actually

92
00:06:52,614 --> 00:06:54,381
the tops of these giant trees.

93
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:59,347
-They reach all the way up?

94
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:01,981
Right to the surface?

95
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:04,881
CHAD: Have you noticed
how huge this place is?

96
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:06,281
RENJI: Yeah.

97
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:08,847
Fact is, I can't see how we're
ever going to get out of here.

98
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:09,814
[shivering]

99
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:10,781
-Huh?

100
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:13,714
What's wrong?

101
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:17,081
-This is-- it's
the Menos Forest.

102
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:18,681
-Hold on a second.

103
00:07:18,714 --> 00:07:19,681
What's that?

104
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:21,547
I've never heard of
the Menos Forest.

105
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,814
-It's exactly as I thought.

106
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:25,014
-What do you mean, Uryu?

107
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:26,381
Can you explain?

108
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:29,947
-Well, it was very far away,
but when we were all falling,

109
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,947
I could've sworn I
saw a group of Menos.

110
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:38,381
I imagine that in this world,
Arrancars and Espada both

111
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,414
live right on the surface.

112
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:42,614
While the Gillians and
all of the lesser Hollows

113
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:44,347
live underground.

114
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,747
Is that correct?

115
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:46,314
-Yeah.

116
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:47,647
You're right.

117
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,181
ICHIGO: Which means--

118
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:54,014
RENJI: It means that this forest
has Hollows behind every tree.

119
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,581
-Nel, do you know the
way back to the surface?

120
00:07:56,614 --> 00:07:58,614
-Nel only hear rumors
of the Menos Forest.

121
00:07:58,647 --> 00:07:59,947
It's a new place for Nel.

122
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:02,514
This is the first time
Nel has ever been here.

123
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:05,247
Nel doesn't know of
any way out of here.

124
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:06,214
D'aw!

125
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:08,147
This isn't any good!

126
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:09,614
We're all going to die for sure!

127
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:11,514
-It's really a forest of death!

128
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:12,114
-Yeah, man.

129
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:13,881
Danger!

130
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:15,281
-Hey, don't worry, Nel.

131
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:16,447
It's all right.

132
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,381
We found a way into this
forest, and now we're

133
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,381
going to find a way out.

134
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:23,681
-Ichigo.

135
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:24,814
-It's logical.

136
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:27,147
The fact that we can
see Hollows indicates

137
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:31,147
that they have a way in, which
really means there's a way out.

138
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:32,447
-Very good, evildoers.

139
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:34,381
That's a pretty
clever thing to say.

140
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,447
-You guys are very impressive.

141
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:39,414
-Honestly, it doesn't please
me much to be praised by you.

142
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:40,347
-Hm.

143
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:41,714
-All right.

144
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:43,881
If you guys don't mind, I'd like
to get the hell out of here.

145
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:51,114
-Hey, Ichigo.

146
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:52,614
Rukia's missing.

147
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:54,514
-Huh?

148
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:56,214
-When did she disappear?

149
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:58,381
-Probably when we were
swallowed up in the sand.

150
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:10,650
-What happened?

151
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:11,317
Where am I?

152
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:18,250
Ichigo!

153
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:26,050
Dammit.

154
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:27,850
Where are Ichigo and the others?

155
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:02,184
Damn.

156
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:04,684
Why are there so many Hollows?

157
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:07,250
I keep defeating them, but
their numbers don't diminish.

158
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:09,184
They're as many as when I began.

159
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:13,984
I have to rejoin Ichigo and
the others as soon as possible.

160
00:10:14,017 --> 00:10:14,950
Ichigo!

161
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:15,584
Renji!

162
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:17,850
Where are you?

163
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,317
What's that?

164
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,717
Sode no mai!

165
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,217
Tsukishiro!

166
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:27,839
If I can just get there...

167
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:48,573
Menos Grande?

168
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:56,484
A Cero!

169
00:10:56,517 --> 00:10:56,984
Whoa!

170
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,517
ICHIGO: Hey!

171
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,450
Rukia!

172
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:36,417
RENJI: Rukia!

173
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,617
Where are you?

174
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,250
URYU: Rukia!

175
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:40,550
-Hey, Soul Reaper!

176
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:44,917
-What's the deal?

177
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,784
We can't find her anywhere.

178
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:49,017
-We fell from the
same place, after all.

179
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,784
I don't really see how she
could've gotten that far.

180
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:53,750
-Oh-- I got it.

181
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:55,184
-What is it, Ichigo?

182
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:58,084
-Rukia's really small, and
kind of a lightweight, right?

183
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:58,917
OK.

184
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,350
Maybe she just got blown away.

185
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:02,817
-You're right, Ichigo!

186
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,484
That would explain it!

187
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:05,884
It makes perfect sense.

188
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:08,650
That's why we couldn't find her
when we searched this place.

189
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,884
-What do you think Rukia is?

190
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,884
Some kind of kite, or something?

191
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,784
[mumbling]

192
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:16,650
-Huh?

193
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:17,217
What?

194
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:17,917
Hold on.

195
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,517
What's he trying to say?

196
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:24,684
[mumbling]

197
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:25,417
-Oh.

198
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,717
Hey, Ichigo?

199
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,084
Bawabawa says that he's
going to climb a tree

200
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:30,817
and try to find her.

201
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,317
-Hm?

202
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:32,950
-Ah!

203
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:34,017
Bawabawa!

204
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,550
What a good boy!

205
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:37,117
All right.

206
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,484
Go!

207
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:39,384
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

208
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:40,884
Go and get a good look.

209
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:42,917
Look all around for
that vile Soul Reaper

210
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,917
with your sharp eyes, Bawabawa.

211
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,850
-Heh, heh.

212
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:47,617
That's a good idea, Pesche.

213
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,550
-Hey.

214
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:49,850
He just called her
vile, didn't he?

215
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:51,650
-And he doesn't
have eyes, either.

216
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:55,850
-You know, all of your
comments aren't helping here.

217
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:56,817
Wait a minute.

218
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,950
[mumble]

219
00:12:57,984 --> 00:12:59,617
-I want to see what this
underground area looks

220
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,684
like as a whole.

221
00:13:00,717 --> 00:13:03,550
Let me jump on and
look for myself.

222
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:04,217
-I'm going, too.

223
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:09,384
-Give it your best, Bawabawa!

224
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,217
We know you can do it!

225
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,517
-They don't give up.

226
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,017
Impressive.

227
00:13:17,284 --> 00:13:19,417
-I'm very grateful
that you saved me,

228
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,784
but it's time to put me down.

229
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:23,850
You can let go of me.

230
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,417
I told you to let go.

231
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,117
Hey.

232
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,350
Are you listening to me?

233
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,484
See you later.

234
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:43,684
What?

235
00:13:52,384 --> 00:13:53,184
Hold on.

236
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:56,917
What do you think you're doing?

237
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,717
-Just bear with me.

238
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,484
We will arrive at my
hideout momentarily.

239
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:06,584
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): This man--

240
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:07,184
-Get ready.

241
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,612
-There are many
sounds in the forest.

242
00:14:42,646 --> 00:14:45,712
-There are several odd
spiritual pressures.

243
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:49,179
-So, what should we do?

244
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:51,179
-They'll die if we
leave them alone.

245
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,346
-Hey.

246
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,146
We received a notice
from Las Noches.

247
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,079
-It looks like we're
going to have some fun.

248
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,546
Heh, heh, heh.

249
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:13,979
-Huh?

250
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:26,846
Hey.

251
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,179
Is that a light created by Kido?

252
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:53,012
It's true.

253
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:55,346
You're really a
Soul Reaper, right?

254
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:56,646
Where are you assigned?

255
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,479
What's your squad?

256
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,512
Tell the truth.

257
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,079
You left your
school, didn't you?

258
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:05,779
Well?

259
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:06,646
What do you have to say?

260
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,112
-My name is Ashido.

261
00:16:09,146 --> 00:16:10,779
-Ashido?

262
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:14,579
-And this place is
called the Menos Forest.

263
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:17,012
-The Menos Forest?

264
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:19,012
-This is where Menos live.

265
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,812
It is a world that is far away
from the rules of the Soul

266
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:22,279
Society.

267
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:34,846
-What are you trying to do?

268
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:36,679
You don't want to talk, huh?

269
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:37,879
You have nothing to say?

270
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:53,346
He's strong.

271
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,012
I can tell that his
fighting style's random.

272
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:58,179
But still, it has
incredible strength.

273
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:03,079
Huh?

274
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,679
ICHIGO: Hey!

275
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:32,212
Can you see anything?

276
00:17:32,246 --> 00:17:33,246
-No!

277
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,812
It's no good!

278
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,546
It's very strange.

279
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,479
When we were
falling, I could have

280
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:43,546
sworn that I saw a group
of Menos in this direction.

281
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:46,712
But I don't see
them anywhere now.

282
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:49,846
Where did the Menos go?

283
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:50,579
ICHIGO: What the--

284
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,379
-Huh?

285
00:17:51,412 --> 00:17:53,012
ICHIGO: Take a look at that.

286
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:54,046
-Just listen to them.

287
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,379
What are they fussing about now?

288
00:17:55,412 --> 00:17:55,879
ICHIGO: Renji!

289
00:17:55,912 --> 00:17:56,512
Let's go!

290
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:56,987
RENJI: All right!

291
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,553
-Uryu!

292
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:58,010
It's Hollows.

293
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:06,453
-Hm?

294
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,187
[roar]

295
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,887
-Chad!

296
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,387
Uryu!

297
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:21,887
-Get outta my way!

298
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,987
[roaring]

299
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,453
-What's this?

300
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:37,387
-I have no idea.

301
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,120
-Now they're surrounding us.

302
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,053
-Here they come!

303
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:52,553
Ichigo!

304
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:53,987
-What is it, Nel?

305
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,987
Dammit.

306
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,587
Hide yourself!

307
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,487
-You should, too!

308
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,753
Hide, Ichigo!

309
00:18:58,787 --> 00:18:59,320
-Don't go!

310
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:00,587
There's danger!

311
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,720
-Right.

312
00:19:01,753 --> 00:19:03,687
The proper course is to
leave those evildoers.

313
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,120
-But we mustn't!

314
00:19:06,153 --> 00:19:06,620
Ah!

315
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:12,420
[roar]

316
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,953
-Look at the size of them.

317
00:19:19,987 --> 00:19:21,187
They're Menos.

318
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,520
-Yes, I see.

319
00:19:22,553 --> 00:19:24,820
That certainly explains what
all that howling was about.

320
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:26,353
It's a Menos.

321
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:28,820
I should have
guessed that before.

322
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:32,753
[shaking]

323
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:33,753
-Bawabawa!

324
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,587
Please don't move
around like that.

325
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,187
My aim is-- ah!

326
00:19:42,387 --> 00:19:42,987
-Getsuga Tensho!

327
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:52,020
Are you all right?

328
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:52,720
-Yeah.

329
00:19:52,753 --> 00:19:53,720
Thanks to you.

330
00:19:59,253 --> 00:20:02,720
[roar]

331
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:10,520
-Roar, Zabimaru!

332
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,587
-They keep coming
and coming, Pesche.

333
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,453
We're going to be eaten
for sure at this race.

334
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,487
-All right.

335
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,453
Our only option is
to bravely withdraw.

336
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:26,953
-But what about Ichigo?

337
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:28,253
-Listen, Nel.

338
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,020
You just have to make yourself
believe that those Soul

339
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:31,987
Reapers are complete strangers.

340
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,653
As if we never knew
them to begin with.

341
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,853
-Well, yeah, but we
already know them.

342
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:38,720
-That's precisely why
I'm saying to stop

343
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:40,120
knowing them immediately!

344
00:20:40,153 --> 00:20:41,487
-Ah!

345
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,187
PESCHE: It may be
too late already.

346
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,587
[screaming]

347
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,553
-Nel!

348
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:52,420
[screaming]

349
00:20:52,453 --> 00:20:54,220
-Ichigo!

350
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,720
-Dammit, we've been caught.

351
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:57,853
-They're gonna eat us!

352
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:58,920
-I'm coming!

353
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,220
[roar]

354
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:02,587
[screaming]

355
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,420
NEL: Ichigo!

356
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:06,853
Why are there so many of them?

357
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:08,820
-They're the same
ones I saw earlier.

358
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:09,820
-Aw, hell.

359
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:25,787
-Is this why you brought
me all the way here?

360
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,653
Was your only
purpose to kill me?

361
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:44,987
-So, that's all you've got?

362
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,087
In that case--

363
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,587
-Ah!

364
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:00,053
Huh?

365
00:22:13,329 --> 00:22:17,796
[theme music]

366
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,493
NEL: We're going to
be eaten at this rate.

367
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:46,960
But what's the best
way to cook us?

368
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,826
DONDOCHAKKA: I'd probably
have a strong taste

369
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,526
if I were simmered
and made into a broth.

370
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,160
PESCHE: I should be
deep fried to savor

371
00:23:52,193 --> 00:23:53,326
the sweetness of my flesh.

372
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,760
NEL: Nel would taste
great as a sashimi!

373
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:59,293
ICHIGO: You sure have a
lot of time on your hands.
