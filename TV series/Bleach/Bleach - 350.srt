1
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:50,969
Ah!

2
00:01:56,842 --> 00:02:00,112
The person who
attacked Ishida,

3
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:01,413
would be me.

4
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:03,382
[gasp]

5
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,684
Ichigo!

6
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:07,519
Hnh?
What's the matter, Chad?

7
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,022
It's Orihime!
She's in danger!

8
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:11,390
[gasp]

9
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:14,593
[Shukuro]
Relax.

10
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:17,662
I have no intention of
doing anything to you yet.

11
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:26,138
I'll be heading home for today, right
after I punish this disobedient boy.

12
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,406
Gahh!

13
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:35,614
I see. It's true. You're as
kind-hearted as I heard you were.

14
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,484
You can't even bear to see
an enemy get hurt, can you?

15
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,753
That's not what I'm doing.

16
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:44,890
If you're really the
one who attacked Uryu,

17
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:47,793
Then I'm not going
to let you get away!

18
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,064
Interesting.

19
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:04,676
Who're you calling?

20
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:06,745
Who d'ya think?
Orihime!

21
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:10,982
I don't think
that's a good idea!

22
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:11,750
Huh?!

23
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,953
If your call distracts
her, even for a second,

24
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:16,421
it might leave her
open for an attack!

25
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:18,557
You think it's
that bad?!

26
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:19,624
I'm not
sure.

27
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,695
I know her spiritual
pressure is being strained!

28
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:28,800
So are we closing
in on them?

29
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:32,571
My Spiritual pressure perception
says we're on the right track.

30
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:34,906
But I'm not having any luck pinning
down their exact location.

31
00:03:35,607 --> 00:03:39,611
Okay! If you've got the direction
right, I think I know where she is.

32
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:41,847
[Ichigo]
If we keep heading this way,

33
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:44,382
We'll be right at
her apartment!

34
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,993
Hmm.

35
00:03:57,062 --> 00:04:02,901
So if I'm the one who attacked Ishida,
you won't allow me to get away, huh?

36
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:10,775
So predictable.
And quite overused.

37
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,479
That will never make
it into any book.

38
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,685
Whoa! Hey!

39
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,953
What do you think
you're doing?!

40
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:24,055
Mr. Tsukishima is
gonna kill you!

41
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:26,558
I mean it!
He's super serious!

42
00:04:26,758 --> 00:04:30,128
You won't get off with a spanking
from him or just a beating! He'll---!

43
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:31,463
Please be quiet.

44
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:35,834
I know what I'm doing,
but I'm not protecting you.

45
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,069
Sushi-gawara.

46
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:43,074
It's Shishi-gawara.

47
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:50,582
I have to focus. There's no telling
what his next move will be.

48
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:53,151
He's already
drawn his sword.

49
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,821
So maybe I should
use Santenkesshun.

50
00:04:57,856 --> 00:05:00,625
But that might appear like
I'm provoking him to attack.

51
00:05:01,393 --> 00:05:04,763
At this point, is there some
other way I can stop him?

52
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:18,677
Hey stop!
Santenkesshun!

53
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:20,845
[gasp]

54
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:34,693
What's her
apartment number?

55
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,695
It's four-oh-three!
This way!

56
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,542
[Ichigo]
Orihime!

57
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:52,577
What happened?!
Are you okay?!

58
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:58,016
[Ichigo]
Orihime!

59
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:00,652
[stunned breath]

60
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:06,124
I'm not cut or bleeding!?

61
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,765
That can't be!

62
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,535
I definitely felt that blade
cutting deep into my body!

63
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,807
[Ichigo]
Orihime!

64
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,009
Wha!?

65
00:06:24,943 --> 00:06:27,545
Ichigo?!
And Chad too?

66
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:29,681
Why are you guys here?

67
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,082
Uh, we were worried!

68
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,820
Chad thought, there was something
wrong with your Spiritual Pressure.

69
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:37,889
Yeah. You okay?

70
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:40,825
There was a dip in your
Spiritual Pressure.

71
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,461
Can you tell us exactly
what happened to you?

72
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,498
Me?! Nothing much really.

73
00:06:47,465 --> 00:06:50,669
[chuckle] Just school
and some homework.

74
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:55,006
I did have this tummy ache. That's why
I was bent over. That must've been it.

75
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,641
That couldn't
have been it.

76
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,978
There was another Spiritual
Pressure here until a minute ago.

77
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:01,613
Whose was it?

78
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:04,749
Oh you're right.
My friend was here.

79
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:07,519
I forgot, I met this
friend of mine here.

80
00:07:09,954 --> 00:07:11,022
"A friend"?

81
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,995
That's right.
Tsukishima.

82
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:25,537
After my friend left, my stomach began
aching for some reason. That's all it was.

83
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:27,939
Wait a minute.

84
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,145
Why am I calling him my friend?

85
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,917
Sorry If I had
you two worried!

86
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:43,855
That can't be. He said he's
the one who attacked Uryu.

87
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:51,663
Well, I'll be sure to tell
you if anything happens!

88
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,467
And you guys be sure to let me know
if anything happens to you, okay?

89
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,435
Uh... Sure.

90
00:08:00,372 --> 00:08:01,406
[chuckle]

91
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:05,510
I can't let Ichigo
know the truth!

92
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:08,913
[Ichigo]
Well then, we'll see ya later.

93
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:10,982
[Orihime]
Okay! See you tomorrow!

94
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,951
[chuckle]

95
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,956
That was strange.

96
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,393
For a moment there,
I thought he was my friend.

97
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,028
Why did I think that?

98
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:26,064
What was it in me,
that he cut?

99
00:08:35,673 --> 00:08:38,410
So, what do you
think of her story?

100
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:40,378
Well.

101
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,418
I'm not sure.

102
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:51,556
Orihime has no idea that Ichigo's
getting his powers back.

103
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:55,794
She probably worried about
him getting dragged into a fight because of her.

104
00:08:56,361 --> 00:09:00,398
One thing's for sure, she doesn't want
Ichigo to know the danger she's in.

105
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:09,040
She said there was nothing wrong, so I
guess we should believe her, right?

106
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:12,811
[Chad] I do agree with her that

107
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,713
having Ichigo get into a fight
in his present condition,

108
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,382
would be way
too risky.

109
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,420
I need to get in touch
with her again later.

110
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:27,725
I must've just perceived her
Spiritual Pressure wrong.

111
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:29,861
Sorry about that.

112
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,434
Sure, no worries.

113
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:51,049
Another.

114
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:52,083
Not for you.

115
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,551
Mmm?

116
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,453
And why the hell not?

117
00:09:56,621 --> 00:10:00,024
You've had enough.
Please control yourself.

118
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,359
Just what're you saying?

119
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,531
I realize you're happy that things are
going well with Mr. Ichigo, but...

120
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,968
What? It's not like that. C'mon.

121
00:10:10,535 --> 00:10:11,402
Huh?

122
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:15,507
Hey Riruka!
Come on wake up!

123
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,908
Why don't you go
home already?!

124
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:21,679
Hey!Don'tignore
me,damnit!

125
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:24,716
Psh.

126
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:27,886
Mh.

127
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:33,458
Oh I forgot! Hey this thing's empty!
One more! C'mon buddy!

128
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:35,760
You are done.

129
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:39,831
I am not done! What's one more?
I'm still thirsty here!

130
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:41,132
[Giriko]
You are beyond thirsty.

131
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,668
[Kugo]
YOU'RE beyond thirsty!

132
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:47,539
Oh come on. I am sotally tober!
One more won't kill me!

133
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:48,540
[Giriko]
That's enough.

134
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,776
Kugo. the phone.
It's your line.

135
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,411
Hmm?

136
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:01,686
Who is this?

137
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:07,759
Hm?! All right.
I'll open up now.

138
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,443
Chad and Orihime aren't
telling me anything,

139
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,046
but something
definitely happened.

140
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,421
It was probably the same
guy who attacked Uryu.

141
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,125
Kugo. You think it's?

142
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,563
Tsukishima.
It's most likely him.

143
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,665
So then you do
know this guy?

144
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:54,005
Tsukishima is a
Fullbringer, just like us.

145
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:56,741
You see...

146
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:00,945
He used to be one
of our members.

147
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:02,113
[gasp]

148
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:12,784
[doorbell]

149
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:14,119
[Ikumi]
I'm coming!

150
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:18,290
Who's there?
It's late ya know.

151
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:19,090
Gaagh!

152
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:20,225
Hunh?

153
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,128
Damn that hurt!

154
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:26,231
I've warned you before that your
door opens towards the stairs!

155
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:28,266
Open it slowly or
you'll kill someone!

156
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,800
How many times do--

157
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:29,701
Ichigo!

158
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:31,770
Where have you
been for so long?!

159
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:34,439
Were you taking time off
again without calling me!?

160
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:36,241
Hrmf.

161
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:38,543
Come on in!

162
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:40,645
I'll hear your
excuse over tea!

163
00:12:42,547 --> 00:12:44,282
No thanks.
Don't want any.

164
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:45,483
Huh?

165
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:47,585
But why not?

166
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:51,356
[Ikumi]
Say what?!

167
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:55,293
You want more time off?!
Have you lost your mind?!

168
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:58,096
Come on! You've already taken
all this time off already!

169
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:02,067
So just how much work are you
thinking of skipping out on?!

170
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:05,503
Are you even listening?!

171
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:06,471
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:06,504 --> 00:13:07,439
Hnh?

173
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:11,109
But, I thought
you should know.

174
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:12,677
Wait! We're not
done here yet!

175
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:13,645
Hold on!

176
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:19,517
Listen to me. I don't know
what's going on with you,

177
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:22,153
But stop worrying
about me, okay?

178
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:23,321
Huh?

179
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:25,123
I'm not one of
your classmates!

180
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:27,392
I'm an adult!
I'm all grown up.

181
00:13:28,193 --> 00:13:30,595
So I'm old enough to
take care of myself.

182
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:33,298
There's no need for a kid
like you to feel worried.

183
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:37,035
So if something's bothering you,
just spit it out and tell me!

184
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:42,107
Ya got that? Know if you need
to talk I'm here for you.

185
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,248
[Ichigo]
Thank you, Ms. Ikumi.

186
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:13,738
Tsukishima,

187
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,709
was the original
founder of our group.

188
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:22,614
We all came together
under a common goal:

189
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:26,217
To discard our Fullbring powers
and become normal humans.

190
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:32,090
Tsukishima was the one who discovered a way to
transfer our powers to a Substitute Soul Reaper.

191
00:14:32,357 --> 00:14:34,426
Naturally, he
became our leader.

192
00:14:35,393 --> 00:14:36,494
Things were going well.

193
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:41,533
After years of searching, we finally
found a Substitute Soul Reaper

194
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:46,171
who agreed to absorb the powers of
several of our members. But then,

195
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:49,140
Tsukishima suddenly
had a change of heart.

196
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:57,715
He killed the Substitute
Soul Reaper and every on ewho

197
00:14:57,715 --> 00:14:59,384
had given him their powers.

198
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:02,754
After that, he disappeared
without a trace.

199
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,660
It seemed,

200
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:10,295
He'd gone mad.

201
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:13,765
But perhaps he'd been planning
his murderous exit all along.

202
00:15:16,134 --> 00:15:17,769
I need to show you something.

203
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:19,103
Hm?

204
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:28,246
[gasp]

205
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:33,251
This was that Substitute
Soul Reaper's Combat Pass.

206
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:37,489
I don't know what Tsukishima's
real intentions are.

207
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:40,625
He's always been quite good at
keeping his thoughts to himself.

208
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:44,629
And like I said, we haven't
seen him since that incident.

209
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:50,268
But for right now, I'm betting
there's one thing we can count on.

210
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:54,305
Based on the past, Tsukishima
will do anything to keep

211
00:15:54,305 --> 00:15:57,408
us from succeeding with another
Substitute Soul Reaper.

212
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:58,243
[gasp]

213
00:15:59,744 --> 00:16:02,580
All of his latest actions
support this theory.

214
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:09,354
He attacked Uryu Ishida, Then
made contact with Orihime Inoue.

215
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:12,156
He knows what he's doing.

216
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,695
He's managed to get your attention now,
by threatening your friends and family.

217
00:16:18,463 --> 00:16:20,665
[beginning to seethe]

218
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:23,801
Ginjo.

219
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:26,271
I have to do something.

220
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:32,210
Stay calm,
we can't rush in.

221
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,382
We know he's definitely making some
serious moves. So we'll speed things up.

222
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:40,752
Your next training session
will happen very soon.

223
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:43,187
We'll contact you
when we're ready.

224
00:16:45,723 --> 00:16:48,426
So go home for now,
try to get some rest.

225
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:05,209
Huh?

226
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,114
Dad?

227
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:12,517
Hm?!

228
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:20,525
[Kisuke]
Something wrong?

229
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:31,502
No. it's nothing.

230
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:35,340
But let's go.

231
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:37,775
Go somewhere else?

232
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,511
Yeah, just in case.

233
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:43,414
Hm.

234
00:17:47,118 --> 00:17:50,054
I gotcha.
Let's do that.

235
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:01,265
[Ichigo]
Wait.

236
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:08,506
[Ichigo] So many things happened all at
once, that I had forgotten what he said.

237
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,643
Just how much do you
know about your buddy?

238
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:14,712
What makes you think
you understand Urahara?

239
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:18,449
Should I go after him
right now and ask him?

240
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:24,155
No, now's not good. What if
Kisuke really is my enemy?

241
00:18:25,123 --> 00:18:27,392
I don't have enough power
to do anything against him.

242
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:31,229
I gotta get my powers back
as soon as possible!

243
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:43,808
[Orihime]
Whoaaa!

244
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:46,210
[clattering]

245
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:48,646
Eeyah... he he he he...

246
00:18:50,114 --> 00:18:51,282
What was that noise?

247
00:18:51,683 --> 00:18:52,550
Oh...

248
00:18:53,284 --> 00:18:55,687
It's nothing, really.
I'm fine.

249
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,789
I just dropped some dishes.

250
00:19:00,124 --> 00:19:01,059
I see.

251
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:04,529
Anyway, that's what happened?

252
00:19:06,297 --> 00:19:07,231
Uh-huh.

253
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:15,807
I'm sure I got cut.
But then when I came to,

254
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:19,310
There wasn't any blood
or any kind of wound.

255
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:23,247
And both of the guys who were
there with me had disappeared.

256
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:30,054
And when I saw that both you and Ichigo
had showed up to see if I was okay,

257
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:33,691
I don't know why,
but for a second there,

258
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,361
I thought of that
person as a "friend".

259
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:41,532
Hm? What do you
mean by that?

260
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:46,170
Sorry. I don't understand what
I'm trying to say either.

261
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:50,608
But I was overcome with this feeling
that this stranger was my friend.

262
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:56,514
It's not like I mistook him for someone
else, I mean after all, he attacked me.

263
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:58,649
But how should I put it?

264
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,120
It felt like when I
thought about the past,

265
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:07,425
It suddenly seemed like I knew
who he was, it was weird.

266
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,762
Be careful, Chad.

267
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:16,100
I have a feeling his powers are
more terrifying than they seem.

268
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:18,770
Thanks. I will.

269
00:20:20,438 --> 00:20:22,507
You said there were
two guys there, right?

270
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:24,208
Huh? Right.

271
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:27,211
Do you remember their names?
Either one of them?

272
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:32,450
Yeah, I think it was
Tsukishima, and Sushigawara.

273
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:33,684
Aahh-choo!

274
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:37,688
O-oh...

275
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:43,494
May I continue with our
topic, Shishigawara?

276
00:20:44,095 --> 00:20:46,364
Uhh yes, sir!

277
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:48,232
Good.

278
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,637
As far as this matter is concerned, you
do not need to do anything further.

279
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:56,808
But sir! As your apprentice, don't you
feel that I should be taking every--?

280
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,244
Will you please stop calling
yourself my apprentice?

281
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,113
Oh! Sorry sir!

282
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:05,249
But as your super
loyal apprentice!

283
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:07,785
I don't think it's proper for
someone who should be helping,

284
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:11,088
to just watch quietly as
you do all the work, sir.

285
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:12,657
[frustrated]

286
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:18,462
By "this matter," I specifically
meant Orihime Inoue.

287
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:21,432
Huh?
Oh.

288
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:24,769
I've left a mark on her.

289
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:30,074
No further contact will
be necessary. Understood?

290
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:34,579
Uh! Right.

291
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:37,348
Hm.

292
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:41,219
Now, who should
I go after next?

293
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,398
Yasutora Sado?

294
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:57,802
Or Ichigo Kurosaki?

295
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:04,675
Think I'll go after
Ichigo immediately.

296
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,646
I wonder what Ginjo
will think of that.

297
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:49,649
[Orihime] So Chad, about
that Sushigawara.

298
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:51,785
[Chad] Yes, tell me about
this Sushi-gawara guy...

299
00:23:52,152 --> 00:23:54,120
[stomach growl]

300
00:23:54,154 --> 00:23:57,624
[Orihime] Sorry! Talking about Sushigawara
has got me wanting to go eat some sushi.

301
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,426
[stomach growl]

302
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:00,627
[Chad]
Yeah, me too!

303
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,594
[Moeh]
[Sneeze]
