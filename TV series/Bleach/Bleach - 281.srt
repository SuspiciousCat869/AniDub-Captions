1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,833
Welcome to my castle, Los
Noches.

2
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:11,866
[roaring]

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,300
Shatter...
Kyokasuigetsu!

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,500
I am the emperor...
Barragan Ruizenban!

5
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:16,648
Now then...

6
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:19,781
The preparations for our
invasion are finally
complete.

7
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:23,148
We will now mobilize our
forces into the World of
the Living.

8
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:30,015
I will wipe out Karakura
Town, create the Ouken,
and bring down the Soul
Society.

9
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:35,748
The door to a new world
will be opened.

10
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:43,315
Stark. Barragan.
Halibel. I'm counting
on you to pull off this
attack.

11
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:48,548
Everything is in place,
and we're ready to begin
on your command. We shall
not fail you, Lord Aizen.

12
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:51,015
Whatever you say, sir.

13
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:06,888
Hm?

14
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:15,555
You... bastards!

15
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:18,822
Jakuho Raikouben!

16
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:21,855
[growling]

17
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:24,355
See ya.

18
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:32,155
[screaming]

19
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,922
Oh, dear...

20
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,488
It looks like another one
of your friends has gone
down in flames.

21
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:58,988
[panting]

22
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:02,062
Captain Soi Fon!

23
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:14,062
Man.. That was close,
Captain? Are you all
right?

24
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:18,028
I've felt better, but...
at least I'm still
alive.

25
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:32,595
There's a large crack in
the Shiju Saimon barrier...
... made by the Jakuho
Raikoben.

26
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:37,195
I've never seen such a
thing---Its power is
incredible.

27
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,561
Are you two all right
down there?

28
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:44,295
What kind of a question
is that, fatso?! Of course
not! She could've died!

29
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:49,762
Under normal
circumstances, I can only
use the Jakuho Raikoben
once every three days.

30
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:52,595
Now I've used it twice in
one day.

31
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:56,462
Just so we're clear, I
expect to be compensated
for this.

32
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,028
Oh yes, of course.

33
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:00,195
I'll pay you back,
as promised.

34
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:04,902
I'll trap Kiskuke Urahara in
my strongest barrier for a
full month. Huh?!

35
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:16,368
The barrier's crumbling!

36
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:17,635
Impossible!

37
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:28,935
[gasping]

38
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:32,335
[gasping]

39
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:43,068
Unforgivable!

40
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:46,402
What?! Is
this for real?

41
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:50,635
[gasping]

42
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:52,602
Unforgivable!

43
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:54,968
This can't be!

44
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:58,102
You will pay for this!

45
00:05:58,202 --> 00:06:03,942
Oh, damn it! How can he
still be alive after
getting hit by my Jakuho
Raikoben?!

46
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:05,842
Is he invincible?!

47
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:14,175
I'm going to kill you
all! And I'm going to do
it with my own hands!

48
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:21,608
I am the king of Hueco
Mundo! I am a god! I can
never die!

49
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:24,175
[grunting]

50
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:40,808
You will regret your
insolence toward me!

51
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:43,975
I will turn you
all to dust!

52
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:53,942
I don't understand what's
driving him so hard to
defeat us! Do you think
it's his loyalty to Aizen?

53
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:05,482
You don't really think
that will save you from
my wrath, do you?!

54
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:11,148
There is no escape from
me!

55
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,848
I will disintegrate your
bones!

56
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:20,648
You think mimicking a
Hollow will protect you?!
Know your place!

57
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:30,348
I am the emperor...
...Barragan Ruizenban!

58
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:38,282
I am the god of Hueco
Mundo!

59
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:44,315
Watch yourself, Hachigen!

60
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:47,715
[laughing]

61
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:52,615
Puny beings! You pale in
comparison to my powers!

62
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,848
Your petty concerns are
of little importance!

63
00:07:56,948 --> 00:08:01,215
Soul Reapers, humans,
Hollows, Arrancars...

64
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:08,455
as well as free will,
animals, plants, the sun,
the moon, and the stars...
In reality, they

65
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,222
mean nothing.

66
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:19,222
As you are about to
discover, the only thing
that is absolute in this
world is my power!

67
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:23,455
Other than that,
everything else is a
trifling matter!

68
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:33,288
The fact is, I am
supremely powerful. And
as such, the world should
be under my control.

69
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:42,555
There can be no equality
between opposing powers.
Your lives hold no real
value. To me, you are no

70
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,222
To me, you are no
more than ants.

71
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:50,788
[laughing]

72
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:57,622
I commend you! I'm
surprised that an ant
like you has even been
able to injure me!

73
00:08:57,722 --> 00:09:01,088
I imagine you will feel
quite proud of yourself
in hell!

74
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:03,028
[laughing]

75
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:12,195
What? What's happening
here?

76
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:15,095
<i>You're the one who gave</i>
<i>me the idea.</i>

77
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:19,095
That is your own power,
the only thing that is
absolute in this world.

78
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:20,995
Hmm?

79
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:25,762
Something about all this
seemed strange to me. As
we've witnessed,
everything your power

80
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:32,395
touches, grows old, rots,
and crumbles to dust. But
that doesn't explain why
it prevents you from

81
00:09:32,495 --> 00:09:34,462
turning into dust as
well.

82
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:37,228
That paradox led me to
come up with a theory.

83
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:42,495
If you weren't suffering
the effects of exposure
to this power, it stood
to reason that you must

84
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:46,228
have surrounded your body
with something that could
hold it at bay.

85
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:51,328
I had to breach that
barrier, so I forced your
power back inside of you,
to a place where that

86
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:53,662
protection would normally
never reach.

87
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:58,428
That is impossible! How
could you do that without
my being aware of it!

88
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:06,335
You bastard! What have
you done with your right
arm?!

89
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:08,068
What game are you
playing?!

90
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:10,535
It's no game---My arm's
inside you!

91
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:25,502
He severed his own arm
with a barrier, and
transported the rotting
flesh inside Barragan!

92
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:29,102
How did he come up
with that?! That
man's a genius!

93
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:34,168
If your power is
absolute, as you say,
then it only makes sense
that you, yourself,

94
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:36,935
should not be able to
withstand that power.

95
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:41,902
I had no proof of this
when I took the chance to
infect you. But now that
I see the results,

96
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:44,002
I'm glad I made the right
call.

97
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:52,635
Curse you, you ant! How
dare you defy a god in
this way?!

98
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:56,002
Your insolence will
doom you to destruction!

99
00:10:56,268 --> 00:11:01,202
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
the word 'god' is not
very familiar to those of
us who are inhabitants of

100
00:11:01,302 --> 00:11:02,875
the Soul Society.

101
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:08,308
As a result, we
apologize---We are not
able to understand the
implications of your words.

102
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:14,208
We must ask you to
forgive our lack of
faith, god of Hueco
Mundo. Now, farewell.

103
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:17,808
[screaming]

104
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:21,275
Wow! Amazing!

105
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,442
He pulled it off! He
actually defeated that
guy!

106
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:36,542
[groaning]

107
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:40,108
I'm amazed you're still
able to move!

108
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:46,108
I will not die! I refuse
to die.

109
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:54,475
I have sworn revenge! I
promised I would kill you
for your disrespect, and
I will! You will pay for

110
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:59,275
your arrogance! And I'll
exact that penalty with
my own hands!

111
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:07,915
I am a king! I am a god!
I shall not die... unless
I take you with me!

112
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:09,348
Hachigen, look out!

113
00:12:09,448 --> 00:12:13,248
We will die together!!

114
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,010
[bell ringing]

115
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:32,944
[sighing]

116
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,765
I have had enough.

117
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:55,831
How boring. Nothing is
more meaningless than a
trained army without a
single enemy to conquer.

118
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:57,531
Am I wrong?

119
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:09,138
Not sure why I bother to
ask. No one here is going
to disagree with me.

120
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:12,605
[roaring]

121
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:16,371
What happened?!

122
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:18,938
Gagamel's been killed!

123
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:29,505
Identify yourselves!

124
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:32,071
[growling]

125
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:40,271
Stand down.

126
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:47,271
This is just the thing I
need to pass the time.
Why have you come here,
strangers?

127
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:54,038
Very pleased to meet you.
My name is Aizen...

128
00:13:54,638 --> 00:13:59,671
...I'm Sosuke Aizen.
You must be Barragan,
king of Hueco Mundo.

129
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:06,245
Indeed. And what exactly
are you? Since none of
you are wearing masks,

130
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,845
<i>I have to presume</i>
<i>you are not Hollows.</i>

131
00:14:08,945 --> 00:14:13,078
<i>Are you humans? Or are</i>
<i>you Soul Reapers?</i>

132
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:20,278
Well, it doesn't matter
what you are. Truthfully,
I am growing weary.

133
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:25,511
If you had not shown up,
I would have had to
improvise some
entertainment. I would

134
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:29,145
have split my army into
two, and forced them to
kill each other.

135
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:37,145
Be that as it may, I
suppose I should greet
you. Welcome to my
castle, Los Noches.

136
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:38,811
Heh.

137
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:43,478
How amusing. This place,
with no roof or walls, is
a castle?

138
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:51,845
I have no need for a
roof. as king, that all
of Hueco Mundo's skies
form the roof of my castle.

139
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:55,978
I see---Well, I suppose
that would be one way of
looking at it.

140
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,311
That's quite enough,
Kaname. There's no
point in baiting him.

141
00:15:01,545 --> 00:15:02,778
Right.

142
00:15:02,878 --> 00:15:06,585
Your majesty, I was
hoping we might have a...
...little chat.

143
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:09,385
Could you take a look at
my sword...?

144
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:12,285
It's called...
Kyokasuigetsu.

145
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:19,285
And why should I care?

146
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:23,751
I wish to ask you a
simple question.

147
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:25,918
<i>What is it?</i>

148
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:30,551
Tell me... Are you
satisfied with your
existence as it stands
in this moment?

149
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:32,451
What?

150
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:37,318
Have you ever looked
around and felt your
world was not the way it
should be? Do you ever

151
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:40,751
find yourself wishing you
could achieve a higher
greatness?

152
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:42,551
Hmm...

153
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:48,018
I can help you. You just
have to obey me.

154
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:52,918
If you were to do so,
I could give you even
greater power.

155
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,985
<i>Greater power, you say?</i>

156
00:15:56,085 --> 00:16:01,585
That's right. My research
will soon be complete.
I'm perfecting a way to
turn Soul Reapers into

157
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:04,758
Hollows, and Hollows into
Soul Reapers.

158
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:11,758
By removing the
boundaries between these
two opposing states of
being, you could achieve

159
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:13,891
higher greatness.

160
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:18,491
You could truly lead the
way to stepping forth
into a new world.

161
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:29,525
[laughing]

162
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:36,225
What an amusing proposal!
You actually have the
nerve to suggest I can
achieve greater power and

163
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:38,691
discover a new world?

164
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:45,491
Don't make me laugh! I am
the king of Hueco Mundo,
the king of all I survey!
No one can surpass my

165
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:53,758
power, least of all you
foolish mortals! No world
exists, other than the
one I already control!

166
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:55,858
How unfortunate...

167
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,558
Attack them now, my
minions! Crush these
arrogant ants!

168
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:09,231
What an unfriendly bunch.

169
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:10,431
[roaring]

170
00:17:13,998 --> 00:17:16,598
I shall take you on
myself.

171
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:22,665
You are about to be
killed by the king of
Hueco Mundo. Consider it
an honor.

172
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:27,198
It seems awfully
ironic... for the
king of Hueco Mundo.

173
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:33,531
Think about it, my
friend. Even though
you're a Hollow, the way
you wield your weapon,

174
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:35,931
and your giant black
form...

175
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:39,131
...remind me very much of
a Soul Reaper.

176
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:40,598
Silence!

177
00:17:55,665 --> 00:18:02,331
Hmpf! What a fool! In the
end, you weren't even
able to put up a proper
fight.

178
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:06,971
How pathetic. It was
hardly worth my effort.

179
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:14,771
What is this?

180
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:21,071
You! How can you still be
alive?!

181
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:26,771
My Zanpakuto,
Kyokasuigetsu, has the
power of complete
hypnosis.

182
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:29,405
What are you talking
about?

183
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:34,305
In other words, the
people you defeated
before, were nothing more
than illusions.

184
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:38,771
Shatter... Kyokasuigetsu!

185
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:50,205
What is happening?!

186
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:54,405
This is your world...
stripped of all mirage.

187
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:56,971
You bastard!

188
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:03,705
Don't do anything rash.
It's pointless. You won't
be able to kill me.

189
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:16,111
Yes. On that day, I made
a vow...

190
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:25,011
A vow that I would take
my revenge on you...

191
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:33,011
That I would take back my
throne, no matter what
the cost.

192
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:40,245
That day is here! We will
die together!

193
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:49,578
I have been waiting for
this opportunity for a
long time, Sosuke
Aizen...!

194
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:56,278
The moment of retribution
is finally at hand. you
will regret ever giving
me power.

195
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:59,211
That power is
your undoing!

196
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:08,518
I am a king, a god! I
will never die! I will
hunt you forever, Sosuke
Aizen!

197
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:35,985
Farewell, King of Hueco
Mundo. In the end, it
turned out you shared the
same concerns as most mortals.

198
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:39,885
...A desire to avoid
aging, coupled with a
great fear of death.

199
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:03,918
My goodness, it appears
the Soul Reapers have
actually defeated him---

200
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:07,991
You should pay attention,
or those may be your last
words.

201
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:12,491
There's always time to
die. Why are you in such
a hurry? I'm not going
anywhere.

202
00:21:12,591 --> 00:21:16,958
I can't waste a lot of
time dealing with
underlings. Once I've
taken care of you, I'm

203
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:19,591
gonna go kill that
bastard, Sosuke.

204
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:21,658
One thing at a time, my
friend.

205
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,625
[grunting]

206
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:44,058
Our Number Two just
died... and he doesn't
give a damn.

207
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,425
Shameful.

208
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:48,558
<i>What's wrong?</i>

209
00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:51,058
Don't talk to me,
Lilinette.

210
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:54,858
<i>Are you crying? Ow!</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

211
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:03,691
<i>Are you okay, Stark?</i>

212
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:08,031
Revenge isn't my thing,
but I'll make an exception.

213
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:49,129
Gin, you and I are both
from the same region---We
should get to know each
other better!

214
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:52,662
<i>I doubt you know anything</i>
<i>about where I'm from.</i>
<i>We're not even in the</i>
<i>same league.</i>

215
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:53,829
That's kind of
closed-minded.

216
00:23:54,995 --> 00:23:55,862
<i>You're obviously coarse</i>
<i>and lack elegance.</i>

217
00:23:56,995 --> 00:24:00,029
That's it! I swear on my
homeland, I'm taking you
down!
