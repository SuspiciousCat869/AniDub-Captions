1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,666
Zangetsu!
It is you right?

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,433
Wrong Ichigo, my name is--

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,100
What in the hell, is going on?!

4
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:15,922
<i>[Isshin]</i>
<i>Wait Ichigo, stop!</i>

5
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:19,422
What?! Aren't we
in a hurry here?!

6
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:22,822
Something's wrong.
There's no sign of
the Cleaner.

7
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:24,455
"The Cleaner"?!

8
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:27,255
Y'mean that Spirit
Energy train-like thing?

9
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:32,422
Yeah. Usually a Soul Reaper
can't do anything at all
about the Cleaner.

10
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:37,189
But from the traces of
Spiritual Pressure,
I'd say Aizen did something.

11
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,622
[deep monstrous breath]

12
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:51,222
<i>What are you so</i>
<i>afraid of, Gin?</i>

13
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:58,122
Reason exists primarily for
those who count on it to
survive.

14
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:01,255
<i>Well, Shall we go?</i>

15
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,689
Towards the end
of all reason.

16
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,322
So is it bad if the
Cleaner's not here?

17
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,555
If we leave things like
this, it's not good.

18
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:14,489
But right now, it's good for us.

19
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:20,089
<i>As its name suggests,</i>
<i>the Precipice World</i>
<i>is on the edge.</i>

20
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:25,189
<i>It's a place isolated</i>
<i>temporally and spatially</i>
<i>from both the World of the</i>
<i>Living and the Soul Society.</i>

21
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:29,655
<i>The Cleaner existed to</i>
<i>limit those who've entered</i>
<i>from staying here too long.</i>

22
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,022
But right now it's not here.

23
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:37,322
<i>So I'll be able to teach</i>
<i>you in this place.</i>

24
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:40,722
To teach me?
Teach me what?

25
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:46,622
You must learn the
Final Getsugatensho!

26
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:51,189
The Final...
Getsugatensho?!

27
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:08,722
What happened?
Why was I just
lying here?

28
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:33,722
The Final Getsugatensho!?

29
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:36,589
That's right.

30
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:40,055
And you want to teach
it to me in this place?
Why do it here?

31
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:45,889
<i>The Precipice World is</i>
<i>a disconnected space.</i>

32
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:49,289
<i>And it is surrounded</i>
<i>by multiple layers of</i>
<i>temporal torrent.</i>

33
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:52,955
Oh- kay?
I gotcha!

34
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,655
You don't have to know
what that means, ichigo.

35
00:04:56,255 --> 00:05:02,055
To put it simply, the
density of time in here is
overwhelmingly higher than
the density of time outside.

36
00:05:02,489 --> 00:05:04,689
The difference is unbelievable.

37
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:09,355
In the time one year passes
in our world, 2000 years
will pass by in here.

38
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:10,522
What?!

39
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:16,689
Besides being the pathway to
the World of the Living, this
Precipice World is also used
as a place to exile criminals.

40
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:20,789
<i>That's the reason why</i>
<i>the Restrictive Current</i>
<i>and Cleaner exist.</i>

41
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:26,022
<i>If the Restrictive Current</i>
<i>snares you, escape from it</i>
<i>is impossible and death is</i>
<i>imminent.</i>

42
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,422
If the Cleaner comes
in contact with you,

43
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:35,289
<i>you'll be hurled from</i>
<i>the present and</i>
<i>completely thrown off of</i>
<i>your original time axis.</i>

44
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:41,255
<i>That's the reason why there</i>
<i>was a difference of several</i>
<i>days from when you first</i>
<i>entered the Soul Society.</i>

45
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:43,589
<i>It was the result of the</i>
<i>Cleaner pursuing you.</i>

46
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:48,555
You were lucky Kisuke had the
technical skills to skew things.

47
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:51,789
Thanks to him, you arrived with
a shift of only a few days.

48
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:56,722
Ordinarily, you would've
been flung centuries off
course and the rapid flow of
time would've killed you.

49
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,889
But right now,
since the Cleaner
is not here,

50
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:07,322
It's the perfect
opportunity to gain time.

51
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:13,155
Since time here in the
Precipice World is 2000 times
denser than it is in our world,

52
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:18,122
<i>if you trained for 2000</i>
<i>hours here, only one hour</i>
<i>will have gone by outside.</i>

53
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:23,789
There is no way of sealing off
the Cleaner in the Soul Society,
but there is a way to stop the
Restrictive Current.

54
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:36,022
We call this process
"Realm Fixation".

55
00:06:36,222 --> 00:06:39,655
Usually It's accomplished
by having a group of
low-ranking Soul Reapers

56
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,889
<i>pool together their Spirit</i>
<i>Energy to fixate the</i>
<i>Restrictive Current.</i>

57
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,289
But I can fixate
it by myself.

58
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:50,555
I will hold down the
Restrictive Current until my
Spirit Energy is used up.

59
00:06:50,922 --> 00:06:54,722
By my estimate, that's
enough to give you about
2000 hours in here.

60
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:57,922
So that'll give you just a
little short of 3 months.

61
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:01,155
Use that time to get an answer.

62
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:02,789
Answer?

63
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:03,922
That's right.

64
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:10,322
Find out what works.
Get your sword Zangetsu
to tell you what the Final
Getsugatensho is for you!

65
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:28,655
C'mon! What is going on here?!?
Is this some kinda joke?

66
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:34,922
Everyone on the streets is
asleep! And none of the traffic
lights or cars are working!

67
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,855
This is so weird!
This isn't a dream!

68
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:41,289
And it isn't a movie, either.
It looks like the world's
come to an end!

69
00:07:41,622 --> 00:07:45,155
Hey!-Isn't anybody anywhere
awake?! Mizuiro! Ichigo! Sis!

70
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:48,289
C'mon!-Anybody!! Somebody talk
to me-tell me what's going on!!

71
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:50,989
Am I the last guy awake
on the whole planet??!
Give me a sign!!

72
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:52,289
Hg'owww!

73
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:58,122
Ow! What's the big-- Huh!??

74
00:07:58,822 --> 00:07:59,822
<i>Tatsuki??</i>

75
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:07,062
Oh how great! I'm so
thankful to see someone,
even though it's you!

76
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:09,096
I mean, did you take
a look around?

77
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,462
Everyone in the town
is sound asleep!

78
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:16,129
I was totally freaking
out-thinking maybe I was
the only human still
awake in the whole world!

79
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,729
I mean, no
one's awake.

80
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:22,096
At first it felt to me like
a bad sci-fi flick but now
it feels so creepy and real.

81
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,862
The first two minutes I thought
I might snap and lose it, but
now I've pulled it together.

82
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:31,762
But boy I sure am glad you're
alive! But it's not like I was
worried about you or anything!

83
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,829
In fact, I'd rather you
be worried about me!

84
00:08:35,162 --> 00:08:37,062
By the way, have
you seen Mizuiro?

85
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:39,662
'Cause I haven't! So tell me
why'd you punch me in the--

86
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:40,496
Mmmph!

87
00:08:43,262 --> 00:08:44,429
Shut up!

88
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:46,362
<i>Right... Sorry about that.</i>

89
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,129
Why did you
dodge my punch!?

90
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:01,729
Are you crazy?!
If I don't dodge,
I get hurt!

91
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:05,862
The fact that you dodged my
punch means you're not placing
your inner soul into your sword!

92
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:07,129
Now concentrate!

93
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:10,396
Don't you know how
to communicate with
your own Zanpakuto?!

94
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:12,496
I get it, ok?

95
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:16,396
But outside of an actual fight,
I've never turned to Old Man
Zangetsu like this.

96
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:19,096
Place your sword on
your lap and meditate!

97
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:22,362
Concentrate only
on your sword!
Just do it!

98
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,762
All right I'm doing it!

99
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:49,296
That form is
called Jinzen.

100
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:56,862
It is a form for
carrying on a dialogue
with one's Zanpakuto

101
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:01,129
that was created over thousands
of years since the very
beginning of the Soul Society.

102
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:07,362
Until now Ichigo, all your
techniques were acquired
without utilizing deep thought.

103
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:10,062
<i>You operated strictly</i>
<i>through brute force.</i>

104
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:16,196
Not this time. Now in order
for you to progress even
further with your training,

105
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:21,329
you must take yourself into
realms of deep meditation
that you've never thought
to venture into before!

106
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:27,696
Go, Ichigo!

107
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:35,229
[Keigo]
I'm really sorry.

108
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:39,996
How can I explain?
I woke up alone, and
found everyone asleep!

109
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:44,529
It was so quiet, it was almost
like a tomb, and I was so
confused and alone!

110
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,562
so I got all
hyper-nervous, y'know?

111
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:48,496
Stop with your
whiny explaining!

112
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:51,962
I've heard enough!...
C'mon-Let's go!

113
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,762
Well seriously, I'm sorry.

114
00:10:54,796 --> 00:10:55,929
Huh??

115
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:57,896
Whoa!
Chizuru!
Michiru!

116
00:10:58,162 --> 00:11:03,396
I want to move them. But
I don't think I can carry
both of them. Could you
carry Chizuru to school?

117
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,429
Yeah, sure!

118
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:06,162
Up ya go!

119
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:09,329
And don't touch
her butt!

120
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:10,596
I wouldn't do that!

121
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:14,329
Hey, Tatsuki.

122
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:15,496
[sigh] What now?

123
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:18,762
Chizuru actually
has big boobs.

124
00:11:18,796 --> 00:11:19,629
Hngh!

125
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:27,462
From what I've seen just
from walking around so far,
here's what I figured out.

126
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,696
I went to the edge of town
to see what was going on,
and it was gone.

127
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:35,762
Like it had been cut off.
There were only the
mountains past that.

128
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:43,962
I know this is hard to believe,
but it's like the entire
town has been moved.

129
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:48,529
So do you think Ichigo
has something to do
with all of this?

130
00:11:49,296 --> 00:11:51,896
Isn't that obvious?
Who else could it be?!

131
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:55,029
But...

132
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:59,296
If this stuff is Ichigo's fault,
then Ichigo is going to fix it.

133
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,762
That's the kind
of guy he is.

134
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:12,196
[Aizen]
Indeed, this is an unacceptable
sight for the Soul Society.

135
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,629
This is the last
we'll see of it.

136
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:49,329
<i>Calm down.</i>

137
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,429
How unbecoming of you.
You should be able to
breathe here.

138
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:58,096
[gasps]

139
00:12:58,329 --> 00:12:59,329
You see?

140
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:02,162
Who are you?

141
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:05,462
Old Man Zangetsu is the only
one who should be here.

142
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:07,729
[chuckle]

143
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:13,196
That is not the way to talk to
the person who just taught you
how to breathe underwater.

144
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:22,662
That's Tensa Zangetsu!

145
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:30,496
I'm not surprised you
don't recognize me.

146
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:36,529
I mean really, this is the
first time you've actually
come here in a Bankai state.

147
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:46,296
Zangetsu!
It is you right?

148
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:49,996
You're wrong.
What is the full
name of your Bankai?

149
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:55,829
I am Tensa Zangetsu. Understand?

150
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:08,262
You've made it.

151
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:12,896
Be careful this time.
He will not go easy on you.

152
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:21,129
It was the same with my Engetsu.

153
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:25,529
Our Zanpakuto don't really want
to teach us this technique.

154
00:14:28,262 --> 00:14:39,229
You'll learn exactly
why soon enough.

155
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:40,796
Hold on, Old Man!

156
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:44,296
Er, I don't mean, you're
old but just hear me out!

157
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:47,829
I didn't come back here this
time to start a fight with you!

158
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:50,129
I just want to ask you
a question dammit!

159
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:53,596
Oh you do? About the
Final Getsugatensho?

160
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:57,062
Uh! That's right!
So you can hear
what's said outs--

161
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:03,096
What are
you doing?!

162
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:05,829
I cannot teach you
such a thing.

163
00:15:06,662 --> 00:15:10,962
Really? Well unfortunately,
that's exactly what I need
you to do right now!

164
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:15,062
I don't care!

165
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:20,196
What happens to what you want to
protect is no concern of mine.

166
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:21,396
What!?

167
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,596
You need to
understand something.

168
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:36,729
What you want to protect Ichigo,
is not the same thing that I
want to protect!

169
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,862
Uhh! My head hurts...

170
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:45,962
What is going on? None of
the trains are running.

171
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:49,296
So I can't get to work
or even get back home.

172
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:50,962
Say now! Hi there!

173
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:53,496
I'm glad to see
someone's awake.

174
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:56,162
Do either of you have any
idea what's going on here?

175
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:57,829
Too late for you.

176
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:09,129
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>Humans with no sense</i>
<i>of Spiritual Pressure,</i>
<i>are unable to feel my power.</i>

177
00:16:09,562 --> 00:16:12,296
But their bodies can't survive
being near that power.

178
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:23,729
Well now, those kiddies
over there certainly
appear to be wide-awake.

179
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:28,096
I've seen them before,
through the eyes of Ulquiorra.

180
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:32,562
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>They are friends of</i>
<i>Ichigo Kurosaki.</i>

181
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,261
Hyaaahh!

182
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:53,202
So what do you mean by that?

183
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:55,835
Mean by what?

184
00:16:57,368 --> 00:17:01,135
By what you said.
"What happens to what you want
to protect is not my concern."

185
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:05,568
Damn it, I need you to explain
to me what the hell all of
that is supposed to mean!

186
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,702
I thought you lent me
your powers all this
time to help me.

187
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:15,602
Was I wrong?
Then why'd you give them
to me in the first place?

188
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,902
I mean what the hell
did you want from me?
What was your intention?

189
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:22,968
Answer me Zangetsu!

190
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:30,768
It is exactly as I said.

191
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:31,968
What is?!

192
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:35,268
Take a look at this world!

193
00:17:37,235 --> 00:17:41,768
<i>[Zangetsu]</i>
<i>This world of yours used</i>
<i>to be full of hope,</i>
<i>filled with skyscrapers!</i>

194
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:45,102
<i>Now it looks like the</i>
<i>rundown small town it is!</i>

195
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:47,502
<i>This place has</i>
<i>sunk to a new low!</i>

196
00:17:53,135 --> 00:17:56,635
The rain that continued to fall
on this world has subsided,

197
00:17:56,668 --> 00:18:00,035
<i>but now everything</i>
<i>has submerged itself</i>
<i>into this ocean!</i>

198
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:05,035
<i>And this all happened</i>
<i>because you lost hope and</i>
<i>stopped moving forward!</i>

199
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:14,502
Aaagh!

200
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:20,535
Ichigo, I cannot
leave you like this.

201
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:25,535
I know what has to happen.
I will rip out the root
of your despair!

202
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:30,935
[wet coughs]

203
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:35,002
Huaaghh!

204
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:54,735
<i>What's up?</i>

205
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,068
It's been a long time, Ichigo.

206
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:03,868
What's with that look of yours?

207
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:06,935
Don't act like you
don't know me!

208
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:19,235
Hey wait a second.

209
00:19:19,268 --> 00:19:20,135
Hm!?

210
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:22,402
Did you spend any time
looking for Mizuiro?

211
00:19:23,102 --> 00:19:26,168
Uh, I did try looking
for him a little.

212
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:30,368
<i>But ever since Ichigo</i>
<i>disappeared, he's been</i>
<i>walking to school on his own.</i>

213
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:34,635
<i>And he's hasn't been</i>
<i>answering his cell phone</i>
<i>either. I bet he's still</i>
<i>asleep somewhere.</i>

214
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:36,868
Hmm.

215
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:42,502
I thought you two were best
friends, I mean haven't you
guys been hanging out
together since middle school?

216
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:44,702
or maybe things aren't
really like that?

217
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:48,135
We just give each
other personal space.
That's all.

218
00:19:49,302 --> 00:19:50,302
I gotcha.

219
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,902
Ichigo was the first person
Mizuiro ever really trusted
enough to open up to.

220
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:57,235
He usually puts up
a wall with everyone.

221
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:01,302
So I'm just happy to see
him have other people
that he'll talk to, y'know?

222
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:05,935
Hm?

223
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:10,635
Enough small talk.
What was I saying, anyway?

224
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:12,902
That you've got a man-crush.

225
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:13,602
Sheesh!

226
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:19,602
Anyway, after we drop
off Chizuru and Michiru
at the school, you
should go find Mizuiro.

227
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,968
What about Ryo
and Mahana?

228
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:24,568
I'm sure those two
will manage just fine
without our help.

229
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:27,035
I'll go look for
Yuzu and Karin.

230
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:28,768
Aren't they
with their Dad?

231
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:32,002
He's probably unconscious
like everybody else.

232
00:20:32,302 --> 00:20:33,135
Ahh.

233
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:35,302
[loud staticy explosion]

234
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,435
Uh?!

235
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:40,835
What in the hell is going on?!

236
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:43,268
Uh Tatsuki!
Are you okay?!

237
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:46,368
Shut up! I don't need
you worrying about me!

238
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:56,268
Who are these guys?

239
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:00,602
[fainting gasp]

240
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:03,435
What's wrong?!

241
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:05,835
That's quite impressive.

242
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:10,802
So close to me, yet
you're still able to hang
on to your existence.

243
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:14,935
Who are... you?!

244
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:18,935
Ichigo Kurosaki will
be here soon.

245
00:21:18,968 --> 00:21:22,268
And I have no doubts,
he will possess new powers.

246
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:28,302
I want to bring those powers
closer to perfection.

247
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:32,535
And I'm quite certain
your deaths will help
to make that possible.

248
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:38,802
Run, Keigo! Run!

249
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:40,735
[whimper]

250
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,868
You need to get going now!
You can't do anything to
help here, so move! Do it!

251
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:46,768
I--...!

252
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:53,735
Don't bother going
after him yet.

253
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:55,835
<i>I'll start with</i>
<i>this one first.</i>

254
00:21:56,035 --> 00:22:01,135
<i>What now!? What should I do!?</i>
<i>My body won't move...</i>
<i>I can't move!!</i>

255
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:05,068
<i>I've gotta do something!!</i>

256
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,470
<i>[Keigo]</i>
<i>Tatsuki, ever heard of the</i>
<i>misattribution of arousal?</i>

257
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:51,936
<i>[Tatsuki]</i>
<i>What are you babbling</i>
<i>about at a time like this?</i>

258
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,170
<i>[Keigo]</i>
<i>When you're in an agitating</i>
<i>situation with someone, your</i>
<i>brain can mistake it as love.</i>

259
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:59,436
<i>[Tatsuki]</i>
<i>Oh really? So you're in love</i>
<i>with that freaky looking guy?</i>
<i>Sorry I told you to run.</i>

260
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,370
<i>[Keigo]</i>
<i>How'd you come to</i>
<i>that conclusion?!!</i>
