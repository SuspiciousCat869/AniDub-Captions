00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:40,782
What the hell are you, anyway?

00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:41,482
-Come, Cain.

-You'll never show
your ugly faces again,

once we're through with you.

It's time to end this!

-Take care of them.

-Very well.

189

It's been awhile, but they
shouldn't be much of a problem.

So this is your doll?

Ha!

You're still all
alone, aren't you?

-But don't worry.

Someday you'll have
a doll as well.

Don't think of yourself
as some stray dog.

You are a chosen human.

You are a Bount.

-All right, then.

-When I'm doing training?

00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,806
-Yes.

-Well, I really
want to be like you.

Also, if you'll let me, I'd like
to stay here and live with you.

215
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:44,072
I've learned from you how
to enjoy training my body,

216
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:45,672
and cooking and washing clothes.

217
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:48,672
And, well, the cleaning
isn't so much fun,

218
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:51,472
but I've realized that
these are all good things

219
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:53,306
to know about and do.

220
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,972
For the first time, I
feel like I'm alive.

-Yeah, anyway.

-If that is the case,
then it may be about time

224

that you had a doll of your own.

The Book of Doll
Summoning was written

properly, your doll

232

can become a great ally, who
will help and understand you.

-Wow!

234
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,072
-However, when we decide you are
ready, I will do the summoning.

235
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:41,506
Whatever you do, don't
try this on your own.

236
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,706
-All right.

237
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:45,539
-But it was too soon.

238

Everything was too soon for him.

I am the one who killed him.

to personify your power.

give your birth cry

If you will do this, I
shall offer you my life,

as a token of my
heat's integrity.

At this moment, our
hearts stretch across

256
00:16:41,472 --> 00:16:44,939
different worlds, and welcome
the moment when we become one.

I finally have a doll of my own.

263
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:18,639
Look at her.

264
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:21,406
Look at how small
and beautiful she is.

265
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:27,506
Just watch this now.

266
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:29,839
I'm going to give her some
orders, and she'll obey!

267

-Don't do that, Cain.

268
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:32,839
You can't control
what will happen.

269
00:17:32,872 --> 00:17:34,039
-No, I can do it.

270
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:36,439
It'll be all right.

271
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,139
All I have to do is speak
to her kindly, like this.

272
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:40,706
And I'm sure she'll respond.

Open your eyes now, my doll.

274

Wake up and speak to me,
just the way Dalk would do.

-Ah.

I still want to sleep.

-Oh please don't say that.

279
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:58,572
I need you to lend me your
power, for just a little bit.

280
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:00,272
Just a little while.

00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:01,339
Won't you do that, please.

I won't do anything
until you do that.

285
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:13,472
Show you my power?

-Yes.

-But I don't know how.

288
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:20,006
-Then I will test you.

289
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:20,506
-Hm.

291
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,106
Get away from it, quickly!

00:18:50,706 --> 00:18:51,706
What's happening?

297
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:56,039
I'm not ready to die, yet.

00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:00,672
-Cain!

299
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:11,539
No, don't tell me.

-Please forgive me.

304
00:19:52,206 --> 00:19:55,706
I lost the life of
an important comrade.

305
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,739
I am to blame.

to show this to Cain someday.

The break of dawn.

309
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:13,472
-Yes.

310
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:21,372
-Bounts should no
longer live alone.

311
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:27,272
This sadness is much too painful
for us to bear in isolation.

312
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:30,672
We should live
together from now on.

313
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:31,172
-Yes.

314
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:43,439
And ever since that day,
Kariya has been my leader.

-This one refuses to die.

00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,639
-Monster.

317
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:55,306
Just what is it you hope
to accomplish, anyway?

318
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:59,106
-Kariya's plans for this world
are actually very simple.

319
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:02,006
He wants to create
a new, clean, world.

320
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,506
A world that will
be ruled by Bounts.

-What are you talking about?

322
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:09,672
-When a Bount gains power by
sucking the souls from living

323
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:12,006
humans, it also
increases the power

324
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:15,872
of all the other Bounts, because
of the multiplier effect.

325
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:18,239
Soon we will rule the world.

326
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:20,272
-That's what you think.

327
00:21:20,306 --> 00:21:22,939
I'm not about to let you use
Keigo's life for that purpose.

328
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:28,239
-It's useless to defy us.

329
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:33,239
Admit that you cannot defeat
the Bounts, young man.

330
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:34,272
-No, never!

331
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:37,572
-The fire in your
eyes spells danger.

332
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:40,906
Such power without
principle is dangerous.

333
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:43,139
You must understand, or die.

334
00:21:43,172 --> 00:21:44,472
-Go to hell.

335
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:46,872
No matter what you say,
I want let Keigo die.

336
00:21:49,572 --> 00:21:51,439
-Why am I destined,
again and again,

337
00:21:51,472 --> 00:21:53,406
to witness the deaths
of young ones, who

338
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:54,772
forfeit their bright futures?

339
00:21:57,406 --> 00:21:59,306
Farewell, young one.

340
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:04,306
-So, you want me to finish him?

341
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:05,006
-Do it now.

342
00:22:08,172 --> 00:22:10,939
Hm?

343
00:22:10,972 --> 00:22:13,106
Who's there?

344
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:14,272
-So then.

345
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:15,972
You are a Bount, are you?

346
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:25,906
From the Court Guard Squads, I'm
Squad 3 Lieutenant, Izuru Kira.

347
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:46,308
[them music]

348
00:24:06,752 --> 00:24:08,952
-Orihime, we have to fight
together in this battle.

349
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:11,052
-This will be the first
time we've worked together.

350
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,419
Well then, you must be the
bridegroom and I'm the bride.

351
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,019
Or in this case, maybe
I'm the bridegroom

352
00:24:16,052 --> 00:24:16,986
and you're the bride.

353
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:18,086
I know!

354
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,652
Could it be that we're
both the bridegroom?

355
00:24:19,686 --> 00:24:21,552
-What in the world
are you talking about?

356
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:22,486
[theme music]

357
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:34,452
-[inaudible] the Soul Reapers.

358
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:36,552
-Golden.

359
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:39,152
In the world sorely
lacking justice,

360
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,619
I shall become justice itself.

361
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:44,519
Then will I erase
the world's evil,

362
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:47,552
like clouds in the night sky.

363
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,419
I risk it all, for justice.

364
00:24:50,452 --> 00:24:51,252
Cry, Suzumushi!

365
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,052
-Aren't Bitto bugs
amazing little suckers?

366
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:02,919
-They sure are.
