1
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,590
[Kugo]
We want to become
ordinary humans again,

2
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:56,563
so we will help you regain
your Soul Reaper powers.

3
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,529
That's not what I came
here to discuss with you.

4
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:15,299
What's that?

5
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:21,111
Listen. I only came here
for one reason, to find
out why stuff's
happening to my friends.

6
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:25,286
As for me getting back
my Soul Reaper powers,

7
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:27,791
That's beside the point.

8
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:49,333
[Yasutora]
So, you're okay
with letting him
leave like that?

9
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:55,445
Sure. Out of nowhere
we ask him to become
a Soul Reaper again.

10
00:02:55,445 --> 00:03:01,323
I mean seriously, I never
really expected him to
agree to our suggestion as
soon as we brought it up.

11
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,162
You of all people
should understand that.

12
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:08,771
He's most likely already come
to grips with never being a
Soul Reaper again.

13
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,509
He came to us because
he thought we might
know something

14
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:14,349
about all these incidents
that are suddenly
happening around him.

15
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:18,223
But he did approach us, so
we've made great progress here.

16
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:22,632
Now the pressure is on us
to not let this golden
opportunity slip by.

17
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:27,408
He must be convinced
to see things our way.

18
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:30,814
Failure in this matter
simply can't happen.

19
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:33,352
[Jackie]
You really think so?

20
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:34,488
Hnh?

21
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,899
I'm not feeling as sold as
you are that this Ichigo
guy is really worth all
that much trouble.

22
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:41,736
Besides...

23
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,945
You having personal
reasons for wanting
him to have his
powers restored,

24
00:03:45,978 --> 00:03:48,215
and whether he
can actually be
of help to us,

25
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:49,952
are two distinctly
different things.

26
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,789
Mmm.

27
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:56,899
But, I'd say some of us are
already interested in him.

28
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:58,336
Hmm?!

29
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:00,305
So, maybe I'm the
only one who
thinks otherwise.

30
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,944
Wait! Were you just
referring to me?!

31
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:04,548
She didn't
say that.

32
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,923
Well I don't think that
he's worth taking a lot
of risks for either!

33
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:12,696
But from what I see, it
sure seems we do need his
powers, wouldn't you say?

34
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:16,404
So says the one who got
all hot and bothered
after seeing him.

35
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:16,861
Ahh!

36
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:19,533
Shut it!
That is so not true!

37
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,768
Now, now.

38
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,006
Fine then!
So what do you
guys think?!

39
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:24,743
Well, Yukio?!

40
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,945
Don't care.

41
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:28,350
Ya don't care
either way?

42
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,354
And you Giriko?!

43
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:32,859
It's appears
quite clearly,

44
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:36,065
that we really do need
this Ichigo character.

45
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:47,721
[struggled breathing]

46
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:01,849
[frantic grunts]
Ah! Ahhhn! Egh ahhh!!

47
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:07,427
You'll pay for thiiiiiaagh!

48
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:09,030
Huh?!

49
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:15,109
Oh, good. The Soul Reapers
haven't found you yet.

50
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:20,853
Who the hell
are you?!

51
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:26,097
It must be so agonizing,
to be weighed down by
such a huge grudge.

52
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,136
I will free you.

53
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:33,579
But in exchange...

54
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:34,848
Agh!

55
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,856
I'd like you to do something for
me.

56
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:42,830
That's it.

57
00:05:43,131 --> 00:05:45,435
AugghhhAAAAAAAAHH!

58
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:53,618
See you tomorrow!

59
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:58,828
Alright I came like
you asked me to,
so what's up?

60
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:02,068
Shush! Don't talk
so loud, or he
might hear you!

61
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:05,174
You and I are going to
confirm with our own eyes

62
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:08,080
whether this Ichigo guy
is really someone we need.

63
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:10,617
You're crushing on
this guy, aren't you?

64
00:06:10,651 --> 00:06:12,154
Hell no!
I am not!

65
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:13,457
He'll hear you.

66
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,140
[gasp]

67
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,713
He's turned
the corner!

68
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:19,651
Let's go!

69
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:21,755
I don't think so.
Count me out.

70
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:22,757
Wait!

71
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:24,260
Rrr!

72
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:29,303
[Uryu]
Come in.

73
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:34,179
Hi, there!

74
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:35,315
Huh?

75
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,952
Hi, Orihime.

76
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,757
He he he! I came to
see how you're doing!

77
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:41,727
Uwah!

78
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:43,598
What's this?

79
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:45,902
I figure you've got a lot
of free time on your hands!

80
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,180
So I brought you a bunch of
DVDs of some up and coming,
unknown entertainers,

81
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:53,618
who might break out
and become famous
in a few years.

82
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:57,091
Uh... Oh, ah!
Thanks so much!
Heh!

83
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:58,628
So how're you feeling?

84
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:02,769
Me? I'm doing well.
It still hurts
sometimes, though.

85
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:03,370
Nhf!

86
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:07,311
If the pain's really that bad,
would you like me to heal you?

87
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:10,284
That's okay.
Thanks for offering.

88
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,056
But I'd rather just
be here for now.

89
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,991
Oh...

90
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:20,070
So then, You didn't
come here just to see
how I was, did you?

91
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:27,918
Well, I heard that the
paramedics found you somewhere
close to Ichigo's house on the
day that you were attacked.

92
00:07:29,087 --> 00:07:32,126
I was wondering why you
were there... uh...

93
00:07:33,095 --> 00:07:35,132
Could it have
been because,

94
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:39,809
You sensed that something's
going on around Ichigo,
like I do, and
you were worried?

95
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:42,413
No, it was just
a coincidence.

96
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:46,956
But it's true that I did
sense some kind of Spiritual
Pressure surrounding him.

97
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:50,329
But that had nothing
to do with the guy
who attacked me.

98
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:51,331
Really?

99
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:53,067
Yeah. But more
important--

100
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:54,371
[spiritual explosion]

101
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:56,842
Was that a...?!

102
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,347
It's a Hollow.
And it's close!

103
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:00,716
Ngh!

104
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,887
Don't move, Uryu!
I'll go and see
what's happening!

105
00:08:03,154 --> 00:08:04,423
But Orihime!

106
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:08,966
I'll be fine! I won't
put myself in danger!
I'll be right back!

107
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:10,268
Okay...

108
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:18,785
She's right, a Hollow
like this shouldn't
be a problem.

109
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:21,924
But, what
worries me is...

110
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:39,693
Mh?

111
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:40,795
Ahh!

112
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:46,339
[phew] That was so close!
Why'd he look back this way?

113
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:46,806
Hm?

114
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,149
There's some kinda
presence here!

115
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:53,754
Ichigo!

116
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:54,288
Uh?

117
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:56,058
Orihime?

118
00:08:57,127 --> 00:09:00,199
What's wrong?
You look flustered.
What's up?

119
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,135
Stay behind me!

120
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:01,870
Huh?

121
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,007
Is it a Hollow?!

122
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,058
No, wait...
I must've imagined it!

123
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,129
Now you're putting
yourself in danger?

124
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,265
Of course not!

125
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:20,206
I usually let Uryu
and Chad take care
of it. Really!

126
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:22,009
Hey, wait up!

127
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,948
[Orihime]
So anyway, what were
you doing over here?

128
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:28,455
[Ichigo]
Oh, not much.
But hey, what
about you?

129
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:30,960
Damn it.
Who is she?!

130
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:34,033
Thanks for
walking me back.

131
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:34,901
Take care.

132
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,072
Yeah, see you
tomorrow.

133
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,538
[Ichigo]
Hanging on to the
past isn't my style.

134
00:10:09,904 --> 00:10:13,076
So you're saying you don't
want your Soul Reaper powers?

135
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:14,545
Ah!

136
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:52,989
Listen, I'm not asking
for you give me an
immediate answer.

137
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:55,259
I can wait
until tomorrow.

138
00:10:56,161 --> 00:10:58,532
You just go home and
think it over tonight.

139
00:10:59,133 --> 00:10:59,935
Sure.

140
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:08,519
It's true. The way I am now,
I can't protect anyone.

141
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,925
But I did all this
knowing the consequences.

142
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,538
Yuzu, Ichigo says he's
not eating dinner.

143
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,544
Oh, that's alright.

144
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:27,088
No it's not. I mean I
know you went all out
and cooked him some of
his favorite stuff.

145
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,493
Whatever. I'm through with him!

146
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:33,300
Yeah. Think I'll go
take a bath now.

147
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:35,505
[sigh]

148
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:39,279
Nh!

149
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,151
Ah?

150
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,955
[groaning]
Hmmmaugh!

151
00:12:04,596 --> 00:12:07,234
It certainly appears
that he's not coming.

152
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:14,181
Looks like you figured
this guy wrong.

153
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:20,160
It seems the more you
ask him to help us, the
less he really wants to.

Here Ichigo. You get to finish
the leftovers from last night.

Thanks, it
looks tasty.

00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:47,413
By the way, last night,
were you expecting a
visit from someone
around dinnertime?

158
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:51,187
What are you talking about?
Wait, did someone come by?

159
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:55,162
No, I just felt like
there was someone out in
front of our house, but,

160
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:57,666
When I went out front to
check, no one was there.

161
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:00,272
Probably just the wind.

162
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:04,647
I can certainly wait
until tomorrow.

163
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,553
How about you go home and
think it over tonight.

164
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:18,140
Chad!

165
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:21,179
What are you
doing here?

166
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:24,286
Hey, did you happen
to drop by my house
last night?

167
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:26,556
Your place?
No, not last night.

168
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,994
Huh. In that case I
guess it was him.

169
00:13:29,562 --> 00:13:30,531
Ichigo.

170
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:31,464
Hm?

171
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,335
Ya got a minute?

172
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:39,680
[Ichigo]
So what's going on with you?

173
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:43,153
I mean you haven't
been at school in
like forever.

174
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:46,659
Do you remember,
the promise we made
in junior high?

175
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:52,505
Back then it was you,
who protected something
very important to me.

176
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:57,348
[Ichigo]
If there's ever anything
so important you'd protect
it with your life,

177
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:59,352
I'll protect it
with mine as well.

178
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:01,322
Whattya say?

179
00:14:05,263 --> 00:14:11,843
[Chad]
From that day on, you and I have
fought as a team, and in my own
way, I've tried to follow you.

180
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:14,247
Yeah.

181
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:20,793
Ichigo, I know that you've
been trying to hide it,
but to tell you the truth,

182
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:24,334
It's been awful to watch you
since you lost your power.

183
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:28,242
I know you want to fight!

184
00:14:30,178 --> 00:14:32,650
And it's tearing you up that
you're unable to protect
everyone with your own
power, like you did before!

185
00:14:32,684 --> 00:14:33,586
[gasp]

186
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:38,328
There's nothing to
feel ashamed of.

187
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:40,967
That's a quality that
defines you, Ichigo.

188
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:48,615
Hold on.

189
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:50,685
Good talk, Chad.

190
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,004
So, what's the plan now?

191
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,778
My thought is there really
isn't anything we can do.

192
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:06,951
I did have a talk
with him, but he
didn't say
anything about it.

193
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,721
Ginjo.

194
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,328
Why didn't you actually talk
with Ichigo last night?

195
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,499
What'd'ya mean, Chad?

196
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:17,238
You went over to his
house last night, right?

197
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:21,947
What the hell are
you talking about?
I didn't go to his house.

198
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:25,621
Well if you didn't,
then who was it who did?

199
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:27,358
What exactly
are you saying?

200
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,568
Last night, one of Ichigo's
younger sisters apparently
sensed the presence of
someone at their home.

201
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:35,607
There's a simple
answer to that.

202
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,716
And what's that?

203
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,328
One logical explanation is
there's someone besides
us who's trying to make
contact with Ichigo as well.

204
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:55,546
Now that you say that!

205
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,888
I've also sensed a strange
presence very close to him.

206
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,605
It's him...!

207
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:27,476
Hey!!

208
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:38,998
By the way, last night,
were you expecting a
visit from someone
around dinnertime?

209
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,002
That could've been him!

210
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:54,863
Hey!!

211
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,734
[panting]

212
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:14,702
Damn!

213
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:16,138
[Yuzu]
Ichigo! Is that you?

214
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:17,340
Huh?

215
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:18,542
I knew it!

216
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:19,812
Yuzu!

217
00:17:20,814 --> 00:17:22,784
What're you doing
here, Ichigo?

218
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:25,958
You're all right!

219
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:27,527
"Alright"?

220
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,932
Uh, forget it.
It's nothing.

221
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,936
So Ichigo, I'm
on my way to buy

222
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:35,376
groceries for dinner tonight.
Would you come with me to
carry the bags?

223
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,912
Sure. Be glad to.

224
00:17:40,954 --> 00:17:44,026
Hm? Was that a
breeze just now?

225
00:17:56,484 --> 00:17:58,054
Uh, is something wrong?

226
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,024
Uh!

227
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:01,861
Yaahhh!

228
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:02,596
Yuzu!

229
00:18:02,629 --> 00:18:04,132
Help!
Help me!

230
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:08,975
Yahh!
Help! Help!

231
00:18:09,577 --> 00:18:12,148
Ichigo! Something's
got a hold of me!

232
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,589
There's no doubt! It's a Hollow!

233
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:19,429
Make it stop!!

234
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:21,199
Dammit!
Drop her!!

235
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:22,836
Augh!

236
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,604
Agh!

237
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:27,078
Ichigo!
Help me!

238
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:32,488
Damn! Why the hell
can't I see it?!

239
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:35,761
Ichigo... Run... away...

240
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,032
Yaahhh!

241
00:18:38,032 --> 00:18:38,634
Uht!

242
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:41,873
Dah!

243
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:47,652
[panting]

244
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:53,997
[roar]

245
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:56,135
Hraaagh!

246
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:00,076
Yuzu!!

247
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,844
Agh!

248
00:19:03,014 --> 00:19:03,850
Yuzu!!

249
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,938
[gasp]

250
00:19:15,907 --> 00:19:17,944
That hurt, you
Hollow bastard!

251
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:20,048
Ginjo!

252
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:22,486
You hung in there
well, Ichigo.

253
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:25,894
What do you say we
get some ramen.

254
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:29,033
Right after I take
care of this problem.

255
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,109
[roar]

256
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:45,832
Bastard! Why'd you go
after this girl anyway?!

257
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:49,840
Hrrrr...

258
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:50,842
Raagh!

259
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:58,123
Haaaaaa!

260
00:19:58,524 --> 00:19:59,659
[roar]

261
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:01,263
Haahhh!

262
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:12,284
Ah! Yuzu! Hey!
You alright?!

263
00:20:12,986 --> 00:20:14,623
[coughs]

264
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:16,893
[Ichigo]
Thank you.

265
00:20:17,094 --> 00:20:17,762
Huh?

266
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:24,108
Ginjo, I owe you for this.

267
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,080
Forget about it.

268
00:20:27,648 --> 00:20:30,153
I didn't show up to make
you feel like you owe me.

269
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:33,760
But truth is, we can't
afford to have you die.

270
00:20:37,768 --> 00:20:38,603
Besides.

271
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,748
It would suck for us to have
the door slammed shut on us
'cause we didn't protect
someone we were able to.

272
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:55,804
[Riruka]
You did what?!

273
00:20:56,304 --> 00:21:00,112
Are you a moron?! You saved him
and then just left him there!?

274
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:03,051
If we really need his
powers like you've said,
why didn't you say,

275
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:06,056
"I'll save you if you
cooperate with us" and
make a deal with him?!

276
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:10,766
From the sound of it you
really want to invite that
guy back to our place.

277
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:11,868
Yeah.

278
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:13,204
No, I don't!!

279
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,845
I still don't get why you
two keep exaggerating
about my interest

280
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:19,182
in that goofy dude with
that tacky orange hair!

281
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,220
[Ichigo]
Hey, I'm not THAT goofy.

282
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:22,322
Huh?!

283
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:26,130
Ichigo Kurosaki!

284
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:29,669
Is your
sister okay?

285
00:21:30,171 --> 00:21:30,973
Yeah.

286
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:34,011
Why'd you come?

287
00:21:35,615 --> 00:21:37,285
Look don't get
the wrong idea.

288
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:38,854
Huh?

289
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:41,259
[Ichigo]
I didn't come 'cause
I feel like I owe you.

290
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,302
I want my power back
to protect people.

291
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,008
That's all.
So let's do it.

292
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:53,884
Straight to the
point, huh?

293
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:00,965
How did...?
It's my...

294
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:05,273
That's the symbol of
your power, right?
Be sure to keep it safe.

295
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:09,248
Right.

296
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:48,943
[Riruka]
You could've told me
he'd be joining us!

297
00:23:48,943 --> 00:23:51,542
[Kugo]
Come on. Stop picking on me
just because you're happy.

298
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:53,444
[Riruka]
No one said
I'm happy!

299
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:56,447
Or that he's my type...
Or he's got a sexy voice...
Or he has a cute smile!

300
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:58,149
I'm not thinking
any of that, okay?!

301
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,285
[Kugo]
I think you just
gave yourself away.
