to be a pyrotechnical wizard,

but I'm still not
fully convinced of it.

57

The idea of shooting us up into

-What's this?

59
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,767
-It's a reishukaku
or spirit core.

60
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:51,067
Place your palms on it and
concentrate your spirit energy.

61
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:51,567
-Hm.

62
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:52,201
Like this?

63
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:59,801
Can someone show me how to
concentrate my spirit energy?

64
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,001
-Huh.

65
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:04,434
Any soul reaper should
easily be able to do that.

66
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:07,467
So you should know how to use
your spirit energy to do this.

67
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:10,801
-Well, actually, he's the
substitute soul reaper

68
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,567
I was telling you about earlier.

69
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:15,634
And he can't use
spirit energy at all.

-Yeah.

00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:16,901
I can see that.

72
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:20,167
-Uh, you mean like this?

73
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,301
-This kid is
completely hopeless.

-Ganju, show this
amateur how it's done.

to fight for it?

-Yeah.

Come on and take it
if you think you can.

80
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:40,667
But I, for one, would
rather die right here

81
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:42,567
than to learn it from you.

-Stop this right
now, both of you.

[moaning]

85
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,234
-What's that?

86
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:06,534
-This here is the cannonball.

87
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:07,534
-Cannonball?

88
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,467
-Now pay close
attention, every one.

89
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,434
You may think that the only
thing guarding the Seireitei

90
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:15,467
is that barrier, but
you are dead wrong.

91
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:18,167
It isn't nearly that simple.

92
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:21,767
That barrier is made from
a stone known as Sekkiseki.

93
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:24,567
It's rare, even in
the soul society.

94
00:05:24,601 --> 00:05:28,067
This is a fragment of it.

95
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:32,034
As you can see, it completely
repels spirit energy.

96
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:34,067
Therefore, it's
impossible to smash

97
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,767
through the barrier with
spirit energy alone.

98
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,167
Even cut into a small
piece such as this,

99
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:41,834
it emits a wave that
breaks down spirit energy

100
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:46,167
from all sides, which means
that the Seireitei has

101
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:49,034
a spherical barrier which
surrounds them, protecting them

102
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:53,867
not only from the sky above
but even below the ground.

103
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:59,801
So you see, that's
why we use this.

104
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:00,801
-Enough show and tell.

105
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:02,301
I'm tired.

106
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:03,834
KUKAKU (OFFSCREEN): Suck it up.

107
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:06,734
This cannonball is a special
hard spiritual partition

108
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,801
penetration device I invented.

109
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:11,101
In other words,
if all four of you

110
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:14,267
combined put your spirit
energy into this Reishukaku,

111
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,867
you can create a
temporary cannonball

112
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:19,134
that can break
through the barrier.

113
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,101
Then I'll use the
flower crane cannon

114
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:23,534
to shoot that
cannonball into the sky,

115
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,767
and it'll punch a hole
straight through the barrier.

116
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,534
Any questions?

117
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,701
-Eh, well, I was--

118
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:33,867
-All right then.

119
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:35,301
Now take them to the
underground training room

120
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:37,334
so they can practice
concentrating their spirit

121
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:38,001
energy.

122
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:38,367

-Get them out of here.

127
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,101
-Yes.

00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:41,601

Put me down this instant.

-Listen, you guys.

If any one of you
loses concentration,

135
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:52,667
then you'll blow up on the spot.

going to help them?

-I'm against it.

147
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:20,634
Helping a soul reaper is
something we shouldn't do.

148
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:24,101
I mean think after what
happened to our brother.

Listen, sis, I--

-Ganju, what did I tell you?

151
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:31,301
Didn't I say you were never
to speak of this again?

152
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:32,501
-But sis.

153
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:34,367
-You have your orders.

154
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,301
Now go.

a weak face in front of them.

I hear what you're saying.

161

I think this is probably
the first time I've ever

been asked to wear
it like this myself.

00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:21,401
-So Momo, are you
the only one here?

168
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,301
-Uh, yes, I think so.

169
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:24,801
RANGIKU (OFFSCREEN):
The lieutenants

170
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:27,667
are scattered, working hard
all over the soul society.

171
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:30,801
It might take about half a
day for everyone together.

172
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,267
And to make matters
even worse, my captain

173
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:34,767
can't be reached at all.

174
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,901
This is starting to turn
into somewhat of a problem.

175
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,167
What to do?

176
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:40,467
What to do?

177
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:44,867
-So then, just who exactly
is Rangiku's squad captain?

178
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:46,601
-You know, young Hitsugaya.

179
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:49,467
-Oh, not that little genius.

180
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:51,601
And I thought I had it rough.

181
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:52,667
-Renji?

182
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:53,867
-Yeah?

183
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,901
-You haven't seen Captain
Aizen around, have you?

184
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:58,167
-Uh, no.

185
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,467
I-- I haven't.

186
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:01,534
-I'm worried.

187
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:03,401
He's been acting strange lately.

188
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:06,067
I ran into him just this
morning and asked him

189
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:08,601
if anything was wrong,
because I was concerned.

190
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:09,834
But he didn't answer.

191
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:11,467
I don't know what to do.

192
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:14,267
[sigh]

193
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:16,501
-It'll be all right.

194
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:18,267
It's nothing to worry about.

195
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:20,067
My guess is that
even this summons

196
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,067
will be canceled
before much longer.

197
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:28,167
-In your personal
opinion, should Rukia die?

198
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,367
-What's happening,
Captain Aizen?

199
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:32,501
Just what the hell
is going on here?

200
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:34,401
SHIROGANEHIKO AND
KOGANEHIKO (OFFSCREEN): No.

201
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:36,434
That's wrong, Ichigo.

202
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:37,201
It's not right.

203
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:37,601
-No.

204
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:38,634
No.

205
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,634
-How many times do
I have to tell you?

206
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:42,167
[groaning]

207
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:42,667
-Do it.

208
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:43,467
Do it.

209
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,567
Do it.

210
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:47,267
-[inaudible].

211
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:48,467
-Come on, Ichigo.

212
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:49,534
Try harder.

213
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,934
-It's supposed to be
[inaudible], right?

214
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:51,467
-[inaudible].

215
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:56,534
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Help me out here.

216
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:57,434
Is it working?

217
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:58,134
I can't tell.

218
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,234
-Sorry, brother.

219
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,334
I've decided to help
that soul reaper who

220
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:13,867
came to me, a soul reaper not
unlike the one who killed you.

221
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:16,867
If you were still alive and
saw me not helping them,

222
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:20,701
you'd be the first to scold me,
you who loved soul reapers all

223
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:25,267
your life and also
died as a soul reaper.

224
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:44,462
SHIROGANEHIKO (OFFSCREEN): Now,
you, if you please, Orihime.

225
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:48,462
Good.

226
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:50,395
You're doing just fine.

227
00:10:50,428 --> 00:10:52,662
KOGANEHIKO (OFFSCREEN):
Now you, Uryu.

228
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,295
SHIROGANEHIKO
(OFFSCREEN): It's narrow,

229
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:55,662
but the overall shape is there.

230
00:10:55,695 --> 00:10:56,795
KOGANEHIKO (OFFSCREEN): Hm.

231
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:58,962
I'll bet that the
shape most likely

232
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,928
stems from the boy's
own personality.

233
00:11:00,962 --> 00:11:02,962
SHIROGANEHIKO (OFFSCREEN):
Chad, you are up next.

234
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:09,895
Ah, this one is a bit
unstable, but very powerful.

235
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:12,195
KOGANEHIKO (OFFSCREEN): And
now, it is time for Ichigo.

236
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:12,695
-Ah!

237
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:18,862
-That's terrible.

238
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,162
-Just worthless.

239
00:11:20,195 --> 00:11:21,828
-What is that supposed to be?

240
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:24,695
-It is obvious that you have
absolutely no talent for this.

241
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:28,762
You have no talent at all.

242
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:30,395
-Shiroganehiko!

243
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:32,762
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): How many
times do I have to tell you,

244
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:33,762
I don't understand?

245
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:35,228
You, teach me some
useless pointers.

246
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:35,728
Damn it.

247
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:47,862
[heavy breathing]

248
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,762
-Excuse me, boss man.

249
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,162
I'm sorry to
interrupt what you're

250
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:56,428
doing but dinner's ready.

251
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:57,195
-Huh.

252
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:58,662
Hey, guys, listen up.

253
00:11:58,695 --> 00:12:00,028
Why don't we take a break?

254
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:00,828
Dinner's ready.

255
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:03,062
I bet you guys are starving.

256
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:04,562
-I suppose we could eat.

257
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:07,662
-You didn't get to eat in
the Rukon district, did you?

258
00:12:07,695 --> 00:12:09,328
Well, those guys
over there don't

259
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,362
know how to use their spirit
energy, so they're not hungry.

260
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:14,028
So why don't you three go eat?

261
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:15,795
-OK, but what about--

262
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:18,262
-Never mind about me.

263
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:19,862
Go on ahead and eat.

264
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:22,262
I'll join you guys
when I'm done.

265
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:22,828
-All right.

266
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:23,795
If you're sure.

267
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:24,895
Then I guess we will.

268
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:26,228
[grunt]

269
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:26,995
-Come on.

270
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:28,428
Let's go and eat, Orihime.

271
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:29,895
-Oh, Uryu.

272
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:31,228
I'm not hungry at all yet.

273
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:33,162
So I'll just hang
out here for a while.

274
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:36,328
[stomach growling]

275
00:12:36,362 --> 00:12:37,262
-Hey.

276
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:37,762
OK.

277
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:38,262
Busted.

278
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:39,662
I'm fibbing.

279
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:40,828
Maybe I am hungry.

280
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:42,828
Oh, this is embarrassing.

281
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,928
-Orihime, go on.

282
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:46,795
It's OK.

283
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:47,628
I'll be fine.

284
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:48,862
-I know that.

285
00:12:48,895 --> 00:12:51,095
It's just that I want to
stay and practice some more.

286
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:52,895
Besides, I'm not
really that hungry.

287
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:53,795
Really.

288
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:54,862
-Orihime.

289
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:57,162
Please.

290
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:57,895
Do it for me.

291
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:04,895
-OK.

292
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:08,695
I'll do it, just because
you're asking me so nicely.

293
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:11,728
[giggle] I'm going to go then.

294
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:13,895
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Orihime,
are you going to join us?

295
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:14,462
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): OK.

296
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:15,295
Let's go eat.

297
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,228
I'm starved.

298
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:34,228
[groaning]

299
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:41,628
-Damn it.

300
00:13:41,662 --> 00:13:43,428
-So she that important to you?

301
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:44,562
-Huh?

302
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:46,928
-That girl, the
other soul reaper.

303
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:49,995
You know, the one
you came to save.

304
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:50,995
-Not really.

305
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:52,528
-Huh.

306
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:53,528
-Give it here.

307
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:55,395
-I know why you're doing this.

308
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:57,495
It's got to be because
you promised to save her.

309
00:13:57,528 --> 00:13:58,195
Right?

310
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:58,762
-No.

311
00:13:58,795 --> 00:13:59,395
That's not it.

312
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:00,328
-Then it's money.

313
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:01,562
That's got to be it.

314
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:03,662
She promised to pay you
if you saved her, huh.

315
00:14:03,695 --> 00:14:04,728
-No way.

316
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:06,028
How the hell am I
supposed to use money

317
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,562
from here in my world?

318
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:10,162
-Then why the hell are
you so damned determined?

319
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:10,828
-I owe her.

320
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:21,662
You see, she saved my life,
and I haven't repaid her yet.

321
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,328
She gave her power in order
to save me and my family,

322
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:28,262
even though she just met me.

323
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:30,928
Because of that,
she was captured.

324
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:35,695
And now she's about
to be executed.

325
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:38,428
I don't want to turn into
some kind of deplorable guy

326
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,828
who would just turn
his back on her.

327
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:43,028
Understand?

328
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:43,962
What now?

329
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:47,662
-Give it here.

330
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:48,495
-What are you doing?

331
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,028
Give it back to me.

332
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:51,495
-I've got practice myself.

333
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:53,062
So cover your ears.

334
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:55,162
I don't want you to
hear my technique.

335
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,028
I'm going to do some
work on an old trick

336
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,262
that I developed for
myself a while back.

337
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:04,962
Visualize this.

338
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:07,762
Draw a circle inside
your mind as dark

339
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:10,462
as possible and as
heavy as possible.

340
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,862
Then imagine yourself
jumping right

341
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,662
into the center of the circle.

342
00:15:14,695 --> 00:15:16,328
This is a basic
imaging technique

343
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:18,662
that allows you to get in
touch with your spirit energy.

344
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:25,095
I could cry it's so easy.

345
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:27,395
And I didn't even
have to practice it.

346
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:42,262
Well, sorry about that.

347
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:44,562
Besides, since you
totally suck, I

348
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,695
doubt you'd be able to
do it like I can anyway.

349
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:50,595
Good luck.

350
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:56,128
-Hm.

351
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:57,995
Talk about a ham.

352
00:15:58,028 --> 00:16:00,795
That guy is one bad actor.

353
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:01,528
What an idiot.

354
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:13,728
Draw a circle inside my mind.

355
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:22,595
-Thank you for the meal.

356
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:24,728
-Yeah.

357
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:25,595
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Uh.

358
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:27,795
Orihime, are you done?

359
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:28,995
-Oh yeah, really.

360
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:30,395
I'm full.

361
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:33,328
[stomach growling]

362
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,228
-See.

363
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:39,228
Really.

364
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:41,862
My stomach is full after all.

365
00:16:41,895 --> 00:16:44,062
-You really don't
have to go that far.

366
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:47,595
Just forget that I ever asked.

367
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:51,495
-Actually, I was going to
take the leftovers to Ichigo.

368
00:16:51,528 --> 00:16:52,762
-That's right.

369
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:55,028
He still hasn't had
anything to eat.

370
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:58,562
[explosion]

371
00:16:58,595 --> 00:16:59,695
KOGANEHIKO (OFFSCREEN): No.

372
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,595
It's breaking apart.

373
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:02,628
-Oh no.

374
00:17:02,662 --> 00:17:04,028
The great Kukaku arm
is going to fall.

375
00:17:04,062 --> 00:17:04,628
-Oh no.

376
00:17:04,662 --> 00:17:06,128
Please don't.

377
00:17:06,162 --> 00:17:08,995
-It's Ichigo.

378
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,128
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Let's go.

379
00:17:14,162 --> 00:17:16,062
-What the hell's going on?

380
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:18,295
Ganju, I'm talking to you.

381
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,828
KOGANEHIKO (OFFSCREEN):
Sis, I'm so sorry.

382
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:24,662
It's just that I
only showed him once.

383
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:26,828
I never thought it would
turn out like this.

384
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:29,695
His spirit energy is strong,
but he's out of control.

385
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:41,895
-You stupid idiot.

386
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,728
Concentrate your spirit energy.

387
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:57,428
-I did it.

388
00:17:57,462 --> 00:17:58,095
-Great.

389
00:17:58,128 --> 00:17:59,262
You did it, Ichigo.

390
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,762
-Yeah.

391
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:04,062
-You ignorant dumbass.

392
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:05,728
You've got to stay focused.

393
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:13,095
-What are you?

394
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:14,995
Freaking deaf or
freaking stupid.

395
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:17,862
Remember, I told you if
you don't concentrate,

396
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:19,162
you're going to blow up.

397
00:18:19,195 --> 00:18:19,728
-Yes.

398
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:20,995
Yes, you did.

399
00:18:21,028 --> 00:18:23,428
-Next time just be
sure not to do this.

400
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:26,295
-You're as guilty
as he is, schmuck.

401
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:28,262
Both of you, no food tonight.

402
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:29,562
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): But why?

403
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:30,462
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): Come on,
you can't lump me together

404
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:31,262
with him.

405
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,862
KUKAKU (OFFSCREEN): Shut up.

406
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:34,128
Any more complaints?

407
00:18:34,162 --> 00:18:35,495
GANJU AND ICHIGO
(OFFSCREEN): OK.

408
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:36,128
We understand.

409
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:45,662
YAMAMOTO (OFFSCREEN):
So you're here.

410
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:56,028
Captain of Squad
Three, Gin Ichimaru.

411
00:18:56,062 --> 00:18:58,628
-An unexpected summons.

412
00:18:58,662 --> 00:18:59,595
Tell me.

413
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:01,795
Should I be appalled
or impressed?

414
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:04,128
And look at this
distinguished crowd.

415
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:07,262
The captains who control
the soul society,

416
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:10,328
all here just for me.

417
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:12,862
Or am I mistaken?

418
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:16,728
I see the captain of Squad
13 is conspicuously absent.

419
00:19:16,762 --> 00:19:17,528
What's wrong?

420
00:19:17,562 --> 00:19:19,462
Did something happen to him?

421
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:21,595
-He's not feeling very well.

422
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,095
-Oh, not again.

423
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,962
I hope he gets well soon.

424
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:26,362
-Quit joking around.

425
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:29,495
You know that's not the
reason you were summoned here.

426
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:32,462
It is my understanding that you
went and played with that Ryoka

427
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:34,462
by yourself, didn't you?

428
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:36,995
And I also hear that you failed.

429
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:38,328
Explain yourself.

430
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:40,495
You should have no trouble
dealing with four or five

431
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,428
Ryokas without backup.

432
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:43,528
-I see.

433
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,162
So then you're saying
that they survived.

434
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:46,428
ZARAKI (OFFSCREEN): They what?

435
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:50,228
-Well, I was under the
impression that they were dead,

436
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:54,295
but I guess my instincts
are starting to fail me.

437
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:56,995
-Stop all this monkey
business right now.

438
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,895
There's absolutely no way
that captains such as us

439
00:19:59,928 --> 00:20:02,462
could fail to instantly
tell whether an opponent's

440
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,128
spirit has ceased to exist.

441
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:04,828
-Oh no.

442
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:06,262
Not again.

443
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:08,595
Old fools caught up
in stupid bickering.

444
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:10,262
-Can you not see?

445
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:12,495
Your petty accusations
seem to imply

446
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:14,228
that I let him go on purpose.

447
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:16,428
-That's exactly what I'm saying.

448
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:18,495
ZARAKI (OFFSCREEN):
Shut up, Kurotsuchi.

449
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:22,362
Can't you see I was the one
who was talking to him first?

450
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:24,628
Or perhaps you'd rather
be done in by me.

451
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:26,328
KUROTSUCHI (OFFSCREEN):
What did you say?

452
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:27,762
-So stupid.

453
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:29,362
-Well, what do you know.

454
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:33,228
Tempers are running high today.

455
00:20:33,262 --> 00:20:34,928
-Stop!

456
00:20:34,962 --> 00:20:36,028
Enough of this foolishness.

457
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:41,462
I think the true
reason for which

458
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:44,028
you have been summoned here
to stand before your peers has

459
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:45,962
been made abundantly clear.

460
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,528
It is the fact that
you acted alone,

461
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:50,262
that coupled with the
fact that you also

462
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:52,628
permitted the target to escape.

463
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:56,662
So then, how do you defend
your actions, Ichimaru?

464
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:00,928
-I cannot.

465
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,295
Well, you see.

466
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:05,828
There's nothing to say.

467
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:07,562
I made a simple mistake.

468
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:10,195
I'm not going to stand
here and make excuses.

469
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,962
I'll accept whatever
punishment--

470
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:12,995
-Just a minute, Ichimaru.

471
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:17,095
I have something I
want to ask you first.

472
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:23,762
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): Red alert.

473
00:21:23,795 --> 00:21:24,795
Red alert.

474
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:26,262
Intruders in the Seireitei.

475
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:28,262
All squads get into position.

476
00:21:28,295 --> 00:21:28,762
Repeat.

477
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:29,728
Red alert.

478
00:21:29,762 --> 00:21:30,728
Red alert.

479
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:32,695
Intruders in the Seireitei.

480
00:21:32,728 --> 00:21:34,195
All squads get into position.

481
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:35,528
ZARAKI (OFFSCREEN): Those Ryoka.

482
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:36,128
It can't be.

483
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:45,695
-Ichigo.

484
00:21:53,231 --> 00:22:03,264
[theme music]

485
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:53,313
[theme music]

486
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:56,446
-Four students and one cat
are going to Seireitei.

487
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:57,013
-Got it.

488
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:58,313
I'm off, sis.

489
00:22:58,346 --> 00:23:00,246
-Attention, everyone.

490
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,479
The cannonball will
be shot very soon.

491
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:05,113
Take your seats now or else.

492
00:23:05,146 --> 00:23:05,813
-OK.

493
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:07,979
Now, I'm really worried.
