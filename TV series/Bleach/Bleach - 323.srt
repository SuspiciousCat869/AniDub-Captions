1
00:01:55,272 --> 00:01:56,072
By the river?

2
00:01:57,205 --> 00:01:59,938
Yeah! I feel Rukia
and the other's
Spiritual Pressures.

3
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:00,572
Let's go!

4
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:02,738
Wait! I'll go instead.

5
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:05,972
I think it'd be better if you
went and looked for Nozomi.

6
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:07,705
<i>Please?</i>

7
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,005
All right.

8
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,838
Chad, I want you
to go with her.

9
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:14,538
Mm. You got it.

10
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,472
<i>[Kon]</i>
<i>[grunty walking]</i>

11
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:25,505
Are we there?

12
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,972
Cool your jets!
We should see it
over that way soon.

13
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:30,272
There! Isn't that it?

14
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:37,872
[Kon]
So, what's over
there anyway?

15
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:41,572
Just remember I'm the one
who brought you here!

16
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:43,638
So you should fill
me in on what's up!

17
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:47,338
I heard you say before...

18
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:50,138
I'll fix things so he
doesn't need to protect me.

19
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:51,838
What are you
talking about?

20
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:55,172
That's why I came here,
to Karakura Town.

21
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:58,438
So is that what
this is all about?

22
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,605
Aren't-cha gonna
tell me?

23
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:07,738
Hey! Wait up
will ya? C'mon!

24
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:37,172
C'mon, let's go!

25
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:38,438
Hey wait!

26
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:39,538
Huh?

27
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:40,705
Mmm.

28
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:42,505
Someone's coming!

29
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:50,672
Is that Renji!?

30
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:52,638
Maybe.

31
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,305
Heh!

32
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:03,638
Ah! That's
not him!

33
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:05,805
So it's you two.

34
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:10,438
You know, I was starting to
get a little bored with just
searching for Nozomi Kujo.

35
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:13,072
I could use a
little work out.

36
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:19,138
Hey. Get going.
Move out.

37
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:20,638
But Chad, wait!

38
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:22,138
I've got this.

39
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:23,672
Be careful!

40
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:32,472
Whadd'ya know Chad?
I wasn't expecting
to fight you.

41
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,072
<i>But since we're</i>
<i>going to fight,</i>

42
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:37,072
I'm not holding back!

43
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:41,138
Brazo Derecho Del Gigante!

44
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:47,872
That won't work!
I'm not some stranger.

45
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:49,972
But I'm gonna
kick your ass!

46
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:07,605
Please hang on!

47
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:18,272
Time for a look.

48
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:21,205
We need to check out how
Old Man Yama's doing.

49
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:23,405
Be on your toes though.

50
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:26,305
He may be old and give the
impression that he's feeble,

51
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:29,438
but no one matches up to
Master Genryusai's skill set.

52
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,638
Oho don't I know it.

53
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:34,872
And that's why we're both going
in there to deal with him.

54
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:49,005
Old Man Yama!
It's Shunsui
and Jushiro!

55
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:51,238
May we come in Master?

56
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:54,105
We have some news we'd
like to share with you.

57
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:55,772
Enter.

58
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:57,172
Hah!
Heh!

59
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:59,005
Thanks, we'll
only be a minute.

60
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:08,372
Pardon this
intrusion, sir.

61
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,805
So what brings the two of
you here at this hour?

62
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,238
Heh!
Heh!

63
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:18,038
Huh?

64
00:06:18,072 --> 00:06:20,338
You two have a
ways to go yet.

65
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:27,272
You made a very basic mistake:
allowing your target to sense
your intent to kill.

66
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,105
You're good, Master.

67
00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:31,005
I'm very impressed.

68
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:32,772
So just when
did you know?

69
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:35,738
[low growl]

70
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:40,205
So now, tell me
young ones.

71
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:43,272
What makes you think you can
dispose of me so easily?

72
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:47,605
Y'got an answer?
Guess the only way
is to show him.

73
00:06:47,638 --> 00:06:49,772
Y'know, I've been
looking forward to this.

74
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:50,705
Me too!

75
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:53,772
You really have a
desire to fight me?

76
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:57,705
Well if you're truly ready,
I'm happy to accept your
challenge.

77
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,672
But be aware, I have no plans
of losing to you just yet!

78
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:06,738
What did you find, Isane?

79
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:10,305
It's confusing.
What I'm seeing doesn't
seem quite right.

80
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:16,572
This traffic log for the
Precipice World indicates
frequent travel by Ichigo
Kurosaki and Captain Kyoraku.

81
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:20,672
Do you suppose that
Captain Kyoraku would have
altered these records?

82
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:24,105
I don't think he
would do something
as obvious as that.

83
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:28,605
But I do think the traffic
information in that log
has been altered.

84
00:07:28,838 --> 00:07:32,705
If that's the case, there's
probably only one person
who could've done that.

85
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:35,205
That would be
Captain Kurotsuchi.

86
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,772
No. This is too
easily noticeable for
him to have done it.

87
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,172
Well then who did this?

88
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:46,805
I wanted to solve this,
so I went over to the
Daireisho Archive to do
some further research.

89
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:50,805
The Daireisho Archive?!
In the Underground
Assembly Hall?!

90
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,405
<i>Yes. It's a huge</i>
<i>repository.</i>

91
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:57,105
<i>It contains the records</i>
<i>of all Soul Society</i>
<i>events and information.</i>

92
00:07:57,138 --> 00:08:00,738
<i>Everything is stored there,</i>
<i>whether one wants it to be</i>
<i>recorded or not.</i>

93
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:02,605
Oh! I see.

94
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:05,605
So did you find anything
that would help us out?

95
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:09,405
I found a Department of
Research & Development
scientist

96
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:12,038
who's completely obsessed
with the Precipice World.

97
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:17,438
This individual has put together
many studies on the
Precipice World all by himself.

98
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:21,838
<i>But there's one detail about</i>
<i>him that truly concerns me.</i>

99
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:28,038
<i>Prior to a certain time,</i>
<i>there appears to be no</i>
<i>record of him existing.</i>

100
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,872
What?! Even in the
Daireisho Archive?

101
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:36,138
Yes. I don't know the reason,
but it would appear he's
no ordinary member.

102
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:38,238
Did I get that right?

103
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:39,038
[gasp]

104
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,205
<i>[Unohana]</i>
<i>Meet the head of the Precipice</i>
<i>World Research Section,</i>

105
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:52,338
<i>the Department of Research</i>
<i>& Development's Seventh</i>
<i>Seat, Kageroza Inaba.</i>

106
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,672
Just as I expected.

107
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:58,238
Although I thought it'd take
you a little longer to find me.

108
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,805
I didn't think you would
access the Daireisho Archive.

109
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:02,872
Lieutenant.

110
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:03,972
Yes Ma'am!

111
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:05,705
Haaah!

112
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:10,305
You're wasting
your time.

113
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:15,438
It appears you have been
able to cross over
both space and time.

114
00:09:15,672 --> 00:09:18,972
Is that the result of
the Precipice World
research you've done?

115
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:21,338
You are very astute.

116
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:24,872
However the technology involved
is still imperfect.

117
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:30,505
You're using the Precipice World
to cut off the Soul Society
from the World of the Living.

118
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,572
What exactly is your plan?

119
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,138
You'll find out soon enough.

120
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:37,672
Heh heh heh heh.

121
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:41,072
Haaaa!

122
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:43,138
El Directo!

123
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:44,438
Augh!

124
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:53,638
You're a damn good fighter!

125
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:55,972
Mmm.

126
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:59,705
So then, I guess it's time
for me to get serious.

127
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:01,605
Bankai!

128
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:10,338
Hihio Zabimaru!!

129
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:14,972
<i>Hikotsu Taiho!</i>

130
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:21,672
Haaaa!

131
00:10:27,738 --> 00:10:29,972
HUAAAAHH!

132
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:32,472
Again! Hikotsu Taiho!

133
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,472
Augh!

134
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:41,505
Huh?!!

135
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,405
Heh heh heh!

136
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:46,572
Hey Chad, you alright?!

137
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:51,705
Even though he's my impostor,
I think you did pretty
darn good standing up to
him this long.

138
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:53,638
Heh.

139
00:10:56,338 --> 00:10:59,272
So then you're my Reigai.
Interesting.

140
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:02,372
No matter how much
power you have,

141
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:05,305
I'll blow you away,
you fake!

142
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:27,721
Come on. It's about
time you filled me in
on this whole thing.

143
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:29,721
What exactly are
you here for?

144
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:36,121
[sigh] So you're not
talking again, huh?!

145
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,888
A Senkaimon.

146
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:38,455
Huh?

147
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:42,488
Aha! So there's a
Senkaimon here!

148
00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:45,588
Wait, what do you mean
there's a Senakimon here?!

149
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,288
Isn't that something only
Soul Reapers can open?

150
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:50,821
Studying the Precipice World,

151
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:56,555
led to the discovery that
many previously unknown
Senkaimon actually exist
right here in this world.

152
00:11:57,321 --> 00:11:59,921
And that structure ahead
of us is one of them.

153
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:01,788
Yeah?

154
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:05,188
So what are you going to do
when you get to the Senkaimon?

155
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:06,688
Let's go.

156
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:08,688
Uhh... Hrm!

157
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:30,455
Huh?

158
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:33,355
There's really a
Senkaimon here?

159
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:38,621
Now I got it!

160
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:41,588
You're gonna open the Senkaimon
and run away somewhere, right?

161
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:42,421
Hey wait!

162
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:45,088
I'm not running anywhere.

163
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:46,788
Huh?

164
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:52,588
It's right here.

165
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:55,121
It's a wrinkle
in space.

166
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:00,688
Whoa!

167
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,721
What's up with this?

168
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,455
Doesn't this one look
different than what's usual?

169
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:15,888
This one is a naturally
occurring Senkaimon.

170
00:13:16,055 --> 00:13:16,755
Hm?

171
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:21,388
There are countless
Precipice Worlds connecting
the Soul Society with the
World of the Living.

172
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:25,688
Some are extremely dangerous
because they flow way too fast.

173
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:30,555
<i>Some are tiny, some are</i>
<i>gateways connected to</i>
<i>who-knows-where.</i>

174
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:32,621
This is one of them.

175
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,721
If I enter this one
and close the gateway,

176
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,921
then no one will be
able to find me.

177
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:41,288
Hey! This thing would be
perfect for hide-and-seek.

178
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,521
So, how long do you plan
on hiding in there?

179
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:45,888
Forever.

180
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:47,388
Oh.

181
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:48,655
For-whaa?!

182
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:49,588
So then
are you??

183
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:51,455
That's how it is.

184
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:56,288
Closing the gateway means
I can never return to the
same time and space.

185
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:57,755
Whoa, hold it! Wait!

186
00:13:57,788 --> 00:14:00,255
Why do you have to make such
a radical move as that?!

187
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:02,921
You don't have to go
that far, do ya?!

188
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:05,988
Ichigo and others,
all of us have said
we'll protect you!

189
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:09,121
Are you sure this is
what you really want?

190
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:11,421
"What I want"?

191
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:14,921
Lots of good things will
happen if you keep on living!

192
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,055
Even I was able to
keep on living,
thanks to Ichigo!

193
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:25,988
Once I return and I
have retrieved Nozomi,

194
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:28,955
<i>not only the Soul Society but</i>
<i>also the World of the Living,</i>

195
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:31,921
will be forced to
exist under my control.

196
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:39,888
I have to. This is the only
way to stop his madness.

197
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:43,388
Nozomi...

198
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,721
Okay then!
You're right!

199
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:48,321
Uh?

200
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,255
If you're really that sure it'll
work, then I'll go with you!

201
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:53,355
What?!

202
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:58,421
Uh! It's not what you think!
I'm not going 'cause I'm
worried about you!

203
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:01,455
And I wasn't worried
you'd be lonely all
by yourself, either!

204
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,555
For me it's just a whim!

205
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:07,288
Y'know lately I've found
myself getting really
fed up with this world!

206
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:10,321
It might be nicer
to spend my life in
the Precipice World!

207
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:12,455
Huh? Whoa!

208
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:15,221
You'd do that?

209
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:19,655
Say! What's with you?
You wanna kiss me?

210
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:21,955
You don't hafta
thank me that much.

211
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:24,055
Hanh??!

212
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:28,255
Hey! What the hell?!
Untie me uou idiot!!

213
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,955
I'm going alone. Stupid!

214
00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:33,588
Who you callin' stupid,
ya cold-hearted weasel?!

215
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:38,855
But I do appreciate...
That you really care.

216
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:40,455
Huh?

217
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:43,788
Nozomi, wait!

218
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:54,788
Come on! Don't do it!
Hey! Nozomi!!

219
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:55,755
[gasp]

220
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:58,155
Stay here!!

221
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:02,688
Uh!

222
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:05,888
I got here just in time.

223
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,921
So were you about
to go somewhere?

224
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:08,721
[smack]

225
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:10,521
Reigai!

226
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,855
[Rukia]
We need you to stop making
your own decisions.

227
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:18,688
[Ikkaku]
Are you going to
take all of us on,
or just give up instead?

228
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:19,821
Agh!

229
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:22,255
How'd you find me?

230
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:23,955
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>You're asking us "how"?</i>

231
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:26,821
How naiÃ¯ve.

232
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:31,088
Were you really under the
impression you were the
only one who knew about the
existence of this Senkaimon?

233
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:35,521
You should realize that
whatever you know,
Kageroza knows as well.

234
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:36,855
Let me go!

235
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:38,888
It'd be better if
you came with us.

236
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:41,955
Hey you bastards!
You keep your hands
offa that girl!

237
00:16:42,155 --> 00:16:44,221
Bring it on!
I'll take on
all of ya!

238
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,055
What, are you too
scared of me?!

239
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:48,188
Well, it's time to go!

240
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,821
I don't want to go!
No way! Stoppit!

241
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,555
Hey! Don't
ignore me!

242
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:54,888
Don't make me go!

243
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,588
[Kon]
Hey, you rotten
bastards!

244
00:16:56,855 --> 00:16:59,121
No! I won't go!

245
00:16:59,155 --> 00:16:59,921
[Ichigo]
Oh yeah?

246
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:00,888
Huh?

247
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:02,388
So that's your choice!

248
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:03,821
Hm!?

249
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:19,655
Ichigo Kurosaki!

250
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:22,121
Why'd you come?

251
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:24,021
What the hell took
you so long?!

252
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:26,455
I was here putting
my butt on the line
for her big time!

253
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:28,688
And they were about to
take her away for good!

254
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:30,155
Shut up Kon!

255
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:32,921
So what's your
excuse for going off,
acting on your own?!

256
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:36,521
Since you were with her,
you could've at least
clued me into that.

257
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,588
You wanna know what's up,
then give me a cell phone,
you jerk!

258
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:42,755
Hand over Nozomi Kujo right now.

259
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:45,321
Not gonna happen!

260
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:49,888
There are six of us here...
and only one of you.

261
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:52,221
And you think you
can protect her?

262
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:53,488
That's two
of us!

263
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:55,121
Yes, I can.

264
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:56,321
Aw...

265
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:57,288
But why!?

266
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:00,788
Because you should do
what you want to do!

267
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:04,555
Enough talk.

268
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:07,421
We'll just take
her from you.
Like it or not.

269
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:09,921
Let's get this
over with quickly.

270
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:14,888
Huaaa!

271
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:23,888
Hnh?!

272
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,555
Damn those guys!

273
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:47,188
Hey, Nozomi!
Aren't you a Soul
Reaper as well?!

274
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:49,488
Don't you have a
Zanpakuto or something?!

275
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:50,821
I don't.

276
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:54,121
Agh! If ya had one,
we'd at least take
one of 'em out.

277
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:55,755
You sound worried.

278
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:58,788
If Ichigo were his usual self,
he could probably manage.

279
00:18:58,821 --> 00:18:59,888
But right now...

280
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:01,421
I mean, C'mon!

281
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:03,488
It's natural to worry about
your friends, isn't it?!

282
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:07,555
Natural to worry...
Do what I want.

283
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:11,021
Fighting in order to protect
your friends...

284
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,121
<i>Sacrificing.</i>

285
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:15,221
Damn you all!

286
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,121
What's the matter?
Your Spirit Energy
is winding down.

287
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:21,455
It's only a matter
of time now.

288
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:24,621
I have no choice.
Here goes nothin'!

289
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:28,121
But Ichigo! Your Soul Reaper
powers can't handle this!

290
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:31,221
Just shut up!
I'll make do with
what I've got!

291
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,355
Bankai!

292
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:39,355
[panting]

293
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:46,721
Don't you dare assume
that this is the end!

294
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,821
Brazo Izquierdo Del Diablo!

295
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:57,388
[gasp]

296
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:02,655
Huaah!

297
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:06,521
Damn it!

298
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:09,855
Hey! Way to break
through that attack!

299
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:12,955
It's my turn!
Hikotsu Taiho!

300
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:14,988
Rrrgh!

301
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:25,555
Well. We won, but I
don't feel too good
about what we did here.

302
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:29,021
Hey wait, Renji.
Just what is this thing?

303
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:34,455
That thing?
Let me see that.

304
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:38,021
This is no ordinary
Soul Candy!

305
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:43,755
Getsuga... tensho!!

306
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:53,721
[panting]

307
00:20:57,188 --> 00:21:00,188
You have won... Ichigo.

308
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:08,055
Ichigo!

309
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:10,988
Your Spirit Energy!
it could've...

310
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:13,621
Run out. What of it?

311
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:16,088
Hnh!
Nevermind, forget it!

312
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:20,621
You fought them all off
knowing that you'd risk losing
your Soul Reaper powers?

313
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:23,021
Why do that?

314
00:21:23,821 --> 00:21:25,488
Because I made
you a promise.

315
00:21:26,588 --> 00:21:27,688
A promise?

316
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,988
I swore I'd protect you.

317
00:21:36,855 --> 00:21:40,321
So don't even think about
trying to disappear into
the Precipice World.

318
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:42,821
Hmph!

319
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:45,955
You got that?

320
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:54,421
I got it.

321
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:55,755
Whaa?!?

322
00:21:56,288 --> 00:21:59,088
Ah! Hmm...

323
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:01,855
Huh?

324
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:02,855
[chuckle]

325
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:48,057
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Kon, you're a mess!</i>

326
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,857
<i>[Kon]</i>
<i>Hah! These battle scars</i>
<i>are my badges of honor!</i>

327
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,590
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Well they look awful,</i>
<i>not to mention dirty.</i>

328
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:56,190
<i>[Kon]</i>
<i>You can tell the intense</i>
<i>battle I went through, huh?</i>

329
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:58,057
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>It takes courage</i>
<i>just to touch you.</i>

330
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,924
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Guess I'll throw you</i>
<i>in a bucket of water.</i>

331
00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:01,290
<i>[Kon]</i>
<i>What am I, a towel?!</i>
