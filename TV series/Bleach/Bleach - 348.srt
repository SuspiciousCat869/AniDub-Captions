1
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,245
[Kugo]
Is your sister okay?

2
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:54,748
Yeah.

3
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,651
Why'd you come?

4
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,088
Look, don't get
the wrong idea.

5
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:02,489
Huh?

6
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,058
I didn't come 'cause
I feel like I owe you.

7
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:10,230
I want my power back
to protect people.

8
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,766
That's all. So let's do it.

9
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,604
Straight to the point, huh?

10
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,444
How did...?
It's my...

11
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:29,116
That's the symbol of your power, right?
Be sure to keep it safe.

12
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,153
Right.

13
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:41,028
And now here's your local weather
forecast for tonight and tomorrow.

14
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,230
Rain clouds covering
western Japan are bringing

15
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,265
intermittent showers
to the Shikoku region,

16
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,267
at about a half
an inch per hour.

17
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,503
This cloud cover will
continue in the Shikoku and

18
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,738
Kyushu region through at
least tomorrow evening.

19
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,573
[sigh] As a result, scattered
rain showers will continue

20
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,043
Yuzu, it's midnight.

21
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,310
So you going to bed?

22
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,281
No but you should.
I've got stuff to do.

23
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,649
Like what for instance?

24
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,154
It doesn't matter, but you can't stay
awake all night waiting for Ichigo.

25
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,689
I'll stay up
and handle him.

26
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,591
I'm telling you to go
to bed because you have

27
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,592
to cook in the morning
and go to school.

28
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,328
My staying up's got
nothing to do with Ichigo!

29
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,098
You think all I do
is worry about him!

30
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,667
Hey, it's okay for you
to worry about him.

31
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,270
He has been acting
strange lately,

32
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,472
and it's only natural
to worry when he comes

33
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,541
home so late a bunch
of nights in a row.

34
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,242
I said I'm not worried!

35
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,210
You are too!

36
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,445
I'm not! Now quit it!

37
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,213
What?!

38
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,181
[door opens]

39
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:34,715
Hnh?!

40
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,016
Huh?

41
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,551
[Ichigo]
I'm home!

42
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,487
- Hey there!
- Ichigo!

43
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,557
Oh wow, you're
both still up!

44
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,625
Uhh...

45
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,327
Get to bed or you'll never
wake up for school tomorrow!

46
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,131
Go on!

47
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,201
[both]
Uh! Sure!

48
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,037
[both]
Good night, Ichigo!

49
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,989
For the past week, I have been doing
everything that you asked me to do.

50
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:20,060
So, can you please explain to me
why the hell I'm back here again?

51
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,029
Even though you complain,
you still came in.

52
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:24,765
Thanks for that.

53
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,366
Shut up.

54
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,370
Heh. You want your Soul Reaper
powers back, don't you?

55
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,539
That's why I've shown up here.

56
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,208
I thought by now we'd be
starting some kind of

57
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,644
training-type thing at a
much bigger place than this.

58
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,147
[Riruka]
That's half right!

59
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,316
Tonight we're going to start
your training right here!

60
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,054
What're you
staring at?!

61
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,457
Uh. Nothing.

62
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,192
Here's a thought.

63
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,695
Maybe you should stop kicking the
door open when you come in here.

64
00:04:56,196 --> 00:05:00,400
I say that 'cause I don't enjoy having to
see your panties every time you do that.

65
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,002
Really?

66
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,504
Hey Yukio.

67
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,540
What makes you think you have
the right to be such a smart

68
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,375
ass and speak to me in that
manner all of the time?

69
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:11,678
I bet it's 'cuz you think you
can get away with saying

70
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,347
whatever you want, just
because we have a guest here!

71
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,516
Hey well guess again!

72
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,985
A creepy geek like you
who sits around doing

73
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,054
nothing but playing
video games all day

74
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,224
has no right to talk to me like
he's in any way an equal to me!

75
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:27,527
Ya got that, big mouth?!
I have never ever, then

76
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,297
or now, thought of you
and myself as equals!

77
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,968
Sorry, I missed that,
could you say that again?

78
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,336
Hnnggh!

79
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,405
Reeeally?

80
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,208
Yukio. What makes
you think you--

81
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,276
You don't have
to repeat it.

82
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,146
Don't touch
me, Jackie!

83
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,717
O-kay, just forget that and begin
explaining that box to Ichigo already.

84
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,055
Stop bugging me! You don't have to
tell me, I'm gonna explain it now!

85
00:05:55,755 --> 00:06:00,126
What're you just standing there for?! Get
over here so I can tell you about this!

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,697
Fine, sure. Are you going to tell
me about it by yelling at me?

87
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:05,565
[gasp]

88
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,534
Wait!!

89
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,736
Stop right there!
That's just fine.

90
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,539
Don't you come
another inch closer!

91
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,708
Hey, Make up
your mind.

92
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,283
See this box?

93
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,684
I see it.

94
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,585
Well?

95
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:26,720
Well what?

96
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,022
Isn't it cute?!

97
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:29,589
Huh?

98
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,192
You should
be thrilled!

99
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,562
This cute dollhouse is where you
will be doing your training.

100
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,567
What?

101
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,271
Don't ask questions,
I'll show you it soon!

102
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,273
Show me what?

103
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,741
My Fullbring power.

104
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,411
My Fullbring power is
called "Dollhouse"!

105
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:56,049
You see, my special ability is that
I'm able to move people or things

106
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,519
into and out of objects that
I love or I think are cute.

107
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,426
Eh?

108
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,163
That heart is your pass.

109
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,399
Okay, now you can go in.

110
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,467
Me, go in there?

111
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,404
Yes, I permit you to.

112
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:20,540
What're you--??

113
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,685
Oof!

114
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,486
Aagh. That hurt.

115
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,323
Damn! What the
hell just happened?

116
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,024
Hm?!

117
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,394
Hnh?!

118
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,534
You're kidding!

119
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,006
Well? Isn't it cute?

120
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:56,517
Yeah right, cute my ass!
What the hell is that?!

121
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:57,952
Defeat him!

122
00:07:58,419 --> 00:07:58,920
What?!

123
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:01,956
I'm saying, defeat
him by fighting him!

124
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:03,925
That's your training!

125
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:07,495
He's not strong, you can
take him, it'll be easy!

126
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:10,064
If you can use
Fullbring, that is!

127
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:11,366
What?!

128
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,701
Hwaaaagh!

129
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:16,404
Yaaaaa!

130
00:08:16,404 --> 00:08:16,906
Hunh?!

131
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,744
Yaaaagh!

132
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:26,514
Damn!

133
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:28,850
How pathetic!
Fight him!

134
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,753
Stop running away!
Act like a man!

135
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,521
I AM a man!

136
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:37,058
but I barely know what's going on and
you expect me to just fight this guy?!

137
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,994
Start by explaining
how I got so small!

138
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,097
Answer me will ya!

139
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:44,966
How in the hell did I get
shrunk down and end up

140
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:46,801
stuck in this toy doll
house with an angry pig?!

141
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:52,573
I told you. That's the power of my
Fullbring. My "Dollhouse" Fullbring.

142
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,644
Fullbring's the power of love.
It's a part of me.

143
00:08:58,379 --> 00:08:58,946
Love?!

144
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:04,018
It's my ability to draw out the maximum
power from something that I really love.

145
00:09:04,552 --> 00:09:08,923
For instance, a guy like Ginjo really
only likes that pendant of his.

146
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:11,926
So he turns that into a weapon
he can use when he fights.

147
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:13,961
But I'm not anything like him!

148
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:18,533
I have many things that I
love and cherish, and I

149
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,535
look forward to finding
even more things to love!

150
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:23,404
I'm positive that I'll continue
collecting things that I love,

151
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,707
and my greatest wish is that I'll
die smothered by those things!

152
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:30,077
My "Dollhouse" Fullbring
has endowed me with the

153
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:32,713
ability to give permission
to things that I love.

154
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:35,683
That way I can move them in and
out of my favorite objects!

155
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:37,985
That's what
just happened.

156
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:41,055
I gave you permission, inviting
you into my favorite dollhouse,

157
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:43,424
so you were transported
there and made to fit!

158
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,026
How nice for you.

159
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:48,062
Okay, that's enough
explaining for now!

160
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,932
I think it's about time
for you to defeat him.

161
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,667
Raaagh!

162
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,137
Why're you freaking out so
much in there? It's simple!

163
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:58,539
This is put together so
that you'll be able to

164
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:00,475
defeat him if you're
able to use Fullbring!

165
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,376
Go on,
give it a try!

166
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:04,779
You're totally nuts!

167
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,647
You're up there talking like
Fullbring is supposed to be

168
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,516
so easy that all I have to do
is try it to make it work!

169
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:10,351
Raaaagh!

170
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:11,652
I thought this was
supposed to be a training

171
00:10:11,686 --> 00:10:12,887
program to regain my
Soul Reaper powers?!

172
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:15,990
Why do you have me trying to use
Fullbring instead of what I know?!

173
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:18,726
You sure talk a lot!

174
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:22,930
Stop complaining and just
do as you're told, whiner!

175
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,399
You don't want to
get killed, do you?

176
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:26,901
Rrrgh! You suck!

177
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:30,671
Do you even hear yourself?
You sound like a dictator!

178
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,040
Yeeaaaggh!

179
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:37,712
Well! At least you're
getting better at dodging!

180
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,413
Shut up!

181
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,383
Help me out! At least
give me a clue here!

182
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,685
It's insane for you to
expect me to use Fullbring

183
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,988
without even giving me a
hint about how to use it!

184
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:48,656
"A hint"?!

185
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:52,593
All of us were able to use Fullbring
from the moment we were born!

186
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:55,396
So I wouldn't have any
clues or hints for you!

187
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,800
You must be really stupid or something.
Wake up, stupid!

188
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,135
What a damn mess!

189
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,938
Hey! That's enough
already, kid!

190
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:04,672
Huh!?

191
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,709
Stop your running away and start
fighting right now! C'mon!!

192
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:10,044
Huh!?

193
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:11,679
Wait, that thing
is talking?!!

194
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:15,850
Of course it talks! Inside of "Mr.
Pork" is this big

195
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,885
scary dude that I abducted
from this neighborhood!

196
00:11:18,486 --> 00:11:20,588
Wait, you abducted
who from where?!?

197
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:24,125
And did I just hear you say that
this thing's name is Mr. Pork?!

198
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,360
Where's the love in
a name like that?!

199
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,395
Hmph!

200
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,031
You just stay still now
and let me kill you!

201
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:33,668
Listen! If I don't beat you
to death within 15 minutes,

202
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:36,804
she told me that this spell I'm
under will become permanent,

203
00:11:36,804 --> 00:11:40,841
and I'll be stuck here for the rest
of my life as a ridiculous plushie!

204
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,511
So he wants to kill me
'cuz you told him a lie!??

205
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:45,846
My plushie isn't
rediculous!

206
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,848
Ow! Oh! Sorry!

207
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:50,718
Enough! That's all the advice
you get 'til you're done!

208
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:52,987
Give me a shout
when you finish.

209
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,523
Hey! Hold on,
that's not fair!!

210
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,958
Too bad!

211
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:59,660
Hey! Let me out
of here, damn it!

212
00:11:59,694 --> 00:12:00,628
Open the
lid again!

213
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:02,730
Hey. Think I'll
go have a snack!

214
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:05,466
Giriko, make me some tea!!

215
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:06,133
[screaming]

216
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,569
I want a nice hot
tea with milk!

217
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,772
The same kind they serve
over at Henri Dubois!

218
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,510
Will he
survive?

219
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:17,812
Who knows?

220
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:20,948
Stop running away!

221
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:23,351
Let me kill
you already!

222
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:27,488
Damn! I can't believe she's not letting
me out or giving me some any advice.

223
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,624
She acts like some
mean old witch.

224
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:37,064
I said stop! Hey!

225
00:12:37,064 --> 00:12:38,933
All of this running
won't get me anywhere.

226
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,568
I've got to think
of something quick!

227
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:44,572
Fullbring's the power of love!
It's a part of me.

228
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,608
She said "It's the
ability to draw out the

229
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:49,744
maximum power from
something a person loves"

230
00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:53,547
But it didn't seem to me like Ginjo
"loves" that pendant he wears.

231
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:55,983
If I had to describe
how he feels about it,

232
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,119
I'd say it was more he
was "attached" to it.

233
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:01,789
Which means that for me to
be able to use Fullbring,

234
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,425
I need an object that I feel
as attached to, as he does.

235
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:06,894
There's gotta be something
like that for me.

236
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:21,042
If you're so worried,
why don't you help him out?

237
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:22,810
Pfffff!

238
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:26,881
I! I am not
worried at all!

239
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:27,748
Fine then.

240
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:32,420
Hey, I mean come on, if he goes and gets
killed that easily, he wasn't the one!!

241
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:33,521
Know what I'm sayin?

242
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:36,424
But Riruka,
are you really sure?

243
00:13:36,457 --> 00:13:38,359
That plushie has
a timer, right?

244
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:41,529
It's going to be
15 minutes soon.

245
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:53,841
Thank you so much for doing
the shopping, Mr. Chad.

246
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:54,909
Sure.

247
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,079
What's that?

248
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:00,014
[gasp]

249
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:01,649
This is crazy!

250
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,051
You didn't already start with his
Fullbring training did you?!

251
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:05,786
What do you
mean "already"?

252
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:07,755
Well of course I
got him started!

253
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:10,725
Don't tell me you're
criticizing my methods too?

254
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:13,060
Graaaaahhh!

255
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:14,929
Let me kill you!!

256
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:18,499
Think! There's got
to be something!

257
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,533
[gasp]

258
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:22,737
Hey!

259
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,538
[Chad]
Ichigo! Your Combat Pass!

260
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:27,141
Stop that Chad! What the
hell are you doing?!

261
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:30,911
You have to learn how to use Fullbring
in order to survive this fight, Ichigo,

262
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:33,614
so your Combat Pass is the
only chance you've got!

263
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:37,885
Thanks Chad! I was just having
the same exact thought!

264
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,854
[buzz]

265
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:42,389
[female announcer]
Time is up.

266
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:44,558
As predetermined earlier,
since use of Fullbring

267
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,761
was not detected within
the 15 minutes allotted,

268
00:14:46,794 --> 00:14:49,663
"Crazy Beast Mode"
will now be activated.

269
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:52,066
Ah! Please!
Don't do it!

270
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:57,071
Brrlblblbgghln!

271
00:14:57,071 --> 00:15:01,008
This is... cruel!
Don't!

272
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:07,381
Huh?! What the
hell's this?

273
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,791
Oh. It appears that the
timer has been activated.

274
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,477
[menacing breathing]

275
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,948
[roar]

276
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:47,062
Hey!

277
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,465
You didn't tell me he was
going to become that hideous!

278
00:15:50,465 --> 00:15:52,768
Just what were you
thinking, Giriko?!

279
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:55,337
My, my.

280
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:59,241
You were the one who requested
my assistance in the training

281
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:02,744
of Mr. Ichigo, Miss Riruka,
and I did as you asked.

282
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,479
That's true, but...!

283
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,782
You didn't have to
make it so ugly!

284
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,917
there must've been other
ways you could've chosen!

285
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:13,255
Well. I couldn't think of
any other permutations.

286
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:14,489
Seriously?!

287
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,457
Riruka!

288
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,158
Huh?

289
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:18,794
Let Ichigo out of
this box right now!

290
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:22,397
No, you mustn't.

291
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:23,498
Huh?

292
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:25,834
As was the case
with the plushie,

293
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:28,303
that box possesses a
timer on it as well.

294
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:32,274
If the organism inside can
survive for 30 minutes,

295
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:35,444
then said organism will be
allowed to exit the box.

296
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:36,478
Clear?

297
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:38,080
And where'd that
condition come from?!

298
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:42,784
You did leave the conditional
restrictions up to me as well.

299
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,052
Agh!

300
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:49,024
Removing Mr. Ichigo from the box now
would be a violation of the terms.

301
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:53,395
If you were to do that, the God
of time will seek retribution.

302
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:55,464
"God of time"?

303
00:16:56,431 --> 00:17:00,168
I believe that this is the first
mention that I've made of it.

304
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:06,208
The timer is set in such a way, that in the
event of a breach in its time requirements,

305
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:11,380
all objects being timed will be immediately
burned away by the Flame of Time,

306
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:14,816
until there is no trace left
of the offending objects.

307
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:16,852
You're lying!

308
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:20,188
Well you can choose
to believe me or not.

309
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:24,359
[Riruka]
It's not a bluff.

310
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:27,396
I've seen it
happen many times.

311
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,209
It seems you're
convinced.

312
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:44,913
But allow me to repeat the
restriction involved in this matter.

313
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:49,084
If, either Mr. Ichigo or Mr.
Pork are removed from the

314
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:52,454
box by anyone before another
15 minutes have elapsed,

315
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:58,927
All three objects involved, by that I
mean Mr. Pork, Mr. Ichigo, and the box,

316
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,797
will be completely consumed
by the Flame of Time.

317
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:08,804
That, you see, is my Fullbring.
"Time Tells No Lies."

318
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,273
Deactivate it!

319
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:14,810
Impossible.

320
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:18,480
Once Time Tells No Lies is set,

321
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:24,186
even myself, who controls its power,
cannot undo its time parameters.

322
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:28,490
So a mistake in setting the
terms, can lead to death.

323
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,127
Don't ever take
time so lightly.

324
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,831
Meddling with time is a
frightening proposition

325
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:38,367
that certainly should be
avoided at all costs.

326
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:41,069
[ring]

327
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,504
Oh my.

328
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,208
It seems the next pot of
tea is brewed and ready.

329
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:49,311
Would you care for
another cup, Miss Riruka?

330
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:55,183
Ah. A wonderful smell.

331
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:59,187
God and all that is important
dwells in exact time.

332
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,025
[roar]

333
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,409
[growl]

334
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:26,181
Raaugghhh!

335
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,359
Now what do I do?!

336
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,164
I need to manifest this Fullbring
thing using my Combat Pass.

337
00:19:43,331 --> 00:19:45,066
But how do I do it?

338
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:48,336
What did he say again?

339
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:53,308
Our special ability is
to draw out the "soul"

340
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:56,445
in any object, and to
put that object to use.

341
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:01,082
So, I have to draw out the
soul of my Combat Pass.

342
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,052
Damn! How am I
going to do that?!

343
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,454
How?!

344
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:10,492
Use your pride!

345
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:12,994
Hunh?!

346
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:17,766
When I first used Brazo
Derecho Del Gigante,

347
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:20,502
I had pride in my heart.
A whole lot of it.

348
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,839
The material that forms the
basis for my Fullbring

349
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,074
is the skin that I have
on both of my arms!

350
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:27,275
Your skin?

351
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,347
My skin has always been darker,
because I have Mestizo blood in me!

352
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:36,084
My appearance, the size
of my body, those things

353
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:38,453
caused me a lot of rough
times in my life!

354
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:42,424
But I never lost the pride I had
in my skin's color or in myself!

355
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:44,493
I was able
to be proud,

356
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:47,195
because of my Abuelo!

357
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,267
He's the one who gave me the strength
to always have pride in myself!

358
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:59,040
Think back Ichigo!

359
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:03,011
Remember those times when you had all
that pride in your Soul Reaper powers!

360
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,083
That Combat Pass will respond to
what you possess in your heart!

361
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,886
Think back to then! Do it!

362
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,057
The moment I was proud of
my Soul Reaper powers?

363
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,193
Think back.

364
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:44,085
Everything.

365
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:50,792
I was proud at every moment!

366
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,928
[gasp]

367
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:53,699
Hnh?!

368
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:54,262
Ah!

369
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:49,526
[Mr. Pork] If I lose this fight, I'll be
stuck like this for the rest of my life!

370
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,861
[Ichigo] Relax. You'll
turn back to normal.

371
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:53,363
[Mr. Pork] I swear that
chick is an evil witch!

372
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,399
I'm going to be stuck
looking like this until I

373
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:57,367
get a kiss from some lady
who knows true love.

374
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:58,669
That'll break this spell!

375
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:00,170
[Ichigo] Good luck
with that, porkface!
