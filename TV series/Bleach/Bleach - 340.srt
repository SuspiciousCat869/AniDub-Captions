1
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,643
Seethe, Sumitsukigasa!

2
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:02,227
Yaah!

3
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:04,798
Huaah!

4
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,977
[Rukia]
I expect you're now planning to
use your newly acquired power
to rule the Soul Society.

5
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,416
Rule?! Psh!

6
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,188
How could you
possibly think that's
what I really want?

7
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:20,263
My objective is to
destroy the Soul Society.

8
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:22,901
[gasp] Destroy?!

9
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:25,907
Time is of the essence.

10
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:29,949
Now die.

11
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,687
[gasp]

12
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:38,399
[Rukia]
Ichigo!!

13
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:08,259
[gasp]

14
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:09,662
[small gasp]

15
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:11,666
Ichigo!

16
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,671
His Hollowfication!
It's been reversed!

17
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:32,408
[Rukia]
Ichigo! Are you all right?

18
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:33,510
[Ichigo]
Rukia?

19
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:35,881
Ah! Impossible!

20
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:37,318
What just happened?!

21
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:38,787
Rrgh!

22
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:41,426
[Orihime]
Ichigo!

23
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:45,768
Orihime! You need to
take Ichigo and get him
away from here now.

24
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:48,707
No, Rukia, I can't
leave you guys alone.

25
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:50,044
[Rukia]
What are you talking about?

26
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:53,951
Nozomi's still
inside of him.

27
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:08,713
Right at that moment,
my consciousness seemed
to go completely blank.

28
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,084
Ugh!

29
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:10,752
[beep]

30
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,854
It's me.

31
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:13,758
What is it, sir?

32
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,764
I need more fusion stabilizer.
Prepare it immediately.

33
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:18,935
I'll get on it right away.

34
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:21,473
Hmf.

35
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:25,682
Fusion stabilizer?
Did you hear that, Ichigo?

36
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:28,521
It looks like his
fusion might not
be permanent yet.

37
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:29,455
I think you're right.

38
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:37,973
Substitute Soul Reaper.
I can see that ignoring
you before was a mistake.

39
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:42,782
Although your Spirit Energy
has left you, I can no
longer allow you to live.

40
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:45,488
[gasp]

41
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:48,026
Renji! Uryu! Chad!

42
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:50,798
All of you, step aside, at once!

43
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:52,569
Sorry pal.

44
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:54,773
In case you haven't
noticed, we don't take
orders from an enemy,

45
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:56,777
So go ahead and take
your best shot.

46
00:04:57,512 --> 00:05:00,652
If you want to kill Ichigo,
you're going to have to go
through us.

47
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:02,756
He's been our friend
for a long time,

48
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:05,495
and we're not going to hand him
over to you without a fight.

49
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,732
A friend, you say?

50
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:14,413
Ridiculous.

51
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:19,923
[Ouko]
You're fools if you're
willing to spill your own
blood for the sake of others.

52
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:23,899
If friends are defined
by the commission of a
worthless sacrifice,

53
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,972
Then you all will
have to pay the price!

54
00:05:34,152 --> 00:05:35,021
Byakuya!

55
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:38,594
Close, but no cigar!

56
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:40,733
Are you okay?

57
00:05:42,737 --> 00:05:43,739
Hyaah!

58
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,114
[Shunsui]
Hado Number Sixty-Three!
Raikoho!

59
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,518
[Toshiro]
Yaaahhh!

60
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,761
They're certainly
keeping the pressure on.

61
00:05:54,794 --> 00:05:58,635
Byakuya! Why did
you take such a
risk to protect me?

62
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:02,943
Heh.

63
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:05,649
[Toshiro]
Damn! They have
us surrounded!

64
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:08,020
This is bad!
There's no way out!

65
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:10,826
You need to go heal
Captain Kuchiki!

66
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:12,430
[Yumichika]
You're going nowhere!

67
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:17,072
They're taking advantage of
every opportunity to hit us
while we're down!

68
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:21,848
Their strategy is to keep us
off-balance while they swoop
in and out at will.

69
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,123
If one of us is injured and
not reacting quickly,
that's the one they attack.

70
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:29,464
We're completely surrounded.
We have no advantage!

71
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:31,134
[Kenpachi]
Are you all just
gonna stand there?

72
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:36,745
What's the big deal?

73
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:39,517
All we need to do is
kill off these guys,
one by one!

74
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:43,125
That's what the Reigai
are trying to do to us!
Kill us off, one by one!

75
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:46,731
Details, details!
I'm gonna do them
before they do me!

76
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,101
I agree!

77
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:51,808
Ha ha ha ha!

78
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:53,245
Rwwaah!

79
00:06:57,153 --> 00:06:57,753
Hyaa!

80
00:06:57,753 --> 00:06:58,655
Auggh!

81
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,243
[Yoruichi]
What should we do?

82
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:12,651
We're outnumbered, and if
we lose even one member,

83
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:15,589
they're going to use that
opportunity to take us all out.

84
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:18,562
[Shunsui]
I have to agree.
This looks pretty bad.

85
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:21,534
Even one small mistake could
get us completely annihilated.

86
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,820
It's useless!
Seethe, Sumitsukigasa!

87
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,191
El Directo!

88
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:36,130
Tsuginomai!
Hakuren!

89
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:42,076
[gasps]

90
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,048
Haa!

91
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:49,691
Hihio!
Zabimaru!

92
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:51,795
[snicker]

93
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:55,737
[gasp]

94
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:57,307
Eagh!

95
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,815
That was careless of me.

96
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,790
I should have taken
better precautions to
avoid getting injured
by your weapon.

97
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:10,633
[Ouko]
As I recall, it weakens
the bonds between Reishi.

98
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,781
Exactly. This may surprise
you, but you're not the only
one who can absorb Reishi.

99
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:23,793
How interesting. So you plan
to challenge me by attempting
to absorb my Reishi?

100
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:25,965
We plan to do more
than challenge you.

101
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:31,241
[Uryu]
You obviously underestimate
the power of my friends, which
will become your downfall.

102
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:33,780
What's your play, Quincy?

103
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,751
You'll see soon enough.

104
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:41,595
Yah!

105
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:45,269
[Chad]
Rrraagh!

106
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:48,009
Pathetic!

107
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:48,977
Huh?

108
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,121
Haaaa!

109
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:55,958
What the hell?!

110
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,897
Bakudo Number Four!
Hainawa!

111
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:01,670
Aah!

112
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:03,239
Agh!

113
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,009
Uryu, do it now!

114
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:10,688
That's it. You can
no longer escape.

115
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:14,295
Let's see which one
of us will be left
standing, my friend!

116
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:15,898
Heh!

117
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:19,037
What the--?!

118
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:20,374
[Renji, Chad and Rukia]
Augh! Argh! Uugh!

119
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:24,816
I had anticipated this attack.

120
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:30,059
You're able to create a
containment field by placing
your weapons in five corners.

121
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:35,170
To activate the technique,
it must consume the Reishi
stored within its hilt.

122
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:38,710
You created the containment
as you attacked me.

123
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,251
But you were so intent
on your maneuver as you
were pulling it off,

124
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:47,128
that you failed to notice that
I used Sumitsukigasa to absorb
the Reishi you had stored.

125
00:09:47,661 --> 00:09:49,867
That's how I neutralized
your attack.

126
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:54,075
Not knowing that, you
ended up sacrificing
your own allies.

127
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:59,787
Before the awesome power that
I possess, your so-called
friendship holds no meaning!

128
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:02,291
[Uryu]
I figured you'd
think that way.

129
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:03,026
Huh?

130
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:11,409
I knew that you'd see through
my Sprenger attack, and that
you'd absorb the Reishi from my
Seeleschneider. However...

131
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:12,779
[gasp]

132
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:14,465
Huh?

133
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:18,689
Kageroza! It's over!

134
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:29,376
Huaaah!

135
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:38,194
Wuaaaahhh!

136
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:39,898
Stop--- No!

137
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,100
[Uryu]
Don't worry, Ichigo.

138
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:45,977
We're going to imprison
him like this without
triggering the explosion.

139
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:51,388
If we can continue to drain
the Spirit Energy from the
wound on his back where the
Reishi bond was weakened,

140
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:54,761
we should be able to undo
his fusion with Nozomi.

141
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:57,934
Don't underestimate me!

142
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:00,273
Hajokuri!

143
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:12,297
Wha--? What the
hell is that?!

144
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:28,863
It's swallowing
Sprenger's Reishi!
How is that even possible?!

145
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,001
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

146
00:11:34,341 --> 00:11:40,019
My Hajokuri technique
turns everything around
it into Reishi and
proceeds to absorb it!

147
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:41,088
And then...!

148
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:46,833
Yah!

149
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:54,180
Now die!
Substitute Soul Reaper!

150
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,188
Damnit!

151
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:02,831
Dgh!
EYAAAHHH!

152
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:16,325
The Reigai cannot
attack us right now.

153
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:19,799
Really? And why is that?

154
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,038
Because we're all keeping
a tight formation.

155
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:26,879
They can't use a strategy
of switching off on
opponents to disrupt us.

156
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:28,817
Huh?

157
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:36,499
After watching them operate,
I don't think any of them will
risk sacrificing themselves
to break our formation.

158
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:37,301
Rgh.

159
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:39,071
Huh.

160
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:44,115
I see. Earlier you threw
yourself at them so you
could test your theory.

161
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:47,254
[Kenpachi]
Yaaah!

162
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:47,989
Huh?

163
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:49,158
Raagh!

164
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:50,995
Heh heh!

165
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:52,131
Hm.

166
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,602
[Toshiro]
You sure you want to do that?

167
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:57,107
[Toshiro]
If one or more of
you leave here,

168
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,919
What do you think
will happen, once our
side outnumbers yours?

169
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:03,988
[gasp]

170
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:06,058
Now this is interesting.

171
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,866
Whaddya say we have
a test of wills?

172
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:13,273
Dammit!

173
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:15,511
Agh!

174
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,383
Yaaaaagh!

175
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,926
What happened?

176
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,967
[in pain]
Urgh...Agh!

177
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:32,144
What's going on?
He's acting very strange.

178
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,416
Get out of there! Stop it!

179
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:37,120
[both]
Get out of my head!

180
00:13:37,154 --> 00:13:38,156
Nozomi!

181
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:42,030
What is it? Is the fusion
starting to break down?

182
00:13:43,132 --> 00:13:45,171
[Rukia]
Stop it! Stop what
you're doing!

183
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,179
Nozomi!

184
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,348
[gasp]

185
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:52,919
Ichigo!

186
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:55,358
I'm right here!
I'll get you
out of there!

187
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,132
Don't let that bastard
Kageroza swallow you!

188
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:03,007
Ichigo... Please...

189
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,582
You have to kill me!

190
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,619
Wha?? What are you
talking about?

191
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:13,294
The Zanpakuto he's using
is able to kill him!

192
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:17,970
But you have to do it
quickly, while I hold
him at bay! Hurry!

193
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:19,940
I can't do that!
I won't let you die!

194
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:22,612
Please! I'm begging you!

195
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,380
[gasp]

196
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:26,186
You all risked your
lives to protect me.

197
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:30,328
But now, It's my turn
to protect all of you!

198
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:32,432
[conflicted gasp]

199
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,318
No, I won't!
We're friends, Nozomi!

200
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,324
We'll find a way to save you!
I swear!

201
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:47,428
Heh!

202
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:48,104
[gasp]

203
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:50,166
Hah!

204
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:51,737
Renji!

205
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,540
[straining]

206
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:55,511
Ichigo!
I need you to get back!

207
00:14:57,515 --> 00:14:59,452
Out of my way, you fools!

208
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:01,155
Yaah!

209
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:02,224
Ungh!

210
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:03,460
Urgh...

211
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:05,664
Oof!

212
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,237
Rukia! Renji!

213
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:11,041
Friends, you say?

214
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,018
Tell me something,
Substitute Soul Reaper...

215
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,694
Because I don't understand.
Why do you people keep
using that word?

216
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:26,673
Why do you always cling to
that one word when your
backs are against the wall?

217
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:31,616
Answer me!

218
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:36,259
[Byakuya]
Why have you chosen
this particular way to fight?

219
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,528
What?

220
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:41,203
Why do you choose
to separate us?

221
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,375
And then attack the one you've
separated from the others?

222
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:49,519
I understand it as a tactic,
but it doesn't seem like a
choice you would make,

223
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:52,225
since you should possess
the same pride that we do.

224
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:55,564
To distrust others, loathe
the fellow allies around you,

225
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:58,136
and consider isolation a virtue.

226
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:02,111
That has to be the true
nature of Kageroza.

227
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:04,215
[Ouko]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

228
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:07,589
What's wrong?
Cat got your tongue?
Ha ha ha ha ha!

229
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:09,560
Ichigo! Ngh!

230
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:11,396
Ichigo!

231
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:15,170
See? Friends are meaningless!

232
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:20,047
A solitary life is the only
true validation of existence!

233
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:24,823
I organized my invading army
without help from anyone.

234
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:31,202
I empowered that force, and it
is now about to annihilate the
Thirteen Court Guard Squads.

235
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:34,142
The same group that
refused to give me my due.

236
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:37,616
And by resurrecting
myself as a Mod Soul,

237
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:41,357
I was able to harness the
true power of my Zanpakuto,

238
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,064
a power that I could not
control in my original form.

239
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:51,544
This is truly the ideal
existence of solitude
that I have strived for!

240
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:56,153
Ha ha ha ha ha!

241
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,593
You're so pathetic!

242
00:17:00,662 --> 00:17:01,230
Huh?

243
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:04,770
Didn't you realize something
when you were doing this?

244
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:09,179
The essence of a Mod Soul is
based on a Soul Reaper's Reishi.

245
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,454
And that means you were unable
to create them all by yourself.

246
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:16,093
And besides, you wouldn't
have been able to wield

247
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:19,768
your true powerwithout Nozomi,
from whom you cut yourself off!

248
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:22,406
You just proved your
assumption was wrong!

249
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,876
The fact of the matter is,

250
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,349
you couldn't have done
a thing without drawing
from those around you!

251
00:17:27,684 --> 00:17:28,584
[gasp]

252
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:31,257
Here's a lesson
for you!

253
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,597
No matter how hard we try,
we can't do everything all
on our own!

254
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:37,202
And refusing to
acknowledge that fact,

255
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:39,541
makes you nothing
but a damn fool!

256
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:41,645
Rrr... [gasp]

257
00:17:42,914 --> 00:17:46,922
You're saying that
Kageroza's personality
is affecting our style
of fighting?

258
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,661
You're not going to
break our solidarity.

259
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:53,602
Certainly not by
employing the tactics
you've apparently chosen.

260
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:55,339
Shut up!

261
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,708
Ungh!

262
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,683
[shaken] Rrrrnnh!

263
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:02,420
Rrgh!

264
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,222
[gasp]

265
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:08,198
[seething]

266
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:17,183
Nemu! Damn it!

267
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,252
Agh!

268
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:22,860
I'll put off eliminating you
for just a moment.

269
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:29,307
You can watch as Nozomi
completely becomes mine.

270
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:34,184
Then you can die in agony.

271
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:38,492
[gasp]

272
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:39,829
Uhn!

273
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:46,341
[Ouko]
You! What is the
meaning of this?!

274
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:49,547
Hmpf!

275
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:51,484
[Kon]
It means you've
been punked!

276
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:53,322
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

277
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:55,226
That voice
sounds like Kon!

278
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:57,764
You stupid dummy!
You fell for it,
didn't you?!

279
00:18:58,498 --> 00:18:59,869
What do you say
to that, genius?

280
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:02,440
Why don't you just
kiss my ass and scram!

281
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:09,655
Get back in there!
You're creeping us out!

282
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:11,492
Mmmf!

283
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,431
That...feels...
good...Really.

284
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:18,272
You little rat!
How were you
able to do that?

285
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,644
So, You really want to know?

286
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:23,583
Okay, how did it go again?

287
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:28,693
[Kisuke]
Well it all started with
Mayuri liquefying his body

288
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:31,899
to fake his own death so he
could seek out Kageroza's lab,

289
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:34,772
where he ended up helping
me defeat my imposter.

290
00:19:34,772 --> 00:19:39,715
Then we decided to remove
the Soul Candy from
Lieutenant Nemu's Reigai
and replace it with Kon's,

291
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:41,819
and voila! The rest is history!

292
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:44,758
Got it? That's what
Clog-Dude said!

293
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,297
So you have me to
thank for everything!

294
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:48,533
Thank you
for what?!

295
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:50,270
You didn't
really do
anything!

296
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:51,739
What?! Oh yes, I did!

297
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,643
You see this?

298
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,417
This is a Mod Soul!
With your Spirit Energy!

299
00:19:57,617 --> 00:19:58,553
Swallow it!

300
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:00,323
[gulp]

301
00:20:01,025 --> 00:20:01,860
[gasp]

302
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:25,040
I kept my promise to you,
Ichigo! Now get out there
and save Nozomi!

303
00:20:28,446 --> 00:20:30,618
Heh! Yeah, you got it, Kon!

304
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:35,494
Rrrgh! You sorry
excuse for a Mod Soul!

305
00:20:36,963 --> 00:20:39,736
Oh yeah? I'm better than
the ones you created!

306
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,940
Yours are just slaves,
doing your bidding!

307
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:43,610
At least I have
some free will!

308
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:45,981
Don't give them an
opening to move in.

309
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:47,618
Yeah, I'm well aware.

310
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,324
We're wise to any
moves that they make!

311
00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:55,734
What is it with you guys?
I told you to keep
out of this!

312
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:57,538
Sorry about
that, Captain.

313
00:20:57,872 --> 00:20:59,876
This could well be
our last battle!

314
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:01,947
We'd be privileged
to die with you.

315
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:04,719
He's right, it would
be a great honor.

316
00:21:04,752 --> 00:21:06,623
If you don't mind.

317
00:21:06,623 --> 00:21:10,097
What? Hah! Fine, whatever!

318
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:15,741
In fact, I guess it wouldn't
be such a bad thing, to have
someone covering my back!

319
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,881
[Toshiro]
Hmf, You guys, working
together in battle?

320
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:20,952
Now that is really
out of character!

321
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:28,066
You're wrong. When it comes
to protecting what we must,
we'll use any means necessary!

322
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:32,843
Protecting what you must?
Are you referring to your pride?

323
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,550
No. We have but one
thing we protect.

324
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:39,722
And that is the Soul Society.

325
00:21:42,495 --> 00:21:44,566
Hang on, Nozomi. I promise you,

326
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:48,140
you're not alone now, and
you'll never be alone again.

327
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:53,417
And this time, we're not
going to let anyone stop
us from saving you!

328
00:21:56,757 --> 00:21:59,663
We'll teach this bastard a
lesson he'll never forget!

329
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:02,401
The power of friendship!

330
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,142
Go get him, Ichigo!

331
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:08,481
Ban kai!

332
00:23:46,778 --> 00:23:48,130
[Rukia]
Good job, Kon.

333
00:23:48,164 --> 00:23:50,499
[Orihime]
But weren't you scared?

334
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:53,736
[Kon]
It didn't even occur to me!
All I could think about was
saving the two of you!

335
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:55,638
[Orihime]
That's amazing!

336
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:57,706
[Rukia]
Truthfully, though,
you had to have been
a little scared.

337
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,243
[Kon]
I don't know the meaning
of the word! Hey, what is
the meaning of the word?
