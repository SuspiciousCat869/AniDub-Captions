00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:50,343
[crying]

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,681
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): The
dirt and depression

4
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:54,481
of the Rukon District
hasn't changed at all.

5
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:06,748
Hm?

6
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:11,914
[coughing] Huh?

7
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:19,514
-Huh?

8
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:21,614
Well, well.

9
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:23,181
-It can't be.

10
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:26,648
-It's you again.

11
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:27,248
What a coincidence.

12
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:33,881
This'll be fun.

13
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:34,681
[inaudible] Nieder.

14
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:52,614
Let's go.

15
00:02:52,648 --> 00:02:53,406
Ha!

16
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:00,648
Hmph.

17
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:04,848
What's this?

18
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:06,181
You don't even have a zanpakuto?

19
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:10,581
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
She's much stronger

20
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:12,548
than she was the last
time I faced her.

21
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:18,648
-It's one of the Bounts!

22
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:20,081
Rukia.

23
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:23,514
But you can't beat her
without a zanpakuto.

24
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:24,306
-Huh?

25
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:34,881
Hmph.

26
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:35,814
Worthless trash.

27
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:43,648
From what I heard, Mabashi
had no trouble making you

28
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,748
into his personal plaything.

29
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:00,514
-You certainly are cute.

30
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:02,548
It's making me excited.

31
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:05,714
[laughter]

32
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:06,214
-Shut up!

33
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:15,648
-Yeah?

34
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:17,014
So you want a fight?

35
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:17,914
-Oh, my, my.

36
00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:20,248
Do you mean another fight?

37
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:23,814
And I was right in the
middle of my tea time.

38
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:26,148
-And I remember distinctly
telling you never

39
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:29,548
to call for me when I'm
in the middle of my nap.

40
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:32,248
-Quit complaining, and
just follow orders.

41
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,514
I've got work to do.

42
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:44,914
-Rukia.

43
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:46,114
You fool.

44
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:47,614
How could you have
let yourself get

45
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:49,081
talked into this by a Bount?

46
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:51,481
Never let your
emotions rule you.

47
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:53,114
And what could you
possibly do now

48
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:56,648
with that old piece
of garbage sword?

49
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:58,248
-Are you just going
to stand there?

50
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:04,748
-Then you won't mind if I go.

51
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:06,214
-It's starting!

52
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:09,181
-I guess I'm going in.

53
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:09,663
Oh!

54
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:10,648
She got me!

55
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:19,014
-I'll take care of you.

56
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:25,740
-Ha!

57
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:33,148
How could-- Whoa!

58
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:39,781
-Oh!

59
00:05:39,814 --> 00:05:40,748
Rukia, get up!

60
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:42,048
Get up and run away!

61
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:43,748
I've been trying
to tell you, you're

62
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:45,881
no match for her in
the state you're in!

63
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:47,181
Why won't you just run?

64
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:53,481
-Don't you understand?

65
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:56,681
You cannot defeat me.

66
00:05:56,714 --> 00:06:01,614
I doubt that you'll even
be able to touch me.

67
00:06:01,648 --> 00:06:04,914
[laughter]

68
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,948
-Those who underestimate
me will pay the price!

69
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:10,248
-What a clever little
saying that is.

70
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:12,814
Let's go ahead and prove
it wrong, shall we?

71
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:13,781
-Beautifully.

72
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:16,481
And with flawless technique.

73
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:17,148
Now let's torment her.

74
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:37,148
-Oh!

75
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:38,681
No!

76
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:40,148
I can't just stand here
and watch this happen!

77
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:44,183
-Huh?

78
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:47,696
What?

79
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:54,881
-Come on, Rukia.

80
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,181
Why are you just standing there?

81
00:06:56,214 --> 00:06:58,848
Hurry up and defeat her
while you have the chance!

82
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,948
I can't keep this up
forever, you know.

83
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:01,658
-Ririn.

84
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:06,614
All right.

85
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:09,581
The one who reigns, mask
of flesh, all creation,

86
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:12,548
flap of wings, the one who
carries the title of human!

87
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:14,648
In the name of truth
and temperance,

88
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:17,881
dig your claws into the
wall of sinless dreams!

89
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:19,848
Hado 33, Sokatsui!

90
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:25,748
[scream]

91
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:26,781
-Ah!

92
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,748
Why didn't you defend yourself?

93
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,948
-You're still not worthy.

94
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:45,048
-Why's she raising
her arm like that?

95
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,548
Does that mean
she's surrendering?

96
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:50,481
-Is she--

97
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:03,214
[shout]

98
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:06,581
-Could she be absorbing reishi?

99
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:10,781
-If she's absorbing reishi,
she'll turn into a monster!

100
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:11,914
-Ririn--

101
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:13,081
-You've gotta run
away now, Rukia!

102
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:19,514
-Ha ha ha ha ha!

103
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:23,048
This taste, no matter how
many times I taste it,

104
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:25,248
I can't get enough!

105
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,181
Ha ha ha ha!

106
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,148
-Come on, Rukia.

107
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:28,548
We've gotta get out of here.

108
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:29,981
This way.

109
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:31,614
-Was that on purpose?

110
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:34,614
-It would seem you
have a deathwish.

111
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,114
-Argh!

112
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,081
-Look out!

113
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:48,014
-Witness the result
of my life's devotion.

114
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:17,848
-Rukia!

115
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:47,214
-There you are.

116
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:48,914
There's no use running from me.

117
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:50,514
You should have
learned that by now!

118
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:55,581
Was that an illusion?

119
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:57,148
Huh?

120
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,881
-Ah!

121
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:01,614
-That was your
handiwork, wasn't it?

122
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:03,248
I must admit, it's
impressive that you

123
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:05,681
were able to trick
me with that twice.

124
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:08,681
-Please don't kill me.

125
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:09,881
-No?

126
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:11,881
Then what exactly do
you want me to do?

127
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:15,848
Do you want me to let her
escape, and fight you instead?

128
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,214
Huh?

129
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:20,881
Do you think that's
a good decision?

130
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,881
-I don't remember
saying that, exactly.

131
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:29,048
-I'm gonna turn you--

132
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:32,214
-You're going to be
sorry you attacked Ririn!

133
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:34,048
Hado number four!

134
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:34,548
Byakurai!

135
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:47,048
-Rukia!

136
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,714
-You saved us by distracting her
long enough for me to counter

137
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:50,581
attack.

138
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:51,514
-No problem.

139
00:10:51,548 --> 00:10:55,481
[laughter]

140
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:57,248
-You're both slow
learners, aren't you?

141
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:07,814
The real fun is just beginning.

142
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:13,114
-She really is a monster.

143
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:15,514
And an incredibly dangerous one.

144
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:16,681
Come on, Ichigo.

145
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:17,948
You've gotta save both of us.

146
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:31,410
-After conducting
extensive research

147
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:33,243
into old historical
documents that

148
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,443
were provided to us
by the Kuchiki clan,

149
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:37,810
there is a fair amount
of new information

150
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:39,210
that I can report to you.

151
00:11:39,243 --> 00:11:40,476
-Oh?

152
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,410
-At one time there was a series
of experiments conducted here

153
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:45,843
in the Seireitei, the very
nature of which would now

154
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:48,176
be strictly prohibited.

155
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,176
These events occurred long
before the establishment

156
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,110
of our Department of
Research and Development.

157
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:56,843
The instigator of these
experiments was a scientist

158
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:59,343
named Ran'Tao, was
is also referred

159
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:02,410
to in the Kuchiki's historical
documents as the evil

160
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:04,076
researcher.

161
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,476
Ran'Tao's work was apparently
centered on the study

162
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,976
of eternal life.

163
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,210
But at some point there
was a serious accident,

164
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:13,510
and a number of souls
in the cycle of rebirth

165
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:16,043
were directly effected.

166
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:18,910
A mutated strain of humans
with abnormal abilities

167
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:21,276
was born in the
world of the living.

168
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,310
These are the Bounts.

169
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,043
After the accident, Ran'Tao
accepted responsibility

170
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:29,110
for the tragedy, and was
subsequently banished from

171
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:30,110
the Seireitei.

172
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:32,976
As for the Bounts, they
were purged, so as not

173
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,310
to cause harm to the
world of the living.

174
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:38,010
-Was it to protect the
world of the living?

175
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:40,943
Or did some superior just want
to bury the evidence in order

176
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:42,910
to conceal his own involvement?

177
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:44,010
-Careful, Shunsui.

178
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:45,743
-It doesn't matter.

179
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:48,010
All that matters now
is that we recognize

180
00:12:48,043 --> 00:12:51,010
this is a problem
of our own doing.

181
00:12:51,043 --> 00:12:53,343
-This would seem to confirm
that the Bounts are here

182
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:56,276
for revenge, just as Lieutenant
Matsumoto reported to us.

183
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,110
-Hm.

184
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,110
Possible.

185
00:12:58,143 --> 00:13:00,076
But regardless of their
reason for coming here,

186
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,910
the Bounts must now be
completely annihilated.

187
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:06,943
There is one last bit of
news I shall impart to you.

188
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:10,476
The Substitute Soul
Reaper, Ichigo Kurosaki,

189
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,910
has reentered the Soul Society
from the world of the living.

190
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:17,810
-That Ichigo is one
hardworking boy, isn't he?

191
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:20,810
-A thousand pardons, captains.

192
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:23,276
I have come with an
emergency dispatch.

193
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,210
Bount waves and Rukia
Kuchiki's spiritual pressures

194
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:26,143
have been detected.

195
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:30,410
-Open the gates!

196
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:36,176
Onward, to the East
Rukon District Area 43!

197
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,443
Help is on the way, Rukia!

198
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:45,376
-Ichigo!

199
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,176
Is that you?

200
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:49,810
-Orihime?

201
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:50,376
What's the matter?

202
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,110
-W-w-w-we found them!

203
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:53,043
We found the Bounts!

204
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:54,343
Or one of them, at least.

205
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,810
We're detecting a
Bount's presence.

206
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:57,076
This is very bad.

207
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,043
-What are you talking about?

208
00:14:01,076 --> 00:14:03,310
[gasp]

209
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,743
RUKIA: Hado 33, Byakurai!

210
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:11,143
-What happened to you?

211
00:14:11,176 --> 00:14:13,210
Your power seems a lot
weaker than it did before.

212
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:43,110
That's surprising.

213
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:48,143
I didn't think you had that
kind of strength left in you.

214
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:50,443
But, what'll you do now?

215
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:52,876
-Let's end this
fight beautifully.

216
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,310
-And then end her
life perfectly.

217
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:56,410
-That's the idea.

218
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:14,210
-Bakuda One!

219
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:14,910

RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Good.

221

I've stopped her
movement for now.

Sokatsui!

225
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:52,143
She's not hurt.

I'll give you that.

230
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,210
Which means that for me,
the fun just lasts longer.

Come this way.

235
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,876
I have something for you.

236
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,376
It's not much, but
it's something.

237
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:26,943
What happened to your arm?

238
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:28,143
You're wounded.

239
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:31,143
Why didn't you heal it with
that Kido you're so good at?

240
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,743
You can, can't you?

241
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:35,010
-Well, normally I'd
be able to, but--

242
00:17:35,043 --> 00:17:36,110
-Rukia.

243
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:39,010
Is it because your spiritual
pressure is completely--

244
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:39,976
what is it?

245
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:40,850
-Shh.

246
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:53,043
You got left behind here.

247
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:57,976
-Rukia!

248
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,476
-I know.

249
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,076
The Bount's here.

250
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,076
Take this girl and run.

251
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,743
-Huh?

252
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,276
But I can't leave you alone.

253
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,810
-Please don't argue.

254
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:08,443
Just get this child
to a safe place, now.

255

-Get your hands off her!

261
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:11,376
-Well, that depends
on what you do.

262
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,910
I have a lot of patience,
but your silly games

263
00:19:13,943 --> 00:19:15,310
have taxed me to the limit.

264
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:22,910
-Oh, Rukia.

265
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,710
Grr.

266

-And don't try
anything funny, or I

267
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:32,110
promise I'll crush this girl's
head before you can move.

-You monster!

about her after all.

Interesting.

273
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,176
I find myself
getting excited just

274
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,510
thinking about all the different
ways I might finish you off.

-Do it all at once.

281
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,110
Let's slice her up until
her flesh and blood

282
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:35,243
are indistinguishable
from each other.

00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:50,175
Thank you.

335
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:53,008
-Oh, moon watching should
always be like this.

336
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:56,108
MAN: Hey, what's going on
with the moon all of a sudden?

337
00:24:56,142 --> 00:24:58,008
-All of you, quit making
fun of my bald head!

338
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,875
-The moon's smooth!
