NARRATOR: A deadly
new Arrancar has

3
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:53,487
appeared before Captain
Hitsugaya's team in Karakura

4
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,521
Town.

5
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:56,421
It proved to be a
formidable opponent,

6
00:01:56,454 --> 00:01:58,454
capable of replicating itself.

7
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:00,054
The Soul Reapers
managed to defeat

8
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,821
the first wave of
clones, but they

9
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:04,787
were sure the enemy would
regroup for a new attack.

10
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:07,254
Two lost souls,
Shota and Yui, became

11
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:09,421
targets of the
Arrancars, and the team

12
00:02:09,454 --> 00:02:11,021
attempted to protect them.

13
00:02:11,054 --> 00:02:13,654
According to analysis
from the Soul Society,

14
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:15,621
this Arrancar is trying
to quickly absorb

15
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:17,521
as many tools as possible.

16
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,121
To do that, it has mounted
a multi-pronged attack,

17
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:22,487
controlling a large
number of clones at once

18
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:25,754
and forcing Hitsugaya's team
to spread themselves thin.

19
00:02:25,787 --> 00:02:27,287
-Split up and surround them.

20
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:27,787
-Right.

21
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:32,854
-Wait.

22
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:45,754
Hey.

23
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:49,654
You're OK.

24
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:50,487
It's gone.

25
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:52,921
Everything's gonna be all right.

26
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:54,054
Did you just see a monster?

27
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:57,754
-Shota!

28
00:02:57,787 --> 00:02:59,421
Wait a minute!

29
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:01,454
It's too dangerous for us here.

30
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:02,721
We've got to go.

31
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,187
-I won't leave.

32
00:03:04,221 --> 00:03:05,387
-Come on.

33
00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:08,487
We need to go back home and
let the others find Yui.

34
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,954
-I'm not going back!

35
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:10,787
Not without Yui.

36
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:11,654
She's my sister.

37
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:13,721
I've gotta protect her!

38
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:14,687
-Listen to me.

39
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:15,287
You've got to--

40
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:36,721
-Yui.

41
00:03:36,754 --> 00:03:37,754
-How did she--

42
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,587
-Yui.

43
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,754
Why did you leave the house?

44
00:03:46,054 --> 00:03:47,487
-I don't know why I left.

45
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:50,887
I just wanted to come
here, that's all.

46
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:53,854
Now that you're with
me, I feel a lot better.

47
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:56,354
I don't have to
be afraid anymore.

48
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:04,487
-I ran away.

49
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:09,021
I ran away and left my
sister here all alone.

50
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:10,821
It's all my fault.

51
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:12,687
I never should've left her.

52
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:20,354
On the day of the
accident, we got separated

53
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:23,154
from our mom and dad.

54
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:26,054
Yui and I were so afraid.

55
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:29,854
We searched for them for days.

56
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:31,421
We looked for them everywhere.

57
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:40,021
But no matter where we looked,
we just couldn't find them.

58
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:57,254
Yui!

59
00:04:57,287 --> 00:04:57,754
Yui!

60
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:04,287
Yui had gone off to look
for them by herself.

61
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:07,687
Yui!

62
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:14,187
Yui.

63
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:16,954
[screaming]

64
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,721
-Yui.

65
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,687
[laughter]

66
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:32,621
-It's a monster.

67
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:35,587
I'm scared, Shota.

68
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:37,587
Help me, Shota.

69
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:38,087
Please.

70
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:44,987
Shota!

71
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:49,421
Don't leave me!

72
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:52,321
Please don't!

73
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:53,787
Please, wait.

74
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,254
Shota, come back.

75
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:55,787
Help me!

76
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:07,387
-When I finally stopped running,
I was far away from the park.

77
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:10,221
I was so scared, I was shaking.

78
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:11,787
Yui was left alone.

79
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:12,987
I didn't think about her.

80
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:16,521
All I could think
about was myself.

81
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:18,187
I'm horrible.

82
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:20,654
That thing could've taken her.

83
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:27,221
-What happened then?

84
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,687
Did you go back?

85
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:33,887
-I felt-- I felt so
guilty about running away,

86
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:36,754
I just couldn't believe
what I had done.

87
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:40,954
I came back and looked for
Yui, but I couldn't find her,

88
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:43,154
and then he showed up again.

89
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:50,154
Where's my sister?

90
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:52,621
-How should I know?

91
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:55,087
-Give me back my sister!

92
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:59,987
-Why don't you come inside
and look for her yourself?

93
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:02,987
-Why you!

94
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:03,954
-You little brat.

95
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:16,887
SHOTA: And that's when
you showed up, Rangiku.

96
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:18,354
Let me go!

97
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:19,187
Hey, let go!

98
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:20,321
What do you think you're doing?

99
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:23,354
I'm-- I'm ashamed.

100
00:07:23,387 --> 00:07:25,687
I abandoned her.

101
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:28,621
And in spite of that,
Yui still trusts me

102
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:30,521
and believes I
would protect her.

103
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,854
Rangiku.

104
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:39,521
-All of this was really hard
on you, wasn't it, Shota?

105
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:43,021
[sobbing]

106
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:44,654
-Don't cry, Shota.

107
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:47,621
I don't know how,
but Yui stayed safe.

108
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:50,887
I mean, she's right
here and she's fine.

109
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:51,721
And see?

110
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:53,587
Now the two of you are together.

111
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:55,487
It's not too late, Shota.

112
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:57,687
You can still protect Yui.

113
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:00,154
-Mhmm.

114
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:03,987
RANGIKU (VOICEOVER): But
if what he says is true,

115
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:05,821
Yui was caught by that monster.

116
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:06,954
Hm.

117
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,554
I wonder.

118
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:13,554
[phone ringing]

119
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:14,421
-Yes?

120
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:15,554
-It's me, Rangiku.

121
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:16,754
Listen up.

122
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,254
I spotted the mock Arrancar
and almost caught it,

123
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:20,887
but it managed to escape.

124
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:22,654
RANGIKU: Where where
are you now, Captain?

125
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:25,821
-I'm downtown watching over
a soul who was attacked.

126
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:27,787
I made a couple of attempts
to interrogate him,

127
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:31,354
but he's extremely
terrified and won't speak.

128
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,354
I'm heading back in
a couple of minutes.

129
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,621
RANGIKU: Understood.

130
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:36,787
In that case, we'll
head back too.

131
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:38,021
-All right, got it.

132
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:40,454
We'll meet up aft--

133
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:41,787
[crash]

134
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,787
-Captain, are you there?

135
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,287
-I should have guessed.

136
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,754
I'm watching over a
soul who was attacked.

137
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,787
It can't be.

138
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:03,254
He disguised himself
as a human soul.

139
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:05,821
That must be how he kept
himself hidden while

140
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:07,554
preying on unsuspecting victims.

141
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:24,521
I've lost him.

142
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:31,821
I can't even track his
spiritual pressure.

143
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:33,821
-Captain Hitsugaya!

144
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:35,287
-Yes, Yumichika?

145
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:37,287
-Rangiku was very worried.

146
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:38,987
Are you all right, sir?

147
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:40,954
-I'm afraid another
problem has developed.

148
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:42,054
-Huh?

149
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:44,454
-I'll explain it to
the team just as soon

150
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:46,221
as we all get back.

151
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:47,621
RANGIKU: Captain.

152
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,154
I thought something terrible had
happened when you got cut off.

153
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:51,354
-No.

154
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:53,287
I just let my guard down
and dropped my soul phone.

155
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:54,221
That's all.

156
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:55,821
-I'm glad you're all right.

157
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:56,954
-So, where's Ikkaku?

158
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:59,454
-He's out patrolling
the town, keeping watch.

159
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:00,421
-Captain.

160
00:10:00,454 --> 00:10:01,621
I think I've figured
something out

161
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:03,454
about the appearance
of this Arrancar.

162
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:04,087
-Oh?

163
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:04,821
You have?

164
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,787
-Yes.

165
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:07,254
I've been analyzing
the situation,

166
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,021
and we just may have lucked out.

167
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:10,621
then tell us what you know.

168
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:12,954
I've observed something
about the enemy as well.

169
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,454
You report first, then
we'll compare notes.

170
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:18,121
-When you take the date and
time into consideration,

171
00:10:18,154 --> 00:10:21,221
there's a very good possibility
that Yui was the first person

172
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,387
to encounter the mock Arrancar.

173
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:25,087
-If that's true,
how in the world

174
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:27,321
did she ever survive
the experience?

175
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:28,287
-That's the problem.

176
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,054
Right now, it's a mystery.

177
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,587
And the fact of
the matter is, she

178
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:34,054
doesn't seem to
remember anything.

179
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:35,121
-Yui.

180
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:37,521
-I'm really sorry.

181
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:41,987
-What's your take on all
this, Captain Hitsugaya?

182
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:43,754
RANGIKU: Captain?

183
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:46,087
-Now it's all beginning
to make sense.

184
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:48,487
I wish that I'd been able
to figure it out earlier.

185
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:51,521
-Are you seeing a pattern to
all these attacks by the enemy?

186
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:52,654
-Worse than that.

187
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:55,454
This mock Arrancar is
exhibiting a new power.

188
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,921
It appears that it's actually
able to transition itself

189
00:10:57,954 --> 00:10:59,521
into human souls.

190
00:10:59,554 --> 00:11:02,254
In transforming itself,
it's able to mask

191
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,621
all traces of its
spiritual pressure,

192
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:08,387
and thereby avoid detection by
members of the Soul Society.

193
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:10,321
The way it works
is that it becomes

194
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,221
the perfect offensive weapon.

195
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,287
Apparently, it transforms so it
can approach humans and souls

196
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,221
more easily.

197
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,187
It gets them to
lower their guard

198
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:21,721
and then it absorbs
their spirit energy.

199
00:11:21,754 --> 00:11:23,787
After that, it
duplicates itself.

200
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,821
It can make an endless
number of clones

201
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:28,354
which can go out and absorb
a huge number of souls

202
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,754
all at once.

203
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:33,787
In no time at all, it can gather
an incredible amount of power.

204
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:36,121
-It disguises itself as a human.

205
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,754
That means-- No way.

206
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:39,654
-What?

207
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:40,987
You mean, I--

208
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:42,421
-What are you talking about?

209
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:44,754
This has nothing to do with Yui.

210
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,621
-Shota.

211
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:48,487
-I'm sorry, Shota.

212
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:53,187
We don't know if it's true, but
we have to take precautions.

213
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:54,221
-You're right about that.

214
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:55,654
-What are you planning to do?

215
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:56,154
-Stay away.

216
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:04,787
Yui!

217
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,887
-The Konso didn't work?

218
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:12,854
-Yui!

219
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:14,321
-What's he doing?

220
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:15,287
Shota.

221
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:18,187
Why is this happening to me?

222
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,121
-Captain.

223
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,321
-I know.

224
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:22,987
The Arrancar has definitely
done something to her.

225
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:24,187
-What now?

226
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,954
-Unfortunately, until we
know her true identity,

227
00:12:26,987 --> 00:12:29,021
she's considered a threat.

228
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:33,021
Under the circumstances,
she's a danger to us all.

229
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:34,221
All right.

230
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,887
The Soul Society needs to
do an immediate analysis

231
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:38,021
of her spiritual pressure.

232
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:43,754
-We have finally collected
enough reishi samples

233
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:45,354
to conduct our research.

234
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:48,354
-Sorry to rush you, but
it's an urgent matter.

235
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:49,087
-Right.

236
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:50,054
We understand.

237
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:51,987
So, this mock Arrancar
actually takes

238
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,287
the form of the
humans it attacks.

239
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:56,221
-It's urgent we find
the Arrancar who's

240
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:57,754
generating these clones.

241
00:12:57,787 --> 00:13:00,787
He's biding his time,
strengthening his powers.

242
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,421
-Don't worry, Jushiro.

243
00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:04,887
We'll find and destroy it
before this goes any further.

244
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:06,387
-Sounds good.

245
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:08,287
We'll be in contact
with you just as soon

246
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,854
as the results come back.

247
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:14,021
-The only thing we can do now
is wait for their findings.

248
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:17,421
Until then, the girl needs to
remain inside a Kido barrier.

249
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:18,654
-You're gonna lock her up?

250
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:19,587
You can't do that.

251
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:21,021
She doesn't deserve it.

252
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:23,821
She's my sister, and she
hasn't done anything wrong.

253
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:25,354
-But Shota.

254
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,687
We're only doing this
for Yui's protection.

255
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:32,087
That Arrancar has
done something to her.

256
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:35,387
It may even be trying to
control her right now.

257
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:37,587
You always talk
about protecting her.

258
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:39,621
Well, this is your chance.

259
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:41,187
The enemy won't be
able to touch her

260
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,987
once she's inside the barrier.

261
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:47,654
In the meantime, we'll kick
that Arrancar's butt so hard,

262
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:50,287
he won't know which way is up.

263
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,654
You've gotta trust us, OK?

264
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:53,487
And you too.

265
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:54,687
What do you think, Yui?

266
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:55,921
Can you do that?

267
00:13:55,954 --> 00:14:00,421
-Maybe, but I'm kinda scared.

268
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:00,921
-Yui.

269
00:14:03,987 --> 00:14:06,087
-I know.

270
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:06,787
Here, take this.

271
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:11,421
I know it's a little bit
different from the one

272
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:14,554
you had, but it's
still pretty, and it'll

273
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,154
help you get through
the next few days.

274
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:20,187
So, do you think you can be
a good girl and wait here?

275
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:21,421
-Yeah.

276
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:24,654
-Well, if Yui's
fine with it, OK.

277
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:27,587
-Thanks you two.

278
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:28,587
-Very good.

279
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:30,387
Now that everything's
been decided,

280
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:32,687
I better go out and
take over for Ikkaku.

281
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:34,387
-That's all right.

282
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,554
I'll relieve him and
take over the next shift.

283
00:14:36,587 --> 00:14:39,287
I want you to make a
visit to Urahara's shop.

284
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:41,021
-What's so important?

285
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:43,554
-I want you to brief
Renji on the situation.

286
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:44,387
-All right.

287
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:45,754
Got it.

288
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:48,354
-Rangiku, your job is to take
care of these two children.

289
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,621
-Understood, Captain.

290
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:51,921
Remember, we can't track
the enemy's movements,

291
00:14:51,954 --> 00:14:53,687
so don't let your guard down.

292
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:10,154
-Just a little bit longer and
my power will be at its peak.

293
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:23,396
[music playing]

294
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:09,129
-Did you sleep OK, Yui?

295
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:10,463
-Yeah.

296
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:12,563
Can you help me, Shota?

297
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,329
I want to go outside.

298
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:15,463
-I'm sorry.

299
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:19,163
I wanna let you out,
but I'm afraid I can't.

300
00:16:19,196 --> 00:16:23,429
-I wanna go out there
and find mommy and daddy.

301
00:16:23,463 --> 00:16:26,496
I wanna find them too, but
there's no way you can--

302
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:27,929
-Don't be so upset.

303
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:29,829
It's all right.

304
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,129
I know a secret.

305
00:16:31,163 --> 00:16:33,063
I can get out of this
barrier with your help.

306
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:34,363
-Huh?

307
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:38,196
-All you have to do
is stand up, Shota.

308
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:40,063
Hold up your hand.

309
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:42,163
Like this.

310
00:16:42,196 --> 00:16:42,663
-Really?

311
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:56,563
How did we do that?

312
00:16:56,596 --> 00:16:58,596
-It's a secret.

313
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:01,629
Let's go.

314
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:04,096
-Well, Hiyosu, have you
figured anything out?

315
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:04,663
-Yes.

316
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:05,896
A few things.

317
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:07,329
Check out these figured.

318
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:07,829
-Huh?

319
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:10,763
Oh, I see.

320
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,629
-Just as we suspected, right?

321
00:17:18,729 --> 00:17:19,663
-Yui.

322
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:20,229
Shota.

323
00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:21,763
Where are they?

324
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:23,163
No, they couldn't have.

325
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:24,463
-Rangiku, what's wrong?

326
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:26,196
-Captain, the
barrier's been broken.

327
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:28,396
-What the hell?

328
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:31,129
There are still traces of
their spiritual pressure.

329
00:17:31,163 --> 00:17:33,696
How did they break that barrier?

330
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,729
-I can't imagine
how they did this.

331
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,863
-It's hard to tell.

332
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:38,696
-We have to start
looking for them.

333
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:39,463
-Yes, you're right.

334
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:40,796
I agree.

335
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:42,096
-Captain Ukitake.

336
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,796
-We have the results of
the analysis you requested.

337
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:48,663
-Rangiku, you go out there
and start looking for then.

338
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:50,763
I'll come join you as
soon as I finish up here.

339
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:51,429
-Right.

340
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:52,696
Understood, Captain.

341
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,363
So, what do you have for us?

342
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:55,829
-I'll begin with the conclusion.

343
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:58,329
Yui Toyokawa is a clone.

344
00:17:58,363 --> 00:18:01,063
It appears she was created
by the mock Arrancar.

345
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,029
-Are you sure about that?

346
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:04,329
-Absolutely.

347
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:06,763
She was a human being with
strong latent spirit energy

348
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:09,429
before she was killed.

349
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,363
That's probably why
the mock Arrancar

350
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:14,863
was attracted to her
in the first place.

351
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:17,463
Unfortunately for us,
absorbing her soul

352
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,163
boosted its powers by
an incredible amount.

353
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:22,063
Exactly how much,
we can't tell yet.

354
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:24,729
At the very least,
it gave the Arrancar

355
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:26,396
the ability to
create attack clones

356
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:28,863
while the real
form, the main body,

357
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:30,563
remains hidden and
gains strength.

358
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:33,029
This explains a lot about
the pace of the Arrancar

359
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:34,563
attacks the level
of their success.

360
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:38,063
It absorbed a huge number
of souls of a short time.

361
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:39,896
I'm afraid that's
all we have for now.

362
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:41,163
-I see.

363
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:43,129
However, it seemed
to me that girl

364
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,396
was very much i
control of herself.

365
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:48,296
AKON: It's likely that
it was all an act.

366
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:50,796
She's definitely being
controlled by the enemy.

367
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,096
-What's the matter?

368
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:54,263
HITSUGAYA: If that's true,
and we kill the originating

369
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:55,463
Arrancar--

370
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:58,896
AKON: That child's soul
will be destroyed as well.

371
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,863
-Uh-- OkK.

372
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:02,996
-Wait a minute.

373
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:05,663
If Yui Toyokawa has such
strong spiritual power,

374
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:07,796
then why wouldn't her
brother have it is well?

375
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:09,596
-That's very insightful.

376
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:11,663
Since they're related,
there's a good possibility

377
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:13,529
that his level is
the same as hers.

378
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:14,863
-That's it.

379
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:17,496
She wasn't able to do it alone,
so she used Shota's power

380
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,096
to break the Kido barrier.

381
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:24,263
The enemy lured him out
there to absorb his soul!

382
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,463
RANGIKU (VOICEOVER): Shota.

383
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:26,196

384

through that barrier?

We didn't even break a sweat.

-You're in danger.

393
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:45,463
Come back with me now.
