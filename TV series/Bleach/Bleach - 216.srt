00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:51,402
NARRATOR: Sosuke
Aizen's true objective

3
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:54,802
was to wipe out the enriched
spirit zone of Karakura Town.

4
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:57,002
This would allow him
to create the Oken,

5
00:01:57,035 --> 00:02:00,135
and eventually take over
the entire Soul Society.

6
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:02,602
In a bold attempt to keep
Aizen's plan from succeeding,

7
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:05,602
the Soul Reapers built a
replica of Karakura Town

8
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:09,102
in the World of the Living and
readied themselves for battle.

9
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:12,268
With the opposing Espadas and
Soul Reapers fully prepared,

10
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:14,568
the furious battle between
them finally commenced.

11
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:25,502
-All right.

12
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:26,968
You should stand back.

13
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:41,968
All things in the
universe turn to ashes.

14
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:43,168
Ryujin Jakka!

15
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:12,202
Jokaku Enjo.

16
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,535
We are safe.

17
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,468
This wall of flames ought to
keep Sosuke and his cohorts

18
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:19,335
at bay for quite some time.

19
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:22,468
No then, we shall
show them no mercy.

20
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,668
End them at once.

21
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:26,502
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
in Hueco Mundo,

22
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:29,835
Ichigo was determined to get to
Tower Five to rescue Orihime.

23
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:34,268
But an army of Exequias
intercepted him.

24
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:38,068
The Exequias sheer numbers
gradually overwhelmed Ichigo.

25
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,768
By all accounts,
it appeared the end

26
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,135
was near for Ichigo
and his quest.

27
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:42,968
Then suddenly--

28
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:48,902
[shouting]

29
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:54,835
-[laughs] Yeah, want some more?

00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:58,102
[shouting]

31
00:03:58,135 --> 00:03:58,602
-What?

32
00:03:58,635 --> 00:03:59,102
Renji!

33
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:04,268
-Heh.

34
00:04:04,302 --> 00:04:05,935
-El Directo!

35
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:19,035
[shouting]

36
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:23,002
-Hey, Chad!

37
00:04:25,668 --> 00:04:28,568
-Tsugi no mai, Hakuren!

38
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:39,035
-Rukia!

39
00:04:39,068 --> 00:04:40,102
-Idiot.

40
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:41,868
Save the heartwarming
reunion for later.

41
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:43,568
Now get going, Ichigo!

42
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:48,068
-I'm on it!

43
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:53,168
-Oh, that guy.

44
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:54,335
He still needs a babysitter.

45
00:04:58,035 --> 00:04:59,435
NARRATOR: In the
meantime, Orihime

46
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:01,502
found himself alone
in the tower, face

47
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,335
to face with Ulquiorra.

48
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:05,535
Orihime told Ulquiorra
that because she

49
00:05:05,568 --> 00:05:07,135
had shared her heart
with her friends,

50
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:08,702
she was not afraid of dying.

51
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,802
But Ulquiorra had his doubts
about Orihime's declaration.

52
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:15,735
-Your heart, you say.

53
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:18,868
You humans always
toss around that word

54
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,402
so casually, as
if it's something

55
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:25,702
you can hold in the
palm of your hand.

56
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:28,168
Tell me, what is a heart?

57
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:35,968
If I tore a whole in your
chest, would I see it?

58
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:41,102
If I split open your
skull, would it be there?

59
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:43,568
-[gasp]

60
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:48,502
[rumbling]

61
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:28,668
-Ichigo!

62
00:06:35,068 --> 00:06:35,535
-Hm.

63
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:42,935
Step away from her.

64
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,835
-I was just about to.

65
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,602
My responsibilities are clear.

66
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:52,135
My duty is to protect Las
Noches until Lord Aizen returns.

67
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:56,468
I haven't received orders to
take the life of this woman.

68
00:06:56,502 --> 00:07:00,335
Until those orders come,
I will allow her to live.

69
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:05,802
However, you are a
different matter.

70
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:08,735
Killing you would be
absolutely within my duties

71
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:10,335
of protecting Las Noches.

72
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:17,002
You shall die by my sword.

73
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,268
-What a surprise.

74
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:25,768
It's funny, I never figured
you would be the first one

75
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:27,468
to draw your sword.

76
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:30,102
On the way here, I was thinking
that you wouldn't take me

77
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:32,102
seriously enough
to draw right away.

78
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:39,235
So tell me, is it reasonable
to say you consider me

79
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:42,802
an opponent that's equal to you?

80
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:45,035
-You might say that.

81
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:49,435
I consider you an
enemy worth destroying.

82
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,835
-That's good enough.

83
00:07:57,735 --> 00:08:00,668
-[gasp] Ichigo.

84
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:15,702
-So, all right.

85
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,135
What should we do here now?

86
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:27,802
Stuck with our enemies while
our boss is in that mess.

87
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:38,368
-You should be more careful with
what you say about Lord Aizen.

88
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:39,902
-And you should
mind the words you

89
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,668
speak to me as well, Harribel.

90
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:07,002
Seeing as how the
boss is caught up,

91
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:10,168
I will be the one
giving orders here.

92
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:11,902
And no one will complain.

93
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:16,502
-Hold on.

94
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:19,202
-Mila Rose, be quiet.

95
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:22,002
-You know, I'm good with that.

96
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:22,835
Ah!

97
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:24,935
What was that for, Lilynette?

98
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:25,768
Stop it!

99
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:26,735
LILLYNETTE: You good with that?

100
00:09:26,768 --> 00:09:28,002
What are you kissing ass for?

101
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,735
You always kiss up to
everyone everywhere.

102
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:30,768
It never ends with you!

103
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:32,002
There they go again.

104
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:34,868
LILLYNETTE: You want to
make yourself for a change.

105
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:37,768
-The enriched spirit zone
lives down there beneath us.

106
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:39,368
Aizen said it's a fake.

107
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:41,302
He said they replaced
the real world

108
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:44,168
with a replica built
by the Soul Society.

109
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:47,668
Before the fire surrounded
him, he said all we have to do

110
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:50,968
is invade the Soul Society
and obtain the enriched spirit

111
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:51,935
zone.

112
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:54,168
But is it really
necessary for us

113
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:56,635
to go through all that trouble?

114
00:09:56,668 --> 00:10:00,168
I figure from what was said
earlier, it works like this.

115
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:02,168
He said they
erected four pillars

116
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,535
on each side of the town and
used the power of the pillars

117
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:08,302
to swap out the entire place.

118
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:10,968
So what would happen if we
destroyed those pillars?

119
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:16,235
Now, Findorr.

120
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:17,435
-Sir.

121
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:21,302
[high-pitched noise]

122
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,702
BARAGGAN: I know where
those pillars are located.

123
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:39,668
There's a method to
placing things like that.

124
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:41,368
I'm certain that
their position's

125
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:42,968
at the four cardinal points.

126
00:10:50,502 --> 00:10:53,335
-[shout] This is terrible!

127
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:54,402
They know!

128
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:57,402
[cries] They know!

129
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,902
[roaring]

130
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:16,902
-[gasp]

131
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:23,802
This is bad.

132
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:31,768
If they end up
destroying those pillars,

133
00:11:31,802 --> 00:11:34,802
the real Karakura Town that
we sent to the Soul Society

134
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:35,735
will come back here.

135
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,435
And you know what
that would mean!

136
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:39,968
The real Karakura
Town will become

137
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:41,135
nothing but a battlefield!

138
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:55,335
[shout]

139
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,171
If they destroy those
pillars...

140
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:22,485
Karakura Town

141
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:25,218
will return and be destroyed!

142
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:27,752
-Quiet down, you fool

143
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:28,252
-Huh?

144
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,552
How naive do you think I am.

145
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:40,918
I would never allow any of
these pillars to be unprotected.

146
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,318
-Hm?

147
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:44,218
-Huh?

148
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:45,785
What?

149
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:46,918
IKKAKU: Extend, Hozukimaru!

150
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:54,452
YUMICHIKA: Bloom, Fuji Kujaku!

151
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:02,318
IZURU: Raise your
head, Wabisuke!

152
00:13:09,218 --> 00:13:11,918
-I have stationed
capable fighters

153
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:13,785
to defend these pillars.

154
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:14,285
-Hm?

155
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:16,252
-Huh?

156
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:18,218
-You did?

157
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:32,252
-What?

158
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:37,718
Ikkaku, Yumichika,
Izuru, Shuhei!

159
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:40,152
I thought they were holding
down the fort back home.

160
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:41,652
I should have known
when they weren't

161
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:42,985
there when you had us assembled.

162
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:44,752
I felt good thinking
the soul society

163
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:46,318
was counting on me
instead of them.

164
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:48,818
Ha, ha, serves them
right, I thought.

165
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:49,585
Wait, hold on.

166
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:51,885
All of you knew about this?

167
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,118
-Sure did.

168
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:54,352
-Huh?

169
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:56,685
-It's an insult to
think we're like you.

170
00:13:56,718 --> 00:13:57,185
-What?

171
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:02,685
SUI-FENG: I did
tell you about it.

172
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,852
I think you were munching
on fried crackers

173
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,652
and missed when I said it.

174
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:09,752
And you did look kind of
dazed from eating so much.

175
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:11,152
MARECHIYO: Me?

176
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,885
-That's the only explanation.

177
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,585
Munching Marechiyo.

178
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:16,018
-Come on.

179
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,752
RANGIKU: You were
the one in a daze

180
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:20,652
as you had a fried
cracker feeding frenzy.

181
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:22,085
-Hey, now!

182
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:24,952
Chowing down on fried
crackers and being in a daze--

183
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:28,552
-Maybe I didn't tell him.

184
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:29,585
-Hm.

185
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,552
Four new soldiers.

186
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:36,118
They can't stop us now.

187
00:14:36,152 --> 00:14:39,118
It's as though four ants
guard those pillars.

188
00:14:39,152 --> 00:14:44,152
Since that's the case, we will
squash them with four dragons.

189
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:53,152
Poww, Chuhlhourne, Abirama,
Findorr, go crush them.

190
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,418
-[together] Sir!

191
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:56,918
As you have commanded,
your majesty.

192
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:15,952
-Here we go.

193
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:16,885
Someone's coming.

194
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,485
[grunt]

195
00:15:32,818 --> 00:15:33,285
Huh.

196
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:36,952
Well, well.

197
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:39,485
Aren't you a big fella?

198
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,718
I pray you're as
imposing as you look.

199
00:15:42,752 --> 00:15:43,485
-You pray?

200
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:47,618
To what?

201
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:48,752
Explain that.

202
00:15:48,785 --> 00:15:51,485
Are you saying that you
Soul Reapers have a god?

203
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,718
-Huh?

204
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,252
Explain?

205
00:15:58,718 --> 00:16:02,718
Uh, now that you mention
it, we don't really

206
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:03,952
pray to anything specifically.

207
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:08,618
All right.

208
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:10,218
Let's do this!

209
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:11,952
If it'll make you
fight me any better,

210
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:14,818
than I'll even pray to
your god if you like.

211
00:16:14,852 --> 00:16:16,252
-I see.

212
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:18,285
Then we do not have a problem.

213
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:23,252
Our god, the king, knows one
thing better than anyone.

214
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:25,585
In his divine wisdom,
he understands

215
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,985
that you are no match for me.

216
00:16:29,018 --> 00:16:29,485
-Oh?

217
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:43,018
FINDORR: Before
we begin, I'd like

218
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:46,218
to ask, what rank do you hold?

219
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:47,652
-Shuhei Hisagi.

220
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:50,718
I'm a Squad Nine lieutenant.

221
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:51,852
-Very well.

222
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:56,752
In that case, I too will
fight with the strength

223
00:16:56,785 --> 00:16:59,818
of a lieutenant-class
Soul Reaper as well.

224
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,318
-Hm?

225
00:17:12,518 --> 00:17:14,918
-Huh?

226
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:17,285
CHUHLHOURNE: Here, here, here.

227
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:20,585
Look, I am here!

228
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:25,818
[giggle] His majesty, King
Barragan's First Fraccion,

229
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:28,385
Charlotte Chuhlhourne
has arrived.

230
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:33,752
[giggle] Huh?

231
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:39,552
My, my, my, my, my, my, my.

232
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:42,418
-[groan]

233
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:44,485
-Mhm.

234
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:45,652
-I've got this rule.

235
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:48,252
I don't look at ugly things.

236
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:51,618
-Oh, dear.

237
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:54,685
-Hey, just what the hell
did you do that for,

238
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:55,818
you stupid bastard!

239
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:58,185
-Well, that's exactly
what I want to ask you!

240
00:17:58,218 --> 00:18:00,185
What's the idea of
calling someone you just

241
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:02,652
met for the first
time ugly, sourpuss?

242
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:04,385
See here, I'll
tell you something

243
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:08,585
that's really ugly-- judging
someone based on appearances.

244
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:09,952
That's right.

245
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:13,718
I'm talking about what lives in
your heart and can't be seen.

246
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:16,885
What a nice line,
if I do say so.

247
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:18,452
I mean, someone
with a heart as pure

248
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,252
as mine, someone who possesses
the sweet beauty of never

249
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:24,118
judging others-- it's
an absolute beauty that

250
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:25,685
defies all else.

251
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:28,518
Can you understand such things?

252
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,320
-[groan]

253
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,181
-When I say something,
you can at least

254
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:34,910
look at me, you ugly freak.

255
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,210
-I don't need to look at you,
because nothing you're saying

256
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:40,177
makes any sense, you
flipped out hairball!

257
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,210
-Oh, come on.

258
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:42,544
Just take a look.

259
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:43,110
-No way!

260
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,044
-I said look!

261
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:46,544
Look here.

262
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:48,510
I said look!

263
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,010
-[groan] Stop it!

264
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:53,677
Don't bring your
ugliness near me.

265
00:18:57,677 --> 00:18:59,144
-How dare you!

266
00:18:59,177 --> 00:19:00,144
You said it again!

267
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:01,944
You called me ugly!

268
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:03,144
-I'll say it all I want.

269
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:04,944
Ugly, ugly, ugly!

270
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,944
-I'll punch you!

271
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:12,910
ABIMARA: [shout] Gonna do it!

272
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:13,677
Gonna do it!

273
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,077
Gonna do it!

274
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,677
Who is the bravest of his
majesty King Baraggan's

275
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,144
Fracciones, I ask you.

276
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:23,410
I am the one!

277
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:28,610
Who is it that is the most
trusted of his majesty King

278
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:32,210
Baraggan's
Fracciones, I ask you.

279
00:19:32,244 --> 00:19:34,410
I am that guy!

280
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:37,310
Who happens to be the strongest
of his majesty King Baraggan's

281
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,744
Fracciones, I ask you.

282
00:19:39,777 --> 00:19:43,277
I am that one guy!

283
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,077
Yeah, yeah, yeah, huh.

284
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,177
Gonna do it.

285
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,044
I gotta do it.

286
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:47,777
Gonna do it Gonna do it.

287
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,777
Gonna do it, do it, do it!

288
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,077
Hey.

289
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,177
Hey, you there!

290
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,344
Why is it you're not
saying this along with me.

291
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:01,010
You're kind of depressing.

292
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:02,910
-What the hell do you mean?

293
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,910
You want me to do
that song and dance?

294
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:07,510
-Did you just call what
I do a song and dance?

295
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:08,610
There's no such thing!

296
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:10,177
Don't mock what I do!

297
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,777
This is a ritual,
a glorious ritual

298
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,710
where we shout to each other our
intent to kick each other's ass

299
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:18,744
and then psych one another
to utter his call to battle.

300
00:20:18,777 --> 00:20:19,510
Let's go.

301
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:20,410
Let's do it!

302
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:22,077
Are you ready?

303
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,744
Gonna do it!

304
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:23,444
Gonna do it!

305
00:20:23,477 --> 00:20:24,610
I gotta do it!

306
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:25,744
Gotta do it!

307
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:27,310
Come on, do it.

308
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:28,510
-No way.

309
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:31,144
I will not yell about
wanting to kick your ass.

310
00:20:31,177 --> 00:20:33,177
There's no point in
joining in on an energy

311
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,277
wasting, negative ritual.

312
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,910
ABIMARA: The only
one who's negative is

313
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:41,277
you, Mr. Bump on a Log
That's About to Die!

314
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,044
How great.

315
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:44,410
I get stuck a gutless one.

316
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,044
Oh, well.

317
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:49,810
I'm King Baraggan's
Fraccion Abirama Redder.

318
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:51,677
What's your name, Soul Reaper.

319
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,144
-I am Squad Three
lieutenant Izuru Kira.

320
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:58,444
-You said Squad Three?

321
00:20:58,477 --> 00:20:59,377
Ha.

322
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,744
-Huh?

323
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:02,444
-Now I get it.

324
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:06,010
You were under Gin Ichimaru.

325
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:08,544
Yeah, I heard about how
he abandoned you back

326
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:10,010
in the Soul Society.

327
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:12,710
But now I can see
it all makes sense.

328
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,410
I'd say he had no other
choice but to leave

329
00:21:34,444 --> 00:21:37,077
a gutless guy like-- huh?

330
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:46,644
-I'm warning you.

331
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:51,410
Don't mention his name so
casually in my presence.

332
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:55,377
I mean, if you're
going to die anyway,

333
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,077
wouldn't it be preferable
to die in one piece?

334
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,544
-Now I see.

335
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:03,044
So you do have some guts.

336
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:04,944
I like that look on your face.

SHUHEI: It's been awhile
since I've made an appearance.

339
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:50,442
IZURU: Shuhei, don't
go getting giddy.

340
00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:51,742
SHUHEI: Who's giddy?

341
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:53,409
I don't expect that
I'll get to show off

342
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:56,375
my winning smile, impressive
strength, and universally

343
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:58,609
appealing nature
to all the viewers.

344
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:00,942
IZURU: No one said
anything about that.
