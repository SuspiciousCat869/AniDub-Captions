VOICEOVER: Soul Reapers.

00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:53,424
The spiritual guardians to
the world of the living.

4
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:56,157
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,757
of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

Ichigo and Captain
Hitsugaya's troops

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,757
barely managed to
defeat the Arrancars

that Aizen had created.

9
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:09,557
But both sides
suffered major damages.

ICHIGO: The truth is I haven't
been able to protect anyone.

11
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,457
I couldn't defeat our enemies.

12
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,290
I was useless.

13
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:20,357
I lost.

tracked down the Visored

with one goal in
mind-- to learn how

17
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:31,490
to suppress his inner hollow.

We'll teach you control.

You'll learn how to deal with
that hollow inside of you.

-Hey.

23
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:01,357

Zangetsu, do you

mean the one you're

-Bastard!

Now tell me where
the hell did you

45
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:29,724
learn to use bankai like this?

-Isn't it obvious?

00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:32,924

-Amazingly you haven't
even acknowledged

the confusion in your heart.

-What you mean?

00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:27,157
How exactly have I failed?

In spite of your
best efforts, I now

see that it's impossible
for you to truly use Bankai.

You're out of your mind.

I'm using Bankai
right now, aren't I?

This is crazy.

I'm tired of all this
nonsense, you jerk.

-The truth is those who don't
have the will to fight cannot

95
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,490
deflect my blade.

96
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:17,457
It's over.

-Shut the hell up.

100
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:41,157
Wait a minute.

101
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,224
Why does Byakuya
keep popping up?

102
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:48,557
I haven't got a clue
what's going on here.

103
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,157
-Concentrate now.

104
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,724
Don't lose your focus.

105
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:52,690
-Believe me.

106
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:53,190
I won't!

107
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:57,590
-Oh really?

108
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:02,690
Then why were you just staring
off into space a minute ago?

109
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:05,557
-I said I'm not losing focus!

Zen Getsuga Tensho!

-Hm.

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,190
-He blocked it with one hand.

113

117
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:39,490
That's it.

118
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:41,990
10 minutes.

119
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:42,657
Hachi.

120
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,290
Time to switch out.

121
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:45,257

122

00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:01,890
My turn.

-I'm Kensei Muguruma.

129
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:14,024
And I'm going to kill you.

-Stop messing around, Ichigo.

132
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,790
If you don't finish this soon,
we'll be forced to kill you.

133
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:34,690
-I told you.

134
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:38,290
You're not good enough, Ichigo.

135
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:40,024
Didn't you notice?

136
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,724
I was the first to
use Getsuga Tensho

137
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:45,524
after we released our Bankai.

138
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:48,324
And you?

139
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,890
All you did was
watch my technique.

140
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:53,724
You tried to imitate me
and failed miserably.

141
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:54,824
You're incompetent.

142
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:57,790
But you know that don't you?

143
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,257
Ichigo.

144
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:04,090
You might as well give up.

145
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,424
You're not good
enough at Bankai!

146
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,157
[gasp]

147
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,090
-You're completely useless
and always have been, kid.

148
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:19,590
-Huh?

149
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:27,290
-Kariya?

150
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:39,814
[panting]

151
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:41,748
-How much of a break do I get?

152
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:43,581
-If all of us rotate
in on schedule,

153
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:45,214
It's 10 minutes
times eight people,

154
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:47,048
so that makes it 80 minutes.

155
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,381
-It isn't times eight, idiot.

156
00:11:49,414 --> 00:11:52,081
You can't count her,
so it's only seven.

157
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:53,114
-Fine.

158
00:11:53,148 --> 00:11:56,314
10 minutes times 7
is 70 minutes then.

159
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,148
-Wait a minute.

160
00:11:57,181 --> 00:11:59,014
This doesn't sound good.

161
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:01,081
I'm only supposed to
form the barriers,

162
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:03,514
but they're including me
in the fight calculations.

163
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:07,581
-Ichigo is strong.

164
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:09,614
A lot stronger than
I thought he'd be.

165
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:14,748
You'd better be very
careful while you're

166
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,981
fighting out there, Kensei.

167
00:12:17,014 --> 00:12:19,281
Because if you aren't--

168
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:27,114
-Instant regeneration.

169
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,648
-He's pretty serious.

170
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:36,581
What's up with him?

171
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:37,914
-Don't be so critical.

172
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:39,781
You'll see why
when you get there.

173
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:40,781
[cough]

174
00:12:40,814 --> 00:12:42,714
[shriek]

175
00:12:42,748 --> 00:12:44,714
[grunt]

176
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:50,148
[shriek]

177
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:52,114
-What the hell is this?

178
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:54,614
[grunt]

179
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,548
[shriek]

180
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:02,014
[gurgling]

181
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:09,748
-You're transforming
faster than we expected.

182
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:12,714
[shrieking]

183
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,948
-Ichigo's internal battle
to control his hollow

184
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:19,614
needs to be finished
within one hour.

185
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,781
Not counting
[inaudible], there's

186
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:24,081
six of us to go before
it becomes my turn again.

187
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:32,114
If this battle gets all the way
back to me, he'll be done for.

188
00:13:39,014 --> 00:13:39,481
-Kariya.

189
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:44,781
I'm not seeing you.

190
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:46,948
-Hm.

191
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:49,148
-You're an illusion
of some kind.

192
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:50,848
-Maybe you're right.

193
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,148
But--

194
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,948
-But what?

195
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:57,681
-Well, it all depends on
what you think you're seeing.

196
00:13:57,714 --> 00:14:01,014
Most illusions are seen with
the heart, not the eyes.

197
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,014
You made a replica of me
from deep within your soul.

198
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:07,881
That in itself suggests that
your heart is full of doubt.

199
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:11,548
It reveals you
regret defeating me.

200
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:14,781
The truth is whenever you finish
a battle, the fallout from it

201
00:14:14,814 --> 00:14:17,381
weighs heavily on your mind.

202
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:20,348
Afterward, you turn your back
to the enemy you defeated,

203
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:23,148
and the friends you
couldn't protect.

204
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:24,481
Be honest, Ichigo.

205
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:27,481
go Are you that afraid of
moving forward after the fight?

206
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:30,781
Are you that afraid of
walking the same path as me?

207
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:31,681
-No!

208
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:34,881
I'm different from you.

209
00:14:34,914 --> 00:14:36,414
-You don't sound so convincing.

210
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:41,114
What happened to your Zangetsu?

211
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,614
[groaning]

212
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:46,581
-Do you think you can defeat
me with your bare hands?

213
00:14:46,614 --> 00:14:47,514
[groaning]

214
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:55,214
-What a shame.

215
00:14:55,248 --> 00:14:57,748
You've lost your Zangetsu.

216
00:14:57,781 --> 00:15:01,048
Now you know how it
feels to be helpless.

217
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:04,381
In your current state you're
as vulnerable and defenseless

218
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:06,181
as a newborn.

219
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:07,514
-Damn it.

220
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:10,214
-Do you want a
weapon that badly?

221
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:12,981
Well then, I'll give you one!

222
00:15:13,014 --> 00:15:14,981
[scream]

223
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,948
[groaning]

224
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,481
-Hold on.

225
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:28,781
Hey, is that Zangetsu?

226
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,548
-Sorry, kid.

227
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:34,648
It's just me.

228
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:39,314
You wanted a weapon, right?

229
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:41,214
Choose whichever one you like.

230
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,414
-No.

231
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:52,681
Zangetsu isn't here.

232
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:58,014
I almost forgot.

233
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,814
Zangetsu lives within me.

234
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:02,714
-What's wrong?

235
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:05,614
Aren't you going
to pick up a sword?

236
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:10,014
If you don't then, how
will you deal with this?

237
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:12,348
-I've got a surprise
for you, smart guy.

238
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:15,648
Zangetsu!

239
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:27,314
-Heh.

240
00:16:27,348 --> 00:16:29,248
Does this zanpakuto
look familiar?

241
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:31,281
What do you have to say now?

242
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:34,514
-You're certainly confident
with a weapon in your hand.

243
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:35,548
But you know something?

244
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:37,281
You're truly pathetic.

245
00:16:37,314 --> 00:16:38,648
-Shut up!

246
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:42,781
-If you're so confident,
then try to take me down.

247
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:44,614
[grunting]

248
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:50,348
-You will never
be able to cut me.

249
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:52,314
Especially with a
sword that regrets

250
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:54,881
having defeated me
in our last fight.

251
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:58,014
[grunt]

252
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:00,014
-Let me be perfectly
honest with you.

253
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:01,648
[groan]

254
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:05,981
-This is something you
don't know about battle.

255
00:17:06,014 --> 00:17:08,814
The fight never ends.

256
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:12,314
After you've defeated one
enemy, a stronger opponent

257
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:13,814
will appear.

258
00:17:13,848 --> 00:17:16,048
Then if you're
able to defeat him,

259
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:19,981
an even stronger
one comes along.

260
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:21,481
If you don't have
the inner resolve

261
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:24,448
to endure this eternal
struggle, then you

262
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:27,348
will eventually succumb and die.

263
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,314
But it doesn't end there.

264
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:33,948
The battles always continue
elsewhere, fought by others.

265
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:35,481
It's an endless cycle.

266
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:38,114
And it's not only limited
to a person's existence

267
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:39,714
on the physical plane.

268
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:40,814
Believe me.

269
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:42,748
As long as people and
their souls exist,

270
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:43,781
there will be disputes.

271
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,181
And those disputes
will lead to fights.

272
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:48,914
And those fights go
on for all eternity.

273
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:50,981
No matter how much you
try to run from them.

274
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:51,781
-That's not true.

275
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:52,648
You're full of it!

276
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:53,714
-You fool!

277
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:55,548
You refuse to see
the truth before you!

278
00:18:03,414 --> 00:18:04,781
-Trust me, Ichigo.

279
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:06,548
Those who have power
will eventually

280
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:09,081
be drawn into battle.

281
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:13,614
That's how it happened
for most of the Bounts.

282
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:14,881
I was a witness.

283
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:18,114
And naive idealists like
yourself were among the first

284
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:19,614
to lose their lives!

285
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:21,514
[groaning]

286
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:25,281
-Damn it.

287
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,681
Damn.

288
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:30,981
-You still going to fight
with this weak sword?

289
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:32,381
What's the matter with you, kid?

290
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:33,981
Don't you even have
a little pride?

291
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:39,048
Disappointing.

292
00:18:47,614 --> 00:18:48,081
Za--

293
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:50,981
-Zangetsu.

294
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:53,981
-That isn't Zangetsu.

295
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:58,314
I keep saying that
I am Zangetsu.

296
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:02,648
[groaning]

297
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:03,948
-I must admit it.

298
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:07,514
It never ceases to amaze me
how brainless you can be.

299
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,081
You've lost your weapon.

300
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,514
Why are you just standing there?

301
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:18,014
Ichigo, what's the difference
between a king and his horse?

302
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:20,881
-What the hell are you saying?

303
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:22,848
-I'm not talking
about obvious stuff.

304
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:24,681
Like one's an animal
and one's a person.

305
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:27,581
Or one has two legs
and one has four.

306
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:29,648
Form, ability and power!

307
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:31,048
That's what's puzzling.

308
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:34,114
If their form, ability and power
are exactly the same, why is it

309
00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:36,314
that one becomes the king
and leads them into battle,

310
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:38,714
while the other becomes the
horse and carries the king!

311
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:40,314
So what's the
characteristic that

312
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:42,048
distinguishes these two beings?

313
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:49,848
There's only one
answer-- instinct!

314
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:53,181
In order for identical beings
to get stronger and gain power,

315
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:55,781
they need to develop
a killer instinct.

316
00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:58,714
And that instinct is
mostly forged in battle.

317
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:02,648
They must develop an insatiable
hunger to engage in battle.

318
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:05,648
They must live to mercilessly
crush, shred and slice

319
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:07,181
their enemies.

320
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:11,048
This thirst for power is
not an unnatural desire.

321
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:13,581
In fact, it forms the
very essence of our being.

322
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,881
Deep within our body
lies the honed instinct

323
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,014
to dominate and
slaughter our enemies!

324
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:23,048
My friend, you don't have that.

325
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:25,381
You use your brain to
try and win a fight!

326
00:20:25,414 --> 00:20:28,248
You attempt to defeat your
enemies with reason and logic.

327
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:30,948
You don't tap into those
pure, base instincts that

328
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:36,381
exist within your core
waiting to be released!

329
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:38,414
And the simple matter
is it does it work.

330
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:40,048
You're weak, Ichigo!

331
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,381
-I won't put up with that.

332
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:54,281
Am I clear?

333
00:20:54,314 --> 00:20:56,748
I don't know about
Zangetsu, but I

334
00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:59,981
refuse to play horse to a
king who's weaker than me.

335
00:21:00,014 --> 00:21:02,314
Someone whose uncertainty
and hesitation

336
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:05,381
will end up getting
us both cut to pieces!

337
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:07,681
If you aren't willing
to assert your strength

338
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:10,214
and retain the crown,
then I'll destroy you.

339
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:16,981
Which means I'll be king.

340
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:21,714
[labored breath]

341
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:22,214
-Instinct.

342
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:28,814
The desire to seek battle.

343
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:40,981
Sword-- I won't let
you Have my sword.

344
00:21:41,014 --> 00:21:44,948
[grunt]

345
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:46,914
[gasp]

346
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:54,848
[groaning]

347
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:03,748
[instinct]

348
00:22:13,009 --> 00:23:43,042
[theme song]

349
00:23:43,978 --> 00:23:45,918
ORIHIME: Ichigo has a
pretty happy expression

350
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:48,485
on his face for someone in the
middle of an internal battle.

351
00:23:48,518 --> 00:23:50,352
He must be having a great dream.

352
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:52,118
RUKIA: Men only
have erotic dreams.

353
00:23:52,152 --> 00:23:52,818
ORIHIME: What?

354
00:23:52,852 --> 00:23:54,218
That perverted dumbass!

355
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:56,318
After all we've done for him!

356
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,052
Ichigo: Perverted--
Perverted dumbass?
