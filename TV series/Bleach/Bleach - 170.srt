NARRATOR: One day,
a swarm of Hollows

4
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:54,228
suddenly descended
upon Karakura town.

5
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:56,162
In the midst of
exterminating them,

6
00:01:56,195 --> 00:02:01,395
Ichigo and Rukia stumbled
across a curious trio.

7
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:04,162
Ichigo's friends soon
appeared, and together they

8
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:05,795
defeated the Hollows.

9
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:09,295
But the three strangers had
vanished during the fray.

10
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,862
Though they didn't turn up
again, in the most unlikely

11
00:02:11,895 --> 00:02:13,228
of places.

12
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:16,528
They moved in next door, right
behind the Kurosaki clinic.

13
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:20,262
Stranger still, they
transferred into Ichigo's class,

14
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:21,962
as students.

-A giant!

18
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:41,462
-That girl has to
be a grade school.

19
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,028
-Two adults and a child?

20
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:47,295
-I am Kenryu.

21
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:50,528
On my left is Enryu.

22
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:53,762
And to my right,
let me present--

23
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:55,128
-Ahem.

24
00:02:55,162 --> 00:02:58,828
I am Rurichiyo Kasumioji.

25

28
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:10,062
Where did you move here from.

29
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:12,095
-Somewhere far away.

30
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:14,728
-How come the three of
you transferred together?

31
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,328
-We're all related, OK?

32
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,528
-Where are you guys all living?

33
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:19,895
-That's a secret.

34
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:21,762
-What are your measurements?

35
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:24,595
-This one is a little on the
youngish side, don't you think

36
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:27,562
-I can't help it,
she's adorable.

37
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:28,295
-Wait a sec.

38
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:29,428
What gives, new guy?

39
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:31,362
How come you're the one
doing all the talking?

40
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:34,295
-Lady Rurichiyo is a
person of high nobility.

41
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:36,028
She needn't waste
time conversing

42
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,995
with those beneath her.

43
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:39,228
-Beneath her, huh?

44
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:40,862
Ah, come on now.

45
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:43,195
That's going little
too far, isn't it?

46
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:45,295
-Just so we're clear.

47
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:48,595
I won't allow fraternization
with Lady Rurichiyo.

48
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,495
-Huh?

49
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:52,862
-If you get too
friendly with her,

50
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:54,762
I'll put you in the ground.

51
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:57,428
-You're kidding, right?

52
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:58,795
-So, Ichigo.

53
00:03:58,828 --> 00:03:59,928
Let's talk.

54
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:01,595
-Talk about what?

55
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:03,295
-Hey, what's the deal?

56
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:05,328
How come Ichigo
gets to chat her up,

57
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:07,162
and I get death
threats thrown at me?

58
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:12,628
Forget I said anything.

59
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:16,995
-Ichigo, this school of yours
is a strange place, isn't it?

60
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:18,828
-What do you mean?

61
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:20,628
-Everybody is wearing
the same thing.

62
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:22,762
Are they Reapers?

63
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,262
-Hardly.

64
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:27,128
-Lady Rurichiyo is
addressing you directly.

65
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:29,095
You had best show
some manners, Ichigo.

66
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:34,995
-You want to back
up a little bit?

67
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:38,495
-Ichigo, I'm ever so
parched right now.

68
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,262
-Hey, uh not to be
rude or anything,

69
00:04:40,295 --> 00:04:42,828
but do you always talk
like that, or what?

70
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:44,495
-Why, do I sound funny?

71
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:48,628
-Well, we're not at in feudal
times anymore, you now.

72
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:49,628
Ah, forget it!

73
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:51,095
I'm not even here.

74
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:52,428
-I kind of like it.

75
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:54,795
There's nothing wrong
with the way you speak.

76
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,662
-Yeah, to each his own, right?

77
00:04:56,695 --> 00:05:00,128
-It's pretty darn
cute, if you ask me.

78
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:01,995
-Run and fetch me a drink now.

79
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:02,528
Ichigo?

80
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:03,728
-A drink?

81
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,495
Why would I do that?

82
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:06,862
-Get moving.

83
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:10,395
Receiving as order straight
from Lady Rurichiuo is an honor.

84
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:11,695
-Back off.

85
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,028
-Ah, come on.

86
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,228
You could at least treat her
to some juice or something,

87
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:16,028
you know?

88
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:17,128
-They're new around here.

89
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:19,828
Show a little hospitality.

90
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,095
-All right already.

91
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:24,762
You three are a real pain
the ass, you know that?

92
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:28,162
-Serve me well, Ichigo.

93
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,128
[bell tolling]

94
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:39,195
-Huh?

95
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,962
What are those
weirdos up to now?

96
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,695
-Oh, hi Ichigo.

97
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:48,795
Are you heading home?

98
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:51,795
We are returning to
our abode as well.

99
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:53,095
-Lady Rurichiyo.

100
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:54,928
-Would you like to accompany me?

101
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:56,862
-You're both going the same way?

102
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:58,162
-Pretty much.

103
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:00,528
-Hey, then we'll all be
together for part of the way.

104
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:01,662
Let's hit the bricks!

105
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,428
-Come then, Ichigo.

106
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,662
Shall we?

107
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:04,795
-Sorry, m'lady.

108
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:06,428
I'm afraid that's not possible.

109
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:08,562
A lot of planning went
into our return route.

110
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:10,295
We can't deviate now.

111
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,928
Loitering about
with these commoners

112
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:14,228
will just waste precious time.

113
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:15,528
-Huh?

114
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:16,595
Gr.

115
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:17,295
-Please, m'lady.

116
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:19,295
It's for your own good.

117
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:20,628
-Oh, is it?

118
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:23,195
I am going home with Ichigo,
whether you like it or not.

119
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:25,295
-Please bear with us
for this afternoon,

120
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:27,362
and I'll pick you up a
treat on the way home.

121
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:30,962
I hear the sweets in this
world are to die for!

122
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:32,095
-Really?

123
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:33,262
Til we meet again, Ichigo.

124
00:06:42,662 --> 00:06:44,628
-They're being way too careful.

125
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:45,595
-Hm.

126
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:46,628
-They're definitely
up to something.

127
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:53,728
-Wow.

128
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:56,295
You are such an
extraordinary cook, Kentryu.

129
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:58,228
-Why thank you, m'lady.

130
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:01,095
-Today was the most
fun I've had in ages.

131
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:03,828
-It brings me great
pleasure to hear that.

132
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:06,395
-Do you think I could go
back to school tomorrow?

133
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:07,362
-Of course.

134
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:09,195
I don't see why not.

135
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:09,828
-Oh really?

136
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,595
Oh, I can't wait.

137
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:14,962
That means I can see
Ichigo Kurosaki again.

138
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:20,728
-But Lady Rurichiyo, that boy--

139
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:21,795
-He's a fine young man.

140
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:23,195
And so strong.

141
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:24,428
-You can't, m'lady.

142
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:27,162
You can't let down your
guard so easily around him.

143
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:29,928
The boy's obviously beneath you.

144
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:33,262
If you get too close, there
could be serious consequences.

145
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:36,195
-Serious consequences?

146
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:38,228
Such as what, exactly?

147
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:39,428
-Well.

148
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:41,795
I just mean--

149
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:42,862
-Typical.

150
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,062
The two of you are
worrying far too much.

151
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:45,995
Now then.

152
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:47,162
I think it's time
I had my dinner.

153
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:48,762
-Of course.

154
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:49,828
-It looks delicious.

155
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:55,062
-What?

156
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:57,762
The same class?

157
00:07:57,795 --> 00:07:59,228
Are you serious?

158
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:00,295
-Yes.

159
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:02,428
They ingeniously used
memory replacement

160
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:07,028
and transferred into our school
without raising any suspicion.

161
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:10,662
Ichigo, what do you make
of these three, huh?

162
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:13,795
There's no question their
businesses is with you.

163
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:16,795
But what are they after?

164
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:18,462
-I thought you were
going to poke around

165
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:20,428
a bit, see what you
can learn about them?

166
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:21,828
-Yeah, I did.

167
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:24,962
But there was no evidence that
they'd ever used the Senkaimon.

168
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,928
One thing I do
know is those gigai

169
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:29,495
they're using had to
have come from Kisuke.

170
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:31,362
But I was told that
he had to respect

171
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:34,795
the privacy of his clientele.

172
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:36,028
-I don't like it.

173
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,562
This whole thing's starting
to smell fishy to me.

174
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:39,628
Come on, Ichigo.

175
00:08:39,662 --> 00:08:41,028
You and I will sneak
over to their place,

176
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,595
and get to the bottom
of this business.

177
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:44,162
-Eh.

178
00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:45,828
Too much work.

179
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:46,462
-Huh?

180
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:47,195
Why the hell not?

181
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:49,328
Aren't you curious at all?

182
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,295
-If Kisuke isn't
worried about them,

183
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:54,862
the odds are pretty good
that they're harmless.

184
00:08:54,895 --> 00:08:57,228
I say we just give them
some space for now.

185
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:59,162
See what their deal is.

186
00:08:59,195 --> 00:08:59,662
-Ichigo.

187
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:05,528
He's right, Cone.

188
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:06,462
-Huh?

189
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:08,162
This doesn't worry you at all?

190
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:10,162
Man, I'm so freaked out
now, I can't even sleep!

191
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:17,562
[breathing]

192
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:27,928
[whooshing noise]

193
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:32,395
[thud]

194
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:38,628
-Ichigo!

195
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:39,895
-It's next door.

196
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:51,062
-His spiritual pressure?

197
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:54,495
-Well, it isn't normal,
whoever it's coming from.

198
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:55,695
Rukia, let's go.

199
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,528
-What's the ruckus?

200
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,262
I'm trying to catch some z's.

201
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:13,262
-No where to run,
now start talking.

202
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:14,662
-What's going on here.

203
00:10:14,695 --> 00:10:17,828
Your spiritual pressure has
changed since yesterday.

204
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:19,262
Come on, speak up.

205
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:21,195
I'm a substitute Soul Reaper.

206
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:23,262
I can't just let it slide.

207
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,062
-Now explain yourself.

208
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:27,028
Otherwise.

209
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:28,262
-What the hell?

210
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,195
-They've come.

211
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:29,895
-What?

212
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:31,395
What is that pressure?

213
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:38,795
-Dammit!

214
00:10:44,262 --> 00:10:45,228
[music playing]

215
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,585
-Hey Kenryu, who is this guy?

216
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:13,251
-Ichigo, I leave
the rest to you.

217
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:14,651
-Huh?

218
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:15,418
Hey!

219
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:16,518
Wait a minute!

220
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:20,851
-They're fleeing.

221
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:22,318
-Thanks a lot.

222
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:22,818
-Huh?

223
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:32,385
-All right then.

224
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:33,685
Who's this guy?

225
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:35,718
-He doesn't seem to be
part of the Stealth Force.

226
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:38,418
-Hold it!

227
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,618
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

228
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:50,418
-He's obviously come here
seeking Rurichiyo and her men.

229
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:54,385
-Yeah, looks that
way, doesn't it?

230
00:11:54,418 --> 00:11:55,218
All right now.

231
00:11:55,251 --> 00:11:56,551
What do you what with Rurichiyo?

232
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:57,051
Talk!

233
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:04,318
-Ichigo!

234
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:12,485
-What the hell was that?

235
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:14,918
I lost consciousness for a sec.

236
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,585
-What's wrong, Ichigo?

237
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:18,085
Ah!

238
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:28,251
-What the hell is he doing?

239
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:29,918
-Something about that
Zanpakuto's power.

240
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:35,851
Be careful, Ichigo.

241
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:38,385
The light that
blade's reflecting,

242
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:40,851
it's not just
meant to bling you.

243
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,285
-Yeah, I figured.

244
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,851
-Ichigo!

245
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:54,718
Don't look into the light!

246
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:55,218
-Dammit.

247
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:00,318
-Ichigo.

248
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,085
I think we're dealing
with an assassin.

249
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:08,618
-An assassin?

250
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:12,251
Rukia!

251
00:13:15,951 --> 00:13:16,618
-Ichigo!

252
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:17,818
Try to take him alive.

253
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:20,851
We need to find out why
he was sent for Rurichiyo.

254
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:22,218
-I know that.

255
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,318
Dammit.

256
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:31,818
-Ichigo!

257
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:37,951
Don't look at that
light, Ichigo.

258
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,751
Keep your eyes on your opponent.

259
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:40,585
-Easy for you to say.

260
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:46,551
-Ichigo!

261
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:06,051
-I can take down guys like you
without even looking at you.

262
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:12,251
Your Zanpakuto reflects
the light of the moon

263
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:15,785
into your opponent's eyes,
momentarily dazing them.

264
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:28,051
But in order for
you to keep it up,

265
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:31,185
you always have to
attack your foe head on.

266
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:35,518
Once I figured that out,
you didn't stand a chance.

267
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:37,485
Now I want some answers here.

268
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:39,385
Why did you come here,
looking to Rurichiyo?

269
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:44,385
Start talking.

270
00:14:59,218 --> 00:14:59,751
What the hell?

271
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:05,751
-Did he take his own life?

272
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:07,251
-What?

273
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:09,851
-Either way,
Rurichiyo and her men

274
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:11,518
are tangled up in
something serious.

275
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:19,251
-You dealt with the
assassin, I see.

276
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:24,118
I have to compliment you on
your-- Why did you do that?

277
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:26,751
-For turning tail and leaving
us to do all your dirty work,

278
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:28,118
dammit!

279
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:30,285
-Why don't you tell us what
you've gotten us mixed up in.

280
00:15:34,818 --> 00:15:36,651
-I'll go find Orihime.

281
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,085
Probably a good idea to
call Uryu and Chad, too.

282
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:50,351
-Lady Rurichiyo Kasumioji is--

283
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,485
-What?

284
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:54,851
The Kasumioji?

285
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:57,018
As in the Kasumioji clan?

286
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:58,985
-You've heard of them, Rukia?

287
00:15:59,018 --> 00:16:00,051
-They're nobles.

288
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,551
Second only to the
four great noble clans.

289
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:06,251
-And that particular detail
didn't pop in your head

290
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,518
the first time her
name got tossed out?

291
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,451
-Rukia.

292
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,818
Rukia!

293
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:14,285
Am I to understand that you're
a member of the Kuchiki clan?

294
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:17,118
-Yes, that's correct.

295
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,518
-I, I beg your pardon.

296
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:20,451
I never imagined
I'd find a Kuchiki

297
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:22,451
living in a place like this.

298
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:24,151
-What, you too?

299
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:26,718
You expect me to believe that
you didn't recognize the name

300
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:28,951
Kuchiki until 10 seconds ago?

301
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:30,285
-Please, Ichigo.

302
00:16:30,318 --> 00:16:32,551
How are we supposed to get
to the heart of this matter

303
00:16:32,585 --> 00:16:34,585
if you keep butting in.

304
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,018
-Hey, what you blaming me for.

305
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:36,985
-That's all right.

306
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:40,785
No need to stand on ceremony.

307
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:43,085
-Lady Rurichiyo is the
sole legitimate heir

308
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,918
to the Kasumioji clan now.

309
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:51,085
Which wouldn't be a problem, if
her parents, the former heads

310
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:52,651
of the family, were alive.

311
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:58,585
Lady Rurichiyo's mother,
the previous matriarch

312
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,451
of the family, passed shortly
after her daughter was born.

313
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:09,718
Her father followed soon
after, taken by illness.

314
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,918
We've been her
guardians ever since,

315
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:14,585
standing in for the
parents she never knew.

316
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:21,085
-She hasn't taken her place
as the head of family yet?

317
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:21,985
-It's too soon.

318
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:23,218
She's still young.

319
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,185
We thought it better to
wait until she had a chance

320
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:26,285
to come of age.

321
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:31,151
But the situation is
more complicated now.

322
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:33,685
A man by the name
of Gyokaku Kumoi

323
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:36,185
is acting as temporary
viceroy for the clan.

324
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:41,551
Lately, vassals
under his service

325
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:42,551
have begun to disappear.

326
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:47,718
It seems he's been
disposing of anyone

327
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:49,385
who doesn't fall in line.

328
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:57,718
We believe he's been abusing
his station, using his influence

329
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:00,885
to seize control of
the Kasumioji clan.

330
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:04,251
-So a coup d'etat.

331
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:06,651
-More recently,
strange things have

332
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,218
been occurring around
Lady Rurichiyo.

333
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:21,085
-Then--

334
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:25,018
-Yes, Lady Rurichiyo is
the rightful heir to power.

335
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:28,085
She's standing in
Gyokaku Kumoi's way.

336
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:30,985
-So he means to
assassinate here.

337
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:31,918
-How cruel.

338
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:35,451
-Are you able to
prove any of that?

339
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:37,918
-The situation had
grown too precarious.

340
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,985
We needed to get Lady
Rurichiyo to safety.

341
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:48,451
We left, without telling a
soul, under the cloak of a fog

342
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:51,151
heavy night.

343
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:54,051
We passed through the
Kasumioji's personal Senkaimon,

344
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:55,585
and fled to the
world of the living.

345
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,147
-So that's why
the Soul phone had

346
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,113
no record of you crossing over.

347
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:04,513
-Yes, exactly.

348
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:06,080
As you know, the
Soul phones aren't

349
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:08,880
able to access any data that
pertains to private Senkaimon.

350
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:13,847
-Huh?

351
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,580
What's the matter?

352
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,980
-Ichigo Kurosaki.

353
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:20,713
Your reputation amongst the Soul
Society is clearly well earned.

354
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:22,913
Your strength is undeniable.

355
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:24,547
-Huh?

356
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,313
-There are sure to be more
assassins coming for her.

357
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:30,247
Members of a highly
specialized unit,

358
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,313
assembled by Gyokaku Kumoi,
using the Kasumioji clan's

359
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:34,913
vast political power.

360
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:36,780
Please, Ichigo,
won't you consider

361
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:39,947
being Lady
Rurichiyo's bodyguard?

362
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,213
-Wait, hold on a minute.

363
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,747
-I beg of you.

364
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,513
If word of this internal
strife were to get out,

365
00:19:45,547 --> 00:19:47,580
then I fear the
noble Kasumioji clan

366
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:50,547
would be in danger
of dissolution.

367
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,013
We simply can't turn to the
Court Guard Squads with this.

368
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:56,947
Luckily, however, you're
only a substitute.

369
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,680
Not an actual Soul Reaper.

370
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:00,913
-Lucky for you, maybe.

371
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:02,247
-Please!

372
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,247
We can't fend off Gyokaku
Kumoi's assassins on our own.

373
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,880
-Why don't we capture
one of his men,

374
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:12,880
and present him with
his own treacher?

375
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:15,947
-He'd just deny any
knowledge of them.

376
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,247
Not that it matters.

377
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,147
When they fail their
mission, they commit suicide.

378
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,380
Their methods are
chilling, and their skill

379
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:24,880
is a force to be reckoned with.

380
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:33,480
-You're doing it, Ichigo.

381
00:20:33,513 --> 00:20:35,013
I'll assist you as well.

382
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:36,047
-Lady Kichuki!

383
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,613
But we couldn't possibly
ask that of you.

384
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:39,547
-Nonsense.

385
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,513
Coming from a clan
much like hers,

386
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:43,813
I'm well versed in the
burdens of nobility.

387
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:44,813
You have my aide.

388
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,147
-Well that's that then, huh?

389
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,013
-You have our thanks.

390
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:56,513
There's just one other thing.

391
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:59,947
Lady Rurichiyo has no
idea she's being targeted.

392
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,847
And we'd like to
keep it that way.

393
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,413
It would traumatize
her, and she's

394
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:06,647
been through enough already.

395
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,980
She needs to be kept innocent
of all this, at any cost.

396
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:12,280
-What?

397
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:12,980
How do I?

398
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:13,680
-Forgive us.

399
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,947
-Ridiculous.

400
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,947
[music playing]

401
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:37,280
-Felled by a
substitute Soul Reaper?

402
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:38,180
-Yes, my lord.

403
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,080
And a very skilled one, at that.

404
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:44,813
-Why would this substitute
be aiding her, I wonder?

405
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,680
-I think it would be in our
interest to speed things up,

406
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:49,080
or we could run into problems.

407
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,713
-Very well, then.

408
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:54,013
I leave it to you.

409
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,713
Taking over a clan is more
labor-some than I imagined.

410
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:18,581
[theme music]

411
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:47,751
-So, Ichigo.

412
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:49,817
You're a bodyguard now?

413
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:52,384
-Yeah, I just sort
of stumbled into it.

414
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:53,717
-Rocking!

415
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:55,217
I don't know if I like the
idea of working for some kid,

416
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:56,451
but hey, I'm in baby!

417
00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:57,584
Whatever you need!

418
00:23:57,617 --> 00:23:58,417
-Cool!

419
00:23:58,451 --> 00:23:59,917
Keep an eye on the house, then.

420
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:03,451
-I-- Wait, again?
