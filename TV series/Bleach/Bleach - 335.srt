1
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,111
What happened here?

2
00:01:58,513 --> 00:02:01,386
That's right...

3
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:03,123
We lost.

4
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:22,631
[gasping]

5
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:25,637
I see you're finally
awake, Ichigo.

6
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,276
Kisuke, how long was I
out?

7
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:33,687
Easy now. You weren't
unconscious all that long.
Not much more than half a
day after you collapsed.

8
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,158
I see. What about the
others?

9
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:41,169
Well, they were badly injured,
no question about that, but
it looks like they'll
make it. Right now

10
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:44,743
Orihime is doing all she
can to bring them back to
full health.

11
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:46,747
That's good.

12
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:51,290
By the way, we didn't
want to worry your family
so we brought you here to
my place instead. I hope

13
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,595
that's okay with you.

14
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:56,468
Yeah. I appreciate it.

15
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,764
You still look pretty
tired. Why don't you
rest for a bit longer?

16
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:16,276
We can plan what we're
going to do after that.
Here, let me go make you
some tea.

17
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:20,885
Hey, Kisuke...

18
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,328
Did I... lose all my
Spirit Energy?

19
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:26,697
Yes.

20
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,605
That means... I can't
help Nozomi anymore,
doesn't it?

21
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:37,653
I guess it's all
over

22
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,359
I allowed Kageroza to
win.

23
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:44,702
Well... I wouldn't be
so sure just yet.

24
00:03:58,364 --> 00:03:59,231
Huh?

25
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:23,582
[grunting]

26
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:44,058
[gasping]

27
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:50,872
Head Captain Yamamoto has
gotten past the worst of
it.

28
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:56,450
However.. I'm sorry to say
that after assessing his
injuries, he won't be
returning to battle

29
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,687
any time soon.

30
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,056
That's not good news.

31
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,361
What's the prognosis on
everyone else?

32
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:04,969
As far as I can tell,
they're still
touch-and-go.

33
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:10,780
The wounds of Third Seat
Madarame and Fifth Seat
Ayasegawa are still
particularly severe, and

34
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:13,385
showing no signs of
improvement.

35
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:14,923
I see...

36
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:18,730
We just have to be
patient, and give it
time. We're doing
everything we can for

37
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:20,067
them at the moment.

38
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:22,539
That's fine. But what can
we do?

39
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:26,748
I mean.. Kageroza has
also suffered injuries.

40
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:28,083
We need to
finish him--

41
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:31,424
And is your plan to go
and face that man alone,
Lieutenant Abarai?

42
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,660
[sighing]

43
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:37,938
Knowing how he operates,
he's probably already
re-grouped his invading
army, somewhere in the

44
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,473
Soul Society.

45
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,110
Even so...!

46
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:47,057
I sympathize with you.
And I share your desire
to save that Mod Soul
girl. But right now, all

47
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,665
I can tell you, from my
position, is to stand by
and wait.

48
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,776
[grunting]
Yes, ma'am.

49
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:57,879
Mmm.

50
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,925
What's all this? Leaving
so soon?

51
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:05,929
But I brought you some
tea.

52
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:08,634
Thanks, but staying here
isn't going to help
anything.

53
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:15,783
Ichigo...

54
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:17,519
Huh?

55
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:19,891
Come with me. Let's take
a little walk.

56
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:36,559
I remember this place...

57
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:43,708
Hmm...

58
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:47,014
What? Okay, then how
'bout karaoke?

59
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:48,618
You mean just the two of
us?

60
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:50,455
Nah, I'll call over
some friends.

61
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:51,590
Who's gonna be there?

62
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:53,862
Atsuko and the others.
It'll be a party!

63
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,098
Can I also invite Yoshie?

64
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,701
The more, the merrier!

65
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:03,982
What a mess. I'm
powerless...

66
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:08,593
I...can't even protect
myself.

67
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:14,905
Tell me something,
Kisuke.

68
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:15,941
Yes?

69
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,986
My Spirit Energy... Is
there any way to get it
back?

70
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:25,661
Ichigo...!

71
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,737
Oh, hey you guys.

72
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:31,473
Ichigo...

73
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:34,647
Why the long faces?

74
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,150
Uh--

75
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,025
Is it because I lost my
Spirit Energy? If that's
the case, don't worry
about it.

76
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:47,774
Right now.. We have to
find a way to rescue
Nozomi. I do realize I
can't fight anymore...

77
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:52,150
...But in spite of that,
I want you to know, I'm
here to help any way I
can.

78
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:55,090
Ichigo...

79
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:57,995
Huh?

80
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,800
Hey there, Ichigo!

81
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,171
Huh? Wait a minute...!

82
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:04,242
How come.. I see you?

83
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,985
Why wouldn't you be able
to see us? I mean, we're
in our Gigai forms, aren't we?

84
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:11,123
Oh.. Of course.

85
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:16,535
Hey.. We came because we
were worried about how
you were doing. But you
seem to be just fine.

86
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:18,805
Well sorry to disappoint
you.

87
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:19,774
Uh--

88
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:21,778
What's wrong?

89
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:27,925
Listen. As you know, I
lost my Spirit Energy...

90
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,699
But trust me on this.. I
haven't lost my soul...

91
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:35,273
I might have to leave
the actual fighting
to you guys--

92
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,578
But I'm still here for
those who need help.

93
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:38,847
Are you a moron or
something?

94
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:40,551
Uh?

95
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:44,091
You're not the only one
who's dealing with Kageroza.
We're all in this together.

96
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,661
Well yeah, of course...

97
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:49,603
You're damn right! But
even so, you presumed we
thought you'd given up.

98
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:55,984
Don't be silly. If you
gave up, we wouldn't have
anybody to lead our little
group of misfits around.

99
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:57,620
So get over it.

100
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,094
Thanks, Rukia.

101
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:03,699
Uh!
[grunting]

102
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,137
Don't waste your breath
thanking us.

103
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,246
What did you do that
for?! I'm a normal
human right now!

104
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,718
We're supposed to go easy
on you?

105
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,592
Well you don't have to
break my leg to prove
your point! And what are
you nodding about?

106
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:18,630
I think you got exactly
what you deserved!

107
00:09:18,664 --> 00:09:20,934
Oh, so now you're ganging
up on me, is that it?!

108
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:29,586
[heavy breathing]

109
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:32,259
Are you all right, Master
Kageroza? You need
treatment, sir---

110
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:34,163
Get your hands off me!

111
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:41,745
I will now initiate the
fusion of Nozomi and
myself. Begin the
preparations!

112
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:46,288
Yes sir, right away. But
I must warn you, in your
current condition, there
might be excessive

113
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:47,991
post-fusion stress on the
Reigai---

114
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:52,101
Silence! Silence!
Silence!

115
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,039
He's waiting, patiently.

116
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:01,085
Nozomi and I must hurry.
We must become what we
were meant to be, as
quickly as possible!

117
00:10:03,157 --> 00:10:04,993
Here's how I see it...

118
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:10,138
We have to break into the
Soul Society as quickly
as possible. Kageroza now
has Nozomi in his

119
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:15,349
possession. The only good
thing about that is, it
means his attention has
shifted completely away

120
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,185
from us.

121
00:10:17,185 --> 00:10:21,795
Realistically, the people
here comprise our entire
fighting force. We have
no backup.

122
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:25,804
That's the absolute
truth. Against their
invading army, we're at a
disadvantage, with or

123
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:29,210
without you, Ichigo. So
you might as well relax.

124
00:10:29,243 --> 00:10:31,315
You're not helping us
here, Renji.

125
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:35,825
Hold on. I think we have
to consider the impact of
Ichigo's presence on all
this.

126
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:37,695
Huh?

127
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:42,205
We now know why Kageroza
was so tenacious in his
pursuit of Nozomi. But
there was something else

128
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:43,907
that's been bothering
me...

129
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:47,281
Why was he so concerned
about Ichigo, as well?

130
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:53,928
I thought it was because
he was constantly around
Nozomi, protecting her.

131
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:59,340
That was part of it, I'm
sure. But I think a much
bigger reason was
Ichigo's Hollow powers.

132
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:01,310
Why would that be so
important?

133
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:06,355
Here's why. Kageroza was
able to create a Soul
Reaper's Reigai...
employing just the

134
00:11:06,388 --> 00:11:08,960
tiniest amount of Reishi.

135
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,338
But he never created a
Reigai of Ichigo. He
personally confronted him
numerous times, and

136
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:19,883
though he studied him
carefully, he always kept
his distance. Apparently,
he somehow lacked the

137
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,787
ability to reproduce his
essence.

138
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,862
I get it. In spite of
everything, Kageroza is
unable to manipulate Hollow
powers.

139
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:29,937
And that's why he was
cautious around Ichigo.
Is that what's going on?

140
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,741
Yes.

141
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:36,083
Then that explains the
Cleaner. He used it to
attack Ichigo in the
Precipice World.

142
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:39,022
You have a point. In
fact, I got attacked
twice.

143
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:40,091
Really...?

144
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:46,738
That's right. The first
time it happened was when
I went in with you,
Rukia. We came under

145
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:49,043
attack, and I dropped my
Combat Pass.

146
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,482
I remember that.

147
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:55,958
The second time was when
I tried to re-enter the
Soul Society.

148
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,064
I got swallowed up by the
Cleaner.

149
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:04,075
It's weird. How did I
survive that experience?

150
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:07,048
Interesting question...

151
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:09,954
I believe I can see now,
what happened to you.

152
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:11,323
Huh?

153
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:15,565
Ichigo... I think there
might be a way to restore
your Spirit Energy.

154
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,538
Uh! Are you
serious?

155
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,959
You might be able to
restore Ichigo's Spirit
Energy?!

156
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:30,897
What in the world are you
talking about?

157
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,506
This is really just a
theory right now, but...
The Cleaner reacts to
Reishi and swallows its

158
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,517
victims. The time axis
inside the Precipice
World is isolated from
all other planes of

159
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:46,096
existence. So the
consumed Reishi remains
suspended there, without
ever dissipating. The

160
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:51,574
bottom line is, if I'm
right about my analysis,
it might very well exist
there for all of eternity.

161
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:57,352
Don't forget, folks..
Kageroza obtained
decades-old information
about Mod Souls from

162
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,089
inside there.

163
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:02,897
If Ichigo's Reishi is
still in there, we'll
need to collect it, then
use Kageroza's

164
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:08,977
Reigai-creation
technology in reverse, to
artificially re-create
Ichigo's Spirit Energy.

165
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,983
But that means we'd have
to---

166
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:15,891
That's right. We'll have
to break into the
Department of Research
and Development.

167
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:16,894
[gasping]

168
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:19,265
Oh please! Is that even
possible?

169
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,172
Not to mention this is
all based on theory.

170
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:26,379
Regardless.. We still
have the problem of how
we're going to collect
Ichigo's Reishi.

171
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:30,188
Once the Cleaner swallows
someone, that person is
dead, right?

172
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:36,467
That's what seemed
strange to me all this
time. Why don't we sense
any Spiritual Pressure

173
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:38,572
from Nozomi and Kageroza?

174
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:41,277
The answer will clear up
a lot of questions.

175
00:13:41,277 --> 00:13:45,152
There's only one way
Kageroza could have
obtained the Mod Soul
information from inside

176
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:48,158
the Cleaner, and still
live to talk about it...

177
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:53,202
He must have created a
special Reigai of himself
that shuts off his Spirit
Energy. The Cleaner then

178
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:55,874
wouldn't recognize him as
a living being.

179
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:58,546
[gasping]

180
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:04,024
If so... then Ichigo, who
lost his Spirit Energy,
might also be able to get
in and out of the Cleaner.

181
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,569
Does that sound like the
kind of action you might
be willing to risk...
Ichigo?

182
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:14,179
To be honest.. I don't
really understand it.

183
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:18,522
But I've been thinking.
and I can't come up
with any other way to
rescue Nozomi.

184
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:21,560
So I'll have to try it.

185
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:23,499
Mm.

186
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:32,951
Huh?

187
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:36,526
[gasping and grunting]

188
00:14:38,596 --> 00:14:40,200
Are you ready?

189
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,102
Yeah.

190
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:47,615
I'm attaching a
communication device.

191
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:51,457
In the event of an
emergency, I want you to
follow my directions.

192
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,361
You also need
to carry this.

193
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:57,370
I've calibrated it
very carefully, to respond
to the location of your Reishi.

194
00:14:58,237 --> 00:15:00,976
When you find it, push
the button at the bottom.

195
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:03,048
All right. Sounds easy
enough.

196
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:03,529
Hey!

197
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:04,484
Uh--

198
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:05,285
[grunting]

199
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:06,354
Kon!

200
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:09,293
Where do you think you're
going, in your
condition?!

201
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,264
Into the Cleaner, to
retrieve my Reishi.

202
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:14,204
Huh?! Are you crazy?!
What are you thinking?!

203
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:15,473
It's the only way...

204
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:16,442
Huh?

205
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:18,647
...to go and rescue
Nozomi.

206
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,582
[grunting]

207
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:22,387
See you.

208
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:24,325
You've gotta be crazy.

209
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:33,043
This whole thing is my
fault and you know it.

210
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:36,317
And if it is my fault,
then why is it that you
have to go?

211
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,252
Kon...

212
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:39,490
I'm a powerless being...!

213
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,997
I can't do anything! I
can't even protect
anyone!

214
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:48,275
I have to rely on you to
fight my battles for me!
I have to rely on everyone
else to protect me!

215
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:52,518
This.. whole.. situation
is my fault!

216
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:57,661
[sobbing]

217
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,797
Kon...

218
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,475
None of this is your
fault, trust me.

219
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:06,045
Uh?

220
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:11,690
Now stop crying and just
wait here. I'll be back,
I promise.

221
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,662
[grunting]

222
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:19,607
Take this.

223
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,180
What is it?

224
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:26,721
I don't see any point in
me keeping it.

225
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:29,427
A good-luck charm, eh?
Thanks.

226
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,242
Ichigo... Are you ready?

227
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:37,344
Yeah.

228
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,488
For the moment, you'll be
able to move fairly
freely inside the
Precipice World.

229
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:46,663
That being said, we don't
know exactly when the
Cleaner will make an
appearance, so please be

230
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:48,467
patient until it does.

231
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:50,504
I hear you.

232
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,532
Thank you for waiting,
Ichigo. It's coming.

233
00:17:07,674 --> 00:17:09,711
Distance, five hundred
meters.

234
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:12,851
Four hundred... Three
hundred... Two hundred...

235
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:14,120
One hundred...!

236
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:21,536
[roaring]

237
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:27,616
It scooped him up! The
plan's working.

238
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:30,254
So far, so good.

239
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:39,708
Kisuke was right. Without
my Spirit Energy, the
Cleaner doesn't register
me at all. But the

240
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:42,145
pressure in here is
overwhelming...!

241
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:47,557
How are you doing,
Ichigo? Check your
device. If your Reishi is
nearby, the collection

242
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,427
software should respond.

243
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:51,798
Looks like it's working.
I'm heading toward it!

244
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:53,235
[grunting]

245
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:59,649
[screaming]

246
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:00,885
Ichigo!

247
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:04,258
The Cleaner's movements
suddenly changed, without
warning.

248
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:05,828
What does that mean?!

249
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:10,171
As a response to
swallowing Ichigo, it
might be trying to expel
any foreign objects.

250
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:13,744
Ichigo! Abandon the plan!
Get yourself out of
there!

251
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:15,281
Ichigo...!

252
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:17,753
[grunting]

253
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:24,267
Get out of here? How am I
supposed to do that? No
way! I'm finishing this!

254
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,235
[gasping]

255
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:32,450
[grunting]
Damnit!

256
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:43,373
Ichigo. Ichigo! Hey,
Ichigo!!

257
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:48,250
Come on, answer me!
Ichigo!

258
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:53,795
Quit fooling around, you
idiot! You promised me
you'd come back! If you
lied to me, I'll never

259
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:57,603
forgive you, ever!
Ichigo!

260
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,743
Will you keep it down!

261
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:02,947
I can hear everything
you're saying!

262
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:07,457
I've got it! It's
working!

263
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:13,837
Okay!

264
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:16,375
Now to find a way out!

265
00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:19,682
Could that be it?

266
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:21,686
Only one way to find out.

267
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:27,933
What the hell?

268
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,274
Why is there... another
me in here?

269
00:19:36,918 --> 00:19:39,390
I don't know what's goin'
on!

270
00:19:39,924 --> 00:19:42,797
[yelling]

271
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:52,551
[panting]

272
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:53,820
Ichigo!

273
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,688
Huh?

274
00:19:56,827 --> 00:20:00,700
Yeah! I gotta admit, for
a minute there, you had
me worried!

275
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,872
Had you worried? How do
you think I felt?

276
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:05,410
Ichigo, what happened to
you, while you were in
there?

277
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:09,753
Well, to tell you the
truth, I don't really
know for sure. It all
happened pretty quickly.

278
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:14,663
I can't figure out how,
but there was another me
inside the Cleaner. I
thought I rescued him, but--

279
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:16,834
You're saying you rescued
another you?

280
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:18,605
Did you get bumped on the
head?

281
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:20,308
What are you trying to
say?!

282
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:23,416
Ah, yes. I think
I understand what
happened.

283
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:24,951
Well, tell me.

284
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:27,924
I believe what you saw
was the you who was
previously swallowed
by the cleaner.

285
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:29,795
Huh?

286
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:34,572
Basically, the time axis
inside the Cleaner itself
is isolated from all
other worlds. That means

287
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:38,847
anything swallowed by the
Cleaner cannot exist
within any other time
axis.

288
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:44,625
So you're saying he met
himself from the past,
inside the Cleaner?

289
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:49,535
Yes. Apparently, the
Ichigo from the present
was able to get in there
and save the Ichigo from

290
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:50,704
the past.

291
00:20:50,737 --> 00:20:53,711
All of this seems very
complicated, to me.

292
00:20:53,744 --> 00:20:56,116
That also explains the
Combat Pass.

293
00:20:56,885 --> 00:21:01,827
The Reigai was able to
obtain Ichigo's Combat
Pass before we even
arrived in the Soul

294
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:07,440
Society. I was wondering
how they pulled that off,
but this seems to be the
answer.

295
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:11,047
You're right. Everything
was done using the same
trick.

296
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:14,588
Please, stop! Enough
already. You lost me.

297
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:18,596
Anyway, I presume we can
now move on to the next
step, right?

298
00:21:18,631 --> 00:21:20,534
Let's go visit Kageroza.

299
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:22,437
Alright.

300
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:26,413
I came back, just like I
said I would.

301
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:30,621
Yeah. But in the end, I
couldn't do anything at
all to help you.

302
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,725
And what makes you think
that's true?

303
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:35,566
Huh? My charm?

304
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,607
Without this, I wouldn't
have been able to make it
back here safely. And I
wouldn't have had the

305
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,946
chance to save the other
me.

306
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:43,582
I owe that to you.

307
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:45,051
Ohh.

308
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:47,490
Hey! Stop
messing with me!

309
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,493
[chuckling]
How can you
say that?

310
00:21:49,527 --> 00:21:53,169
Cut that out! Keep away
from me, you! I'm a
dangerous being!

311
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:54,805
Now you're gonna get it!

312
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:57,645
Hey, that's my cotton!
Stop flattening me out!

313
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:06,095
Both time and space are
rightly aligned. So let
us begin...

314
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:08,433
[chuckling]

315
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:50,580
Captain Unohana, is there
anything you'll need
while you're here in the
World of the Living?

316
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:55,275
Not really. The Shinto
priest in the town
provides me with goods
whenever I whisper to him

317
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,576
during his sleep at
night.

318
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,275
He probably thinks you're
a deity, ma'am!

319
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:01,578
Well, I'm a Soul Reaper,
so he's not too far off.
