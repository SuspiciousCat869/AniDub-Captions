I know what I need,
A good, hot soak!

2
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,041
It's time.
I'm going to
be killed.

Lieutenant!

9

Was anyone injured
in the attack?

00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:33,873
No sir!

11
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:35,706
Good. You three can
handle it from here.

12
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,473
Sir! Where are you going?!

13
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:40,740
To where I'm needed.

No sir.

16
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:51,240
You seen him?

17
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:53,606
We're trying to find him, sir.
But we haven't seen or heard
from him yet.

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,406
That ass!

19
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,206
What should we do?

20
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,506
Y'know actually it's your
job to figure that out!

00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,406
Right! Yes sir!

22
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,573
Go to the Squad Six Barracks.
Try to track him down there.

Right!

Man! I've gotta think
out every move for them!

I see you're as
busy as usual,
you never slow down.

26
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:15,440
Sorry, Izuru.
I hate to keep
you waiting.

27
00:03:15,473 --> 00:03:18,873
Take your time.
I'll just enjoy some tea,
I'm in no hurry.

28
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,673
Hey! Get this over to
printing right away.

29
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:23,406
Yes sir!

Now what's this?...

31
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,406
Huh. The proposed Men's
Soul Reaper Association
budget for this term.

32
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,506
You can go ahead and stamp
it approved. It's been
checked out. It's accurate.

33
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,240
There's no way I'd
approve something without
going over it first.

34
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:43,206
Believe me, it's fine. The
Vice Chairman, Third Seat
Iemura, is very meticulous.

35
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,373
All right then.
It all looks correct
and in order.

36
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:49,706
<i>There. "Approved"!</i>

37
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:53,406
Thank you, Shuhei.
Well, I'll be on my way.

38
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:54,406
Not so fast.

39
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,306
Hm?

40
00:03:56,606 --> 00:03:57,906
What do you say we go
out for drinks tonight?

41
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,406
Great. Sounds like a plan.

<i>Table for two, please.</i>

44
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,640
Of course.
Just a moment.

45
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,940
[Retsu]
Well, Lieutenant Hisagi!
Good evening!

46
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,606
Captain Unohana.
Nice to see you.

47
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,373
What brings you
ladies here?

48
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,306
It's "Girls night out!"

49
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,706
Oh...

50
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,073
Ha ha ha ha!

51
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:24,873
Seeing you in person has just
reminded me that I haven't
thanked you properly

52
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:26,706
for what you did the
other day, Lieutenant.

53
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,473
"Thanked you"? I hope
you don't mind me
asking what you did?

54
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,606
I'll tell you!

55
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,940
He packed us up a
delicious lunch for the
girls' picnic outing!

56
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:35,573
What?

57
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,240
Heh. I'm afraid
it's true.

58
00:04:38,273 --> 00:04:40,440
And I have to admit I can
cook up quite a meal.

59
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,473
It was six outta ten!

60
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,906
The vegetables were
overcooked, the presentation
was awful and the--

61
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,373
Mmph!

62
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:48,940
[Isane]
What she's trying to say
is it was awfully good!

63
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:51,906
It was good, I mean really,
it tasted all right.

64
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,873
Ah-ha-ha-ha!
It was-"All right"?

65
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:57,540
Well thanks again.

66
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:58,340
Yes thanks.

67
00:04:58,373 --> 00:04:59,540
-Goodnight!
-Bye-bye!

68
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:00,706
[Isane]
That was fun.

69
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,373
[Yachiru]
Yup!

70
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:05,040
So tonight was
"Girls night out".

71
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:07,440
What do you think they
talk about when
they're out together?

72
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,740
Uhh...

73
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:13,073
[drunk]
You've got a problem!
You always take on
too much work!

74
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:18,040
Being a Lieutenant and
running the Seireitei
Bulletin would be enough
for any two guys.

75
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:22,540
So why'd you volunteer
to take on a chair
position in the Men's
Soul Reaper Association?

76
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:23,840
[I dunno]
Mmmm.

77
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:25,506
I do it because
I like it.

78
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,373
Well, I don't
like it one bit!

79
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,406
And what the hell do you
think you're doing packing
a picnic for the Women's
Soul Reaper Association?

80
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:34,240
Helping out.

81
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:37,640
They were busy, so I
made lunch for them.

82
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:40,473
See, when you have talents,
you should use them.

83
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,340
I'm thinking you did it to
get Rangiku's attention.

84
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:45,406
[spit take]
PFFBLT!

85
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,573
You're nuts!
I just enjoy my work!

86
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,773
And when you do your best,
There's a chance that some
people may notice.

87
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,406
It's true.

88
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,373
Once they see that,
They start thinking you
can handle anything,
and that's good right?

89
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:01,873
Hmf. Oh please, like those
ladies would notice.

90
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:05,640
They're just stringing you
along so you'll do their
dirty work for them.

91
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,973
Oh, shut up.

92
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,206
Excuse me!
More sake!

93
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:11,640
Coming up!

94
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,306
All right, now listen up.

95
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:20,040
We've had reports of the
disappearance of several
people in the Rukon District.

96
00:06:20,073 --> 00:06:23,106
So we've decided you
three will be sent
there to investigate.

97
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,706
[in unison]
Right!

98
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:27,406
And I suppose you'll
want me to be in
command of this detail,
that right?

99
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,573
No! No one needs
to be in charge.

100
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:34,406
Awwwww! But hold on!
I'm a natural leader
so I should be put
in charge!

101
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,273
Augh! How in the
world do you
come to such a
conclusion!?

102
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:42,706
Shuhei! You watch
this one and keep her
from doing anything
crazy. Understood?

103
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,440
Yes sir!

104
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:47,740
That is uncalled for!
When have I done anything
crazy on my own?

105
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:48,740
You always act crazy!

106
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:49,840
Hmf!

107
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:51,573
It's all right Rangiku,
it'll work out.

108
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:56,506
<i>This is great! Captain</i>
<i>Hitsugaya is trusting</i>
<i>me to handle this.</i>

109
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,140
<i>All that hard work</i>
<i>really is paying off.</i>

110
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:18,540
Oh! Sometimes that
Captain is just so
arrogant and rude!

111
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:22,406
These clouds look like
they're full of rain,
I think we'd better
pick up the pace.

112
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,606
No. Hold up. I'm feeling
tired. Let's take a break
and rest a few minutes.

113
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,340
We're almost there.
Besides, you rested
just a while ago.

114
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:35,506
It'd be better for us to
keep moving so we can
get to our destination
while it's still bright.

115
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,273
Awwh! This is unfair.
I should've been able
to come later with
Isane and the others.

116
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:46,906
Lieutenant Kotetsu's bringing
the complete rescue team, so
she has a lot of supplies and
people to move with her.

117
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,706
That's why we were
sent on ahead.

118
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,240
I know all that!

119
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,206
[Rangiku]
Ah!-It's raining!

120
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,073
Let's take shelter!

121
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:56,273
This is awful!

122
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,873
If we're here,
at this field on
the map,

123
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:22,006
then our destination
shouldn't be more than a
short walk away from here.

124
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,406
There's no point in
rushing in this rain.

125
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,440
It'll take time for Isane
and her group to catch up.

126
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,973
Why not take our
time to look around
and investigate
along the way?

127
00:08:31,306 --> 00:08:33,273
Hey! Looks like the rain's
stopped for now...

128
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,240
Huh?

129
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,806
<i>Isn't it lovely?</i>

130
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:52,040
Now stop looking so
serious over there and
come look at these
flowers with me.

131
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:53,940
Uh, sure!

[giggle]

133
00:08:57,473 --> 00:08:58,273
Hunh!

134
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,006
Wait a second. Here we are,
with no one else around, in the
middle of nowhere...

135
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,373
<i>Could it be possible</i>
<i>that Rangiku likes</i>
<i>being alone with me?</i>

136
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:11,873

<i>Is something wrong, Shuhei?</i>

00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,606
Uh no! No, there's
nothing wrong, uh-uh!

<i>Stay focused,</i>

Oh wow! All this nature
really relaxes a guy!

00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:47,206
Uh! Oh yeah!
The scenery
here's beautiful.

146
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,973
Agreed! We've worked
quite hard for years
to keep the landscape
looking just this way.

147
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:57,473
Oh! Well...

148
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,840
Shuhei!

00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:00,306
Ah!! What is it!?

150

Hi there.
Do you live
nearby?

151
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
I do. I run that
country inn right
over there.

00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,640
[Rangiku]
Oh, is that so?
Well, then!

153
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:14,540
What do you think?
Since we're tired,
shall we spend the
night there?

154
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:15,473
Dah'rr!

155
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,206
So! Do you have a room?

156
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,340
<i>Yes.</i>

157
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:19,473
Whoa Rangiku!
Wait a minute!

158
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:22,240
I don't think it would be
right for us to do that!

159
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:24,273
Oh come on.
What's the problem?

160
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:28,406
We're out here on a mission
and sleeping at the inn will
be much more comfortable.

161
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,273
I don't want to
sleep outside.

162
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:32,606
Uh, yeah but what
will people think?!

163
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,240
What people?
Lead the way.

164
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:35,306
Right.

165
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:37,740
Now come
along, Shuhei!

166
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:39,240
But I!
Wait!

167
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:49,206
Hey! Look at this!

168
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:54,873
[uncomfortable grunts]

169
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,773
This room is so big,
and nice!

170
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:00,040
<i>Excuse me!</i>

171
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:03,506
Shall I make
you some tea?

172
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,340
No! We can make our own.

173
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,173
Very well then.

174
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:07,540
I can handle it.

175
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:11,373
She's our hostess and
we are guests here.

176
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:13,773
So why don't you let
her make us some tea?

177
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,840
I thought--

178
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:15,873
Let her do it.

179
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:17,273
Well, alright.

180
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,540
What's got Rangiku so wound up?

181
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:25,140
<i>Could she be jealous?!!</i>

182
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,740
<i>Come to think of it, when this</i>
<i>lady showed up and we started</i>
<i>talking, Rangiku kinda pushed</i>
<i>herself between us.</i>

183
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:36,440
<i>No, can't be.</i>

184
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:40,573
Shuhei!. You look like
you're out of it.
I bet this tea will help.

185
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:42,106
Uh, sure!

186
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:45,440
Enjoy.

187
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:46,773
Oh. Thanks.

188
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,106
Ow!

189
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,906
Oh I'm sorry!
Was the cup too
hot to hold on to?!

190
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,540
Well yeah but, I'm fine.
Really I'm okay.

191
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:56,540
I'm so sorry.
Can I do
something to--

192
00:11:56,573 --> 00:12:00,906
Oh no! We have to cool it down!
Does your hand hurt really bad?

193
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,106
It's fine.

194
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:05,273
Let's be safe,
would you please
get us some cold
water?

195
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:07,073
Yes! I'll get
it right away!

196
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,206
Uh, Rangiku,
your hand...

197
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,406
Uh, It's that you're
holding my... hand.

198
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:19,873
Listen. Don't let
your guard down
with that woman.

199
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,206
Say what?

200
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,106
Just do as I say,
all right?

201
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:25,240
Uh... Sure.

202
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,773
<i>I knew it! Rangiku's</i>
<i>jealous that the</i>
<i>innkeeper is into me.</i>

203
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:32,940
<i>I guess she sees me as</i>
<i>more than just a friend.</i>

204
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,073
<i>[Rangiku]</i>
<i>[sigh of satisfaction]</i>
<i>Aaahh!</i>

205
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:40,973
Oh! I stuffed myself!

206
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:44,273
Hey wait! How come
you haven't eaten
anything, Shuhei?

207
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:47,040
Uh, I got distracted.

208
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:50,706
<i>Damn! I couldn't get a bite</i>
<i>down with her sitting there.</i>

209
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:52,573
You really need to eat.

210
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,040
Huh?

211
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,973
So you're prepared for
anything that happens tonight.
I want you to be ready.

212
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,040
Wha!?!

213
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:02,206
[sultry]
So you're prepared for

I want you to be ready...

215
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
Right! Sure!!

216
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,606
[proprietress]
Excuse me!

217
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,106
I came to clear
your trays for you.

218
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,406
Oh sorry.
I'll be done
very soon!

219
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,973
Shuhei. You don't need
to be so accommodating.

220
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:21,906
Keep in mind, we are
the guests here.

221
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,906
I know, but--

222
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,706
No, take your time please.
Enjoy your meal.

223
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,773
Say! Is the wooden
bathtub that's just
outside our room for us?

224
00:13:29,806 --> 00:13:32,073
Yes it is, feel
free to use it.

225
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:33,140
That's great!

226
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,106
I'll fill the
tub for you.

227
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:43,073
Oh! It feels just right!

228
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:52,006
This proves it. Rangiku's
so jealous she's found a
way to get my attention.

229
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,240
<i>Heh! I can tell she's</i>
<i>falling for me.</i>

230
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,106
<i>Whoa! No-no-no!-Stop thinking</i>
<i>like that! This is business.</i>

231
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,840
<i>We are both here</i>
<i>on a mission!</i>

232
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:03,940
<i>I've gotta keep this</i>
<i>on the up and up!</i>

233
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,673
<i>After all, work</i>
<i>comes first!</i>

234
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:09,873
<i>Let's face it, I'm</i>
<i>quite a prize. But I'm</i>
<i>focused on our mission!</i>

235
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:14,040
I know what I need.
A good, hot soak!

236
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,206
[many echoes]
I know what I need.
A good, hot soak!

RAAAGH!

240
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:44,979
There!
Now I'm all set!

241
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,879
See ya.
I'm headed for the tub.

242
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:49,813
Sounds good.

243
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:54,979
Oh and, I'm quite sure
you already know this,

244
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:56,146
D'eegh!

245
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,413
But if you peek at me,
I'll kill you.

246
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:01,979
Sure! Right!

247
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,113
Rrmm! Come on now.
pull it together Shuhei.

248
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,213
<i>All right, let's assess</i>
<i>what's happened so far.</i>

249
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:20,046
<i>We got caught in the rain,</i>
<i>the night was coming and we</i>
<i>needed a dry place to sleep.</i>

250
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,146
<i>By an amazing stroke of luck,</i>
<i>this inn was nearby and we</i>
<i>decided to stay the night.</i>

251
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:27,813
<i>Okay, I get it. Sleeping</i>
<i>here was a logical</i>
<i>choice that she made.</i>

252
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:31,946
<i>And really, Rangiku had no</i>
<i>other choice but to spend</i>
<i>the night here with me.</i>

253
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:34,246
<i>That has to</i>
<i>be all it is.</i>

254
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,813
<i>And Rangiku isn't jealous</i>
<i>of the innkeeper, she was</i>
<i>just concerned for me.</i>

255
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,479
By the way, Rangiku!
Where exactly am I
sleeping tonight?

256
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:45,213
I mean, we're not going
to be staying in the
same room, are we?

257
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:48,779
We're together. I asked
earlier to have our
bedding set out together.

258
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:51,313
Whaaat?!

259
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:54,746
Mmmf!

260
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:57,813
<i>Why do you ask?</i>
<i>Do you mind sharing</i>
<i>a room with me?</i>

261
00:15:58,513 --> 00:16:00,646
Uh, no-no-no-no!
It's no problem at all!

262
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,946
<i>Well I'm glad</i>
<i>to hear that.</i>

<i>Ahh, the water</i>
<i>feels so good.</i>

265
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:12,746
D'aagh...

266
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,946
<i>What's going on in there?</i>
<i>Why are you sighing?</i>

267
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:18,779
[loud]
I'm uh, relaxing!
How's the weather out there!?

268
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:21,113
<i>There's a lovely</i>
<i>moon out.</i>

269
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,879
Oh great!
that sounds nice!

270
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:26,546
The breeze feels perfect.
Nothing beats bathing
like this!

271
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,146
Gee, I'm glad
you're enjoying it!

272
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,779
<i>You must be tired.</i>
<i>Why don't you come</i>
<i>in, too?</i>

273
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:33,613
Uh?

274
00:16:33,646 --> 00:16:35,379
<i>You work so hard and</i>
<i>you haven't had a</i>
<i>day off in weeks.</i>

275
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:38,813
<i>You really need to</i>
<i>learn to rest, or</i>
<i>you'll end up worn out.</i>

276
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:43,946
<i>Did you hear that?</i>
<i>She's worried about me.</i>

277
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:48,879
<i>See! My colleagues</i>
<i>do care about me.</i>

278

<i>They're all watching</i>
<i>out for me.</i>

<i>What a great bunch!</i>

00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,913
<i>And Rangiku understands</i>
<i>me and my needs as well.</i>

281
00:16:56,846 --> 00:16:57,813
Huh?

282
00:16:58,246 --> 00:16:59,913
<i>Why don't you come in, too?</i>

283
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:07,979
<i>She just said, "Why don't you</i>
<i>come in, too?", Didn't she?</i>

00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:12,946
<i>So does she mean, she wants</i>

00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:27,979
But if you peek at me,
I'll kill you.

<i>trying to be playful?</i>

[chuckle] But if you peek at me,
I'll kill youo~

291
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:39,246
<i>So then by saying "I'll kill</i>

<i>"I'm inviting you"!?</i>

292
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:43,579
[extra sultry]
I swear I'll kill you!

<i>No no! She didn't mean that!</i>

<i>Then why the hell did</i>
<i>she say "Come in"!?</i>

Very well.

00:18:13,813 --> 00:18:16,413
It's time. I'm going
to be "killed."

300
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:18,279
Eh?

301
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:20,746
Now growl!

302
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:21,613
Whoaa!

303
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:22,613
Haineko!!

304
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:31,246
Come on Shuhei!
Get moving!!

305
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,613
Whoa!!

306
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:36,613
The hell?!

307
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,646
[moaning]

308
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:44,413
RWWAAHGGH!

309
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:45,313
A Hollow!

310
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:48,246
Looks like we've
found the culprit in
those disappearances!

311
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:48,813
Uh!

312
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:07,246
Growl! Haineko!

313
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:19,346
And reap! Kazeshini!

314
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:39,813
You did it Shuhei!

315
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,613
Uh thanks, but
please explain what
just happened?

316
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:47,613
Our innkeeper lady friend was
the one who was attacking all
those people who disappeared.

317
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:48,479
Whaa?!

318
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:53,779
I had my suspicions, but I'll
admit when we came here to
investigate, I was surprised.

319
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:56,813
I didn't expect her to
engage us so quickly.

320
00:19:56,846 --> 00:20:02,113
And another thing I found
intriguing, was the fact
that she was sending you
such strange Spirit Energy.

321
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:03,613
Spirit Energy!?

322
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:05,479
So then you weren't
feeling it?

323
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:07,746
Not at all.

324
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:13,379
I knew it. You see, the
report said only good-looking
men were being attacked.

325
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:14,746
That's why I chose you.

326
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,779
My plan needed handsome bait
to bring out that Hollow.
You worked great!

327
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:22,246
What?! You used me as bait!??

328
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:25,646
"To deceive your enemy,
you have to deceive
your friend first."

329
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,013
I planned to set the trap
for this creature after
Isane and the others got
here and were settled.

330
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,679
But when she saw you,
she snapped at the bait.

331
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,113
Hey! What's the matter?

332
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:38,046
How could you?
You used me.

333
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,779
Oh, don't think
of it that way.

334
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:42,846
You were the only one
who could help pull off
this mission, Shuhei.

335
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,513
There aren't any other hot
looking guys with the great
skills you have. Hee!

336
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,113
<i>[Izuru]</i>
<i>So you just let her</i>
<i>get away with that?!</i>

337
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,746
Once she explained how
I led to the mission's
success, I felt good.

338
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:09,513
So then, you think
she really meant
what she said?

339
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,579
I think she was playing
you like you've never
been played!

340
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,613
Well I don't quite see
her the way that you do.

341
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:16,879
I don't know...

342
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:18,046
<i>[Yachiru]</i>
<i>Yoo hoo!</i>

343
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:18,713
Huh?
Huh?

344
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:19,646
Yachiru!

345
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:25,146
Hey Shuhei! Kenny busted
up a wall! And I thought
you could be the one to
help us to fix it!

346
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:26,246
But why me?

347
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,413
Because I heard if we ever
need help, we should ask a
handsome guy like you.

348
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:33,613
Guess Rangiku's been
telling the ladies
how great you are.

349
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:35,613
Yup! And she said,

350
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:40,313
Shuhei is the only guy that
I can really count on.

351
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:42,313
You're cool! [giggle]

352
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:48,013
Hmm! Yeah. So Rangiku's
counting on me again?

353
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:51,579
Heh. She knows
who the man is.

354
00:21:51,613 --> 00:21:52,613
Huh?! Are you
kidding?!!

355
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,946
Let's fix that wall!
Lead the way!

356
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,479
Yay! [chuckle]

357
00:22:01,346 --> 00:22:02,613
He's hopeless.

358
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:51,002
<i>[Yachiru]</i>
<i>That Shuhei sure has</i>
<i>proven his title as the</i>
<i>Best Male Soul Reaper!</i>

359
00:23:51,235 --> 00:23:54,169
<i>[Izuru]</i>
<i>That's impressive.</i>
<i>Guess I have a lot to</i>
<i>learn from that guy.</i>

360
00:23:54,202 --> 00:23:56,802
<i>[Yachiru]</i>
<i>Yup, he's great!</i>

361
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:00,269
<i>In our last Girls' Night out,</i>
<i>he was unanimously voted as</i>
<i>our "Most Useful Errand boy".</i>

362
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:01,469
<i>[Izuru]</i>
<i>That's his title?!</i>
