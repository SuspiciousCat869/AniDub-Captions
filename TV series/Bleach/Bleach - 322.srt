Come on, where are
you going, anyway?!

3
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:12,173
In case you didn't notice,
I'm talking to you!
Will you wait up a sec--

4
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:13,173
Ow!

5
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:18,406
That hurt, lady!
Why did you stop
so suddenly?!

6
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,206
I don't know.

7
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:19,939
Huh?

8
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:23,506
Where am I supposed to go?

9
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:25,173
What are you
talking about?!

10
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:28,839
You mean you've been
walking around without any
idea where you're going?!

11
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:31,139
Aah!

12

(Small effort as she hits Kon

Oof!

15
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,039
Leave me alone. pervert.

16
00:02:41,373 --> 00:02:43,339
I keep telling you, lady,
I am not a pervert!

17
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,473
I do have...
a place to go.

18
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:46,806
Huh?

19
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:50,706
I just can't remember...
where it is.

20
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:52,739
Wh--? Wha?!

21
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,406
But... Wait!

[choked]

23
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,339
I can see now that I was right.
There's a certain majestic
quality to your skin.

24
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:10,873
I wanted to try it
before this, but I
didn't want to damage my
own body in the process.

25
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:15,139
I'm so glad you
became available for
the experiment.

26
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:18,373
Looks like their battle's
about over as well.

27
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,739
Hah. What a bust.
I thought you'd put up
more of a fight.

28
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:32,106
Egh... Damn you!

29
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:34,973
What do you think?
Should we finish
them off?

30
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,673
Might as well,
they're done anyway.

31
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,006
[gasping breath]

32
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:41,873
Who was that?!

33
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:46,139
Are you people... Reigai?

34
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:49,373
Oh! So you know
about us, do ya?

35
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:50,473
Don't move!

36
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,706
Like hell!

37
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:52,739
Rgh!

38
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:56,106
Forget about it, Ikkaku.

39
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:59,639
<i>There's no point wasting</i>
<i>our time, fighting these</i>
<i>weaklings anymore.</i>

40
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:03,539
We need to start looking
for Nozomi Kujo.

41
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:05,439
Heh! I guess you're right.

42
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:06,939
Hey!

43
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:11,006
[gasp]

44
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:12,706
Orihime, what is it?

45
00:04:13,106 --> 00:04:14,573
The battles seem
to have ended.

46
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,573
Can you tell
what happened?

47
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:22,173
I'm not sure. The Spiritual
Pressures remaining are
the weak ones.

48
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,606
And I think
Uryu's there too.

49
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,506
Are you saying that the real
Ikakku and the other Soul
Reapers have been defeated?

50
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:33,473
<i>[Chad]</i>
<i>If they were, I'm sure</i>
<i>Uryu is probably attending</i>
<i>to them right now.</i>

51
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:46,106
Once I return and I
have retrieved Nozomi,

52
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:52,906
<i>not only the Soul Society,</i>
<i>but also the World of the</i>
<i>Living, will be forced to</i>
<i>exist under my control.</i>

53
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:58,173
Someday quite soon,
we will meet again.

54
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,773
There's no way I'll ever
allow his plan to succeed!

55
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:07,206
To start with, we
have to find Nozomi,
and fast!

56
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,039
Mm.
Mm.

57
00:05:09,273 --> 00:05:10,106
[gasp]

58
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:11,506
What is that?

59
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:12,906
Something wrong?

60
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,873
There's another
Spiritual Pressure.

61
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:18,206
More of them?
Oh, great,
who is it now?

62
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:26,639
I see. So, it's you, Izuru.
I assume you're here to
fight me?

63
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,273
I don't really want to,
but given the situation,
I don't have much choice.

64
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,239
Huh! Don't you remember,
you've lost to me once already.

65
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:41,906
<i>I remember it very well,</i>
<i>but this will be different.</i>

66
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:42,473
Uh?

67
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:47,339
You see, I'm not the same person
you fought back then.
Literally.

68
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:50,506
Don't expect the same
results this go-around.

69
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,439
Just as I remembered.
You're very good.

70
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:19,139
You don't seem any different
than you were before.

71
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:21,406
Hm. Now naise your head.

72
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:23,639
Wabisuke!

73
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:25,739
[gasp]

74
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:36,173
<i>I assume you're familiar,</i>
<i>of course, with the power</i>
<i>of my Zanpakuto, Wabisuke?</i>

75
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:40,139
As I recall, it doubles the
weight of whatever it strikes.

76
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:46,806
<i>That is correct. Eventually,</i>
<i>the opponent, unable to bear</i>
<i>the weight, ends up</i>
<i>collapsing on the ground.</i>

77
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,539
With his head bowed down,
as if in penitence.

78
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:53,273
That's why it's called
'Wabisuke'. I get it.

79
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:53,739
[gasp]

80
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:12,739
I think you've forgotten
something. My Zanpakuto isn't
affected by yours.

81
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,839
No matter how many times
you strike it, the weight
stays the same!

82
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:20,739
Now growl... Hainek--
Egh...

83
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:23,106
[clang!]

84
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:31,606
How were you able to do that?

85
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:33,339
<i>Easy.</i>

86
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:34,939
How many times did you block me?

87
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:39,239
Three times! There's no
way it could become that
heavy from three strikes!

88
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:39,873
Heh.

89
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:46,239
When Kageroza created us,
he improved our powers.
The original Zanpakuto doubled
the opponent's weight.

90
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:52,739
But with Kageroza's technical
expertise, he was able to
vastly increase its capacity.

91
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:55,617
This Zanpakuto can
increase the weight...

92
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:57,684
... by as much as tenfold.

93
00:07:58,051 --> 00:08:00,217
By... tenfold?

94
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:06,851
<i>In other words, if you took</i>
<i>three strikes, your weapon</i>
<i>now weighs one thousand</i>
<i>times its original weight.</i>

95
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:10,584
Which makes it essentially
useless, as you now know!

96
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:13,751
There's no escape!

97
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:18,284
Waagh!

98
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:23,617
Hado Number Thirty One!

99
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:37,117
[breath] For Izuru's
impostor, you're strong.

100
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,117
<i>An impostor, you said?</i>

101
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:40,584
You heard me!

102
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:43,051
That's interesting.

103
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:47,884
We possess the same memories as
the originals, and what's more,
our powers are much greater.

104
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:53,151
Since we 'impostors' are
superior to the originals,
is it really fair,

105
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:56,084
... to dismiss us as nothing
more than 'phonies'?

106
00:08:56,551 --> 00:09:01,684
<i>I think we should be</i>
<i>considered the embodiment</i>
<i>of these characters, not</i>
<i>the so-called 'originals'.</i>

107
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:05,017
<i>I don't know how you feel,</i>
<i>and I don't really care.</i>

108
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:07,017
I know this.

109
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:10,384
In the final assessment,
only the superior will survive.

110
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:14,817
[gasp]

111
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:32,451
Game over. This will be
a fitting end for you.

112
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:36,784
Oh really? I'm not sure you have
the strength to pull this off.

Ugh! Say your goodbyes,
Lieutenant Matsumoto!

The Spiritual Pressure from
that direction disappeared!

But now, one has
shown up even closer.

Hm? Who's there?!

Are you... my Reigai?!
You really do look like me!

Squad Eight Captain Shunsui
Kyoraku was caught red-handed,
altering Precipice World

That is a Class
One felony!

147
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:58,184
It is also sufficient evidence
to regard him as a suspect in
other acts of sabotage!

148
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:05,051
By being able to control the
Precipice World, he can cut
the Soul Society off from
the World of the Living!

If that were to happen,

00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:19,584
<i>Captain Ukitake!</i>

155
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:24,284
<i>Let me remind you that</i>
<i>decisions of the Central</i>
<i>Forty-Six are absolute!</i>

156
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:28,084
<i>Once a determination</i>
<i>has been made in a</i>
<i>particular inquiry,</i>

157
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:31,884
<i>you should be aware</i>
<i>that even captains are not</i>
<i>allowed to dispute it.</i>

158
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,151
<i>You will now leave</i>
<i>this chamber.</i>

159
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:34,817
Tch!

160
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,517
The Central Forty-Six are a
bunch of pig-headed idiots!

161
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:45,717
[Unohana]
You can't blame them,
you know.

162
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:46,572
Huh?

163
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:49,184
The evidence is there,
in plain sight.

164
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:53,351
As a result, there's no
reason for the Central
Forty-Six to listen to you.

165
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:59,617
Captain Unohana, I'm positive
this incident is a conspiracy,
arranged by someone.

166
00:12:59,984 --> 00:13:05,817
Yes. And on the surface at
least, it appears to be a very
well-conceived operation.

167
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:08,651
Any idea who might
be behind it?

168
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:11,451
Not yet. We've just
begun to look.

169
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:13,784
It appears to me,

170
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:16,451
that we're up against
someone of great cunning,

171
00:13:16,484 --> 00:13:18,617
who won't give himself
away very easily.

172
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:22,451
But be assured, we will
find him, eventually.

173
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:28,017
I understand. However, I may
conduct my own investigation.

174
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:33,017
If you do so, captain,
I urge you to be very
careful.

175
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:42,684
<i>[Unohana]</i>
<i>We must trust no one</i>
<i>but ourselves.</i>

176
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:47,617
<i>And even taking precautions,</i>
<i>it may already be too late.</i>

177
00:13:58,115 --> 00:13:59,015
She's not here.

178
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:01,215
Where could she
have possibly gone?

179
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:05,015
I don't understand.
Why does Nozomi keep
trying to run away?

180
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,915
Do you think it's because she
feels she can't rely on us?

181
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,749
Or is it something else?
Maybe she doesn't want to
cause us trouble.

182
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:16,249
Maybe it's just to escape...
you know, from the enemy.

183
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:17,149
Uh!

184
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:18,715
That's what I
think, anyway.

185
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:22,449
What other reason would she
have to come all the way to
the World of the Living?

186
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:24,882
She knows a
place to hide.

187
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:26,982
Maybe, but where?

188
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,315
Hmm.

189
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:34,882
[Kon]
Come on, Nozomi!
Enough is enough!

190
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:38,949
What's gonna happen if you
get caught again by the
guys who are after you?!

191
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:43,582
If you stay with Ichigo and
the others, at least you know
you'll be protected! Hey!

192
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:46,149
Why would they protect me?

193
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:49,015
What do you mean?
What kind of
question is that?

194
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:53,049
Would they be doing it
for the Soul Society?
Or the World of the Living?

195
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:54,082
<i>None of that!</i>

196
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:58,282
You don't understand anything,
and on top of that, you're in a
big load of trouble!

197
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:01,749
Yeah, walk away!
I don't care what
happens to you anymore!

198
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:04,949
That's it! I'm
completely through
with you! Hmpf!

199
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,649
Aren't you even the
least bit upset?!

200
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:12,649
[gasp]

201
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:14,315
What are you doing?!

202
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,415
We're going back!
Even if I have to
drag you there!

203
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:18,582
Get off me!

204
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:21,049
No way!
I'm dragging you back!

205
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:23,582
You forced me into this!
Do you give up yet?!

206
00:15:23,915 --> 00:15:28,215
You're nuts! Quit
sneaking a peek up my
skirt! And let go!

207
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:31,849
You have to go back to Ichigo!
He's the only one who can
protect you!

208
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:33,349
That won't be necessary.

209
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:34,015
Huh?

210
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:36,882
I'll fix things so he
doesn't need to protect me.

211
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:38,382
What are you talking about?

212
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:41,682
That's why I came here,
to Karakura Town...

213
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:53,549
Nice move. You're not too bad,
for an impostor.

214
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:57,049
I must say, it's an honor to
be praised by the original.

215
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:00,215
But I think you'll find,
I'm even better than you think!

216
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:02,549
<i>This is crazy!</i>

217
00:16:03,982 --> 00:16:06,115
<i>She does seem to have greater</i>
<i>fighting ability than I do!</i>

218
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:08,382
<i>How am I going to be able</i>
<i>to overcome her advantage?</i>

219
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:11,815
Lieutenant Kurotsuchi?

220
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:13,815
Rukia Kuchki.

221
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:18,382
You're a Reigai, too?!

222
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:32,649
Augh!

223
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:39,849
<i>They're teaming up</i>
<i>to finish me off!</i>

224
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,349

<i>has the speed.</i>

225
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:45,015
<i>I don't have a chance against</i>
<i>the two of them together!</i>

226
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,515

<i>You're not getting</i>
<i>away from us!</i>

227
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:57,849
That's fine! I wasn't
planning on running off!

228
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:09,982
<i>Her reactions are so fast!</i>
<i>I'm in trouble if I don't</i>
<i>find some way to distract her!</i>

229
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,215
(Effort as she lands, followed
by startled breath as she turns)

00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:18,015
(Pain reax as she gets kicked by
the real Nemu, followed by
efforts as she flips and lands)

231
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:18,649
Huh?
Huh?

232
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:26,082
Time to end this!
Dance! Sodenoshirayuki!

233
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:28,715
Somenomai! Tsukishiro!

234
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,349
Dance! Sodenoshirayuki!
Somenomai--

235
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:32,649
Too slow!

236
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:44,149
Haugh!

237
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,382
Master... Mayuri.

Hm?

00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,315
This must be their essence.

241
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:19,015
Huh?

242
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:34,915
Let that be a lesson
to you, Reigai!

243
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:36,482
<i>Are you all right?</i>

244
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,449
Lieutenant Kurotsuchi!

Lieutenant
Matsumoto!

247
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:49,615
So, you were able
to destroy her?

248
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:50,515
Yes.

249
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:51,515
Mm.

250
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:55,215
[Kon]
Hey, give it up already!
I'm not letting go!

251
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:56,749
Hope you have a strong grip.

252
00:18:58,182 --> 00:18:58,949
Ow!

253
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:08,482
Gaaah! My eye is hanging by
a thread! I have to get to
a sewing machine! Huh?

254
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,415
What's that look about?

255
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:16,682
I know now,
where I have to go.

256
00:19:16,982 --> 00:19:19,449
Really?! Is it
someplace close by?

257
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:23,349
I hope we can get there
by walking! I don't have
a driver's license!

258
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:27,882
And once you've visited the
place, we can both hurry
back to Ichigo! Right?

259
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:28,949
Eagh!

260
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:32,949
Easy with that ear!
I have no way to replace
it if you tear it off!

261
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:35,749
I must find the gate.

262
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:39,315
Which gate? The shrine
gate right here?

263
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:41,182
No, it's not this one.

264
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:45,182
Is there a place somewhere
in town that has a lot of
these gates, all in a row?

265
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:50,082
Somewhere that has a
lot of... these gates...

266
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:51,815
Ah - haaa!

267
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:53,749
<i>There is such a place!</i>

268
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:57,682
It's a shrine in
the mountains!
I've been there before!

269
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:59,149
Show me how to get there.

270
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:02,215
Ah ha ha ha! You
finally decided you
need me, right?!

271
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:04,915
If you were smart, you
would have accepted my
help from the beginning,
instead of--!

272
00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:05,949
Ow!

273
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:07,715
Stop doing that! It hurts!

274
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:09,115
Let's get moving!

275
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:11,415
I don't have to take
orders from you!

276
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:12,549
It's this way.

00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:37,282
About time you showed up.
You here to bust me out?

281
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:39,615
We're going to see
Master Genryusai.

282
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:42,582
We need to report what's
going on and get his input.

283
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:47,515
I guess. They certainly
don't make these cells very
comfortable for sleeping.

284
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,315
This place was literally
a pain in my butt.

285
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:54,115
This is no time for jokes.
We have to get you out of
here, right now.

286
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:55,682
Here's your sword.

<i>the search for Nozomi Kujo.</i>

That's a good idea.

Mm.

00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:10,449
I still can't sense the
girl's Spiritual Pressure.

293
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:12,315
Any ideas on where
we should start?

294
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:13,549
No, sorry.

295

Almost too easy.

Stop, Shunsui.

00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:46,749
Huh?

306
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:51,749
That's not the job
we're here for.

307
00:21:52,382 --> 00:21:56,382
We have to go. We have other
matters to attend to.

308
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:50,093
[Orihime]
Ichigo! I've come up with a
plan to get Nozomi's attention!

309
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:51,393
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>What is it?!</i>

310
00:23:51,427 --> 00:23:53,827
[Orihime]
First we get a cat. Then we
place it here, and then...

311
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,293
<i>[Chad]</i>
<i>[chuckles] Kitty, aww!</i>

312
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:59,160
<i>Kitty! He he he he!</i>
<i>That's odd. I thought</i>
<i>for sure Nozomi would</i>
<i>go for the cat.</i>

313
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:01,260
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Okay, that's it.</i>
<i>I'm going home!</i>
