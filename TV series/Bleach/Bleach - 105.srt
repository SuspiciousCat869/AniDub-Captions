[theme music]

2
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:08,407
-Huh?

3
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:16,274
-Captain?

4
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:16,974
-The captain's back.

5
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:18,474
-What happened to you, Captain?

6
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,607
-Are you all right, sir?

7
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,007
-Yes, I'm fine.

8
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,041
I brought down the Bount.

9
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:33,574
The area's still frozen
over from my Zanpakuto,

10
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:35,507
but it will melt soon enough.

11
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,674
I want you to go there
and retrieve the Bount.

12
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:38,541
-Wait.

13
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:40,474
He's dead, isn't he?

14
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:41,307
-Of course.

15
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,107
Whatever remains
of the Bount's body

16
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:45,607
will need to be
handled properly.

17
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:48,674
We will need to give
it some sort of burial.

18
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:51,641
-Right.

19
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:53,607
-Has the lieutenant returned?

20
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,007
-Yes sir.

21
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,974
Lieutenant Matusmoto and
Squad 6 Lieutenant Abarai

22
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:59,107
are inside, supervising
the medical treatment

23
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:00,807
for all the injured.

24
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:01,941
And there's one thing.

25
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,441
HITSUGAYA: What's that?

26
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,441
-The substitute Soul
Reaper is inside too.

27
00:03:06,474 --> 00:03:06,741
-What?

28
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,674
-Captain.

29
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:18,107
Welcome back.

30
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:19,774
Is the Bount--

31
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:20,674
-He's dead.

32
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:23,007
-Hey there Toshiro.

33
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,441
It's good to see you again.

34
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:28,007
-How many times do
I have to say it?

35
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,907
You are only to address
me as Captain Hitsugaya.

36
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:32,141
-What's the big deal?

37
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:33,141
Why does it matter?

38
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:36,407
-Why does it matter?

39
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:38,441
And what are you all
doing here anyway?

40
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:40,974
-Well, we were chasing
Kariya through the Seireitei

41
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:42,874
and then we just happened
to run into Rangiku.

42
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:44,574
-That's right.

43
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,607
And it was perfect timing
because Uryu was badly hurt,

44
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:48,541
so we needed a
place to train him.

45
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,041
-Yes.

46
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:51,107
As you may or may not know,
we don't have a home base

47
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:54,574
here in the Seireitei, so
it was quite the stroke

48
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:56,474
of good luck to all
of those concerned.

49
00:03:56,507 --> 00:03:58,807
-Sorry to come
uninvited like this.

50
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:01,407
-So, that's the whole story.

51
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,974
I know it's kind of
a hassle, but you

52
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:04,507
could put us up
for a while, right?

53
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:10,574
-I suppose.

54
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:11,874
-Uryu?

55
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:13,641
-It's-- it's not that bad.

56
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,607
-Are you sure?

57
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:23,674
-I was the one who brought the
Bounts here in the first place.

58
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:28,441
Any injuries I sustain are
completely my responsibility.

59
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:29,841
-Hm.

60
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:32,441
Orihime knows how to
treat this kind of wound.

61
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:34,441
-That's a problem.

62
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,641
Orihime is still outside the
Seireitei, as far as we know.

63
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:40,007
-The battles with the Bounts
left injured men scattered

64
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,941
across the Seireitei, so Squad
4 is stretched pretty thin

65
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:43,874
at the moment.

66
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:45,774
But I put the word
out already, so relief

67
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:48,074
should be here before too long.

68
00:04:48,107 --> 00:04:49,474
-You'll be all right.

69
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:51,141
Your injuries aren't
life threatening,

70
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:53,407
but you won't be
fighting for a while.

71
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:55,541
-That won't work.

72
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:59,607
I came to fight, and that's
what I'm going to do.

73
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:01,441
-Easy now.

74
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:04,474
We received confirmation
that Sui-Fend and Kurotsuchi

75
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:05,974
defeated the Bounts
they encountered.

76
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:11,407
If our intelligence
is correct, that

77
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,841
means the only Bount
left now is Kariya.

78
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:16,041
-I don't know how
you did it, Captain.

79
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:18,141
That metallic Doll gave
us so much trouble,

80
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:21,907
and you faced it down and
finished it off just like that.

81
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:24,407
-It wasn't that simple.

82
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:28,141
Also, there was something
very unusual about that Bount

83
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:29,741
and his style of fighting.

84
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:35,907
He didn't use full
strength in his attacks

85
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:38,107
against the other squad members.

86
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:40,074
Do you know what
happened with Kariya?

87
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,774
-Something strange.

88
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:45,574
He seems to have some kind
of new power all of a sudden.

89
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:48,107
-I think he called
it the Jokai Crest.

90
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:50,041
-He claimed that the crest
would give him the power

91
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:52,607
to destroy the entire Seireitei.

92
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:54,707
-Even the Bount that I
fought said something

93
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:57,374
about wanting to stop Kariya.

94
00:05:57,407 --> 00:06:01,074
-If only we had stopped
him from getting this far.

95
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:03,874
-Well, there's no use
worrying about that now.

96
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:07,107
-Do we know anything about
what happened to Ichinose?

97
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:11,441
-The unofficial report is that
Captain Zaraki killed him.

98
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:12,874
[footsteps]

99
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:14,107
-Huh?

100
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:14,941
-Ichigo, Uryu, everyone,
are you all right?

101
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,407
-You can't just
barge in like that.

102
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:17,474
Orihime.

103
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:18,741
Izuri.

104
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:20,741
-I finished treating Jidanbo's
injuries and he seemed stable,

105
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:23,374
so I decided to come find you.

106
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:26,374
I saw Izuru there guarding
the gate along with Squad 3,

107
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:28,107
and I asked him if he
knew where to find you.

108
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:30,774
-Fortunately I knew
just where to find you.

109
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,941
-Thanks for bringing her.

110
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:36,541
-Will you see what you can
do about Uryu's injuries?

111
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:36,841
-Of course.

112
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:43,407
-Orihime.

113
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:44,441
Listen.

114
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:46,507
I don't need to heal completely.

115
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:50,141
Just enough to fight
again as soon as possible.

116
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:52,407
RANGIKU: Forget about it.

117
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:53,674
What do you mean?

118
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:55,074
-Haven't you been listening?

119
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:57,674
Look, I know you're
anxious, but think about it.

120
00:06:57,707 --> 00:06:58,441
-Yeah, she's right.

121
00:06:58,474 --> 00:06:59,574
-Rest.

122
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:02,574
And recovery are both essential
elements of battle, too.

123
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:06,407
Most of our forces have been
on the move since last night.

124
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:07,941
So if something
important were to happen,

125
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:10,041
we'd be sure to get
word of it immediately.

126
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:12,141
-OK, so just take it easy.

127
00:07:12,174 --> 00:07:14,807
-Until you get some rest,
you won't be any good to us.

128
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:15,974
-So there's no need to panic.

129
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:28,974
-Izuru, who's
available for action?

130
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:31,741
IZURU: The only full
squad is Squad 11, sir.

131
00:07:31,774 --> 00:07:33,974
Since they are temporarily
without their captain,

132
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:35,974
they didn't receive
any deployment orders.

133
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:38,507
-And since they weren't involved
in any of the day's battles,

134
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,541
they should still
be at full strength.

135
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:42,607
-That's right.

136
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:44,607
Because of Kenpachi, I
never did relay any orders

137
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:45,107
over to Squad 11.

138
00:07:50,107 --> 00:07:50,974
-Damn.

139
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,907
I was really looking
forward to getting

140
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:54,774
in on some of the action.

141
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,874
But the odds aren't very good
now that there's only one

142
00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:57,874
of them left.

143
00:07:57,907 --> 00:08:00,007
-And I was hoping to get
some payback for what

144
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,074
they did to me back in
the world of the living.

145
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,407
-Seems like our captain
just abandoned us

146
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,407
so he could go fight on his own.

147
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:09,474
-Word is he fought with a former
Soul Reaper named Ichinose,

148
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:11,641
who was helping the Bounts.

149
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:15,441
By now he's probably sightseeing
there in the Rukon District.

150
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:17,541
-Ichinose.

151
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:18,874
I owe that guy a
little payback, too.

152
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:25,041
That bastard!

153
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:27,407
-Well, if it's revenge
against a Bount we want,

154
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,141
there's only one let.

155
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:30,707
The boss of the Bounts, too.

156
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:32,641
And I plan to be
the one to find him.

157
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:34,141
-Sirs, I have a report.

158
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:35,741
The North Rukon
District has been

159
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:36,874
declared completely secure.

160
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:38,107
No enemy activity.

161
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:41,974
-And with the other squads so
exhausted from the fighting,

162
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,874
we get to do whatever we
want to him if we fight him.

163
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:48,907
So go and find him!

164
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:50,974
-Head Captain, I have
an urgent message

165
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:53,374
from Captain Kyoraku of
Squad 8 and Captain Ukitake

166
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,974
of Squad 13.

167
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:59,441
-I tought Captain Ukitake was
too ill to even get out of bed.

168
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:00,641
He's in action?

169
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,041
-Yes.

170
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,074
I understand that he went
to the Central Library

171
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:06,374
in order to gather data
on the Bounts, sir.

172
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:07,707
-Hm.

173
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:10,607
Well, in any case, what
is this urgent message

174
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,541
you are referring to?

175
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:15,774
-Ran'Tao's old research
data has been recovered,

176
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:17,641
and in it the captains
have found a reference

177
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:19,907
to an explosive power that
was in fact sealed away

178
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:22,141
in the Jokai Crest.

179
00:09:22,174 --> 00:09:23,741
-I see.

180
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:25,907
If the data is
accurate, then it means

181
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,707
that this Bount Kariya
was not lying, after all.

182
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:32,107
-According to the data, however,
the full power of the Jokai

183
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:34,641
Crest cannot be drawn
out immediately.

184
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,707
A short period of
time must elapse

185
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:39,107
after the Jokai
Crest is activated.

186
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:42,674
-And just how much
time do we have?

187
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,807
-About one day.

188
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:46,974
-Evidently, that
is what this Kariya

189
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,607
meant when he said
that everything

190
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:50,907
would be decided
in a single day.

191
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:52,407
-Yes.

192
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,007
-Hm.

193
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,407
Obviously there is no tactic too
low for this man to stoop to.

194
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:00,774
We dare not let down
our guard against him.

195
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:04,107
Kariya must be taken into
custody before this day ends.

196
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:07,007
I will send directives
to all the 13 Court Guard

197
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,007
Squads at once.

198
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:12,407
There will be no time
for a captain's meeting.

199
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:14,407
-Yes, sir.

200
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:16,674
-Tell Captains
Ukitake and Kyoraku

201
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:18,474
to continue
investigating the data.

202
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:20,141
-I understand, Head Captain.

203
00:10:20,174 --> 00:10:23,474
[chatter]

204
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:31,441
-Captain Sui-Feng's
recovery has been

205
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:33,741
going much slower
than expected so she's

206
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,374
on reserve status
in her quarters.

207
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:36,807
-I see.

208
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,807
-Captain Kurotschi's
readiness to return to battle

209
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:41,107
is also listed as
questionable for now.

210
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,107
-Captains Kyoraku and Ukitake
have secluded themselves

211
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:47,574
in the Central Library to
gather further information.

212
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:49,574
-And Captain Komamura?

213
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,374
-Assigned to guard Head
Captain Yamamoto, sir.

214
00:10:52,407 --> 00:10:53,841
-All right.

215
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:55,507
I understand the situation.

216
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,107
Excellent work, Isane.

217
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:57,974
-Thank you, sir.

218
00:10:58,007 --> 00:10:59,007
My please.

219
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,441
-Isane!

220
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:01,841
-Rangiku!

221
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,507
RANGIKU: You have to come
and taste my cooking.

222
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,574
ISANE: But I'm still on duty.

223
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:05,841
RANGIKU: Are you saying
you don't like my cooking?

224
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:06,641
ISANE: No, but--

225
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:07,007
RANGIKU: Here.

226
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,941
Taste.

227
00:11:07,974 --> 00:11:09,441
[wretching]

228
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:46,741
-Who's there?

229
00:12:08,054 --> 00:12:08,887
-I know you.

230
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:12,787
Ran'Tao.

231
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:13,321
[cocking]

232
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:17,221
-A gun that fires Kido?

233
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,754
How did you find me?

234
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:39,954
A Bount sensor?

235
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:41,187
-Yes.

236
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:43,287
In fact, there isn't anyone
who knows more about the Bounts

237
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:44,887
than I do.

238
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:46,654
-Why haven't you
given that information

239
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:48,154
to the Soul Reapers?

240
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:49,921
-It's simple.

241
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:53,421
Because I intend to settle this
whole sorry affair by myself.

242
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:57,387
-Interesting weapon
you have there.

243
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:59,821
I'll admit that it does
pack quite a punch,

244
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:04,887
but I'm afraid it still won't
be enough to bring me down.

245
00:13:04,921 --> 00:13:05,721
What's the matter?

246
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:10,854
-Those markings.

247
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:14,821
Impossible.

248
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,987
After the konpaku
experiment failed,

249
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:29,887
we were sent to the
world of the living.

250
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:32,687
Just before we
arrived, we had heard

251
00:13:32,721 --> 00:13:34,854
reports of a large
number of humans

252
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:38,254
possessing strange powers.

253
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:41,954
They were the first Bounts.

254
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,154
The Bounts were confused
about their strength,

255
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:47,921
yet they were still trying to
live among the normal humans.

256
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:55,154
But due to their powers, human
tolerance towards the Bounts

257
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:55,954
waned.

258
00:13:55,987 --> 00:13:58,654
And finally, they
were persecuted.

259
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:10,021
I tried getting
close to the Bounts,

260
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:12,887
hoping that I might
be able to save them.

261
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:15,421
I admit I felt
responsible somehow.

262
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,854
After all, they were
just innocent victims

263
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:21,221
of our experiments.

264
00:14:21,254 --> 00:14:22,887
I am your friend.

265
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:24,921
I promise, you have
no reason to fear me.

266
00:14:28,854 --> 00:14:31,287
I managed to round
up all the Bounts,

267
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:34,921
and I advised them to
hide and stay together.

268
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:37,687
I'm going to return
to the Soul Society.

269
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:39,187
There I'll make
arrangements to place you

270
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:40,421
all under their protection.

271
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:43,087
You will soon be safe.

272
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:44,887
-Can this be done?

273
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:46,054
-Yes.

274
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:50,054
Though as you can imagine,
it will not be an easy task.

275
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:52,754
Understand that it will
probably take a number of years

276
00:14:52,787 --> 00:14:56,154
before the complete protection
of the Bounts is a reality.

277
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,987
-We understand.

278
00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:00,421
Until you return,
we will wait here.

279
00:15:08,987 --> 00:15:11,787
But something totally
unexpected awaited me

280
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:13,221
when I returned to
the Soul Society.

281
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,887
While I was gone,
central 46 had decided

282
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:26,921
that everything regarding
the konpaku experiments,

283
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:29,821
including their byproduct,
the Bounts themselves,

284
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:32,854
would be buried in secrecy.

285
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:34,921
Why are you doing this?

286
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:37,754
How can you turn your
backs on the Bounts?

287
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:40,354
-We freely acknowledged
that the konpaku experiments

288
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:42,187
were inhumane.

289
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,787
-If you believe that, why won't
you do anything to help them?

290
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:48,087
Don't you know they
possess incredible power?

291
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,821
But If we ignore them,
they may even one day

292
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:53,121
become a danger to
the Soul Society.

293
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:55,887
-We have nothing to fear from
Bounts who cannot control

294
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:59,087
reishi to pass through the
Dangai Precipice World.

295
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:00,954
-We have decided
that as a result,

296
00:16:00,987 --> 00:16:04,087
they will never be a
threat to the Soul Society.

297
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:05,287
However--

298
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:08,754
-There in the world of the
living, such is not the case.

299
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:10,787
As you know, it is
our duty to regulate

300
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:13,054
the balance of konpaku.

301
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:15,221
We believe the Bounts may pose
a threat to that equilibrium.

302
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:24,654
-Are you saying that the Bounts
will be-- you can't mean it!

303
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:27,721
How can you make such a
fateful decision so lightly?

304
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,887
-We do not take it
lightly, I assure you.

305
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:32,987
We are aware that
we will have to live

306
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:35,387
with the burden of our
mistake, and strive never

307
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:37,421
to make such an error again.

308
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,421
-I cannot allow them to do this.

309
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:42,087
I cannot turn my
back on the Bounts.

310
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:53,187
-Seize them all, men.

311
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,821
Kill any who resist.

312
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:57,121
-Yah!

313
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:10,054
RAN'TAO: Without permission,
I hurried back to the world

314
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:12,787
of the living to try
and save the Bounts.

315
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:14,254
[scream]

316
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:15,421
-Thanks.

317
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:16,721
But there are others
further inside.

318
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:17,854
-I understand.

319
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,387
I'll see what I can do.

320
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:21,087
Now just go and save yourself.

321
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:21,754
-Thank you, Ran'Tao.

322
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:25,721
-This one's dead.

323
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:26,687
-There's one over here!

324
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:27,421
-Try not to move.

325
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:30,121
-Help me move this.

326
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:31,121
He's very bad.

327
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:32,187
MAN: Hey, give me a hand.

328
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:34,087
MAN: This one's still alive!

329
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,321
MAN: Another one over here.

330
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,254
MAN: I need two guys over here.

331
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:42,721
[whimpering]

332
00:17:42,754 --> 00:17:43,387
-Hey.

333
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:43,921
Who's there?

334
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,687
-Hey, what's this?

335
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:57,354
-I recognize you.

336
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:59,421
You're Ran'Tao.

337
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,087
-That's right.

338
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,387
-Yeah, that's her.

339
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:04,787
From the Bount
Investigation Unit.

340
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:07,254
-But that unit was
sent home weeks ago.

341
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,287
Why are you still here?

342
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,021
Huh?

343
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:13,187
Hey!

344
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:14,954
She's trying to get away!

345
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:15,254
Come on!

346
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:23,787
Ran'Tao is a traitor!

347
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:24,787
Capture her, men!

348
00:18:37,787 --> 00:18:40,387
-I'm going to stay here and try
to keep them busy for a while.

349
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:42,354
I want you to go on
ahead without me, OK?

350
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:42,787
-Huh?

351
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,254
-You can do it.

352
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:46,421
The other Bounts are
waiting for you outside.

353
00:18:46,454 --> 00:18:48,821
I want you to escape
with your friends.

354
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:51,087
-But then they'll get you.

355
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:51,587
-Don't worry.

356
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:55,087
I'll be just fine.

357
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:57,821
Take this amulet.

358
00:18:57,854 --> 00:19:00,321
The Bounts have a great
deal of power within them.

359
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:02,754
This will help draw
out that power.

360
00:19:02,787 --> 00:19:04,187
I'm sorry, little one.

361
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:06,154
You be forced to
endure much suffering,

362
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:08,421
but I believe one day
you will rise again.

363
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:10,254
And to see that
day, you must live.

364
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:15,787
MAN: Over here!

365
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,587
MAN: I found one!

366
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:17,921
RAN'TAO: Now, run
up those stairs!

367
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:19,054
Get away from here!

368
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:19,787
MAN: Come on!

369
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:20,087
Get them!

370
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:28,021
-I was captioned and taken
back to the Soul Society.

371
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:30,887
The Seireitei held
me solely responsible

372
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:35,154
and buried the entire
case in secrecy.

373
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:37,387
Eventually, the
surviving Bounts took

374
00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:40,954
advantage of the powers hidden
in the amulet I left the boy,

375
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:44,654
and perfected the method
of controlling Dolls.

376
00:19:44,687 --> 00:19:47,154
With their newfound
power, the Bounts

377
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:51,254
plotted revenge and repeatedly
attacked the Soul Society.

378
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:55,321
However, they were defeated
each time by the Soul Reapers.

379
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:59,654
And over time, their numbers
dwindled to almost nothing.

380
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:01,421
Then even the record
of their existence

381
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:03,687
was erased from the Seireitei.

382
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:06,387
[screaming]

383
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:08,787
-But I never forgot
about the Bounts.

384
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:12,154
And then came the day when you
arrived in the Soul Society.

385
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:22,654
You are that same boy.

386
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:24,187
Don't you remember?

387
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:27,787
How you got that
mark on your body?

388
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:29,354
That mark could
only have appeared

389
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:32,087
as a result of the
activation of a certain item.

390
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:33,954
And you must
remember, the person

391
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:37,721
who gave you that item was me.

392
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:40,687
I have lived only to save you.

393
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,154
There is not a
single Soul Reaper

394
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:44,287
remaining who
remembers the past.

395
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:46,287
The Soul Society has changed.

396
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:48,654
Finally, I can save the Bounts.

397
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:49,921
-You bring that up now?

398
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:51,354
RAN'TAO: It's the truth!

399
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:53,154
But if you use the
power of the Jokai

400
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:55,254
Crest that was sealed away
here in the Seireitei--

401
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,987
-The power of the Jokai Crest?

402
00:20:58,021 --> 00:21:00,954
I absorbed that energy
into my body long ago.

403
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:02,154
-Impossible!

404
00:21:02,187 --> 00:21:05,954
-Now I shall use that power
to destroy the Soul Reapers.

405
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:07,721
-What?

406
00:21:07,754 --> 00:21:10,954
[snoring]

407
00:21:16,121 --> 00:21:17,687
-This spiritual pressure.

408
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:19,087
It's Ran'Tao.

409
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,821
Is she in a battle?

410
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:23,387
The only Bount left is Kariya.

411
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:28,821
That means whatever she
is, Kariya is there, too.

412
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,687
-No matter what
you are planning,

413
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:33,854
you are too late
to save the Bounts.

414
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:37,354
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm the only Bount remaining.

415
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:40,054
-Even if you're the last
one, I can still save you.

416
00:21:40,087 --> 00:21:42,087
-You idiot.

417
00:21:42,121 --> 00:21:44,787
You're the one who created
the Bounts in the first place.

418
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:46,354
I had intended to deal
with you after you

419
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:48,287
had seen the Seireitei
destroyed, and felt

420
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:50,187
some of the pain you caused.

421
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:52,421
But I think it'll kill
you right here and now.
