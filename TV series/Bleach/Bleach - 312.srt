1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,300
Good morning! How
are you, Captain Omaeda?

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,500
[yelling]

3
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:12,566
Hi there, Captain Omaeda!

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,833
[screaming]

5
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,600
It's a miracle, that's
what it is!

6
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:08,146
[snoring]

7
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,613
Damn you...

8
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,379
...Stupid Soi Fon.

9
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,846
That was strange. Must
have been a dream.

10
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,913
It sure felt good,
though. It's like
it was real.

11
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:30,879
Wonder if sleeping will
get it back. Guess I'll
give it a try.

12
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:36,346
Huh?
[screaming]

13
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:41,146
Oh great, now I've done
it! I was only gonna take
a short nap! But I ended
up sleeping for three

14
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:45,446
hours! Captain Soi Fon's
probably been looking for
me, and she's gonna be
steamed!

15
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,679
She's gonna make
me pay for this one!

16
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:49,513
I gotta get back there
quickly!

17
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:55,079
[breathing heavily]

18
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:56,946
[screaming]

19
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,213
[breathing heavily]

20
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,646
[roaring]

21
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,813
[growling]

22
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:15,246
End of the road, kid!

23
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:21,346
Give back what you took
from me and I'll make
your death painless!

24
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:24,313
[growling]

25
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:28,313
Arrrh!

26
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:29,213
Ahhhhh!

27
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:30,246
[grunting]

28
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,679
A Soul Reaper?! What's he
doing here?

29
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:36,413
[groaning]

30
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:41,279
In my current state, I'm
at a disadvantage! I'd
better get out of here!

31
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:44,446
Oh, that really hurt!

32
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,913
I thought there was a
Hollow here, but he's
disappeared.

33
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:49,913
Oh well, whatever...

34
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:50,779
Gotta move.

35
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,146
<i>Wait, please!</i>

36
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:53,013
Huh?

37
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:57,179
You just saved my
life. Thank you
very much!

38
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:59,346
What? I did that?

39
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:01,079
Yes!

40
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:04,613
Won't you please tell me
your name, sir, so I know
who to thank properly!

41
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:05,613
Uh...

42
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,179
Yeah...

43
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:12,246
Well, you see... I'm with
Squad Two of the Thirteen
Court Guards.

44
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:13,446
Ohhhh.

45
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,146
In fact, I happen
to be the Captain!

46
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:19,179
[gasping]

47
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:23,046
You're a...
Captain?! Really?!

48
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:28,746
I kinda blurted that out
without thinking it through.
Oh, well, he's just a kid.
What harm could it do?

49
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,946
[chatting]

50
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:40,946
Captain... Everyone
in the village wants
to thank you for saving
Ryuzaburo's life.

51
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,479
Please have another cup
of sake, Captain.

52
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:44,946
Thank you, Captain!

53
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,779
Captain, you're great!

54
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:48,579
How 'bout some food?!

55
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:50,013
Huh?!

56
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:52,013
Well... Uh...

57
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:55,046
...Sure! Why not?!
[laughing]

58
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,379
<i>Hey, Captain, have</i>
<i>some more!</i>

59
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:59,379
I might as well. I am a
Captain, after all!

60
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:04,046
<i>Everyone, please bring</i>
<i>more food for our guest!</i>
<i>He's worked up quite</i>
<i>an appetite!</i>

61
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:09,579
So? Were you able to
steal it from the
Hollow's cave, just
like you promised?

62
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,313
I sure was!

63
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:14,146
And because I was brave,
I win the game of
courage!

64
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,413
Whoa.

65
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:20,613
But you didn't do it by
yourself. You had help
from a Captain. That's
not fair.

66
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:21,913
Mm.

67
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,313
Wait a minute! There's no
rule that says someone
can't help me!

68
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:27,546
<i>This has been a blast!</i>
<i>I really enjoyed it!</i>

69
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,546
Let's have some more
sake, what do you say?

70
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,313
Sounds good!

71
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:31,413
Captain!

72
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,179
I just wanted to thank
you again for saving me,
sir!

73
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:37,679
You're the bravest
warrior any of us
has ever met!

74
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:42,213
You know what, I want to
be just like you when I
grow up! Would you come
and visit us again?

75
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:44,979
Of course! I'll come
over any time you want!

76
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:47,313
You're our hero!

77
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:52,146
That's just part
of the job!
[laughing]

78
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:59,146
[snoring]

79
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:01,513
No, really, I can't eat
another thing...

80
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,946
Oh, crap!

81
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,746
The Captain's gonna
give me hell when I
get back to base!

82
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:14,613
No really, Captain! I'm
telling you the truth!
That's the reason I'm so
late reporting in!

83
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:17,246
I saved a kid named
Ryuzaburo from a Hollow!

84
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,613
Please, you have to
believe me! I rescued the
boy and took him back to
his village! There's no

85
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:25,579
other reason why I'd be
running behind! I would
never neglect my squad
duties!

86
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:30,579
Oh,calm down, Marechiyo! The
fact of the matter is,
your absence wasn't
missed in the least!

87
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:34,546
[groaning]
It's kinda sad when
you put it that way.

88
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:37,246
However... You did break
the rules.

89
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,546
So I'm assigning you to
clean up the Seireitei
grounds...

90
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:41,946
...By yourself.

91
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:44,413
You can't be serious! I
have to clean the whole
place...?

92
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:48,013
By myself? I
mean, I am a Lieutenant,
after all! That wouldn't
be right!

93
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:53,413
If you prefer... I can
come up with some other
punishment. Perhaps you
would prefer latrine duty?

94
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,646
Uhh...! No.

95
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:01,779
I really don't understand.
If you were free and had
the time to handle this,

96
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:03,313
why did I have
to come along?

97
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:04,679
Don't be so negative.

98
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:06,713
<i>Why can't we go in there?</i>

99
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:07,646
Huh?

100
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:10,979
Sorry boys, but I have my
orders. No outsiders
allowed.

101
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,679
If it were up to me, I'd
let you in, but I'm not
allowed to let anyone

102
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:17,946
enter the area without
the permission of a Soul
Reaper.

103
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,213
We're telling you, if you
contact the Captain,
he'll be happy to let
us in!

104
00:07:21,246 --> 00:07:23,513
That's right, we're
good friends of the
Captain!

105
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:27,313
Hmm...
But how do I
know that's true?

106
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,213
Hey! Jidanbo!

107
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:30,046
Hm?

108
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:31,713
Long time, no see!

109
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:36,046
I can't believe my eyes!
If it isn't Ichigo!

110
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,713
What's going on here?

111
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:41,379
These three boys showed
up and insist they're
friends of one of the
Captains.

112
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:43,979
We're begging you!
Would you please
let us in?

113
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:46,213
We just came down here to
see the Captain.

114
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:48,179
Hm? Which
Captain is that?

115
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:51,446
<i>The good one! The one who</i>
<i>came and saved me from</i>
<i>a Hollow!</i>

116
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:57,613
We wanted to show our
appreciation! But
before we could, he
disappeared.

117
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,079
[sighing]

118
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:02,579
[sighing]

119
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:05,946
Isn't there something we
can do, Yoruichi?

120
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:06,779
Jidanbo...

121
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:07,979
Hm?

122
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:11,246
I'll take responsibility.
Go ahead and let these
boys in.

123
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,813
[gasping]

124
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:18,113
So. Who's this Captain
you came to see?

125
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:20,879
Well, the thing is, we
don't actually know his
name.

126
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:22,546
Seriously?

127
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,879
Was there anything
physical about this
person that stood
out in your minds?

128
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:28,113
I do remember he was kind
of husky!

129
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:29,713
He was a big guy! Pretty
tall!

130
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:30,746
Yeah!

131
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,946
Oh, and one other thing
about him! He was pointy!

132
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:33,813
Hmm?

133
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:36,779
So he was husky...

134
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:38,779
<i>...And pretty tall...</i>

135
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:41,713
And on top of that, he
was pointy!

136
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,413
Wonder if it's
Kenpachi...

137
00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:51,546
But wouldn't you say
Komamura is pointy as
well... especially
around the ears?

138
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:56,379
No, he'd stand out too
much. I mean, wouldn't
they just describe him
as looking like a dog?

139
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:57,446
Uh!

140
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,813
The guy said he was the
Captain of Squad Two!

141
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:00,779
[gasping]

142
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:08,346
Oh brother! Why do I have
to do this grunt work?
It's a ridiculous waste
of my time and energy!

143
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:11,879
Huh?

144
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:15,513
<i>Ah, perfect. Just the man</i>
<i>we want to see. Let's ask</i>
<i>him where Soi Fon is.</i>

145
00:09:15,546 --> 00:09:16,913
[laughing]

146
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:18,613
Captain, there you are!

147
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:21,246
Uh, huh??

148
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,613
What in the world are you
kids doing here?!

149
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,213
Captain!

150
00:09:25,246 --> 00:09:27,113
Why did you leave the
village so suddenly?

151
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:28,613
Uh... Well...

152
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:30,413
I... See...

153
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:31,413
Uh...!

154
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,379
[grunting]

155
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:38,346
Uh-oh! What am I going to
do? I lied about being a
Captain, and I ate and
drank all the stuff the

156
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:42,546
villagers put out for me!
This is bad! If anybody
here finds out the
truth...

157
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,746
<i>What's going on, Omaeda?</i>

158
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:48,879
We're very pleased to
know your name is Omaeda,
Captain!

159
00:09:48,913 --> 00:09:50,246
Hey, what are you doing?!

160
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,879
Why are you addressing
the Captain without a
term of respect?!

161
00:09:52,913 --> 00:09:54,346
That's very rude!

162
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:56,279
You say 'Captain'...

163
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:57,879
But the Captain of Squad
Two is---

164
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:00,279
Ahhhhhhh!

165
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:01,546
Lady Yoruichi,
can we talk?!

166
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:02,513
Huh?

167
00:10:04,746 --> 00:10:05,746
Huh?

168
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:09,046
So I said this, and that,
and one thing led to
another...

169
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,013
So that's what happened.
Please don't bust me!

170
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,746
But we'd be contributing
to a lie...

171
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,013
Alright, fine.

172
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:17,346
What?! Yoruichi?!

173
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:19,646
Thank you! I
really owe you!

174
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,413
Heh! Hey...!

175
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:23,713
This is gonna be fun!
[chuckling]

176
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:25,313
<i>This can't be good.</i>

177
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:28,179
Awesome!

178
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:31,379
<i>What a great place! This</i>
<i>is where the Captain</i>
<i>lives?</i>

179
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,846
Of course he does! He's
the Captain!

180
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,746
Okay, you boys have had a
pretty good tour! It's
time for you to head
home, now.

181
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,146
Already?

182
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:43,413
Come on, we just got
here! We want to see more
of how you do your job!

183
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:46,113
Please, Captain! Can't
we hang out?

184
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,979
Well of course you can!
In fact, by Captain
Omaeda's authority, you

185
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:52,713
boys can do almost
anything you want while
you're visiting.

186
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:54,146
<i>All right!</i>

187
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,779
I... never
said that!

188
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:57,546
[cheering and giggling]

189
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,313
<i>I knew it. She's</i>
<i>enjoying this!</i>

190
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,213
[grunting]

191
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:16,846
Ikkaku.. and Yumichika!
Damn! What lousy timing,
to run into these two
guys!

192
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:17,879
Yo.

193
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:18,875
Hey.

194
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:19,846
Oh, hi there.

195
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:23,646
<i>Just a minute, you two!</i>

196
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,513
Uh?!

197
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:25,613
Hm?

198
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:27,646
You can't just walk
by like that! It's
disrespectful!

199
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,113
You owe Captain
Omaeda a more
proper greeting!

200
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:32,146
Huh? What are you
talking about?!

201
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:33,213
Ah!!

202
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:35,713
Like this! Stand at
attention!

203
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:38,679
And say 'Good morning,
sir!' Now you try it!

204
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:41,946
I think these boys are
serious. How strange.

205
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:45,746
Yeah, I don't intend to
ignore their behavior,
just because they're
little kids.

206
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,579
Uhh... Well... you
see.. It's... uhh...
I mean...

207
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:51,879
Huh? Hey, Ichigo.
What are you doing?
What the hell? Let
go of me!

208
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,279
And that's the
situation...

209
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,146
I'm sure he'll make it up
to you properly, once the
kids are gone.

210
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:00,479
I guess we can play
along. Right, Ikkaku?

211
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:01,946
<i>[grumbling]</i>

212
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:05,679
Good morning! How are
you, Captain Omaeda?

213
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:08,379
Why am I
doing this?

214
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,713
Oh, play along. It's not
that difficult.

215
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:13,679
Damn! This is gonna
cost a lot!

216
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:16,313
Come to think of it, you
must be thirsty, Captain.

217
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:20,146
What are you waiting for,
you two? Bring the
Captain some tea!

218
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,479
Tea, you say?

219
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:24,179
Uh!

220
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:25,913
Oh, of course,
sir----Right away!

221
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,746
Oh, you're gonna pay
for this big time.

222
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:29,513
Come on.

223
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:33,879
I'm getting out of here
while I can still run.

224
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:36,346
What's the matter? Are
you all right?

225
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,313
They're gonna bring you
some tea.

226
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:39,746
Yeah, about that--- I'm
not in the mood...

227
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,546
<i>Sorry for the delay,</i>
<i>Captain!</i>

228
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,579
I brought you that cup of
tea!

229
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,346
What are you doing here
Rangiku?

230
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:49,279
Well, we came here to
serve you! Mm?

231
00:12:49,313 --> 00:12:50,779
Right, everyone?

232
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,846
Hi there, Captain Omaeda!

233
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,113
You people should take
the Captain somewhere
nearby, where he can
relax!

234
00:12:58,146 --> 00:12:59,779
He's been under a lot of
stress!

235
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,179
You got it!

236
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:05,113
Hey, wait a second! Hang
on there! What?!

237
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:07,279
[growling]

238
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,146
They took it all. My
wallet...

239
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:14,646
...my watch... my ring,
everything.

240
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,613
I feel like I've been
mugged or something!

241
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:18,513
[groaning]

242
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:20,846
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

243
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,346
Forget it. I don't
have anything left
to give you.

244
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:24,679
Ah!

245
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:30,113
[trembling]

246
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,774
Captain.. Soi Fon!

247
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:45,341
I seem to recall
assigning you to cleaning
duty, yet here you are.

248
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:47,407
Well... I was...

249
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:52,441
Oh boy. This is bad.
Really bad!

250
00:13:52,474 --> 00:13:56,241
I'll ask again. Why are
you not carrying out your
assignment?

251
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:56,974
<i>Insolence!</i>

252
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:57,941
Hm?

253
00:13:57,974 --> 00:13:59,974
You can't speak to this
man like that!

254
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,507
No! Not to her! Anybody
but her! Please!!

255
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:10,074
Really now, who do you
think this person is
you've been talking to?

256
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:14,774
You happen to be
addressing Sir Omaeda,
Captain of Squad Two!

257
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:17,907
Impressive. Their
timing was perfect!

258
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,507
Where did you boys
get that information?

259
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:28,241
Marechiyo, you're in
serious trouble! You can
say goodbye to your days

260
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:31,841
at the Seireitei, and
hello to an unknown
future!

261
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:34,674
[crying]

262
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:36,674
I'm done for!

263
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:38,474
[clearing throat]

264
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:42,541
I apologize, Captain
Omaeda. I should have
been more respectful.

265
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:43,541
Huh?!

266
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:49,841
What?! It's a miracle,
that's what it is! I've
been saved by the Gods!

267
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:52,674
How long can we keep this
up?

268
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:55,174
This is the attitude you
should have had from the
start!

269
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:59,474
Go ahead, Sir Omaeda...
It's time to give this
misguided woman some
orders.

270
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:01,741
What?! No... Really...

271
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:05,941
Didn't you mention
earlier that you needed
someone to do some
cleaning?

272
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:08,674
Oh boy. She's really
enjoying this!

273
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:21,341
Sir... what's next?

274
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:25,074
[gasping]
I don't... know.

275
00:15:26,907 --> 00:15:27,874
Bring another bowl!

276
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:29,207
Yes! Right away!

277
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:31,274
And I want another one,
as well!

278
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,074
Of course!

279
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:33,141
Hey, the Captain is out
of sake!

280
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:34,307
Yes!

281
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:37,941
Sir... What's next?

282
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:39,774
Uh...! Next?

283
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:42,774
Well... I do have sore
muscles...

284
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,774
Oh yeah! That's the spot!

285
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:48,107
If you could push harder
right there, that would
be great!

286
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:48,941
[groaning]

287
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:50,307
Uh...

288
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:54,107
This is the best!
[chuckling]

289
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:57,274
I'm so glad
we came to visit!

290
00:15:57,307 --> 00:16:00,574
Yeah! We're lucky to have
met such a great man!

291
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:01,441
It's been like a dream!

292
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:02,341
<i>Damnit!</i>

293
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:03,541
Huh?

294
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:06,474
<i>That bastard Marechiyo</i>
<i>was so insulting to me!</i>

295
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,674
One thing's for sure.
That coward could never
be a Captain!

296
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:12,374
Really. He just hasn't
got what it takes.

297
00:16:12,574 --> 00:16:13,374
<i>I'll get him back--</i>

298
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,641
What's happening here?

299
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:17,141
The Captain must have
been lying about
everything!

300
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:20,207
We've been played for
fools! The guy's not a
Captain at all!

301
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:23,141
<i>Ryuzaburo! You're the one</i>
<i>who told us he was a</i>
<i>Captain!</i>

302
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:24,941
It's all your
fault!

303
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:34,107
I'll see you guys again,
sometime. If you come
back for another visit,

304
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:36,307
I'll take you on a tour
of the Captain's
quarters!

305
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:38,041
[laughing]

306
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:40,774
He sure plays
the part, huh?

307
00:16:40,807 --> 00:16:42,041
What a liar!

308
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:46,207
What's the matter,
Ryuzaburo? Next time
you come to visit,

309
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:49,007
how 'bout I give you some
training in swordsmanship?

310
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,041
Soon, you'll become a
good fighter, like me!
Hm?

311
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:54,107
What happened?

312
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,274
It was nothing
but a big lie!

313
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:04,874
Liar!

314
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:06,741
Liar!

315
00:17:06,774 --> 00:17:08,974
Liar!

316
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,174
Liar!

317
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:12,407
Liar!

318
00:17:17,741 --> 00:17:18,974
[gasping]

319
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:23,841
I've been waiting for
you! Give back what you
stole from me!

320
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:26,007
[gasping]

321
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:28,807
[grunting]

322
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:37,374
Finally, I've got you
back! With this piece, my
power will return!

323
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:38,907
[gasping]

324
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:44,407
Excellent! Now all that's
left is to devour you!

325
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:45,507
[gasping]

326
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:48,574
[roaring]

327
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:51,107
[screaming]

328
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,407
Man...

329
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:54,341
[gasping]

330
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,307
I don't know about you.
You just keep getting
into one mess after
another!

331
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:00,374
[gasping]

332
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,241
Now stay here and don't
move!

333
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:05,474
[yelling]

334
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:09,041
[growling]

335
00:18:09,074 --> 00:18:13,741
Really? You think you
can defeat me with your
predictable moves, as
slow as you are?

336
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:15,774
You're not getting away!

337
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:17,774
[gasping]

338
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:18,641
Uh?

339
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:21,374
[grunting]

340
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:23,907
Surprised?

341
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:30,774
My movements may not be
that fast in a one-on-one
confrontation. But if I
use the power of my tail,

342
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:34,774
I can completely
neutralize the speed of
whoever I'm fighting.

343
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,241
Damnit!

344
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:44,307
That bastard! He
completely suppressed my
speed! This is bad! This
is really bad!

345
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:47,641
I need to get some help
immediately!

346
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:54,074
Oh no! What are they
doing here?!

347
00:18:55,941 --> 00:19:01,541
I can't just run off with
them watching me! To
them... I'm a... I'm a...

348
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:09,074
Captain! And a Captain
doesn't avoid facing an
enemy in battle! Ever!

349
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,207
[grunting]

350
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:18,307
He's getting himself beat
up!

351
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:21,307
[grunting]

352
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:26,041
He's not good... at
anything.

353
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:27,974
Why would you say that?

354
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:29,674
Huh?

355
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:32,774
It's true that the guy
fighting in front of you
isn't a Captain...

356
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,774
[yelling]

357
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,607
But it doesn't change the
fact that he saved your
life.

358
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:43,674
Was it the idea that the
man might be a Captain,
that impressed you? Or

359
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:47,441
were you impressed by the
man himself, when he
stepped in and saved you?

360
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:48,174
Uh.

361
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:54,207
I suggest you keep
watching him. You might
decide he's your hero
after all.

362
00:19:56,707 --> 00:20:01,241
Damn! I could have run
away by now if those kids
weren't watching me! Not
that it would do any

363
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:06,641
good, since that Hollow
can neutralize my speed.
Wait a minute! If they
weren't watching me...

364
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:08,107
That's it!

365
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:14,774
You haven't got anything
left, have you? Then I
guess it's time I
devoured you!

366
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:16,207
[grunting]

367
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:17,707
[gasping]

368
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,274
[grunting]

369
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:25,707
Well now.. Tell me, how
does Gegetsuburi taste?

370
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:31,274
Bakudo Number 21!
Sekienton!

371
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:35,207
[groaning]

372
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:38,574
How's that? You can't
see me very well, can
you?

373
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:42,007
And I can't see you!
But so what?!

374
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:46,107
[grunting]
Smash 'em!

375
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:50,374
[groaning and yelling]

376
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:57,941
I guess you shouldn't
have... underestimated
me.

377
00:21:02,874 --> 00:21:05,974
Thank you... Mr. Omaeda.

378
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:08,974
I see you went and
demoted me from 'Captain'
to 'Mister'.

379
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:12,274
What did you expect?
You did lie to me!

380
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:14,274
I have to admit that's
true, but...

381
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,541
Don't worry, it's cool!

382
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,574
Huh?

383
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:18,141
My friends were so
impressed by your
bravery,

384
00:21:18,174 --> 00:21:21,174
that they want to
become strong Soul
Reapers, like you!

385
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,607
And what about you,
Ryuzaburo?

386
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:26,974
Mm!

387
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:30,074
Someday, I hope to become
an even stronger
Lieutenant than you, sir!

388
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:32,474
Huh. I'll keep
that in mind.

389
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:33,907
You should hurry on home.

390
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:35,574
[chuckling]
Bye!

391
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:45,841
Apparently, all's well
that ends well, right,
Marechiyo?

392
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:48,207
Absolutely! Hm...

393
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:52,774
What do you say we go
back and have some tea...
Ahhhh! Captain!

394
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:55,074
Who's gonna serve you
that tea?

395
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:57,774
Ahhhhh!

396
00:21:57,807 --> 00:21:58,974
<i>Please--</i>

397
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:01,707
I suppose you'd have to
say, he brought this on
himself.

398
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:03,374
Didn't we contribute,
just a little?

399
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:04,374
[grunting]

400
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,807
I'm sooorryyy!

401
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:51,047
<i>I'm exhausted. I'm gonna</i>
<i>head back now. Yoruichi,</i>
<i>open the Senkaimon, will</i>
<i>you?</i>

402
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,047
You can't go!

403
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,180
<i>What? Why not?!</i>

404
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,614
Because there are more
stories like this one
coming up!

405
00:23:55,647 --> 00:23:58,547
You get caught
in the middle of another
mess in the next episode!

406
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,047
<i>You're kidding me,</i>
<i>right?</i>
