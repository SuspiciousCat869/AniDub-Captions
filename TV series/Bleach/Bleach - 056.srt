You have no right to

what is right and wrong.

It is your duty to accept the
true justice of the world.

7
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:53,014
-Then what is the true
justice of the world, Master?

8
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:54,781
Who determines right and wrong?

Come out, come out,

00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:05,081
Captain Zaraki, where have
you disappeared to, sir?

17
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:06,214
Hello?

18
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:07,481
La la la.

19
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:23,514
Ah, there you are, Captain!

20
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:24,581
I've been looking for you.

21
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:26,781
You won your battle already?

22
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:29,347
-No, they fled.

23
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,414
It was looking like
a good fight, too,

24
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:34,947
but that wolf-faced bastard ran
off before we even got started.

25
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,347
-Wolf-faced?

26
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:39,847
-He suddenly started screaming
about old man Yamamoto fighting

27
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:40,814
somewhere.

28
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:42,581
-Ah, yes.

29
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:46,914
I can feel that, too, not that
you've mentioned it. [laughing]

00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:48,347
-What the hell?

31
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:51,714
Why are you so cheerful
all of a sud-- uh, huh?

32
00:03:57,047 --> 00:04:00,547
You mean you won without
getting so much as a scratch?

33
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,914
-Yes!

34
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:04,314
Oh, but I should tell you, I
did get my outfit kind of dirty,

35
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:05,947
so I had to go change clothes.

36
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:07,414
That's where I just came from.

37
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,947
-Somehow you actually
look healthier

38
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,681
now than you did
before the fight.

39
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:11,681
-Do you mean it Captain?

40
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:13,214
Do you really think
I look beautiful?

41
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:14,614
That's so nice of
you to tell me.

42
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:16,647
-That's not what
I said, you moron.

43
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:17,547
Get a grip.

44
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:19,214
-Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.

45
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:20,614
I got a little carried away.

46
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:22,347
I guess it's because
it's the first time I

47
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:24,281
battled like that a long time.

48
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:27,714
And I must say, I rather
enjoyed the feeling.

49
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:35,881
-[gasping] Damn him.

50
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:38,414
How could he have
suckered me like that?

51
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:40,181
I've never seen a
Zanpakuto like that one.

YUMICHIKA (VOICE OVER): I would
imagine that by now you're

53
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:46,281
curious about the true
power of my Zanpakuto.

54
00:04:46,314 --> 00:04:49,481
What I'm about to show you
is confidential, of course.

55
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:52,914
My Captain and Ikkaku will be
mad at me if they find out.

56
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:55,781
-Somehow he drained m
of all m spirit energy.

57
00:04:55,814 --> 00:04:56,747
Damn it!

58
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:08,381
It's coming from
the old district.

SHUSHEI (OFFSCREEN):
That Captain Yamamoto's

60
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,314
spiritual pressure.

61
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:33,314
-How many years has it been
since I've seen this born?

62
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:38,514
How long since I felt
this fear like the weight

63
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,014
of the deep sea?

64
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:53,714
This transcendent spiritual
pressure even in its Shikai

65
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:58,947
state, this heat, scorches
the heavens and consumes

66
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:00,914
even the clouds.

67
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:07,281
That blade turns everything
before it to ash.

68
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:13,581
That most terrible Zanpakuto,
the oldest and greatest

69
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:17,614
of them all.

70
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:23,581
It is Ryujin Jakka.

71
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:25,714
-What are you waiting for?

72
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:28,281
Go on and release your swords!

73
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:36,014
You haven't much time.

74
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:37,747
Surely you don't
wish to be burned

75
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,647
without even challenging me?

76
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:50,281
-I guess it can't
be helped, Jushiro.

77
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:50,847
Shall we?

78
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:08,081
-Yes.

79

All Waves, rise now
and become my shield!

80

and become my blade!

and they are magnificent!

87
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:25,181
Just like the old
days, the two of you

88
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:27,114
have lost none of your power.

So how did that one feel?

-Yeah, we want you
to be fully healed.

97

-I feel great I'm as
good as new, in fact.

98
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:13,314
Many thanks to you for
helping me get better.

99

-No, not at all.

We're happy to help.

-It was the least that we
could do for you, Jidanbo.

102
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,081
-If you want to
thank someone, you

103
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:23,381
should probably thank
that Ryoka girl.

104
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:26,281
She worked for hours
on healing your wounds.

105
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:29,881
If not for her, you probably
would have lost that arm.

106

-Her name was Orihime.

107
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:31,981
I remember.

108
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:33,747
-Yeah, and I know
why you remember.

109
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,447
She was a cutie.

110
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:37,447
-It's been five
days now since she

111
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:39,347
and her friends went
into the Seireitei.

112
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:41,114
-Five days, huh?

113
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,481
I have to say, I don't
think much of their chances.

KUKAKU (OFFSCREEN): Are
you really that worried

115

about her, Jidanbo?

116
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:56,881
If you're so concerned,
why don't you come with me?

117
00:09:56,914 --> 00:09:59,614
-Oh, what?

118
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:00,781

-Uh, what is it, Miss Kukaku?

You look like you want
something from me.

-You've been asleep
for five days, Jidanbo.

You and I have a few
things to talk about.

130

Let's go for a walk and
discuss a few things,

131
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,981
like some unfinished

-I'm not impressed.

139
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:45,054
For someone who's spent as many
years hidden away as you have,

140
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:46,420
it doesn't seem
to me like you've

141
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:48,954
gotten any stronger, Yoruichi.

142
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:51,520
-Well you, on the
other hand, looks

143
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:54,187
like you've let your skills
get rather dull and rusty.

144
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,387
-I noticed there was a Shihoin
symbol on the Tentoken flying

145
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,520
cloak that Ryoka
kid was wearing.

146
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:05,587
You have him that, didn't you?

147
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,987
-That's right.

148
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,920
There was no way for him to
save Rukia if he couldn't fly.

149
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:15,420
-How shocking to see evidence of
corruption in the Shihoin Clan.

150
00:12:15,454 --> 00:12:18,020
It's a disgrace to learn
that one of their members

151
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:19,754
has been actively
supporting a Ryoka

152

invasion of the Seireitei.

153
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:25,320
And it seems the Shiba Clan
has become involved, too.

154
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:29,920
What a shame to see how low the
four great houses have fallen.

00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:32,720
-You certainly are
talkative today, Sui-Feng.

156
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:35,620
Is it because you're excited
to see your old mentor again

157
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,220
after so many years?

158
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:40,920
Or are you just expressing
your usual pent up anger

-Don't flatter yourself.

165
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:57,054
You still act like
you're better than me,

166
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:58,787
but those days are gone.

167
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,487
I'm the one with
all the power now,

168
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,520
because I'm the one who controls
the Stealth Force, Yoruichi

172
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:26,087
Let me show you the difference
between you and me now.

173
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,220
As you already know, when the
leader of the Stealth Force

174
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:33,554
draws her sword, an
execution battle is eminent.

175
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,120
Any opponent must die.

176
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:38,254
And if that should happen to
include a former commander,

177
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,454
then that is what
will have to be.

178
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,587
You chose to throw away
the title that I now hold.

179
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,387
Just look around you.

180
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,187
There's no escape
for you, Yoruichi!

181
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:05,420
-I really hate being
underestimated like that.

182
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:08,887
It's true that I threw away
the Stealth Force title,

183
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,487
but there is one other title
that I never relinquished.

184
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,254
-Flash Master, Yoruichi!

185
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,954
[cloth tearing]

186
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:30,187
That's not a real title.

187
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,487
But since you
claim it, you leave

188
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:39,087
me no choice but to rip it from
you with my own bare hands.

189
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:45,187
-You still wear
the keisen uniform

of the Punishment Squad, huh?

191
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,854
I didn't know you
were so traditional.

192
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:52,254
-Does it make you
think about the past?

193
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:54,754
-Yes, it does a little.

194

-Think back some more now.

It seems I've taken a hit.

One for one, then.

We're even so far, Yoruichi.

202
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:52,120
-So it seems.

203
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,654
Have you got some gimmick hidden
in the folds of your uniform?

Your movements have
improved, Sui-Feng.

205
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,220
-Some kind of gimmick?

206
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:08,187
I guess you could say that.

207
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,687
I'll show you.

Sting all enemies to death.

You can't escape me!

Why can't you just accept it?

212
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:43,454
Admit that I'm
better than you now.

213
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:45,787
I may be better
than you ever were.

214
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,554
I was just holding back before.

215
00:16:49,587 --> 00:16:51,487
I know, you didn't
think the likes

216
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,687
of me even had anything
to hold back, did you?

217
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,187
That's what you were thinking.

218
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,220
I told you not to
underestimate me.

219
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:03,120
I told you that I'd make
you sorry if you did.

220
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:04,820
I stayed and grew
stronger while you

221
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:07,187
ran and hid from the
battlefield for 100 years,

222
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,087
and now you're going to pay for
it with your life, Yoruichi!

223
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:22,820
Remember my power, Yoruichi.

224
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:27,420
The power of Suzumebachi is
in its Homonka, or Death Mark.

225
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:34,220
The Homonka is etched into
the body of the target

226
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:38,354
with my first attack,
as you can see.

227
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:41,620
The last time you were here to
see it, I hadn't perfected it.

228
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:43,987
But over the last 100
years, the Homonka

229
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,854
has finally become complete.

230
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:49,787
So I suggest you be careful
not to take a second hit

231
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,687
and then try and
run away, Yoruichi.

232
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,920
The Suzumebachi's killing
power is in the second strike,

233
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:59,287
so all I have to is hit you
in the same place once again,

234
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,387
and you die instantly.

235
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,920
Here comes the second
attack, Yourichi!

236

-Ha!

238
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,387
Showing your back to the
enemy and running away

239
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,587
isn't much of a strategy, is it?

240
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,620
I suppose you're running in
order to buy yourself time,

241
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:32,820
but it's useless.

242
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:34,054
You to know why?

243
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:35,954
Before it was
perfected, my Homonka

244
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:39,654
used to disappear after a
while, but now it lasts forever.

245
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:43,087
Those marks on you will never
come off unless I make them.

246
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,487
So you can run and run
all you want, Yoruichi.

247
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,254
Go ahead and try to
escape, but those Homonka

248
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:50,520
will stay on until I
hit one of them again!

Now do you understand what
I've been trying to tell you?

252
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,820
I'm simply better than
you are, Yoruichi.

253
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:40,054
Now that I've made my
point, I can finish you off!

-You've never seen such
a fighting technique

before, have you?

256
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:56,987
It's unique because
it combines elements

257
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,120
of both Hakudo and Kido.

258
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:02,420
It's something I created myself.

259
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:04,654
You should feel
privileged, actually.

260
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:07,354
This technique has only
been perfected recently,

261
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:10,687
so you're the first victim of
it in actual combat conditions.

262
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,254
It doesn't even have a name yet.

263
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:19,254
-Wrong.

264
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:22,120
It has a name.

265
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,687
-What did you just say?

266
00:20:26,354 --> 00:20:27,254
-It's called Shunko.

267
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:33,554
-You don't know what
you're talking about.

268
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:36,187
-Don't you know why that
keisen uniform you're wearing

269
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,954
leaves the back and
shoulders exposed?

270
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:46,787
Because those parts
would be wasted.

271
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,654
When this move is
performed, a dense Kido

272
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:53,587
envelopes the user's
back and shoulders.

273
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:59,387
The Kido draws power first
to the arms and legs,

274
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,620
and then explodes it outward.

275
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:05,154
In other words, the moment
the move is activated,

276
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:08,754
any fabric on the back and
shoulders would be blown off.
