00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:51,501
NARRATOR: At the palace
of Szayelaporro Granz,

3
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:54,534
deep inside of Las
Noches, Uryu and Renji

4
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,667
battled against
clones of themselves,

5
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:57,634
created by the Espada.

6
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:12,634
-Look what you did to my palace.

7
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,667
How will I ever explain
this to Lord Aizen?

8
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:21,867
I am very displeased.

9
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,201
-Uryu!

10
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:41,967
-Such a delicious meal.

11
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:45,534
NARRATOR: Szayelaporro
used his La Lajuriosa

12
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:49,034
to create a powerful doll
that could control Uryu's five

13
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:49,534
senses.

14
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,234
Though the doll appeared
to be a simple toy,

15
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:58,667
any damage it suffered
would directly affect Uryu

16
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:01,401
and was used as a
cruel torture device.

17
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,634
Uryu was incapacitated
by the use of the doll,

18
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,867
and when Renji
attempted to intervene,

19
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:11,434
a doll was crafted for
the lieutenant as well.

20
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:13,701
-I'll get you for that!

21
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,234
-Don't make a fuss.

22
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,834
All I did was destroy
a vital internal organ.

23
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,067
-Huh?

24
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,934
-My, my, my.

25
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:30,934
Some people act just
little children.

26
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:35,934
Humans, Soul
Reapers, Quincys too.

27
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,167
It's actually quite vulgar.

28
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,801
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
Ichigo won a deadly battle

29
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:47,534
against Grimmjow,
and rescued Orihime.

30
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:51,467
However, a fight between Espada
number five, Nnoitra Gigle

31
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:54,601
Nelliel tu Odelschwank
quickly followed.

32
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,901
-Why'd you stop your sword?

33
00:03:56,934 --> 00:03:57,834
-Why'd you stop yours?

34
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:02,801
-You're annoying.

35
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:07,967
You're so annoying.

36
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:12,567
When I'm fighting you, I
can't help but think back.

37
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:17,134
Except for those ridiculous
rag tag clothes you're wearing,

38
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,167
you haven't changed
one single bit.

39
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,567
-Finally, wriggles
my way out of there.

40
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,067
Huh?

41
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:37,867
Pesche!

42
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:38,701
Hey!

43
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:40,101
Are you all right down where?

44
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:40,934
Hold on.

45
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:43,167
I'm gonna get you out, brother.

46
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,601
PESCHE: Thanks, Dondochakka.

47
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:45,101
Come on!

48
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:46,034
Heave ho!

49
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,334
Heave ho!

50
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:50,167
Don't give up now.

51
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:51,401
-It's too heavy.

52
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:53,701
I need to take a
load of for a sec.

53
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:54,467
PESCHE: Hey.

54
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:55,701
Why the heck did you stop?

55
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:58,501
I could almost see
the outside world.

56
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:00,667
-Yeah, well, it don't matter
if you can see outside,

57
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,334
because the only thing
in sight is going

58
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:07,134
to be Renji and Uryu getting
beaten up by Szayelaporro.

59
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,301
You know what?

60
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:10,467
I just noticed something.

61
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:11,101
PESCHE: Hey.

62
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:12,434
I can see out now.

63
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:15,867
-When Szayelaporro does that
lethal sword release of his,

64
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,134
it kinda looks
like udon noodles.

65
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:18,634
PESCHE: Huh.

66
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:19,534
It does.

67
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:20,801
Now that you
mention it, maybe we

68
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:25,434
should call his attack
the Szayelaporro noodles.

69
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:28,634
-Nah, that sounds like a
pretty lame attack to me.

70
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:30,301
PESCHE: Then why'd
you even bring it up?

71
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,234
You're the one who said
it looked like noodles.

72
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:33,634
Quit babbles and get me out.

73
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,534
-OK, OK.

74
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,634
Geez.

75
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,034
You're the one who keeps
on babbling, Pesche.

76
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:40,834
-Look.

77
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:41,634
I'm free.

78
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:51,467
Wait a sec.

79
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:52,667
What are we doing?

80
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:56,067
we can't waste our time here.

81
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:56,801
Master Nel.

82
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,967
-Nel.

83
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,401
-Ichigo, wait.

84
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:19,767
You're not--

85
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:24,167
-Nel's in a lot of trouble,
and I-- I have to go help her.

86
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,167
-Ichi--

87
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:30,534
-Don't move.

88
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:33,567
You will not get in
Master Nnoitra's way.

89
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:39,401
That woman, Nelliel tu
Odelschwanck, she is a boulder.

90
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:43,267
And any boulder that obstructs
Master Nnoitra's blade

91
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:46,867
must be destroyed by
Master Nnoitra himself.

92
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,001
-Ah!

93
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:25,967
-There.

94
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:26,467
All done.

95
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,901
I'm happy that's over
in time for lunch.

96
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:36,834
If I were late, the others
might have gotten worried.

97
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:37,801
-Hold it.

98
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:43,701
I thought I said this was
a fight to the finish.

99
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:47,034
We're not done yet.

100
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,434
-Are you implying
that you'd like

101
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,567
this to be a battle
to the death?

102
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:52,034
-Do you even have to ask?

103
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,334
-I refuse.

104
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:59,201
You don't deserve to
have such an honor.

105
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:00,934
-What was that?

106
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:03,934
-When we became Hollows,
we transformed from humans

107
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:05,267
to beasts.

108
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:10,734
And then, Arrancars, we
regained our sense of reason.

109
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:14,567
Those with the ability to reason
must have a purpose to fight.

110
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:17,334
You lack a purpose.

111
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:21,167
I'm under no obligation
to keep fighting you,

112
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,801
and there is no reason
whatsoever to kill you.

113
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:26,001
-Well, I have a good reason.

114
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:27,834
I loathe and despise you.

115
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:31,034
-Sorry.

116
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,634
That's not a reason.

117
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,401
It's instinct.

118
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:38,401
You are still a beast.

119
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,401
I cannot acknowledge
you as a true warrior,

120
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:44,434
so you are not worthy
to be my opponent.

121
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,167
I won't have the
life of someone who

122
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:48,167
isn't a warrior
on my conscience.

123
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:57,401
-Damn you.

124
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01,967
-Nnoitra.

125
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,201
Are you all right, sir?

126
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:05,667
Can you--

127
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:09,034
-Don't get friendly with me.

128
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,101
Just because I couldn't
defeat that girl,

129
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,267
Tesra, don't start acting
like you're my equal.

130
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:14,967
You're not.

131
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:21,967
-But why Master Nelliel?

132
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:25,634
Why not any other Espada?

133
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:29,767
-Because I hate her.

134
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:33,301
I can't stand seeing a woman
defeating a man in battle.

135
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,334
it turns my stomach.

136
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,434
Hey, Nelliel?

137
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:58,267
Remember how you called
me a beast before?

138
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:01,201
You told me back then that
I'm not a worthy opponent.

139
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,901
Well then, how does it feel
to be killed by a lowly beast?

140
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:19,334
NEL: Pesche, Dondochakka.

141
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:22,067
Pesche, Dondochakka.

142
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:23,267
Where are you?

143
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:24,834
It's time for dinner.

144
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:27,734
Hm.

145
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,067
Pesche.

146
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,667
Dondochakka.

147
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:34,401
Come out.

148
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,634
Where are you hiding?

149
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,601
In here?

150
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:41,401
Hm.

151
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:42,867
Pesche.

152
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:43,367
Dondochakka.

153
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:48,801
Where could those
two guys have gone?

154
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:49,934
It's strange.

155
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:52,901
[gurgling]

156
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:53,734
-Huh.

157
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:54,567
And I'm so hungry.

158
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:02,967
-Hey.

159
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:05,934
-Not you again.

160
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:08,634
-Are you looking for someone?

161
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,201
-Why don't you mind
your own business?

162
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:19,067
And carrying your weapon
around is an empty threat.

163
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:22,067
If you really want to appear
dangerous, you'd put it away.

164
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:36,467
-Pesche.

165
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:39,334
Dondochakka.

166
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:43,401
-I'm so sorry, Master
Nel, we failed you.

167
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:52,067
-You-- You ripped
off their masks.

168
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:55,101
How dare you?

169
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:56,434
-Yeah, I did.

170
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,234
So what?

171
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:00,934
They were too weak.

172
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,267
That's the bottom line.

173
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,101
Now then.

174
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:14,934
I think I've given you a fine
enough reason to fight me,

175
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,834
haven't I?

176
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:20,101
-Not quite.

177
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:22,667
This isn't a reason for
a fight to the death.

178
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:27,034
-You're serious?

179
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:28,767
-But you have done wrong.

180
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:31,501
You've injured two of
my closest friends,

181
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:34,101
and for that, I promise
I will make you pay.

182
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:58,934
-Damn it.

183
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:09,401
I can't stand her.

184
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,534
-Too slow.

185
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:42,467
-Heh.

186
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:01,498
You'd probably
tell me I'm acting

187
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:04,631
like some mindless
primal beast again.

188
00:14:04,665 --> 00:14:07,031
As if I care.

189
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:11,465
The whole point of battle
is to win at all costs.

190
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:14,631
It doesn't require
a good reason.

191
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:16,931
Fighting isn't logical.

192
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:19,698
Never has been.

193
00:14:19,731 --> 00:14:23,931
You looked for some lofty
rationale and paid the price.

194
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:24,998
You make me sick.

195
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:30,831
What do you want?

196
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:33,631
Your work is already
finished here, Szayelaporro.

197
00:14:36,498 --> 00:14:38,931
-Why the sudden cold shoulder?

198
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:42,065
I thought you and I were
allies, joining forces

199
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,831
to meet our goals.

200
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:46,965
Can't I at least witness
the outcome of this?

201
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:50,165
-I don't remember us
ever joining forces.

202
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:52,131
I took advantage of you.

203
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:54,031
That's all there was to it.

204
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:56,398
You wanted to fight
Nelliel, and I

205
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:58,765
wished to test my
new device in action.

206
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,831
Thus our partnership was born.

207
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:05,498
Cooperation is forged
out of common interests,

208
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,198
because it has benefits
for both parties.

209
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:10,198
-So philosophical.

210
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:11,165
Makes me want to puke.

211
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:19,665
Nelliel.

212
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:22,231
It was never power
that divided us.

213
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:23,698
It was experience.

214
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:24,531
Pure and simple.

215
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:32,031
Before your wound has healed and
you've returned to Las Noches,

216
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,831
I will have surpassed you.

217
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:37,998
My powers will be so great
that your sword will not

218
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:41,065
be able to touch me.

219
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:42,331
Let's go.

220
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:45,198
-I don't think you
can give me orders.

221
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:46,231
-Is that so?

222
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:48,565
You're not even an Espada.

223
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:49,931
Perhaps.

224
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:52,831
But it was my device alone that
allowed you to beat Nelliel,

225
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:56,765
and I believe that
affords me some respect.

226
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,998
Am I wrong?

227
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:00,931
See what I mean by
common interests?

228
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,465
-Spirit energy?

229
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,565
Did she just turn into a child?

230
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:28,431
-Fascinating.

231
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,998
I've never seen
such a phenomenon.

232
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:35,165
Spirit energy is escaping
from the crack in her mask,

233
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:37,931
and her soul is shrinking.

234
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:38,898
-Ha.

235
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,831
Who cares how it's happening?

236
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:42,798
Look at you now, Nelliel.

237
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:44,465
In a body that
suits you perfectly.

238
00:16:49,998 --> 00:16:52,831
But on the other hand, I
suppose that's the last time

239
00:16:52,865 --> 00:16:55,465
our swords will ever cross.

240
00:16:55,498 --> 00:16:57,298
That really is a shame.

241
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,198
-This place.

242
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:15,298
Wh-- where am I?

243
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,031
And you?

244
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:22,731
Who are you?

245
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:27,165
-My goodness.

246
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:30,265
She's lost her memory.

247
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:31,265
-Huh?

248
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:36,065
My head feels so funny.

249
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,165
-Pesche--

250
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:39,965
-Be quiet, Dondochakka.

251
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:41,498
This can only mean one thing.

252
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:49,365
Master Nel-- Master Nelliel
tu Odelschwanck has died.

253
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:53,331
Her mask destroyed,
all her power lost.

254
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:56,031
Her memory erased.

255
00:17:56,065 --> 00:18:00,765
The girl who lies before
us is not Master Nel.

256
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:07,265
However, we must protect her.

257
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:10,831
From Nnoitra Szayelaporro.

258
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:12,965
From suffering and hardship.

259
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:15,231
From all dangers and adversity.

260
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,498
If our master has
become defenseless,

261
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:23,365
we must shield her
with our lives.

262
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:30,498
We have sworn to serve
Master Nel in any situation,

263
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:33,931
and this is our one final duty.

264
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:50,065
-You are too persistent.

265
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:52,965
I've taken you down
countless times.

266
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,965
Why can't you just take the
hint and stay down for once?

267
00:18:56,998 --> 00:18:57,465
-Argh!

268
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:02,365
-Like I said, you're
too persistent.

269
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:07,298
-Urk!

270
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:10,465
-I just severed your
left Achilles tendon.

271
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:14,898
Now then, what part of
you shall I break next?

272
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:17,231
Of course, if I play
with too many organs,

273
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:19,687
your body might quit altogether.

274
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:22,665
-Damn you.

275
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:23,998
-Ah, ah.

276
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,265
Don't you move a muscle.

277
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:29,465
What did I just say to you?

278
00:19:29,498 --> 00:19:33,298
We don't want to end our
playtime too early, do we?

279
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:35,531
Be a good boy and sit still.

280
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:39,865
What is going on?

281
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:43,398
-I got it!

282
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,598
I got it!

283
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:46,631
Now, Dondochakka!

284
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:49,331
Bring out Bawabawa!

285
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:51,265
-Yah!

286
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:54,165
Comin' to get ya!

287
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:54,698
Yah!

288
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:01,565
-Uwah!

289
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:10,031
-What the-- why's
that thing coming out

290
00:20:10,065 --> 00:20:11,931
of Dondochakka's mouth?

291
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:15,465
-Bawabaa's one of the combat
spirit bugs Dondochakka

292
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:17,431
houses inside his body.

293
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:20,098
But we didn't dare tell
Master Nel about it.

294
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:22,898
We were worried that
any information about us

295
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,565
would trigger her
memories to return.

296
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:28,565
You see, Master Nel
always hated fighting.

297
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:32,265
And now she's free from
the horrors of violence.

298
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,965
But if her memory
came back, so would

299
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:37,065
those painful, sad thoughts.

300
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:41,898
And our duty was to protect
her from pain, no matter what.

301
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:47,431
However, she certainly
has the will to fight now!

302
00:20:47,465 --> 00:20:50,698
And if Master Nel says
she wants to fight,

303
00:20:50,731 --> 00:20:52,931
our job is to be at her side!

304
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:58,731
We will not be intimidated by
the likes of you, Szayelaporro!

305
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:00,098
Here we come.

306
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:00,598
-Rawr!

307
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:12,798
-Heh.

308
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,531
You honestly think
you've got a chance?

309
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:19,531
If you had half a brain,
you'd just surrender.

310
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:20,998
-It's unfortunate.

311
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,265
-Huh?

312
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:26,265
-I knew it would be rough on
me so soon after transforming

313
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:27,398
back.

314
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:29,531
I didn't want me to use
this unless I had to.

315
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:36,731
Praise.

316
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:50,326
[theme music]

317
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,847
PESCHE: Dondochakka, we did it!

318
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,747
DONDOCHAKKA: Oh, yeah!

319
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,047
What did we do?

320
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,747
PESCHE: When your face is
partially obscured onscreen,

321
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,013
it means you're mysterious,
strong, and handsome.

322
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:26,547
I'm sure plenty
of ladies noticed.

323
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,480
DONDOCHAKKA: Wait!

324
00:23:27,513 --> 00:23:28,880
My face only
appeared in shadows?

325
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:30,013
Does that mean I'm ugly?

326
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:33,547
I want a second opinion.
