1
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,780
I must apologize for
the wait, everyone.

2
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:01,913
I'll be done with the
adjustments in just a minute.

3
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:06,246
Will we really have to pass
through the Precipice World?

4
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,580
Wait, hold on.
Isn't it completely under
Kageroza's control?

5
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:13,246
Well, I wouldn't
say completely.

6
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:14,713
What does that mean?

7
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,180
Y'see it appears that
Kageroza has control over
many of its aspects,
but not the Cleaner.

8
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:22,746
<i>Of course, you might</i>
<i>be wondering,</i>

9
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,980
<i>"then how did the Cleaner</i>
<i>show up at just the right</i>
<i>time to get in our way</i>

10
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:29,013
<i>when it usually only appears</i>
<i>once every seven days?"</i>

11
00:02:29,713 --> 00:02:32,680
Glad you asked!
I have a hypothesis
about that.

12
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:34,780
Never mind the
lengthy explanation.

13
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,080
He set the time axis of the
Cleaner's appearances so that
it would arrive whenever we
entered the Precipice World.

14
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:46,246
Yes, exactly. Astute as
always, Captain Kuchiki.

15
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:53,713
However, this suggests that
Kagerosa has some limits to
his control of time in the
Precipice World.

16
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:59,480
Otherwise, why would there be a
delay between when someone
enters the Precipice World and
when the Cleaner arrives?

17
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,180
So what exactly do you
want us to do, then?

18
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:07,813
All right, what I've
done is secure a space
behind the Cleaner that
Kageroza can't control.

19
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,113
Meaning, you'll be able to move
within that time axis without
any interference.

20
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:17,513
<i>I'll arrange your entry into</i>
<i>the Precipice World so you</i>
<i>end up inside that space.</i>

21
00:03:17,546 --> 00:03:20,413
Of course, that makes it sound
a lot easier than it is.

22
00:03:20,446 --> 00:03:22,846
You'll only have a window
of less than a minute.

23
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:28,746
<i>If your timing's off and</i>
<i>you enter the Precipice</i>
<i>World too soon, you'll</i>
<i>become the Cleaner's prey.</i>

24
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:35,180
And if you leave the reserved
space I've created, you'll fall
into the area Kageroza controls.

25
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:39,346
You might never be able to leave
the Precipice World again.

26
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:49,980
Huh?

27
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:52,313
[gasp] Ichigo!

28
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,646
You all right?

29
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,113
Yeah, Orihime.
Just barely!
And the others?

30
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:00,413
They're all here
and accounted for.

31
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:02,846
<i>They have already been</i>
<i>treated, and are resting now.</i>

32
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,813
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Oh, great.</i>
<i>Glad to hear that.</i>

33
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,113
Can you take a look
at her, too, and see
if she's hurt at all?

34
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,813
<i>Sure.</i>

35
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:14,146
Hey, what's wrong?
You okay?

36
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:15,913
Yaaagh!

37
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
You pervert!

38
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:21,146
She sure seems fine to me!

39
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:22,746
Stop goofing around!

40
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:26,546
You lousy guys are all alike!
You're perverts!

41
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,113
Don't go lumping
me in with him!

42
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,780
I could say the same
thing to you, you know!

43
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,046
At least I'm not afraid
to admit I'm a pervert!

44
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,146
Nyaah!

45
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,680
<i>Why you!</i>

46
00:04:37,713 --> 00:04:39,313
[beating up sounds]

47
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,380
Hngh!

48
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,480
Ah! Are you all
right, Ichigo?

49
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:45,446
Ngh... Yeah...

50
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,546
Here, let me take a look!

51
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,913
No, it's nothing!

52
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:49,813
<i>[Kenpachi]</i>
<i>Really?</i>

53
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:50,280
Huh?

54
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:52,446
Huagh!

55
00:04:53,346 --> 00:04:54,346
Ichigo!

56
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,613
Is he dead?!

57
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,313
One little kick
sends you flying!

58
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,380
I sure wouldn't
call that nothing!

59
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:10,146
I was just off-guard!
Anyone would've gone flying!

60
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:14,046
Besides, I thought you
went to the Soul Society!

61
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,580
I'm on my way
there right now.

62
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:17,546
What? Then I'm
going with you!

63
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,580
Forget it! If this is the
condition you're in, you'll
just end up getting killed.

64
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,713
Just shut up!

65
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:28,780
Try not to get
yourself killed.

66
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:29,680
Huh?

67
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,880
He'll be fine!
There's no way
Kenny's gonna die!

68
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,013
You keep out of
this, Yachiru.

69
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:39,713
Oh, stop. Right, Ichi?!

70
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:41,014
Aw.

71
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:46,513
Relax. Till you and I fight
again, I don't plan on dying,
even if I do get killed!

72
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,013
Okay, I get it!

73
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:50,780
Hurry up and go!

74
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,680
Later, Ichigo.

75
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:54,380
Bye-bye!

76
00:05:58,746 --> 00:05:59,680
About time!

77
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:03,046
You're late.
We were going to
leave without you two.

78
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,680
Don't worry
about it.

79
00:06:05,013 --> 00:06:07,346
Now, before you go,
here's a warning.

80
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:10,046
Don't need one.
Could we just
get going!

81
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:11,646
Aren't we running
out of time?

82
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,480
Yes, you're right.
Okay, be careful.

83
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:18,646
Here goes!

84
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:33,213
<i>[Inaba]</i>
<i>Well, well.</i>

85
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,146
It appears that the
captains have entered
the Precipice World.

86
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:40,713
Doesn't their arrival mean
your attempt at invading

87
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:43,880
the World of the Living has
ended in failure, Kageroza?

88
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:48,280
You're a scientist,
and a smart one at that.

89
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:53,646
If they return to the
Soul Society, it's only
a matter of time before
they shut down your plans.

90
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,246
Surely you must
understand that.

91
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:58,980
Captain Unohana.

92
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:02,880
You sound almost like a
teacher admonishing a student!

93
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:06,580
However, you're gravely
mistaken about one thing.

94
00:07:07,146 --> 00:07:12,146
Do you think I'd simply wait for
them to come without doing
anything to prepare for it?!

95
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,146
Hmm, hmm.

96
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:20,713
What? What is it?

97
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:22,780
Something isn't right.

98
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Ah! Restrictive Current!

99
00:07:31,313 --> 00:07:34,946
Keeping up with the Cleaner in
itself isn't all that difficult.

100
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,213
<i>The real problem is the</i>
<i>captains' powerful Spirit</i>
<i>Energies.</i>

101
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:43,113
The walls of the Precipice World
react to Reishi.

102
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:49,680
In other words, the higher
their Spirit Energies, the
faster the Restrictive Current
pursuing them becomes.

103
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:51,180
Is that what
you're saying?

104
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:54,413
Yes, but they probably
accounted for that.

105
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:57,780
Of course that's not
everything, is it?

106
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:00,180
You're very astute.

107
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,480
<i>I'm not able to control</i>
<i>the Restrictive Current.</i>

108
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:06,613
<i>But I am able to</i>
<i>manipulate time around it.</i>

109
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:18,280
[Toshiro]
That bastard Kageroza!
He set a trap for us,
didn't he?!

110
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,746
So what? We'll
force our way
through!

111
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,146
What do you think
you're doing?!
Come on!

112
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,213
Just leave this to me!

113
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:28,946
Bankai!

114
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,846
Kokujo Tengen Myo-oh!

115
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,680
No, you fool! You're going
to be swallowed by it!

116
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,213
Go!

117
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:42,413
Sajin!

118
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,713
Quick, up there!

119
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:55,380
I can't believe
he did that!

120
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:59,580
Let it go. We have no time
to go back for him now.

121
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:02,546
Besides, he won't let something
like that kill him so easily!

122
00:09:03,246 --> 00:09:05,613
We can't waste time;
we have to keep moving.

123
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:15,880
I can sense three Captains.
Kuchiki, Hitsugaya, and
Zaraki.

124
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,446
But not Captain Komamura!

125
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:21,980
Only a single one
brought down, eh?

126
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:26,213
Well, it appears that
my science is still
far from perfect.

127
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:28,413
I have much to learn.

128
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:29,813
Don't move!

129
00:09:29,846 --> 00:09:32,346
Hado Number
Thirty One!
Shakkaho!

130
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,446
<i>There's no hurry.</i>

131
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,180
<i>Lieutenant Kotetsu.</i>

132
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,480
Takaoni!

133
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:45,746
That's it?!

134
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,413
Sogyonokotwari!

135
00:09:58,513 --> 00:09:59,913
Thank you, Jushiro.

136
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:03,180
It is rather amusing!

137
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:05,513
What is that, old man?

138
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,813
The two of you are.

139
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:12,180
Both of you talk
like the real thing,
act like the real thing,

140
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:14,513
and even fight
like the real thing.

141
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:17,913
But the reality is
that you are Reigai.

142
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:21,680
Nothing about you is truly your
own, not even your intentions.

143
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,746
Now, now, don't say that,
Old Man Yama.

144
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,613
Master Genryusai.
As you say, all that
we are is derived
from the originals.

145
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:33,680
<i>However, it doesn't mean</i>
<i>that we've lost what's</i>
<i>really important.</i>

146
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:35,380
Oh?

147
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:39,046
Yes, that's right.
We still have our honor.

148
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:42,913
If that is so,
then show it to me,
this "honor" of yours!

149
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,746
Hah!

150
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:54,213
My shadow?!

151
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,580
Kageoni.

152
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:03,446
Ah!

153
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:06,846
Guess they're on their way.

154
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,313
This'll be good fun.

155
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:09,013
Huh?

156
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,680
Are you seriously
trying to stop me?!

157
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,346
I'm not. Besides,
that would be useless.

158
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:19,246
Listen, it is their sole purpose
to utterly destroy us, right?

159
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,713
We'll have to fight
them sooner or later.

160
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:26,446
But now, the only target we
have to worry about is Kageroza.

161
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,613
We'll split up and head
for Squad Twelve's
barracks separately.

162
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:33,380
Sure. Right after I'm finished.

163
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:34,246
<i>Fine.</i>

164
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,746
Kenny, it's that way!

165
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,546
Yeah, yeah; I know that!

166
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,180
We're gonna go that way.

167
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:41,580
We'll meet at
Kageroza's location.

168
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,813
<i>I know the Spiritual Pressure</i>
<i>he's tracking down.</i>

169
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:10,713
Huh.

170
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:13,713
Kenny?

171
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:14,680
Yeah.

172
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:19,080
Hey. I've been waiting.

173
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:20,313
Heh.

174
00:12:33,397 --> 00:12:37,830
Gotta hand it to you.
It's like you read my
mind, coming here.

175
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:39,697
No, I didn't.

176
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:41,964
Then why are you here?

177
00:12:42,564 --> 00:12:45,797
I wanted to find out
how strong I am,
that's all.

178
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,864
Heh! You can read
my mind, then!

179
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:53,864
Bring it hard from the start.
I don't mind losing to you.

180
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:56,697
As long as
you're stronger!

181
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:00,197
Hm!

182
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,764
Now it's time to
have a little fun!

183
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:23,597
[growl]

184
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,430
Heh heh!

185
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:28,764
Oh, he's just like
the real Kenny!

186
00:13:30,397 --> 00:13:31,964
You'd better go all-out.

187
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:33,630
Yeah, or else,

188
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:35,297
You're gonna die!

189
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,497
No, you!

190
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:38,030
Ah ha ha ha ha!

191
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:43,030
Augh!

192
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:52,297
Ha ha! What's wrong?
I'd heard that a Reigai
is supposed to be stronger
than the real thing!

193
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,197
Don't disappoint me now.

194
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,597
Just relax.

195
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:57,864
Huh?

196
00:13:58,864 --> 00:13:59,330
G'augh!

197
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,064
Huh, I guess I AM
pretty strong.

198
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,230
<i>Nice try.</i>

199
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,497
Remember what I said about
not minding losing to you?

200
00:14:27,564 --> 00:14:28,630
Forget it.

201
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:32,030
No way am I gonna lose
to the likes of you!

202
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:38,230
Wait! Don't!

203
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:44,530
Kageroza Inaba.
Don't let this folly
go any further.

204
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:45,864
Oh?

205
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:52,030
<i>[Unohana]</i>
<i>You might think everything is</i>
<i>going according to your plan,</i>

206
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:55,364
<i>But killing Head Captain</i>
<i>Yamamoto is impossible.</i>

207
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:58,864
<i>No. Not just Head</i>
<i>Captain Yamamoto.</i>

208
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:02,730
It seems you're underestimating
all our powers.

<i>[Kenpachi]</i>
<i>Ha ha ha ha ha!</i>

Ah ha ha ha ha!

211
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,364
And what's so funny, huh?

212
00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:16,464
This is such a blast!
I haven't laughed
this hard in ages!

213
00:15:17,364 --> 00:15:21,064
<i>Reigai, you have the same</i>
<i>memories as I do, right?</i>

214
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:26,964
It's just like that time.
It's so fun,
I can't help myself!

215
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:27,730
Egh!

216
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,464
Haaaah!

217
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,397
I feel bad for you,
Reigai.

218
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,564
If you really are stronger,
then I'm the one who gets
to enjoy this fight!

219
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,197
Huaaaaa!

220
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,530
Augh!
[wet choke]

221
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,430
Heh! Don't you dare say
it's over yet, you hear?

222
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:52,497
Not when things are just
starting to get seriously
fun around here.

223
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,430
Damn right I won't!
I'm finally starting to
really enjoy myself too!

224
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:01,330
Hyaah!

225
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:03,630
Huaah!

226
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,597
The same trick works
only so many times!

227
00:16:20,464 --> 00:16:21,830
Iro Oni... "White"!

228
00:16:23,964 --> 00:16:24,764
Hah!

229
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,530
Not good enough!

230
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:27,597
Huah!

231
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,764
Shunsui!

232
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:36,097
Man, this sure isn't
proving to be too easy.

233
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,964
<i>The goal of these</i>
<i>Reigai is to stop me.</i>

234
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:45,630
<i>But they must realize that</i>
<i>even fighting to a draw</i>
<i>will prove very difficult.</i>

235
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,364
<i>And yet, they don't</i>
<i>hesitate at all.</i>

236
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:52,397
<i>They're fighting as</i>
<i>though they're willing</i>
<i>to fall right here.</i>

237
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,764
<i>Like they're on a</i>
<i>suicide mission.</i>

238
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:55,930
Heh.

239
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,864
<i>What does this mean?!</i>

Kenny!

243
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:42,430
Hah. So that's it, huh?

244
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:51,097
<i>I never thought...</i>
<i>I'd be killed by...</i>
<i>myself.</i>

245
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:57,464
<i>Well, it's survival of</i>
<i>the fittest, I guess.</i>
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

246
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:03,097
<i>[Yachiru]</i>
<i>Kenny!</i>

<i>What is it, Yachiru?</i>

248
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,830
<i>Heh.</i>
<i>You're right.</i>

249
00:18:26,364 --> 00:18:28,597
<i>I totally forgot about that.</i>

250
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:35,997
Heh heh. We've been
together all this time.

251
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:39,064
So I'm not supposed
to die just yet.

252
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,630
What are you talking about?

253
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:47,030
I'm also going to take back
what I said earlier, about
not minding if I lose.

254
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:51,264
I want to win.
And I'm going to!

255
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:03,397
Even if it's just against some
cheap imitation like you!

256
00:19:04,864 --> 00:19:07,164
Tch! Don't make me laugh!

257
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,697
Haaaaa!

258
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,130

00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,597
Kenny!

260
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:38,364
Heh.

261
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:47,930
So, it's all about winning, huh?

262
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,564
Tch.

263
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,897
Makes perfect sense.

264
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,997
H'augh!

265
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:03,730
Heh.

266
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,230
<i>Kenny!</i>

You aren't dead,
are you?

00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:21,597
Heh. No way, of course not.

269
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:23,730
Ah!
[giggles]

270
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:30,564
<i>[Inaba]</i>
<i>I've underestimated</i>
<i>all your powers?</i>
<i>Is that what you said?</i>

271
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,064
Yes. Is it not true?

272
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,764
I've never been
very interested in
what others do.

273
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:42,130
So it's difficult for me
to say that I truly know
all of you thoroughly.

274
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:44,030
But, Captain Unohana.

275
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:47,864
<i>Don't you think that the</i>
<i>same could be said of you?</i>

276
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:50,464
What do you mean by that?

277
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:53,064
Oh, you'll find out.

278
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:01,297
Captain Unohana.
You'll have to forgive me.

279
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:08,197
[Inaba]
I certainly wouldn't face a
captain of your caliber without
a plan, now, would I?

280
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,197
<i>You already know that many</i>
<i>lieutenants passed through</i>
<i>the Precipice World</i>

281
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,430
<i>to the World of the Living</i>
<i>to work on cleansing the</i>
<i>Tenkai Zone.</i>

282
00:21:17,464 --> 00:21:24,097
<i>Well during that time, I made</i>
<i>a few modifications to the</i>
<i>Soul Society's Senkaimon.</i>

283
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:29,164
<i>I collected a small amount of</i>
<i>Reishi from the Soul Reapers</i>
<i>who passed through it.</i>

284
00:21:29,464 --> 00:21:36,630
<i>With that, I created Mod</i>
<i>Souls indistinguishable</i>
<i>from the originals and</i>
<i>placed them inside Reigai.</i>

285
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:40,897
And that is how I built
my invading force.

286
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,330
The Senkaimon.

287
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,764
Do you understand now?

288
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,730
I've already collected
your Reishi.

289
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:56,930
And it's all thanks to
the Lieutenant Kotetsu
that I created!

290
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:09,664
What are you going to do now?
Heh heh heh heh heh!

291
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:50,472
<i>[Toshiro]</i>
