1
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:55,118
<i>[Inaba]</i>
<i>I've underestimated all your</i>
<i>powers? Is that what you said?</i>

2
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,651
Yes. Is it not true?

3
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:02,184
I've never been very
interested in what others do.

4
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:06,784
So it's difficult for me
to say that I truly know
all of you thoroughly.

5
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:08,618
But, Captain Unohana.

6
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:12,218
<i>Don't you think that the</i>
<i>same could be said of you?</i>

7
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:14,784
What do you mean by that?

8
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:17,751
Oh, you'll find out.

9
00:02:18,818 --> 00:02:19,318
[gasp]

10
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:25,951
Captain Unohana.
You'll have to forgive me.

11
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:34,784
I've already collected
your Reishi.

12
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:38,918
And it's all thanks to
the Lieutenant Kotetsu
that I created!

13
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:51,184
What are you going to do now?
Heh heh heh heh heh!

14
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:03,751
Got to give the old man credit.
He's good.

15
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,751
How you holding up,
Shunsui?

16
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:09,484
Not bad. I still have
a bit more left in me.

17
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:24,284
Hmm.

18
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:26,818
[Toshiro]
I've been expecting you,
Byakuya.

19
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:31,784
I'm just going to
cut to the chase.

20
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:35,384
My orders are to stop
anyone from getting
through past this point.

21
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:39,418
If you wish to turn back and
leave, now's your chance.

22
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:44,851
You stand in my way,
and I will eliminate you.

23
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:49,484
That makes this an
easy choice, then.

24
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:56,184
Bankai! Daiguren Hyorinmaru!

25
00:03:58,084 --> 00:03:59,618
Yaaaaah!

26
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:10,851
Oh! Kisuke.

27
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:15,784
So it seems everyone's
reached the Soul Society
except Captain Komamura.

28
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:19,351
Wait, how were you able to get
that information from here?

29
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:24,251
Well, we'd be at a huge
disadvantage if we couldn't tell
what's going on over there.

30
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:28,118
So I placed devices
on the captains that
transmit back to us.

31
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:29,284
Kisuke.

32
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:32,951
I can't just sit here!
You have to send me to
the Soul Society!

33
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:34,551
Huh?
Huh?
But Ichigo!

34
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:36,051
What're you
talking about?!

35
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,951
This isn't the time
to be resting!
I've gotta go help them!

36
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:41,484
Just calm down!

37
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,351
Let the others handle
the Soul Society!

38
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:45,018
I mean, look at this!

39
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,284
The ladies are
still in a coma!

40
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:50,951
And let's not even get
started on how messed up
the guys got out there!

41
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:53,584
Bed-ridden,
Soul Reapers,
and Four-Eyes!

42
00:04:53,618 --> 00:04:59,751
That's it. Next time your
threads start unraveling,
you're on your own!
That's all we have around here!

43
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:02,784
And why am I being lumped with
the others? I'm not injured!
And right now, each one of them
is more useless than the last!

44
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:05,751
There's almost no one who
can put up a decent fight.

45
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:08,818
If you leave, who
knows what'll happen
if we're attacked!

46
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,818
You're the one who
said you'd protect
Nozomi, remember?
You promised!

47
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:16,284
How're you going to do that
if you're not around?!

48
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,251
And besides Ichigo,
you really do need
some rest.

49
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:26,118
Yeah, listen to Orihime!
Be a good boy and stay
right here!

50
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:28,084
[Nozomi]
Can I ask a question?

51
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:28,818
Hmm?
Hmm?
Hmm?

52
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:30,884
Yeah. Sure.
What is it?

53
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:35,584
Why are you so
determined to protect me?
What's in it for you?

54
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:40,384
Oh! Well, because uh...
Eh, that's a good question...

55
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:41,984
Who knows?

56
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:42,984
Uh?

57
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:44,951
I guess I don't
really know myself.

58
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:47,151
<i>Seriously!?</i>
<i>He doesn't know?!</i>

59
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:50,884
Well, at first, it was
less about protecting you,

60
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:56,351
and more about protecting my
friends in the World of the
Living by stopping Kageroza.

61
00:05:56,851 --> 00:05:58,318
Wow, talk about being blunt!

62
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:01,784
Then maybe if I had just
stayed in the Precipice World...

63
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:02,484
<i>No!</i>

64
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:06,884
You always keep trying to
take everything on yourself.

65
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:09,418
I'm Sorry, but I'm not
gonna let you do that.

66
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:14,084
If you don't want to
tell us your story, fine.
I've told you that before.

67
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:19,218
But you knew that
something terrible would
happen if Kageroza caught
you, didn't you Nozomi?

68
00:06:20,818 --> 00:06:22,684
<i>You don't have to</i>
<i>do this yourself!</i>

69
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:24,684
You aren't alone anymore.

70
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:27,551
Not alone...?

71
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:55,618
[gasp]

72
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:57,584
<i>[Kon]</i>
<i>Hey...</i>

73
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,418
Hey!

74
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,518
[startled]
Whuh?

75
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:01,151
What's going
on with you?

76
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:03,484
It's nothing.

77
00:07:04,018 --> 00:07:07,118
Anyway, I don't know why
I want to protect you.

78
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:12,184
Except that I heard a voice,
And it told me I'm supposed
to help you out.

79
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:14,151
Are you some kind of idiot?

80
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,318
Hey, you don't call someone
an idiot to their face!

81
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:19,984
Especially not
somebody who
saved you!

82
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:23,618
It's just... I didn't
hear any voice.

83
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,584
Listen, kid, you're kinda
missing the whole point here.

84
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:29,018
[chuckle]

85
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:33,051
Heh, boy, you really are
an idiot, aren't you?

86
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:34,718
Heh.

87
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,418
Stop calling me that.
It's Ichigo.

88
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:41,218
This should help restore
some of your Spirit Energy.

89
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:46,018
That's a form of
Kido, isn't it?

90
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:48,684
And I thought you
were just a kid
with an attitude.

91
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,851
Stop calling me that.

92
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,284
It's Nozomi Kujo.

93
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:55,451
All right.
I'll remember that.

94
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,051
Bakudo Number Sixty-Two!
Hyapporankan!

95
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:02,851
Bakudo Number Sixty-Three!
Sajosabaku!

96
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:09,184
Hado Number Eighty-Eight!
Hiryu Gekizoku Shinten Raiho!

97
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:11,284
No incantation!

98
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:14,284
Bakudo Number Eighty-One! Danku!

99
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,751
Lieutenant Kotetsu.
Are you okay?

100
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:25,851
I'm fine.

101
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:33,318
[Isane]
Where's the original
Captain Unohana?

102
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:36,484
She's a wise woman
and a wily opponent.

103
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:39,684
She never really had
any intention of
fighting us at all.

104
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:41,084
So it would
appear.

105
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:43,651
But, I don't
understand.

106
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:49,784
She knew that she didn't have
much of a chance to win this
fight, especially not when it
was three against one.

107
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:58,418
And if she were to die here,
the original captains would lose
their only means to heal and
recover in the Soul Society.

108
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:04,251
<i>Someone who would take the</i>
<i>risk of fighting us anyway</i>
<i>would not be fit to be</i>
<i>captain of Squad Four.</i>

109
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:05,718
Then right from
the start?

110
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:10,418
Yes, that Kido was
apparently only
meant to distract
us from her escape.

111
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,084
She pulled a
fast one on us.

112
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:16,051
Well then, we need
to get moving.

113
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:18,951
Yaaaaahh!

114
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:34,651
Sennen Hyoro!

115
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:41,451
[gasp]

116
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,284
Enough.

117
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:48,651
You really thought
you could fool me
with this ice double?

118
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:54,384
No, you're too smart
for all that.

119
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:58,451
I am well aware of
your skills, Byakuya.

120
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:01,284
Trying to capture you
will be no easy task.

121
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:02,584
Huuah!

122
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:08,684
One question.

123
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:12,351
A question from you?
How unusual!

124
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:13,518
Why?

125
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:14,884
What do you mean?

126
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:19,718
Why would someone of
your caliber choose
to follow that man?

127
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:22,418
What, Kageroza?

128
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:24,584
If you knew,
would it matter?

129
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:28,584
Never mind.

130
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:33,618
There's someone I want to
protect no matter what.

131
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,784
In order to keep her safe,
I'll do whatever it takes!

132
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:40,284
Sennen Hyoro!

133
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:44,351
The same technique again?

134
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:46,684
Huuaah!

135
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:57,084
<i>So that's his strategy;</i>
<i>To limit my range and prevent</i>
<i>me from moving freely by</i>
<i>creating these pillars of ice.</i>

136
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:58,818
<i>Sorry, Byakuya.</i>

137
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:01,918
My goal is to settle the
score with my original.

138
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:06,918
What I'm determined to
protect, my original
wants to protect as well.

139
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:09,418
But he doesn't have
what it takes!

140
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:11,351
Don't you see?!

141
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:15,084
Only the power Kageroza gave me
will make it possible!

142
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:20,751
So until she's safe,
I cannot lose to anyone!

143
00:11:20,784 --> 00:11:22,484
Hyoryusenbi!

144
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:33,472
Hyoryusenbi!

145
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:37,939
Bankai.
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

146
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:48,305
[gasp]

147
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:54,305
Using any means necessary,
including the powers of
another.

148
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:57,939
That is how someone
with no honor thinks.

149
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:02,839
I won't lose to someone who's
tossed away their pride.

150
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:08,739
Yaaah!

151
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:14,672
What?!

152
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:19,505
Are you all right, Jushiro?

153
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:24,005
Yes. But I'm no match for
the power of those flames.

154
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:26,972
What will it be, young ones?

155
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:35,139
Even with only one arm,
my powers are more than
enough to stop both of
you from taking me down!

156
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,739
Yes, you're right.
However...

157
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:39,505
We're not done yet!

158
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,972
Pathetic!

159
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,805
You've already
reached your limits!

160
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,472
Cut us some slack!
You're just too
strong, Old Man Yama!

161
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:05,105
Earlier in our fight,
you said something
about having honor.

162
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:08,505
Yes, that's right.
We still have our honor.

163
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,039
Is this your idea
of having "honor"?!

164
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:19,272
The real versions of the two
of you would follow through
on their convictions
regardless of my wishes,

165
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:22,372
but they would
never compromise
their true nature.

166
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:25,205
I know that more than anyone.

167
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:47,672
But you two lack the
original's conviction.

168
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:52,239
To my eyes, it's nothing more
than a rebellion by impostors.

169
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:56,405
That really hurts, coming
from you, Old Man Yama.

170
00:13:57,105 --> 00:14:00,839
Master Genryusai.
Certainly, to you
originals,

171
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:05,239
what we're doing might seem
like a selfish rebellion
by mere pretenders.

172
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:10,405
But still! We Reigai have our
own way of pursuing our beliefs!

173
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:11,605
<i>And what's that?</i>

174
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:15,405
We cannot tell you
that just yet.

175
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:20,005
Well, then, I have no
choice but to crush you!

176
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:22,739
Huh?

177
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,839
Wait, is that...?

178
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,672
Seems she finally
decided to show up!

179
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:30,972
<i>[Jushiro]</i>
<i>Captain Unohana!</i>

180
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:33,872
[Shunsui]
You sure took your sweet
time getting here!

181
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,605
I noticed right from the
beginning that the two of you
were fighting at full power,

182
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,039
even willing to throw away your
lives in order to kill me.

183
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,739
As if you were in a
hurry to end this fight.

184
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:51,805
But it seems I was mistaken.

185
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:53,539
Yes.

186
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:56,539
Sorry about that,
Old Man Yama.

187
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:58,405
It wasn't that we
were in a hurry.

188
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,872
See, we were able to push
ourselves to our limits,
thanks to her.

189
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:05,905
Please understand, sir.
Unless we did that,

190
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,572
we had no chance
of winning against
you at all.

191
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:22,572
Fine, then.

192
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:27,805
It does not change the fact that
this is a fight to the death!

193
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,805
[panting]

194
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,072
You think I've thrown
away my pride?

195
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:47,739
I suppose it might appear
that way, I'll grant you that.

196
00:15:49,005 --> 00:15:52,105
<i>After all, we can never</i>
<i>become the originals.</i>

197
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:56,839
<i>And even if we defeat</i>
<i>the originals,</i>
<i>Reigai are still Reigai.</i>

198
00:15:57,172 --> 00:16:02,939
And that's precisely the reason
why I will use any and all means
to protect my own intentions!

199
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:07,772
That's the one thing I can hold
onto with pride as a Reigai!

200
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:15,539
You probably think I kept
using Sennen Hyoro in order
to restrict your range,

201
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,805
and also take
away your freedom
of movement.

202
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:20,439
But you would be wrong.

203
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:25,239
By using Sennen Hyoro to
establish a perimeter
around you, I forced you
to destroy it.

204
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:33,172
<i>Someone like you, who</i>
<i>uses speed as a weapon,</i>
<i>would surely have to keep</i>
<i>their surroundings clear.</i>

205
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:34,605
[gasp]

206
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,639
When you destroyed that ice,
it turned into a powdery snow.

207
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:45,372
It obscured our vision,
and created the opportunity
I needed for my next move.

208
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,572
Hyoten Hyakkaso.

209
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:54,272
[gasp]

210
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:58,939
There's no way for
you to escape now!

211
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:08,939
That should have restored
some of your Spirit Energy.

212
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:14,472
Aah! It's just like that
time when Miss Unohana
healed me. Awesome!

213
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:15,739
Seriously?!

214
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,172
[weary faint]

215
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:18,272
Hey, watch out!

216
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,805
Are you okay?

217
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,239
I'm fine.

218
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:25,505
Maybe that effort was
more taxing on your
body than usual

219
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:28,172
'cause you haven't
used your Soul Reaper
powers in a while.

220
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:30,972
<i>Can you stand up?</i>

221
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:32,639
Yeah.

222
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,205
Why's no one worried about me?!

223
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:39,605
[Ichigo]
Kisuke.

224
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:40,905
[startled]
Nh!
Yes?

225
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:42,339
Send me in.

226
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:43,939
Are you sure, Ichigo?

227
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:48,439
If I just wait, I'm
going to start losing
my Spirit Energy again.

228
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:52,205
Right now, I'm strong enough
to take the fight to them!

229
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,039
Ichigo, you can't!

230
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:56,239
Kon, accept it.

231
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:57,439
No, I won't!

232
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:03,439
Ah! Say something!
Stop this fool
from doing this!

233
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:05,405
We could try,
but I doubt
he'd listen.

234
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,139
[dripping with sarcasm]
Sure, he won't listen,
so don't even try!

235
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,439
You won't stop him
that way, Four-Eyes!

236
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,905
We'll manage on our own
here somehow, Ichigo.

237
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:16,405
We promise that we'll
find a way to keep Nozomi
safe while you're gone.

238
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:20,339
Agh! You guys are hopeless!

239
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:22,739
Why are all of you so stupid?!

240
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:26,939
Fine, go take care of
that bastard Kageroza
and get back here!

241
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,739
Just be quick about it!

242
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,372
Yeah, I will.

243
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:32,005
Alright, Kisuke.

244
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:36,339
Very well then.
But let me say
this first.

245
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:40,972
Returning to the Soul Society
is going to be far riskier than
when you went the first time.

246
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:43,305
Are you sure you
want to do this?

247
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:45,339
You bet!
I'm damn sure!

248
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:47,705
All right. Let's
get you ready then.

249
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,205
Ah!

250
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:03,439
Huh?

251
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:07,739
Spiritual Pressure...
What's going on?

252
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:11,939
What?!

253
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:20,772
Ngh!

254
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,539
[panting]

255
00:19:30,672 --> 00:19:34,672
You're still alive, Byakuya?!
How can this be?!

256
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:38,939
If my Senbonzakura had been
even a moment later...

257
00:19:40,105 --> 00:19:41,372
...I would have
been in trouble.

258
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:48,072
You're good, it's true, but as
long as there's moisture in the
air, I still have the advantage.

259
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,072
There!

260
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:53,739
Yaaah!

261
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:02,039
<i>It felt like I hit him.</i>
<i>What is this?!</i>

262
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,339
[gasp]

263
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:12,972
Gokei.
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

264
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:27,172
Should've known.

265
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,539
There is one thing...
that the both of us share.

266
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:51,672
<i>To protect my pride...</i>

267
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,172
I'll use any means necessary.

268
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,939
Hey, What's with the
sad face, Nozomi?

269
00:21:16,572 --> 00:21:17,972
Nothing,
I'm okay.

270
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:22,105
Don't worry; you'll be safe.
Everyone's going to be looking
out for you while I'm gone.

271
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,005
Kon. Got that?

272
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:28,405
Yeah, of course!
I've looked after
her this long.
She's in good hands!

273
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:31,505
Right. Hold onto him like
he's a good luck charm.

274
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:33,105
Whaddaya mean,
good luck charm?!

275
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:36,005
Ichigo, be very
careful, all right?

276
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,039
Yeah.

277
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:38,939
Now get going and
finish this already!

278
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,205
You got it!

279
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:41,305
Ichigo.

280
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:42,372
Mm?

281
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:44,439
Please come back.

282
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:45,272
Ah.

283
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,805
[chuckle]
Yeah, I promise.

284
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:49,972
Well, I better get going!

285
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:04,472
Rest assured.

286
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:08,872
<i>Nozomi will return to us.</i>
<i>I promise.</i>

287
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:48,974
[Jushiro]
Seems Captain Hitsugaya's
Reigai has fallen.

288
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:50,674
<i>[Shunsui]</i>
<i>Yes, how unfortunate.</i>

289
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,674
[Jushiro]
Indeed.

290
00:23:53,507 --> 00:23:57,340
This life-size toy figure
and box full of candies I
had prepared for him will
now go to waste.

291
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:59,340
<i>[Shunsui]</i>
<i>He wouldn't have</i>
<i>liked it anyway...</i>

292
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:00,507
[Jushiro]
You think so?
