‐OK.

00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:54,834
Now who the hell's this?

9
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:57,999
‐Captain of Squad
Three, Gin Ichimaru.

10
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:02,667
‐Oh, not good.

No!

‐[moaning]

15
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,167
‐Unacceptable.

16
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:36,334
Being a guardian
of the gate doesn't

17
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:38,876
mean you're supposed
to open the gate.

18
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,999
‐[grunting]

19
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:43,792
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN):
(THINKING) How careless of me.

20
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:48,542
I didn't think someone of
his caliber would show up.

21
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,999
Even if these kids
have gotten stronger,

22
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:55,250
the strength of a captain
is beyond their imagination.

23
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,751
They cannot fight him.

24
00:02:56,751 --> 00:03:00,167
We must avoid that potentially
disastrous scenario

25
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:00,959
at all costs.

26
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,125
‐[grunting] I defended
the gate, and lost.

27
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,083
Once I lost, I had
to open the gate.

28
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,918
There was nothing
else I could do.

29
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:15,292
‐What you're saying
makes no sense.

30
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:19,459
A gatekeeper who loses isn't
supposed to open the gate.

31
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:26,417
When a gatekeeper
loses, it means death.

32
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:26,999
‐[grunting]

‐[gasp] Ichigo!

35
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,999
‐You want to tell me
just what the hell you

36
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:42,000
think you're doing?

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,999
‐Yes, Ichigo.

38
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:44,125
What are you doing?

39
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,417
‐What's the big idea showing
up now, and trying to butt in?

40
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:49,542
You stupid fricking‐ass clown.

41
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:52,167
Anyone who's pathetic enough
to make an appearance in order

42
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:56,999
to attack an unarmed man
deserves to be killed.

43
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,042
‐You're sure a funny kid.

44
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:01,459
And you're not scared of me.

45
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,125
‐Hell no.

46
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,125
‐Careful, boy.

47
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,709
You must stop, Ichigo.

48
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,918
It is best we retreat for now.

49
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:10,501
‐(THINKING) Ichigo?

50
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,042
‐Huh?

51
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:11,542
Why?

52
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,626
I'm only just
getting started here.

53
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:13,584
GIN (OFFSCREEN):
(THINKING) It's him.

54
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:15,667
‐There's no way I'm going
to submit to this guy.

55
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:16,542
Look, I'll be fine.

56
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:17,959
So just let me
finish this guy off.

57
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,959
GIN (OFFSCREEN): You
must be Ichigo Kurosaki.

58
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,584
‐You know about me?

59
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,167
But how could you?

60
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:26,584
‐Just as I thought.

61
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:29,999
How very predictable.

62
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,584
‐What?

63
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:34,125
Hey, where are you going?

64
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:34,751
Hey, wait!

65
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:38,709
‐All the more reason why
I can't let you pass.

66
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,334
‐So then why are you
standing so far back?

67
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:50,918
Unless you're planning
on throwing that dagger.

68
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:52,999
‐It's not a dagger.

69
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:54,999
In fact, this is my zanpakuto.

70
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,999
Impale him.

71
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:06,834
Shinzo.

72
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:22,209
‐Ichigo!

73
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:22,999
‐Ichigo!

74
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,667
‐No!

75
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,542
The gate!

76
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,083
‐Bye bye now.

77
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:40,125
‐Ichigo, are you all right?

78
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:40,834
‐What happened?

79
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:44,375
‐[growling] Look at the gate.

80
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:48,999
That bastard.

81
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:52,667
‐Well, it seems that
you are all right.

82
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:53,375
‐I'm sorry, guys.

83
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,209
It's all my fault
that the gate closed.

84
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:59,042
‐No, don't start
blaming yourself.

85
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,584
Your opponent was Gin Ichimaru.

86
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:02,375
It couldn't be helped.

87
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,501
You should just be glad
that you were not hurt.

88
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:13,999
‐Would you do me a favor?

89
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,292
Go over there, and try to
help Jitambo if you can.

90
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:17,834
‐Mhmm.

91
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:20,167
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
That's strange.

92
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,375
‐Lookie what we've got here.

93
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,125
‐They must've been
hiding until now.

94
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,417
‐But why?

95
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:33,250
‐Well, obviously we were
frightening to them.

96
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,250
Souls who come to
the soul society

97
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,792
illegally, without a soul
reaper escort are called rioka,

98
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:43,209
and are said to be the root
cause of all kinds of trouble.

99
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,125
‐They must think that
we're their enemies.

100
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,250
‐Please stop.

101
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,334
Allow me to introduce myself.

102
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:55,000
‐Huh?

103
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,709
‐I am the elder of
this area, which

104
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,250
is known as the Rukon district.

105
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,999
All of us witnessed the
events that occurred just now.

106
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:12,209
And we would all like to welcome
you as Jidanbo's true saviors.

107
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:18,459
This place is full
of many soul reapers

108
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:19,792
that are rotten
and incorrigible.

109
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:23,834
But Jitanbo, a native of Rukon
district, is not one of them.

110
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:26,334
He's always been so kind to us.

111
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:29,751
‐We all witnessed how you
fought against Gin Ichimaru

112
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:32,125
in order to save Jitanbo.

113
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:36,334
You must surely
be a good person.

114
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:37,999
We can see that.

115
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,667
But still, what
a terrible wound.

116
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,792
‐Right.

117
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,584
There's no need to worry.

118
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:49,125
I should be able to
heal Jitanbo's wounds.

119
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,167
[gasping and cries of happiness]

120
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,000
‐Huh?

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,999
You're kidding me.

122
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:55,792
You really can heal that wound?

123
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:56,125
‐Sure.

124
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,918
Just leave it to me.

125
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:09,542
Shuno. Ayame.

126
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:10,125
‐Hi.

127
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,999
Do you need some help?

128
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:13,459
‐Hello.

129
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,999
‐Could you lend me your powers?

130
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:17,876
‐Of course we will.

131
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:20,042
As your power, we are here
awaiting your command.

132
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:25,709
All you have to do is recite
the spirit chant, remember?

133
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,792
‐Mhmm.

134
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:28,417
All right.

135
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:29,667
Here we go.

136
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:37,999
Sotenkishun. I reject.

137
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:41,792
[gasps]

138
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:43,125
‐That's truly amazing.

139
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,999
So when exactly did
you get that power?

140
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,584
YUICHI (OFFSCREEN): Excuse me.

141
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:49,918
Please let me through.

142
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:50,292
Ugh.

143
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:51,250
Move it!

144
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,999
Ugh!

145
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:57,083
Hey, over here.

146
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:57,999
It's me.

147
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:58,667
It's Yuichi.

148
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:01,417
Don't you remember?

149
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,292
‐Yuichi Shibata?

150
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,501
‐Right, Yuichi the cockatiel.

151
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,501
You remember now, don't you?

152
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:19,125
‐Uh, it's really you.

153
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:34,584
‐I can tell you've
put on some weight.

154
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:35,876
‐I have not.

155
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,751
People who have never
been here before

156
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:38,999
always make that mistake.

157
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:42,334
You only think that because
you knew me as a parakeet.

158
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:43,709
Here, you don't change at all.

159
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,959
You stay the same as
when you first get here.

160
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,834
‐I see.

161
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:55,792
Tell me, Yuichi, it's‐‐ uh,
what happened with your mother?

162
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:56,126
‐Oh.

163
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:59,292
Here's where I live.

164
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:00,999
I know it looks
kind of run down.

165
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:03,000
But that makes it really
cool in the summer.

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,584
And my family, they're
all really nice.

167
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:08,459
‐What do you mean, your family?

168
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,125
‐Yuichi,, so you're back.

169
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:14,626
You know that mom and dad
were really worried about you.

170
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:16,000
‐[gasp] I, uh‐‐

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,626
‐Did he say your mom and dad.

172
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:22,000
‐Uh, it's just, you see, uh,
this is, uh, Hironari Horiuchi.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,459
And I guess he's
like my big brother.

174
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,209
‐It's nice to meet you.

175
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,709
‐So he's like your big brother?

176
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,959
‐It is often the case
in the soul society‐‐

177
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,501
or rather in the
Rukon district‐‐

178
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:40,999
that people who aren't actually
related to one another by birth

179
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:43,542
form their own families,
and live together.

180
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,167
People who have died in
different times and places

181
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:49,083
come to form special bonds.

182
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,834
It's rare for someone to
meet up with a real family

183
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,876
member who died earlier.

184
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:56,000
‐Hmm.

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,501
But don't the soul
reapers do what

186
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:00,209
they can to reunite
you with your family?

187
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:01,918
‐Well, no, not really.

188
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:04,083
You see, I died in 1947.

189
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,125
It happened in
Yamanashi prefecture,

190
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,000
long before Yuichi died.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,999
You can see by our age and
location that were far apart.

192
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:17,584
‐So that means you really
haven't seen your mother yet?

193
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:17,999
‐No.

194
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,250
But I haven't stopped
looking for her.

195
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,459
‐Hey, don't worry about it, kid.

196
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:26,292
And remember that no matter
what, we're all here for you.

197
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:26,999
Listen to me.

198
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:27,999
You mustn't worry.

199
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:30,417
We were all just like him
when we first got here.

200
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:33,042
But eventually, we
all change with time.

201
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:36,999
‐(SADLY) I won't
see my mom again.

202
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:42,751
[crying]

203
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:43,167
‐Uh, excuse me.

204
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:48,375
Would be all right if I stay
with Yuichi a little longer?

205
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,584
‐That should be just fine.

206
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,209
In that case, I'll
have to go and let

207
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,250
the family know what's going on.

208
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:00,792
‐I've been meaning to ask what
you're doing here, mister.

209
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,999
You're not dead, or
something, are you?

210
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:04,375
‐Uh, no.

211
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,834
I'm not dead.

212
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:06,167
‐OK.

213
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:06,999
Then why are you here.

214
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:10,250
‐I'm beginning to
wonder, myself.

215
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,459
‐Hey, look over there
up on that roof.

216
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:16,584
Isn't that your
soul reaper friend?

217
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:19,083
You know, even if he
goes up higher than that,

218
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,999
he won't be able to
see beyond the gate.

219
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:24,083
‐But that won't stop
him from looking.

220
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,250
Because he just never gives up.

221
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,876
That's the kind of guy he is.

222
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:29,334
You know what I mean?

223
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,959
I guess I must have been
right about your age

224
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,626
when I first started to
realize the fact that I was

225
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:48,209
a lot different
than everyone else.

226
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:48,999
I was right.

227
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,209
Somehow I possessed
this amazing strength.

228
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:54,083
And that strength was
what made me different.

229
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,584
But I don't understand
this power that I have.

230
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,584
I want to understand.

231
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,334
I have a feeling that coming
here will give me some clues.

232
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:21,626
I guess that's
part of why I came.

233
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:23,375
But in searching
for these answers,

234
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,417
I have had to risk everything.

235
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:29,542
‐You must really believe the
risk is worth the reward.

236
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,792
‐I believe that, Yuichi.

237
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:34,626
And that's why you
must never give up.

238
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,999
If you never give up,
and keep searching,

239
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,876
you will find your mother.

240
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:41,626
You believe that,
don't you, Yuichi?

241
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:44,501
‐Yeah, I do now, mister.

242
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:45,000
‐That's great.

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,959
So let's both make a promise.

244
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:48,584
‐OK.

245
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,250
‐Oh, uh, Chad.

246
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,792
‐Yeah, Ichigo?

247
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,125
‐What were you thinking, man.

248
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,876
You gotta at least
let me know when

249
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:06,000
you're behind me like that.

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,918
‐Ichigo, you should know I'm
always going to have your back.

251
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,045
‐Are you serious?

252
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:30,045
You really want us to give up
trying to get past the gate?

253
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:31,004
YORUICHI (OFFSCREEN): No.

254
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,421
I don't mean give up completely.

255
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:34,669
Once the gate has been
opened, it's only logical

256
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:37,920
that the security on the other
side becomes that much tighter.

257
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,753
Which means that continuing
with the same strategy

258
00:14:40,753 --> 00:14:43,254
is not necessarily
the best approach.

259
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:45,379
‐I have to agree
with you on that.

260
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:47,462
‐So then what about
the other gates?

261
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:49,504
‐There won't be much
different from what

262
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:50,129
we faced with this one.

263
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:53,753
‐Well in that case, then what
the hell are we gonna do?

264
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:54,629
‐Well, isn't it obvious?

265
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,837
If we cannot use the gate, then
naturally we must enter another

266
00:14:57,837 --> 00:14:58,669
way.

267
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:05,254
Elder, do you know the
whereabouts of Kukaku Shiba?

268
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:05,712
‐What?

269
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:07,588
You can't be serious.

270
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:09,254
‐As you may know,
she is someone who

271
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:10,753
likes to change her
place of residence.

272
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:15,669
I haven't been able to find
out where she currently lives.

273
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:18,087
‐Kukaku Shiba!

274
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:20,712
[trampling hooves]

275
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,669
‐Are you sure?

276
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:25,920
Don't tell me you're planning to
go through the wall like that.

277
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,753
‐Uh, like what?

278
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:29,879
[trampling hooves]

279
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:30,421
‐Huh?

280
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:33,045
What's that noise?

281
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:37,171
‐Sounds like a stampede.

282
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:37,669
‐Whoa!

283
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:38,379
‐[screaming]

284
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,920
‐What's happening?

285
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,546
‐[moaning]

286
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:43,712
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Anyone know who this guy is?

287
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:44,669
‐[oink]

288
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:45,920
‐Huh?

289
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,753
Are you kidding?

290
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:51,588
What in the‐‐ what's
a boar doing here?

291
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:52,669
‐Well, well, well.

292
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:53,421
What do you know?

293
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:54,379
Thrown again by old Bonnie.

294
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:57,837
There's got to be a
better way to travel.

295
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:58,546
Hey.

296
00:15:58,546 --> 00:16:01,045
It's been a long time, old man.

297
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:01,669
‐Konju, no.

298
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,045
What are you doing here?

299
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,004
I think you should go home.

300
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:06,045
‐What gives?

301
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:07,296
Look, I know it's been a while.

302
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:09,669
But is that any way to
greet an old friend?

303
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:13,337
I mean, what are your
guests here going to think?

304
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:13,962
Huh?

305
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:18,004
What do we have here?

306
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:23,337
Would someone explain to me why
there's a stinking soul reaper

307
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:24,004
here?

308
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:25,462
‐What did you just say?

309
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:27,879
‐What's the matter,
your ears not working?

310
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:30,588
What I said was, would
someone explain to me

311
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:35,462
why there's a stinking
soul reaper here.

312
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,296
‐Huh?

313
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,254
‐Huh?

314
00:16:39,254 --> 00:16:43,087
Well, then say something,
you snivelling dandelion.

315
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:46,669
[grunting] Hey!

316
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:48,337
Just what are you trying to do?

317
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:50,712
Are you picking a fight with me?

318
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:52,129
‐You started it pig straddler.

319
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:54,795
You walked in, and picked
on me for no reason.

320
00:16:54,795 --> 00:16:56,171
What kind of a moron are you?

321
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:57,129
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): Moron?

322
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,588
‐What should we do about this?

323
00:16:58,588 --> 00:17:00,669
We've got to stop those two.

324
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:01,795
‐Quite a mess.

325
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:04,254
This is just as I expected.

326
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:04,669
‐Come on!

327
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:07,337
This is not time to
sit there drinking tea.

328
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:09,629
Just tell us who the guy is.

329
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:10,712
‐Are you kidding me?

330
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:13,379
You really don't know who I am?

331
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:14,254
‐No, I don't.

332
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:15,296
‐Me neither.

333
00:17:15,296 --> 00:17:15,669
‐No.

334
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,421
‐I don't want to know.

335
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:17,795
‐Heh.

336
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,669
Then that settles it.

337
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:21,504
Let me introduce myself.

338
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:25,712
My given name is Ganju, the
self proclaimed Deep‐Red Bullet

339
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,045
of West Rukon, and self
proclaimed but universally

340
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:31,296
acknowledged boss
man of West Rukon.

341
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:36,920
And finally, the self proclaimed
number one soul reaper hater

342
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,712
of West Rukon.

343
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:41,837
‐Self proclaimed.

344
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:42,379
‐Hah.

345
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:45,337
You forgot to add
self proclaimed fool.

346
00:17:45,337 --> 00:17:47,462
‐Say what?

347
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,254
‐You heard me.

348
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:55,669
‐[roaring]

349
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:56,669
‐Ichigo!

350
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:57,337
‐No, Ichigo!

351
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:58,254
‐Hold it right there.

352
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:00,669
We won't let you get
in the boss man's way.

353
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:04,004
‐But look, if you really
want to fight someone‐‐

354
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:07,546
‐We will be happy to oblige you.

355
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,004
‐Ganju's henchmen.

356
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,753
‐What do we do now?

357
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:12,045
‐See that?

358
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:15,669
ICHIGO'S FRIENDS (OFFSCREEN):
They're all riding on boars.

359
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:18,254
‐Get out of here
while you still can.

360
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:18,670
Now listen.

361
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,837
As long as I'm
alive, no soul reaper

362
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:24,087
will ever be allowed to step
one stinking foot inside West‐‐

363
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:27,087
‐Boss man!

364
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:28,004
‐Shut up.

365
00:18:28,004 --> 00:18:29,795
Give it a rest, why don't you?

366
00:18:29,795 --> 00:18:34,669
Look, if you want to
fight, then I'll fight you.

367
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:35,004
‐Why you!

368
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:39,212
You punched my ruggedly handsome
face‐‐ not once, but twice.

369
00:18:39,212 --> 00:18:41,879
‐Actually, the second time
around, it was a kick,

370
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:42,795
you idiot.

371
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:44,462
‐That's enough fighting, Ichigo.

372
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:46,504
You should not be
using up your strength

373
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:47,669
in a meaningless brawl.

374
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,296
‐Hey, don't forget
he started the fight.

375
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,669
So if you want this to
stop, then tell him.

376
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:55,129
‐[sighing in annoyance]
(THINKING) Getting all worked

377
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:57,962
up over such a silly
thing, the fool!

378
00:18:57,962 --> 00:19:01,462
‐The way I see things, you
and me are destined to fight.

379
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:03,712
We don't have a
choice in the matter.

380
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:08,296
‐Stop this fighting, Ganju!

381
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:11,795
Can't you see this man
is a good soul reaper?

382
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:12,669
‐That's enough.

383
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:15,171
Look, soul reapers
are soul reapers.

384
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:19,254
To me, there is no good or bad.

385
00:19:19,254 --> 00:19:22,254
‐You're wrong, Ganju.

386
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:23,669
‐Now get ready.

387
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:27,004
‐Not good.

388
00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:31,004
How does Ichigo expect to handle
him without his zanpakuto?

389
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,296
‐[gasp]

390
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:37,504
‐I got it.

391
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:38,669
Thanks, Chad!

392
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:46,962
‐Very impressive.

393
00:19:46,962 --> 00:19:49,920
I was wondering when
you'd use your zanpakuto.

394
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,296
However, don't think
that you can win this,

395
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:57,669
just because you
wield a bigger weapon.

396
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:06,669
[chuckling]

397
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:07,462
Sink!

398
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:12,212
‐The ground is gone.

399
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,212
‐It's like quicksand.

400
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,669
‐Just hang in there, Ichigo.

401
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,588
‐Using weird tricks
won't help you win.

402
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:27,171
‐[roaring]

403
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:35,462
‐All I can say is, if
that didn't drop you,

404
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:37,920
then you are one tough warrior.

405
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:43,669
‐[gruntng]

406
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:58,171
[grunts and impacts]

407
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:06,753
‐What's the matter?

408
00:21:06,753 --> 00:21:08,588
It's not over yet.

409
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:19,669
‐[roaring]

410
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:23,171
[alarm clock ringing]

411
00:21:30,045 --> 00:21:31,421
‐What time is it now?

412
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,087
‐It's 9:00 already, boss man!

413
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:35,212
This is going to be bad.

414
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:35,670
‐What?

415
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,879
Nine o'clock?

416
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:37,421
Come on.

417
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,629
We gotta go, Bonnie.

418
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:39,504
[whistling]

419
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:43,087
[trampling hooves]

420
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:43,753
‐Bonnie?

421
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:52,670
[music playing]

422
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,462
‐In the next episode, we go to
Kukaku Shiba's unique house,

423
00:22:53,462 --> 00:22:54,669
located somewhere in West Rukon.

424
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:57,504
So what's the secret to this
gorgeous wooden structure

425
00:22:57,504 --> 00:22:58,753
surrounded by open lands?

426
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:02,212
Well, I guess you'll just have
to wait and see. [giggling]

427
00:23:02,212 --> 00:23:05,462
‐So these are natural
wood pillars, huh?
