1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,333
[theme music]

2
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:41,726
ICHIGO: [sigh]
We're still screwed.

3
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,559
Because even if that
bald guy I beat up

4
00:01:43,592 --> 00:01:45,326
was telling the truth
about Rukia being

5
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,559
held in some white tower, we
still don't know where it is,

6
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:51,426
or which road we need
to take to get there.

7
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:52,759
-[gasp]

8
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,092
-Hey, wait a minute?

9
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,726
What about this map?

10
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,026
This would help us avoid
running into any more captains

11
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,159
out there.

12
00:02:00,192 --> 00:02:03,692
HANATARO: It's Rukia Kuchiki
you're looking for, isn't it?

13
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:04,826
I thought so.

14
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,526
It all makes sense now.

15
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,659
And that means the white
tower you were talking about

16
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:12,459
must be the repentance cell.

17
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:15,492
If you'll trust
me, I can help you.

18
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:17,492
I know a hidden way
into that tower.

19
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,692
GANJU: [sigh] I have
to admit, I wouldn't

20
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:28,726
have thought of using
the sewer system.

21
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,992
-Yes.

22
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:31,992
Since it runs underground
throughout the Seireitei,

23
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,259
we can use it to go any
place we want safely,

24
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,859
without running
into any trouble.

25
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:38,492
-I don't get how
something so big

26
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,159
can be kept a secret
from everyone.

27
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:43,592
It wasn't even hidden very
well under that flagstone.

28
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:46,459
-Everybody knows that it
exists, but they don't use it.

29
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:48,726
No one will ever think of
looking for us down here.

30
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,092
-How do you know that?

31
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:52,492
-Only a small number of Squad
Four relief and aid workers

32
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:54,359
happen to know the
layout of these tunnels.

33
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:56,826
So besides me, there really
aren't very many people

34
00:02:56,859 --> 00:02:58,592
who know their way
around down here.

35
00:02:58,626 --> 00:02:59,992
-Oh, I get it.

36
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:02,592
You Squad Four guys have to know
your way around these tunnels,

37
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:04,726
because it's a supply
route for delivery relief

38
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,392
and aid to all the
different units.

39
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:11,326
-[laughs] Well, [sigh] it's
not so much that it's a supply

40
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,826
route, but rather that we're
the ones who have to keep these

41
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,392
tunnels cleaned up.

42
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:17,792
Actually, Squad Four
does seem to end up

43
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:20,326
with more than its share of
the menial chores. [laugh]

44
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:22,459
-You know, he's
actually got me feeling

45
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:25,059
a little bit sorry for
these Squad Four losers.

46
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:26,559
HANATARO: Oh, but
it isn't all bad.

47
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,826
There are some
advantages, too. [laughs]

48
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:31,126
-Hanataro.

49
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,092
-Yeah?

50
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:33,959
-Why are you doing this for us?

51
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:36,659
Why should our mission
be any of your concern?

52
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:38,926
After all, we're
still your enemies.

53
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,492
Instead of the white
tower, you could

54
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:41,992
be leading us into a trap.

55
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:43,626
-Ichigo, don't.

56
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,492
-Before we follow
you any further,

57
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,792
I want to know why
you're helping us.

58
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:51,926
-I know more about than you
think, from listening to Rukia.

59
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,292
She talked a lot
about Ichigo Kurosaki.

60
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:56,759
-Huh?

61
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,359
-Please save her.

62
00:03:58,392 --> 00:03:59,559
You've got to.

63
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:00,826
Please rescue Ms. Rukia.

64
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:06,359
YASOCHICKA: Here's the
latest situation report.

65
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:10,659
Ikkaku Madarame and Yumichika
Ayasegawa, both of Squad 11,

66
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:13,326
have apparently been withdrawn
from the front lines, effective

67
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:14,459
immediately.

68
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:16,759
It's reported that both
high-ranking officers

69
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,759
have sustained serious injuries.

70
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,292
A detailed damage assessment
for the entire squad

71
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:22,826
is currently under way.

72
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,726
But at the moment,
all we have to go on

73
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,992
are unconfirmed preliminary
reports of the day's action,

74
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:30,692
which would seem to
indicate that Squad 11 was

75
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:32,492
almost completely annihilated.

76
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:34,026
[gasping]

77
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:34,659
-What?

78
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:35,759
That's impossible.

79
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,459
-Not Squad 11.

80
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:38,859
MAN: How could a
handful of Ryoka

81
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:41,759
have done so much damage
in just a few hours?

82
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,726
-Ugh, that Squad's pathetic.

83
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,526
-Three of the Ryoka have
been positively identified.

84
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:47,959
And two of these
are known to have

85
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:50,492
taken a member of
Squad Four hostage.

86
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:53,392
Intelligence indicates that
this group is heading this way.

87
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,959
However, since a
short time ago, we've

88
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,092
been unable to detect
their spiritual pressure.

89
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:59,226
So their whereabouts
are now unknown.

90
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:00,726
-[grunt]

91
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:08,326
WOMAN: Obviously,
our intelligence

92
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:10,559
leaves something to be desired.

93
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:12,192
-You know, now that
I think about it,

94
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,626
it's been awhile since our
fourth seat has reported back

95
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:15,926
in.

96
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,426
We better send someone to
check on the West 20 region.

97
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,292
Who knows?

98
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:20,992
He may have been defeated, too.

99
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:22,392
-Are you serious?

100
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:26,226
Isn't the fourth seat in your
squad Jiroba, the wind scythe?

101
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,426
-That's right.

102
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,892
-First Jidanbo, now his brother?

103
00:05:29,926 --> 00:05:32,092
Can they both really
have been defeated?

104
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:34,059
-What the hell is going on here?

105
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:35,026
-[gasp]

106
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,759
-Ah, I've been
telling you for years

107
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:38,526
that Squad 11 is overrated.

108
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:41,526
-Well, what an unbelievable
mess this is turning into.

109
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,559
Right, Renji?

110
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,892
WOMAN: --that much is for sure.

111
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,659
RANGIKU: You're not helping
things by spreading rumors.

112
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,259
We don't even know
what happened here.

113
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:48,126
-What's that about?

114
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,159
MAN: Come on, come on.

115
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:50,092
Take it easy, Rangiku.

116
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,126
HANATARO: After
Rukia was captured

117
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,726
and before she was transferred
to the repentance cell--

118
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,859
or the white tower,
as you call it-- she

119
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:10,059
was held in a cell within
the Squad Six barracks.

120
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:12,926
At the time, I was assigned
to cleaning duty there.

121
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,326
So I saw her when
she was brought in.

122
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,359
To be honest, I was
scared of her at first.

123
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:21,026
I mean, she is
nobility after all.

124
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:22,126
But then, I--

125
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:23,692
-Then what?

126
00:06:23,726 --> 00:06:27,592
-On that first day,
when I spoke to her, I--

127
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:30,492
I'm so sorry to
disturb you, Ms. Rukia.

128
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:33,959
But I have to come in and
start my cleaning chores now.

129
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:36,459
-There's no need for you
to address me formally.

130
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:38,459
HANATARO: Um, but I, um--

131
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,992
-I'd rather you
just call me Rukia.

132
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,859
-Uh, but, um, all right, then.

133
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:47,959
Rukia, thank you.

134
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:49,426
-No, thank you.

135
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,759
-[laugh] You're welcome!

136
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,626
Her voice was so gentle.

137
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:58,759
She was so much kinder
than I expected her to be.

138
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,792
It was such a relief to me.

139
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:03,092
From that day on, my cleaning
chores at the barracks

140
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:05,526
stopped being something I
dread and became something

141
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,459
I actually look forward to.

142
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,259
And little by
little, Rukia started

143
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,959
telling me all kinds of things.

144
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:13,559
Can I ask another
question, Rukia?

145
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:16,692
What it really like over there,
in the world of the living?

146
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:18,092
What kind of food do they eat?

147
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:20,259
And tell me, what kind
of drinks do they have?

148
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:20,992
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:22,359
I know I talk too much.

150
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:25,226
You don't have to
answer me, Rukia.

151
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,226
[laugh] I'm sorry.

152
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,326
-They have a drink called juice
that comes in paper cartons.

153
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,159
-Oh!

154
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:33,959
What kind of a drink is that?

155
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:36,526
What does juice taste like?

156
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,759
-It's good, but it's tricky.

157
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,226
-Oh.

158
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,626
Mm.

159
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:46,159
-[sigh] It was hard to open.

160
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:48,559
There was a certain technique.

161
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:50,226
-That's hard to imagine.

162
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:51,892
How could there be
any kind of technique

163
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:53,659
you couldn't have
mastered, Rukia?

164
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:55,692
-Well, it was difficult.

165
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:59,226
You might not have
been able to master it.

166
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,959
There was this guy who
showed me how to do it.

167
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:05,126
HANATARO: Tell me some more.

168
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:07,192
What else did you see in
the world of the living?

169
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:09,692
Were there any strange things?

170
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:11,992
-Did you know a mod
soul can be inserted

171
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:15,026
into inanimate objects,
as well as the living?

172
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:18,026
-Do you mean those
illegal things?

173
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:19,092
RUKIA: Yes.

174
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:21,292
I saw a guy put one
into a stuffed doll?

175
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,126
-You mean into a child's toy?

176
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,926
Some animal-shaped thing
with cotton and stuffing?

177
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,392
But why would anybody do
something so irresponsible?

178
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,026
That just seems crazy.

179
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,792
-You're right.

180
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:36,226
There are some crazy
ones, both there and here.

181
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:44,592
-She told me a lot about
the world of the living.

182
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:46,559
But almost all the
stories Rukia told

183
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,226
me had one thing in common.

184
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,659
It seemed there
was always mention

185
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:51,692
of this one person
in particular.

186
00:08:51,726 --> 00:08:55,792
Until one day, an official
execution order came for her.

187
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,059
-It is as I said.

188
00:08:57,092 --> 00:09:00,259
Do I need to repeat myself?

189
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:04,759
25 days from now, she'll go to
the central execution grounds,

190
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,792
where she will suffer
the ultimate punishment.

191
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:10,626
That is the final decision
of the Soul Society.

192
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:17,426
-Rukia, is the person you
gave your Soul Reaper powers

193
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,992
to the same person you always
mention in your stories

194
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,726
about the world of the living?

195
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,559
-Yes.

196
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:24,792
His name was Ichigo Kurosaki.

197
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:28,192
I only spent two months there
in that world with Ichigo.

198
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:30,492
But somehow, even after
such a short time,

199
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:32,926
I felt I could trust
him with my very life.

200
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,926
Because of me-- because of
me, Ichigo's own destiny

201
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,759
was changed and became twisted.

202
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,692
And he was hurt terribly.

203
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:45,526
There's no forgiving
what I've done to him.

204
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,259
HANATARO: Rukia sounded so
sad as she said those words.

205
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:57,592
-Sounds to me like this Rukia's
one strange Soul Reaper,

206
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,492
don't you think?

207
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:00,592
-Yeah.

208
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:02,726
She's something else.

209
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,826
-Huh?

210
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:06,226
-And that's why we're
going to rescue her.

211
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,059
-Hey, stop.

212
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:08,592
Where are you taking off too?

213
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:09,859
Wait for me, Ichigo.

214
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:11,626
-Did I say something wrong?

215
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:15,526
GANJU: Ichigo, wait up!

216
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,459
RUKIA: I only spent
two months there

217
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,559
in that world with Ichigo.

218
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:20,959
But somehow, even after
such a short time,

219
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:23,259
I felt I could trust
him with my very life.

220
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:58,426
Because of me--- because of
me, Ichigo's own destiny was

221
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,559
changed and became twisted.

222
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,759
And he was hurt terribly.

223
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,959
There's not forgiving
what I've done to him.

224
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:06,359
ICHIGO: You're wrong, Rukia.

225
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:08,459
All of this was my fault.

226
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:22,626
I swear, there's no way
I'm gonna let you die.

227
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:23,126
Rukia!

228
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,192
-OK.

229
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,092
The coast is clear.

230
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:37,292
You two can come up now.

231
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:41,059
This is the closest
opening to the white tower.

232
00:11:41,092 --> 00:11:42,492
GANJU: [grunt] About time, too.

233
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:45,259
I've breathed enough
sewer air to gag a hippo.

234
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:46,592
-There it is, up there.

235
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:49,926
That's the white tower.

236
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,192
GANJU: This may be the
closest sewer opening,

237
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:55,326
but we've still got
a long way to go.

238
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,892
You know, I've got
a bad feeling this

239
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:58,992
isn't going to be an easy job.

240
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:00,426
-The mist is starting to clear.

241
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,992
Time to move.

242
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:20,226
-What, Ichigo?

243
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:22,626
What do you see?

244
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,359
-There's someone over
there by the stairs.

245
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:29,659
[gasping]

246
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,926
-It's been a while.

247
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,926
I wonder if you still
remember my face.

248
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,526
-Oh, you'll be gone and
forgotten soon enough.

249
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,992
But first, I've got a
whole mountain of payback

250
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:54,892
I'm going to extract
from you, Renji Abarai.

251
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:19,467
RENJI: You not only remembered
my face, but my name as well.

252
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,867
You're full of surprises.

253
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,767
-Thanks for the compliment.

254
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,033
-Whoa, who is this guy?

255
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,767
His spiritual pressure is on
a completely different level

256
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,533
from all those guys we
were tangling with before.

257
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:37,800
[whimpering]

258
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,800
-No, I can't believe it.

259
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,033
That's Renji Abarai.

260
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:46,433
He's the lieutenant
of Squad Six.

261
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,900
-A lieutenant?

262
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:51,600
-I must admit, I'm
surprised to see you.

263
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,767
I was certain you'd
be a dead man after I

264
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,300
saw Captain Kuchiki
attack you like that.

265
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:02,700
-Hey, wait!

266
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:04,167
Don't go rushing in, Ichigo!

267
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,567
-I don't know how you ever
managed to survive that.

268
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,367
But it would seem that
there is more to you

269
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
than I first believed.

270
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:22,300
But as I told you,
I'm going to kill

271
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,000
the one who stole
Rukia's powers.

272
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:27,733
So this is as far as you go.

273
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,033
Because as long as
you're still alive,

274
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,967
Rukia can never
regain her powers.

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,700
-What do you care about that,
when you've just sentenced her

276
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,000
to death!

277
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:38,533
[grunt] I'm going to
cut you to pieces!

278
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,933
-Just go ahead and try!

279
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:44,300
[grunting]

280
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,067
-They've just started.

281
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,233
He's going up against Renji.

282
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:58,167
The Ryoka defeated
the third seat.

283
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,400
Now we'll see if he can
defeat a lieutenant.

284
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,633
If so, then he may truly be
a worthy opponent for me.

285
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,200
-Kenny, I don't
understand something.

286
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:09,233
If you can't even sense
other spiritual pressuer,

287
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:12,467
then how could you tell they're
fighting from miles away?

288
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,800
-[laughs] I'm just
strange that way.

289
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,300
-Yeah, you got that right.

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,467
-Have you two found anything?

291
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,233
-No, not a trace of them.

292
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:25,567
-It's been hours since
these Ryoka crossed over.

293
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,933
Our casualties keep rising, and
we still can't track them down.

294
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:31,733
-Obviously, they've planned
this attack out thoroughly.

295
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:34,033
The way our response
has been handled so far,

296
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,967
I'm not even sure the
captains and lieutenants

297
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,167
even know what they're doing.

298
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,967
MAN: Come check this out!

299
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,833
They just found
Jiroba of Squad Seven.

300
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:42,800
And he's face down
and unconscious!

301
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:43,300
-What?

302
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,367
No way!

303
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,867
-Huh?

304
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,233
-(WHISPERING) They're gone.

305
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:52,667
-Indeed.

306
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,667
Obviously, Ichigo
and the others must

307
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,567
be doing quite a
number out there.

308
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,967
I've never seen
so much security.

309
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,467
And it just keeps
getting tighter.

310
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,133
-Mm, that's true.

311
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,767
But I think you and I can
handle whatever comes along.

312
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,100
After all, we've
done great so far.

313
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,100
What is it?

314
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,800
Are you sensing something?

315
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,933
URYU: I'm feeling strong
spiritual pressure

316
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,333
all of a sudden.

317
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:17,400
One of them is Ichigo, but the
other one-- it's Renji Abarai!

318
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:31,567
You sure ran into a tough
one this time, Ichigo.

319
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,533
[gasp]

320
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:33,867
[laughter]

321
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,933
-[gasp] [shout]

322
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,767
-Hey, are you getting
sick or something?

323
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,167
-You don't look so good.

324
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,767
Got a fever?

325
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,867
-Thank you.

326
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,933
But I was just fine
until you two appeared.

327
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,333
-That's good to hear.

328
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,100
I was just a little worried,
because you do space out

329
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:47,933
sometimes, you know.

330
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,367
Are you ready to go?

331
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,833
-Aw, that was no fun.

332
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,333
-Yeah, totally boring.

333
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,733
ORIHIME: Let's get going
while the coast is clear.

334
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,500
YASUTORA: Ichigo's spirit
energy is increasing.

335
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:10,200
I can feel it.

336
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,300
But his opponent's spiritual
pressure is so strong,

337
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,500
it's off the charts.

338
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:20,500
I better hurry.

339
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:23,967
[grunting]

340
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:42,667
-Now he's doomed!

341
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,600
No matter how strong
Ichigo might have become,

342
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:47,300
there's no way he could
hope to defeat a lieutenant.

343
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,433
-Hold on.

344
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,633
I wouldn't bet any money
against him just yet.

345
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,067
Take another look.

346
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,433
Something's happening.

347
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:59,900
[grunting]

348
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,067
-Oh, wow.

349
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,133
Ichigo just pinned
Lieutenant Abarai right up

350
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:15,367
against the wall.

351
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,633
Ganju, this Ichigo guy-- what
kind of a human being is he?

352
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,100
-Watching this
fight, I'm beginning

353
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,833
to wonder that myself.

354
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:27,633
-So, tell me the truth, Ichigo.

355
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,167
Do you actually
believe you're going

356
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,567
to be able to rescue Rukia.

357
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,700
-I do!

358
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,633
RENJI: Even if somehow
you were to defeat me,

359
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:37,433
there are still 11
more lieutenants left.

360
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:41,100
And then, of course, above
them are 13 full-fledged squad

361
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,467
captains.

362
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,133
You would have to utterly defeat
every single one us to even

363
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,633
have a chance of
reaching the tower.

364
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:51,800
You can't possibly believe
that you could pull that off.

365
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,733
-I don't care about the odds.

366
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:56,133
I don't care about how many
captains or lieutenants there

367
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:57,200
are.

368
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,133
I'll defeat them all,
every one of them.

369
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:02,600
I'll defeat anyone who makes the
mistake of getting in my way!

370
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:03,933
-Where does that come from?

371
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:08,367
You know, this confidence of
yours borders on the insane.

372
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,733
Such a quality would
almost be admirable

373
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:12,233
if it weren't so irrational.

374
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,767
So, your Zanpakuto
has changed, has it?

375
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,933
It's a mistake to think you're
stronger just because of that.

376
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:21,000
ICHIGO: Just like it's a
mistake to get to conceited!

377
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:23,000
[grunts]

378
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,367
-Now roar, Zabimaru!

379
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:37,900
[shouting]

380
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:51,867
-I can't stop it! [grunts]

381
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,467
-Ichigo!

382
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,967
-Oh!

383
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,900
Is he dead?

384
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:02,767
-You seem to think just because
you fought me once before, back

385
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,100
there in the world
of the living,

386
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:06,433
that now you know my true power!

387
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:09,333
Well, let me tell you
something, you amateur.

388
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:12,033
Whenever captain or
lieutenant-ranked Soul Reapers

389
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:15,433
are sent outside, severe
limits are placed on our powers

390
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:20,100
so that we won't adversely
affect the world of the living.

391
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:23,400
My strength right
now is five times

392
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,500
what it was that
first day we met.

393
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:29,533
So no matter how confident you
are, or how strong you become,

394
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,867
there's still no way
you can defeat me.

395
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,367
ICHIGO: I see.

396
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,367
-Huh?

397
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,733
-Hm?

398
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:42,567
ICHIGO: Then I suppose that
means that last attack of yours

399
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,033
was your best shot.

400
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:48,033
[grunt]

401
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,933
Because that didn't have
any effect on me at all.

402
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,167
So thank you.

403
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,667
If all I have to worry about
is 11 more like that one,

404
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,400
then I think I'm going
to be just fine, Renji.

405
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:12,900
Heh.

406
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,567
-[grunt] I'm going
to enjoy this.

407
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:49,923
[theme music]

408
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:50,732
-As I said before,
we Soul Reapers

409
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:53,232
have our powers severely limited
in the world of the living.

410
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:55,232
My strength right now
is five times greater

411
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:56,699
than it was when
I last fought you.

412
00:22:56,732 --> 00:22:58,165
ICHIGO: I've been
training, and I'm

413
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,432
10 times stronger than before!

414
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:01,132
RENJI: Then I'm 100
times stronger than that!

415
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:02,932
ICHIGO: I'm 1,000 times
stronger than that!

416
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,532
-Actually, I'm 10,000
times stronger.

417
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:05,899
ICHIGO: Than I'm
100,000 times stronger.

418
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:07,765
RENJI: Well, I'm a million
times stronger than that.

419
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,732
ICHIGO: Too bad.

420
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:09,999
I'm plus 10 million
times stronger!

421
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:11,899
RENJI: Than I'm a million
bajillion times stronger.

422
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,399
ICHIGO: I'm infinity
times stronger!

423
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:14,299
And that's that.
