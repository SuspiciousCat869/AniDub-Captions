NARRATOR: When Nelliel
returned to her true form,

4
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:53,381
she revealed a past alliance
with Nnoitra and her rank

5
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:54,914
as Espada Number Three.

6
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:58,181
Nnoitora detested Nelliel
and had often challenged her

7
00:01:58,214 --> 00:02:00,314
in order to prove his
power and superiority,

8
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:02,947

-You are still a beast.

00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:07,881
I cannot acknowledge
you as a true warrior,

11
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:11,481
so you are not worthy
to be my opponent.

12
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:13,481
I won't have the
life of someone who

NARRATOR: Aware of his
inferior ability, Nnoitra

00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:24,081
enlisted the help of
Szayelaporro Granz.

16
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:26,214
Together they set
a trap for Nelliel.

17
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,614
After defeating her, he
arranged for her banishment

from Las Noches.

19

Wounded from her fight,
Nelliel's Hollows mask cracked

20
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,981
and her spirit energy
escaped, shrinking her soul

21
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:39,747

the form of a child.

left to fight with.

00:13:58,628 --> 00:13:59,828
-What happened?

216
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:03,428
Why didn't it work on you?

217
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:08,262
--[laughs] Let me tell you
why that didn't work on me.

218
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:17,228
[laughs]

219
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:20,095
There's no question that
the two forces you combined

220
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:24,462
contain an immense amount
of destructive power.

221
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:28,295
However, if they don't
blend completely and totally

222
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:31,395
transform, they can
easily be split back

223
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:34,328
into their separate components.

224
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:37,295
So I applied a tiny amount
of power at the right point

225
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:39,628
to neutralize your attack.

226
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:45,062
-But-- h-how is that possible?

227
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:46,928
-How could you respond so fast?

228
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:49,462
We mounted a surprise attack!

229
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:51,962
-How this, why that.

230
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:53,995
You certainly ask
a lot of questions,

231
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:56,828
but since you're so
curious, I'll tell you.

232
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,728
The reason you failed
is quite simple.

233
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:02,428
You gave me too much
time to prepare.

234
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:03,628
-Huh?

235
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:05,662
-Did you think I wouldn't
know who you were, just

236
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:08,495
because you changed
your masks and outfits?

237
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:12,562
I realized it right away from
the moment I saw you two.

238
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:16,362
It was obvious to me that you
were both Nelliel's Fracciones.

-Cero Sincretico, I
believe you called it.

247
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:36,295
I have to admit that was a
very powerful and effective

248
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:37,328
technique.

249
00:15:37,362 --> 00:15:41,295

-From my perspective,
the reason you

254
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:53,828
lost this fight was
that you didn't employ

255
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:56,128
this technique, which
was your most powerful,

256
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:57,195
from the very beginning.

257
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:05,695
Hopefully, we now
understand each other.

However, I think this fun

You underestimated your enemy.

271
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:27,962
You were convinced you had won.

272
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:30,862
You thought they were
dead, and that arrogance

273
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:31,962
cost you your life.

274
00:17:31,995 --> 00:17:34,528
The only way to
assure your victory

275
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:38,195
would have been cut
off your enemy's head.
