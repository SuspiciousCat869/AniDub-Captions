00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:51,822
VOICEOVER: With their fierce
battle against the Bounts over,

3
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:53,322
Ichigo and his
friends have returned

4
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:56,055
to the world of the living
and their peaceful lives.

5
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:59,255
However, that peace is
shattered by a new transfer

6
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:01,122
student hiding a secret.

7
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,888
The mystery student's
name is Shinji Hirako,

8
00:02:03,922 --> 00:02:07,988
who tells Ichigo he is really
a masked soldier, or a Visored.

9
00:02:08,022 --> 00:02:11,422
Visoreds are Soul Reapers who
have awakened their Hollow

10
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:12,755
powers.

11
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:15,822
Hirako urges Ichigo to join
the Masked Army, telling him

12
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:17,455
he's really one of
them and doesn't

13
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:19,822
belong on the side
of the Soul Reapers.

14
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:22,822
Meanwhile, a Grand Fisher,
seeking revenge on Ichigo,

15
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:24,788
chases down Kon,
who happens to be

16
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:28,722
in the wrong place at the wrong
time, inside of Ichigo's body.

17
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:31,755
The Grand Fisher is able
to brush off Ririn's attack

18
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:33,888
as he closes in on Kon.

19
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:36,422
But just when it looks
like the end for Kon,

20
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,022
the Grand Fisher's
vicious attack

21
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:43,555
is suddenly cut short by
an unexpected visitor.

22
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:45,822
URAHARA: Have you avenged her?

23
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,522
Has justice been meted out?

24
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:49,222
-Look who showed.

25
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:51,022
VOICEOVER: Isshin
and Urahara realize

26
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:53,688
they have new
enemies, the Arrancars

27
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:57,155
and the mysterious
group the Visoreds.

28
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:59,788
Meanwhile, Uryu learns
that his father still

29
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:02,722
has his Quincy powers.

30
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:04,922
-Once the symptoms
appear, Visoreds

31
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:07,488
can never become normal again.

32
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,655
You're already on
our side, Ichigo.

33
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:16,288
VOICEOVER: And so, with
new events set in motion,

34
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,955
the situation takes a turn.

35
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:25,888
-Welcome home, Ichigo!

36
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:26,388
Ha!

37
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:30,288
Whoa.

38
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:32,588
Wha-- What happened there?

39
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:33,888
-For goodness' sakes, dad.

40
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,922
What did you do to him?

41
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:38,755
Are you OK, Ichigo?

42
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:40,188
-Hey, what's wrong with you?

43
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:41,688
Are you sick or something?

44
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,722
Are we running a bit slow today?

45
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:47,655
Oh, I get it, you probably
failed a test or something.

46
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:50,122
Well, don't worry
about it, Ichigo.

47
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:52,655
Isshin Kurosaki is
not the kind of man

48
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:55,222
who scolds his children
over petty test scores.

49
00:03:55,255 --> 00:03:56,722
-Huh?

50
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:58,388
-So what if your
grades are failing?

51
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:00,288
Who cares about stupid grades?

52
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:02,555
Modern education's all
a pile of crap anyway!

53
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:05,288
-I wouldn't call this an
example of good parenting.

54
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:06,822
-A high school boy
should be focusing

55
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:09,988
on things he can talk to his
parents about, like romance.

56
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:12,088
Now that's something a
parent could be proud of.

57
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:13,088
-Romance?

58
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:14,688
He shouldn't talk
to you about that.

59
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,055
-Hm?

60
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,555
No, not if he's doing it right.

61
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:19,222
And believe me, I'd know.

62
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:21,755
-I believe you're a sick man.

63
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:26,522
-Uh, I'll be in my
room until dinnertime.

64
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:27,488
-Huh?

65
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:28,988
Hey, wait.

66
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:30,455
Ichigo.

67
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:31,722
Ichigo!

68
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:33,122
-Maybe he wouldn't
be so depressed

69
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:35,088
if you apologized
once in awhile, dad.

70
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:35,555
-Hmph.

71
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:41,688
-Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

72
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:42,922
If it isn't Ichigo?

73
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:44,188
You're home kinda early.

74
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:46,488
Not that I was waiting
around for you or anything,

75
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:47,188
but welcome back.

76
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:51,122
Hello?

77
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:52,355
Earth to Ichigo?

78
00:04:52,388 --> 00:04:53,455
Oh, nice.

79
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:55,488
Here I am, welcoming
you home with open arms,

80
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:57,022
and you stand there
pale as a ghost,

81
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:59,722
giving me the silent treatment
like some dummy in a wax

82
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:01,188
museum.

83
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:02,155
Huh?

84
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:03,922
Say something
already, would you?

85
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:04,988
I can't take this silence.

86
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:06,288
Hey, I know.

87
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:07,955
Tell me about your old man.

88
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:09,588
Did you notice him
anything differently

89
00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:10,488
from his usual self?

90
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:10,988
-Hi-yah!

91
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:17,788
Are you forgetting
something, Kon?

92
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:18,822
-Listen up, everyone.

93
00:05:18,855 --> 00:05:21,022
It's time for us to go home.

94
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:21,588
-All right.

95
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,388
We're leaving.

96
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:25,022
-I don't want
anyone saying a word

97
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:28,322
about Isshin's true
identity to Ichigo.

98
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:30,122
-So quit talking
about his father,

99
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:32,055
OK, you stupid stuffed animal?

100
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:33,522
If Kisuke finds
out, he'll turn you

101
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:34,855
into a pile of felt and cotton.

102
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:38,388
It's a good thing I
stopped you in time.

103
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,522
-Your father was so normal
last time I saw him.

104
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:43,855
-Just keep your mouth shut!

105
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:44,355
-Huh?

106
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:49,988
-Ichigo?

107
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:52,788
Is something wrong?

108
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:54,355
-No.

109
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,155
It's nothing.

110
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:56,655
-Huh?

111
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:01,422
-Hey.

112
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:04,988
Could you guys leave me alone?

113
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:07,322
-I'm getting sick and tired
of this gloomy gus attitude!

114
00:06:07,355 --> 00:06:09,622
-Hey, what's with
you all of a sudden?

115
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:12,455
-You could have walked in this
room with a smile on your face,

116
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:15,155
but no, you had to be
all sad and depressed.

117
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,288
Well, we're not going to
stand for this any longer.

118
00:06:17,322 --> 00:06:18,922
Let's go, Ririn.

119
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:19,788
-I'm staying.

120
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:20,988
-Oh, no you're not.

121
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:21,522
-Whoa!

122
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:23,155
What's with you?

123
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:26,622
KON: If he wants to brood,
let him brood by himself!

124
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:30,155
-Hey, Kon, what's the big idea?

125
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:32,355
-You have to be considerate
when you're a freeloader.

126
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:37,188
-Man, he sure thinks he's cool.

127
00:06:43,422 --> 00:06:45,288
ICHIGO: I can hear him.

128
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,622
Ever since my
fight with Byakuya,

129
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:51,455
the mask kept coming back,
no matter how many times

130
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:52,288
I threw it away.

131
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:57,622
That's when it started.

132
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:00,488
Ever since then, I've
been able to hear him.

133
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:03,022
It's inside my head, calling me.

134
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,255
I don't need Shinji to tell me.

135
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:07,622
If this keeps up--

136
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:10,655
VOICE: If this keeps up, what?

137
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:12,622
-You!

138
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:16,022
VOICE: Are you to
scare yourself, Ichigo?

139
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:18,288
You're so easy to figure out.

140
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:22,355
When I'm done with you,
you'll be even more scared.

141
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,755
I'm going to get closer
and closer to you,

142
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:26,422
and not just day by day.

143
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:27,522
Oh, no.

144
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:29,822
It's going to happen
much faster than that.

145
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:31,288
Ha ha ha!

146
00:07:31,322 --> 00:07:32,422
See?

147
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:35,022
I'm even closer to you
than I was a moment ago.

148
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,555
And I'm going to keep getting
closer and closer to you

149
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:40,622
until I swallow you up.

150
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:45,522
And then you'll disappear.

151
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:49,788
Things aren't turning out
well for you at all, are they?

152
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:52,155
Ha ha ha ha ha!

153
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:55,422
See ya around!.

154
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:57,355
-What should I do?

155
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:59,055
This can't go on like this.

156
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:06,188
[knocking]

157
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:07,122
KARIN: It's me.

158
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:09,155
Karin.

159
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:09,655
-Come in.

160
00:08:15,922 --> 00:08:18,622
-I want to know what's
going on with you.

161
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:22,422
Why are you acting
like this, Ichigo?

162
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:24,455
-What do you mean?

163
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:26,355
There's nothing
going on with me.

164
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,955
-I know.

165
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,222
I know all about your secret.

166
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:34,922
I know that you're-- I
know you're a Soul Reaper.

167
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:46,088
-Same old, same old.

168
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:49,855
[yawn] Man, I'm
bored out of my mind.

169
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:54,888
-Standing guard is pure torture
if nothing actually happens.

170
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:56,255
-Come on, Rin.

171
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:58,488
How many times have I told you
not to eat all the cookies?

172
00:08:58,522 --> 00:08:59,722
Those are for everyone.

173
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:02,522
Now go make us some tea,
you worthless little twerp.

174
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:03,288
-I'm sorry.

175
00:09:03,322 --> 00:09:04,988
I was hungry.

176
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:09,622
[beeping] I have a reading!

177
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:12,055
Position 3,600 to 4,000.

178
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:14,355
Eastern section of Karakura.

179
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,955
Requesting assistance
and verification.

180
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:23,322
-Hey.

181
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,555
Everything OK?

182
00:09:24,588 --> 00:09:26,955
-Your t couldn't be
more perfect, Akon.

183
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:27,855
-Huh?

184
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:29,055
-Take a look.

185
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:29,888
They're here.

186
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:41,822
WOMAN: That was such a--

187
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,022
-What was that?

188
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:43,822
-Something fell.

189
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:45,488
-I hope no one's hurt.

190
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,822
WOMAN: Something's
in the middle.

191
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:53,755
Here, cover your mouth.

192
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:55,655
-I'm a Soul Reaper.

193
00:09:59,188 --> 00:10:03,788
That's-- that's ridiculous.

194
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:05,122
Soul Reaper?

195
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:07,388
I think you finally
lost it, Karin.

196
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:10,788
-Don't play dumb with me.

197
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:12,722
I've been able to see them.

198
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:14,055
For quite a while now.

199
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:27,855
At first, I didn't
understand what was going on.

200
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:28,688
But Don Kanonji--

201
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:38,688
-All of your spiritual pressure.

202
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:48,622
-Do you think that was an
earthquake just now, Dad?

203
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:53,088
-Ichigo.

204
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:57,522
-Karin.

205
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,155
Sorry.

206
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:04,955
I don't have time for this now.

207
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:06,588
-Where are you going, Ichigo?

208
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:14,555
-Sorry.

209
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,555
-Reporting a message
from Squad 12, sir.

210
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:34,822
Arrancars have been detected
in the eastern section

211
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,288
of Karakura.

212
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,688
There are two of them.

213
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:40,255
Based on their spiritual
pressure, density,

214
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:43,222
and stability, we believe
that they are fully developed.

215
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:53,588
-Hey, Tatsuki, good work.

216
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:54,255
That's enough.

217
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:55,722
Let's call it a day.

218
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:57,522
-I feel like working
out some more.

219
00:11:57,555 --> 00:11:59,722
I think I'll go
for a little run.

220
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:01,055
-Of course you will.

221
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,388
Don't you ever rest?

222
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,055
-Not really.

223
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:03,988
I'll see you tomorrow.

224
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,455
-Hey, Karin.

225
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:14,455
Did you hear that
big boom just now?

226
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:15,955
Huh?

227
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:16,555
What's wrong?

228
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:18,755
Are you all right?

229
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:19,388
-Yeah, sure.

230
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:19,922
It's nothing.

231
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:20,555
I'm fine.

232
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:22,422
-Are you sure?

233
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:22,922
-Yeah.

234
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:24,655
Absolutely.

235
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:27,555
Ichigo's taking a map, so don't
wake him until dinner's ready.

236
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:30,388
-OK.

237
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:30,988
See you later.

238
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:38,422
[groan]

239
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:40,888
-I came here a few times
while I was masked.

240
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:43,388
I see the world of the
living hasn't changed at all.

241
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:45,122
Still boring as ever.

242
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:47,955
The spiritual pressure's so
thin I can hardly breathe.

243
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:49,955
-Stop complaining, Yammy.

244
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:52,822
I told you I could
manage this on my own.

245
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,655
You're the one who
insisted on coming.

246
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,055
-Yeah, yeah.

247
00:12:57,088 --> 00:12:57,855
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:57,888 --> 00:12:58,688
I'll give it a rest.

249
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:02,855
WOMAN: I don't know.

250
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:03,822
-Huh?

251
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,288
Hm.

252
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:06,522
-Is it a meteorite?

253
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:07,622
-I don't see any anything.

254
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:10,122
-Well, something must
have made this big hole.

255
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,188
Do you think it's
OK to get close?

256
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:13,122
-I don't know.

257
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:14,188
You'd better not.

258
00:13:14,222 --> 00:13:16,555
-I'm getting a creepy
feeling about this.

259
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,322
-Don't worry.

260
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:18,355
What could happen to us?

261
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:19,188
-Should we someone?

262
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:21,022
-What's with you people?

263
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:23,755
you'd better stop staring at
me, or I'll suck out your souls.

264
00:13:27,122 --> 00:13:30,588
[screaming]

265
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:45,488
-Chad, wait!

266
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:47,088
-It's no use, Orihime.

267
00:13:47,122 --> 00:13:47,988
That guy's dead.

268
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:53,988
You can see it as
well, can't you?

269
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:56,688
Something's sucking all
the souls out of the people

270
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:57,922
in this area.

271
00:13:57,955 --> 00:14:00,355
-No way.

272
00:14:00,388 --> 00:14:01,822
Maybe they're also--

273
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:02,488
-No.

274
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:03,688
They aren't Bounts.

275
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:05,888
They're gone now.

276
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:08,055
Besides, their method is
different from the Bounts.

277
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:09,688
And so is the scale
of the attack.

278
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:11,588
-Then who could it be?

279
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:13,722
And why are they doing it?

280
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:14,788
CHAD: Let's hurry.

281
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:16,888
ORIHIME: Right.

282
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,488
CHAD: You need to
promise me, Orihime.

283
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:20,455
ORIHIME: What is it?

284
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:22,155
CHAD: When we get
to wherever it is

285
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:25,855
we're going, if we find
anyone who's still alive,

286
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:28,788
I want you to hang back
and take care of them.

287
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:31,288
-But Chad, you'll
be on your own.

288
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:33,288
-I know you want to
help with the fight,

289
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:37,022
but I can't heal the wounded.

290
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,355
Only you can save the survivors.

291
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:40,755
Please, Orihime.

292
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:42,222
I'm counting on you.

293
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:02,256
-Blech.

294
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:03,323
Awful taste.

295
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,023
-What did you expect, Yammy?

296
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:08,857
Weak souls like those
will always taste nasty.

297
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,823
-Well, I only did it because
they kept staring at us.

298
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,223
Like we were part
of some freak show.

299
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:16,790
-Those people weren't
looking at you.

300
00:15:16,823 --> 00:15:19,390
In fact, they couldn't
see us at all.

301
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:22,090
-I know, but they were
still pissing me off.

302
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:24,057
So, how many in the
world of the living

303
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,423
are we supposed to kill, anyway?

304
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:27,690
-Only one.

305
00:15:27,723 --> 00:15:30,223
There is no need to
kill anybody else.

306
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:32,090
-This place is
overflowing with humans,

307
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,557
and you only want to kill one?

308
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,890
-That's correct.

309
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:37,757
I've been told there are
only three people here who

310
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,857
have enough spiritual pressure
to put up a fight against us.

311
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,457
It should be easy to find them.

312
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,023
And the rest are just trash.

313
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:44,990
[whimpering]

314
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:47,057
-Huh?

315
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,323
Surprising.

316
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:50,157
-Hm?

317
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,157
-There seems to be a survivor.

318
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,523
-What just happened to me?

319
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:57,857
I don't get it.

320
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,923
And who or what are those guys?

321
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,890
What's going on?

322
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:09,390
I can't look away.

323
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:15,790
-I'm guessing that if my Gonzui
didn't suck out your soul,

324
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:18,223
then you must have some
pretty good spiritual pressure

325
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,323
yourself.

326
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:20,590
Come on, admit it.

327
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:23,390
You're hiding it somewhere
deep inside of you, right?

328
00:16:23,423 --> 00:16:26,123
Hey, Ulquiorra, is she one?

329
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:27,290
-Look carefully.

330
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:29,590
Her soul's about
to be crushed just

331
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:32,690
from you standing close
to her, you idiot.

332
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:35,523
She's trash.

333
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:37,057
-So you're telling
me she just got

334
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,757
lucky she survived my Gonzui?

335
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,023
Well, her luck's run out.

336
00:16:42,057 --> 00:16:42,523
Yah!

337
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:47,957
Huh?

338
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:56,823
What the-- who the
hell are you guys?

339
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:58,157
-(THINKING) Wow.

340
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,723
WIth just a simple kick, I
could feel his enormous power.

341
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:04,057
Orihime would never
be able to handle him.

342
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,457
Orihime.

343
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,590
Listen to me carefully.

344
00:17:10,623 --> 00:17:13,823
Take Tatsuki and get
out of here, now.

345
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:15,490
-Just please be careful, Chad.

346
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:18,890
-Ulquiorra.

347
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:20,723
Is this guy one of them?

348
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:21,990
-Oh, Yammy.

349
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:24,757
You really need to work on
your investigative powers,

350
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,157
so that you can detect
these things on your own.

351
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,223
You should be able to tell which
one glance, this individual

352
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:33,090
is trash.

353
00:17:33,123 --> 00:17:33,957
-So I see.

354
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:58,023
-Chad, get up!

355
00:17:58,057 --> 00:17:58,923
Chad!

356
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:00,190
Speak to me!

357
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:00,723
Chad!

358
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:03,457
-Ulquiorra.

359
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,223
ORIHIME: Hang on.

360
00:18:05,257 --> 00:18:05,790
OK.

361
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:07,390
-How about her?

362
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:09,057
Is she trash?

363
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,990
-Yes.

364
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,957
She's trash.

365
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,557
-I gotcha.

366
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,957
-Chad, come on.

367
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,457
Wake up!

368
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:21,223
(THINKING) I'm positive
that Chad knew.

369
00:18:21,257 --> 00:18:25,690
He knew these guys were so
strong that neither of us

370
00:18:25,723 --> 00:18:28,690
could stand up against
them by ourselves.

371
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:32,290
He knew that, and that's why
he wanted me to stay away.

372
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:33,790
So that he could protect us.

373
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:37,757
He saved Tatsuki and me
by fighting them alone.

374
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,223
-Santen Kesshun.

375
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:49,690
-Huh?

376
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,723
This girl.

377
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:02,557
What is she?

378
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:05,823
Soten Kisshun.

379
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,190
-How are you able
to heal that guy?

380
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,557
In fact, how can he
even still be alive?

381
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,523
Pretty stubborn, if you ask me.

382
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:24,490
-She has healing powers.

383
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:25,057
No.

384
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,457
That's not it.

385
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,890
This is not a healing technique.

386
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:33,057
She's either reversing
time, or space.

387
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,123
Whatever it is, it's
not the power to heal.

388
00:19:37,157 --> 00:19:41,590
But it is something I
have never seen before.

389
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:43,690
You're a strange human.

390
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:44,590
Aren't you?

391
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:50,890
-(THINKING) Somehow.

392
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,257
Somehow I have to hang on.

393
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,123
At least until Ichigo gets here.

394
00:19:58,157 --> 00:19:58,957
No.

395
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,357
Why do I always rely on Ichigo?

396
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,190
I've been to the Soul
Society twice now,

397
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,757
and both times I've
come home without being

398
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,023
able to do anything.

399
00:20:13,023 --> 00:20:15,690
I don't want to be a
burden to Ichigo anymore.

400
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:22,390
He's got enough
troubles of his own.

401
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:25,823
I have to stand up these guys
without depending on Ichigo.

402
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,190
It's about time I
helped him out for once.

403
00:20:29,223 --> 00:20:38,190
I know I can't do much, but
I can at least do th Tsubaki!

404
00:20:38,223 --> 00:20:39,490

406

Tatsuki, Chad, Uryu, Ichigo.

407
00:20:47,757 --> 00:20:49,590
Everyone.

408
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,057
I will protect all of you!

409
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,023
I reject!

410
00:21:03,857 --> 00:21:04,323
Huh?

411
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:11,190
What was that thing?

412
00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:12,823
A fly?

413
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:14,757
-Tsubaki!

414
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,690
Oh, no!

415
00:21:18,623 --> 00:21:21,157
What do you want to do
with her, Ulquiorra?

416
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,223
Maybe we should take
her back to Aizen

417
00:21:23,257 --> 00:21:27,157
to show him this weird
healing power she possesses.

418
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,657
-Wait.

419
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,023
Aizen?

420
00:21:29,057 --> 00:21:30,323
-No, that won't be necessary.

421
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,490
Just kill her, Yammy.

422
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:35,957
-Gotcha.

423
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,790
