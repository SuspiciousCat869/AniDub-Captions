00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:51,028
NARRATOR: Ichigo and the
Soul Society's advance troops

3
00:01:51,062 --> 00:01:53,328
were ambushed by the Arrancars.

4
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:55,628
During the battle,
Ichigo was injured

5
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:58,195
and Orihime was coerced
into going to Hueco Mundo.

6
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:04,428
The Soul Society alerts
Ichigo and the others

7
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:08,728
of Orihime's disappearance,
and Ichigo vows to save her.

8
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,528
But he is forbidden
from taking action

9
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:11,728
by Head Captain Yamamoto.

10
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:17,362
The head captain determined
that the Arrancars had

11
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:21,162
had sufficient time to prepare
and that a battle was imminent.

12
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:25,095
He ordered Captain Hitsugaya,
Rukia, and the advance troops

13
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,228
to return to the Soul
Society immediately.

14
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:33,195
Left alone in the
world of the living,

15
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:36,762
Ichigo decided to ignore Head
Captain Yamamoto's orders

16
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:41,162
and made plans to go to
Hueco Mundo on his own.

17
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,695
Not knowing how to
break into Hueco Mundo,

18
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:47,228
Ichigo went to Urahara's shop to
get the information he needed.

19
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:50,362
When he arrived, he found that
Uryu and Chad had been waiting

20
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:51,862
there for him, and
were determined

21
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:53,762
to travel to Hueco
Mundo as well.

22
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:02,495
-Believe in us.

23
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:13,462
-It looks like
everybody's ready.

24
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:13,962
Finally.

25
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:20,028
-Let's go.

26
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:30,062
ORIHIME: I can't help but
wonder if it was really

27
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:32,762
a good idea for me to come here.

28
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,728
I wonder if the battle got worse
because I healed those people.

29
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,862
No.

30
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,995
But right now, I
have to make them

31
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:48,628
think that I'm of use
to them, no matter what.

32
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,395
At least-- At least
until everyone

33
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:52,895
is prepared for battle.

34
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:11,328
-You know.

35
00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:13,028
Somehow, I never expected
the buildings here

36
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:15,795
to look as solid as this.

37
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:17,195
It's weird, huh.

38
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,695
I mean, when you consider all
the crazy things that come out

39
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,762
of this place, I figured
it would look like a dump.

40
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,628
-Ichigo, keep your voice down.

41
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:26,195
If they don't already
know we're here,

42
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:29,128
we don't wanna go around
advertising the fact.

43
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:31,228
-Is this place
really Hueco Mundo?

44
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:34,328
-Did you hear what I just said?

45
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:35,528
-I heard you.

46
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:36,562
Think I'm deaf?

47
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:38,028
You were making more
noise than I was.

48
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:40,128
-Oh, yeah, sorry.

49
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:41,528
-Hey.

50
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:44,628
I figure this'll go a lot faster
if we let them know we're here.

51
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:46,662
We just grab the first
guy who shows up,

52
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:49,128
then we make him tell
us where Orihime is.

53
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:50,062
Hey!

54
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,495
Is anyone here?

55
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:52,462
Come on out!

56
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:53,662
-Ichigo.

57
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:55,228
-Well, are you just
gonna stand there,

58
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,028
or are you gonna
help me find someone?

59
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:57,895
Hello?

60
00:04:57,928 --> 00:04:58,962
-He's right.

61
00:04:58,995 --> 00:04:59,728
-No.

62
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:00,995
Not you too.

63
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:02,762
Hey wait for me!

64
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:05,262
[alarm sounding]

65
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:16,595
-All right.

66
00:05:16,628 --> 00:05:18,728
Looks like the coast is clear.

67
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:19,495
-Hey!

68
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,562
Where is everyone?

69
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:21,628
-Ichigo.

70
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:22,728
-What's wrong?

71
00:05:22,762 --> 00:05:24,928
You already said
the coast was clear,

72
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:26,528
so there's nothing
to worry about.

73
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:27,995
-Of course you need to worry.

74
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:32,128
You can't just walk in here
without any sense of caution.

75
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:33,195
Just shut up, will you?

76
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:35,395
-Uryu, calm down.

77
00:05:35,428 --> 00:05:38,728
-I'm the calmest one here!

78
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:39,228
-Huh?

79
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:55,062
-We better get out of here.

80
00:05:59,162 --> 00:06:00,195
-Look what you've done.

81
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:02,062
Is that what you
call being careful?

82
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,828
-If you'd kept your mouth shut,
we wouldn't be in this mess!

83
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:05,762
-Hey!

84
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:08,795
Don't try to blame
this one on me.

85
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:11,362
-Now may not be the best
time to settle this argument.

86
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:14,828
-Tell him that!

87
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:15,695
URYU: A hallway.

88
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:17,528
Should we take it?

89
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:19,095
-Anything's gotta
be better than this.

90
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:25,062
-Chad!

91
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:30,562
-Uryu.

92
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:31,962
-Hang on!

93
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:43,995
-Thanks guys.

94
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,228
That was close.

95
00:06:45,262 --> 00:06:47,062
-What idiots.

96
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:49,062
Who uses old fashioned
traps like that?

97
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:50,662
-I wouldn't talk if
I were you, 'cause

98
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:52,828
you're the one who fell for
that old fashioned trap.

99
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:56,262
-Bu-- I-- sorry, I guess I
just wasn't paying attention.

100
00:06:56,295 --> 00:07:00,462
-Well, as long as we
know whose fault it was.

101
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:01,728
-I think we should keep moving.

102
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:08,295
-Well, anyway, at least
this path looks safe enough.

103
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,595
-Hm.

104
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:11,862
-Well, that's fine, but
where does it lead to?

105
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:13,128
Where the hell are we going?

106
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:15,195
-How am I supposed to know?

107
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:16,928
-We've been walking
quite a while.

108
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:19,995
We'll have to run into
something sooner or later.

109
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:21,528
-I'm not so sure about that.

110
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:24,128
We haven't come across
a single sign of life.

111
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:25,795
Knowing our luck,
this'll end up being

112
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:28,195
a one way road to nowhere.

113
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:29,328
-Just keep your guard up.

114
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:30,528
You never know.

115
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:32,228
-Don't worry about me.

116
00:07:32,262 --> 00:07:33,962
I'm ready for anything.

117
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,828
Uh oh.

118
00:07:36,862 --> 00:07:38,262
Bummer.

119
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:39,662
-It looks like
it's the same kind

120
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:42,962
of trigger as the last one.

121
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,762
[rumbling]

122
00:07:45,795 --> 00:07:46,695
-Wait a minute.

123
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:47,895
That sound.

124
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,262
What the hell is it?

125
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:52,528
-I hope it's not
what I think it is.

126
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:53,962
We're screwed.

127
00:07:53,995 --> 00:07:55,095
-Amazing.

128
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:56,728
All the traps they've
set are so simplistic.

129
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:58,995
-I'm glad you find
them so impressive.

130
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,628
I never said I was impressed.

131
00:08:01,662 --> 00:08:03,128
-Where are you going?

132
00:08:03,162 --> 00:08:04,495
Just leave this to me.

133
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:11,862
-Chad!

134
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:35,295
Nice work, Chad.

135
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:36,662
-Nice, huh?

136
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:38,328
I told you to keep your guard
up, but you wouldn't listen!

137
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:40,628
-Yeah, yeah, whatever.

138
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:41,728
It was all my fault.

139
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:42,595
Are you happy?

140
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:43,162
-Hey.

141
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:44,228
Don't ignore me.

142
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:46,095
I'm not just gonna
let it go this time.

143
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:02,662
-Who are you?

144
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:05,695
-Oh, you finally showed up.

145
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:10,562
Wait!

146
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:12,395
What are we running away for?

147
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:15,295
We've been trying to flush
one out and we finally did.

148
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:17,428
We need to get back there
and beat some answers out

149
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:18,128
of that guy.

150
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:19,462
-Are you insane?

151
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:21,362
What do we do if we're fighting
in a small space like that

152
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,328
and the walls
collapse around us?

153
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,362
-Who cares if the
walls collapse.

154
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:27,028
It's not gonna make
any damn difference.

155
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:29,528
-You must work really
hard to be this dumb.

156
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:32,895
Didn't you notice anything
while we were walking around?

157
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:37,295
We haven't passed a single
window this entire time.

158
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,128
So, think.

159
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,262
Why aren't there any windows?

160
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:43,428
Because this corridor is
underground, you dummy.

161
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:45,195
-Who cares if we're underground.

162
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:47,362
-Fighting in this space
is not a good idea.

163
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:50,428
We've gotta find an area
with more open space.

164
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:52,062
-Uryu, look.

165
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:01,495
It's some kind of hall.

166
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:02,695
-All right.

167
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,762
You don't have any problems
with this place, do you?

168
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:05,495
-Hm?

169
00:10:05,528 --> 00:10:07,462
A staircase.

170
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:10,195
If we're lucky, it will
connect to the outside.

171
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:11,462
I'll go check.

172
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:11,962
-Hey!

173
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:19,795
-Where do you think
you're going, intruder?

174
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,062
URYU (VOICEOVER): Another one.

175
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:23,195
I guess I shouldn't be
surprised that we stirred up

176
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:25,162
more than one in
a place this big.

177
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:33,495
It's another trap.

178
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:35,362
Looks like they've
got us sandwiched.

179
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:36,028
-Hey.

180
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:37,462
Just shut up, will you?

181
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:46,462
URYU: Are these
things Arrancars too?

182
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:48,762
-They sure look a lot more
like Hollows than the ones

183
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:51,262
we were dealing with back
in the world of the living.

184
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:53,595
Eh, it doesn't matter
to me what they are.

185
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:55,495
You guys just stand
back and watch.

186
00:10:55,528 --> 00:11:04,262
I'll handle these two--
What the hell are you doing?

187
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:08,328
-You're the one who needs to
just stand back and watch.

188
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:10,495
-This time--

189
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:12,428
-We're going to handle it.

190
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:13,328
-What's with you guys?

191
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:14,528
URYU: Take it easy.

192
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:16,295
You're gonna want to save
your strength for when

193
00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:18,128
we find Orihime.

194
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:19,195
Besides.

195
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:20,828
I've spent some
time with Kisuke,

196
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:23,562
and he's been informing
me about the Arrancars.

197
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:25,828
Apparently, the group that
Grimmjow brought with him

198
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:29,862
was a mixture of Gillians
and Adjuchas class Arrancars.

199
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:32,428
When a Menos Grande
becomes an Arrancar,

200
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:34,495
it doesn't always take
on a humanoid form.

201
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,995
But only the most powerful
class, the Vasto Lordes,

202
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:41,228
take on a human shape
100% of the time.

203
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:42,728
And as for the
other two classes,

204
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:44,995
even if they do become
Arrancars, many of them

205
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:48,362
won't take on a humanoid form.

206
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:52,228
Also, the lower their
intelligence, the more likely

207
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:53,728
they'll resemble
an ordinary Hollow.

208
00:11:56,762 --> 00:11:57,228
-Uryu!

209
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:05,162
-That is unforgivable.

210
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:07,328
Demoura is one thing,
but you're implying

211
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:11,595
that I, Aisslinger,
have low intelligence.

212
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:14,062
Absolutely unforgivable.

213
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:16,562
-Aisslinger, shut your face.

214
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:17,995
Stop acting like
you're all high,

215
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,862
and mighty, and smarter than me.

216
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:23,995
Huh?

217
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:24,495
Gotcha!

218
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:39,495
-What would we want
with human forms?

219
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:42,262
We abandoned our human
forms long ago so

220
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,228
that we could become
even more powerful.

221
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,128
Hmph.

222
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:53,095
Don't underestimate me, human.

223
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:58,095
[shout]

224
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:02,395
-This is crazy!

225
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,528
Let me help!

226
00:13:03,562 --> 00:13:04,428
-Stay right there.

227
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:05,795
Chad And I have
got this handled.

228
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,462
-Bastard!

229
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:20,695
I'm the one you
have to fight now!

230
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:22,662
Argh!

231
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:23,128
Ah!

232
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:29,895
Uryu, what was that for?

233
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:33,062
-I told you to stay
out of the way.

234
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:33,562
-Huh?

235
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:39,795
-What the hell's with you guys?

236
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:40,895
-Just stay out of the way.

237
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:42,595
Got it?

238
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:45,228
-I wouldn't waste time
worrying about your friends

239
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:46,128
if I were you.

240
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:54,762
-Hey Chad, look out!

241
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:55,928
-Stay back, Ichigo!

242
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:58,328
-We'll handle this ourselves.

243
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:01,162
-What the hell?

244
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:02,462
-Damn.

245
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,828
I thought this guy was just
using an ordinary attack.

246
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:08,795
But he's summoning all the
spirit energy around him

247
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:11,195
into the palm of his hand.

248
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:15,362
That attack's a lot more
dangerous than it looks.

249
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:17,195
I can't construct
my weapon when he's

250
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:20,495
disrupting the spiritual
pressure like this.

251
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:29,962
If I could get a little
distance between us-- Chad!

252
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:30,462
-Huh?

253
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:38,028
AISSLINGER (VOICEOVER):
His attack is too slow.

254
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:41,995
He could never keep
up with my Sonido.

255
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:46,262
Their fighting ability
is easy to measure.

256
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:50,028
The one has power, but
lacks speed and agility.

257
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:55,062
The other is fast, but lacks
the power to do any real damage.

258
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:58,462
I'll finish this!

259
00:14:58,495 --> 00:14:58,962
-Now!

260
00:15:02,395 --> 00:15:03,828
-Huh?

261
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,262
What's he doing?

262
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:08,528
Why is he just standing there?

263
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:12,362
-So you've finally
given up, human fool!

264
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:13,828
Argh!

265
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:14,695
-Demoura, wait!

266
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:20,928
[crying out]

267
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:35,962
-My, my.

268
00:15:35,995 --> 00:15:39,395
Compatibility is
always so important.

269
00:15:39,428 --> 00:15:41,562
I became so absorbed
in the challenge

270
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:44,095
of fighting the same
opponent all this time

271
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:46,095
that I completely forgot
one of the basics.

272
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:54,228
You see, I forgot we
were fighting two on two.

273
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:56,795
If either one of us is having
difficulty fighting with one,

274
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:58,295
we could simply
trade with the other

275
00:15:58,328 --> 00:16:00,062
for a more compatible enemy.

276
00:16:00,095 --> 00:16:02,428
Pit power against power.

277
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,062
And of course,
speed against speed.

278
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,629
Now then...

279
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:28,005
time to step up this battle.

280
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:41,630
-What the hell is that?

281
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:44,664
Uryu-- is that a bow?

282
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,630
-You have to ask?

283
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:49,897
Interesting.

284
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,697
What else would it be?

285
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,297
Have you ever know
me to go into battle

286
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,997
with any other
weapon than a bow?

287
00:17:06,064 --> 00:17:07,730
This is my new weapon.

288
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:11,297
Ginrei Kojaku.

289
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:22,364
[screaming]

290
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:36,530
CHAD: It's a good thing I
didn't destroy your entire mask.

291
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:38,730
Half of your face is bad enough.

292
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,297
I'd hate to see the rest.

293
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,764
[shout]

294
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:55,697
-That's all you've got?

295
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,197
Too bad.

296
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:03,164
I was hoping you'd be stronger.

297
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,564
[shout]

298
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:22,030
-Dammit.

299
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:23,330
Disgusting human.

300
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:30,130
URYU: So that's a Sonido, is it?

301
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:31,630
You were right.

302
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:32,664
You are fast.

303
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:33,997
Impossible.

304
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,430
He's just a human.

305
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,497
There's no way he could keep
up with the speed of my Sonido.

306
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,330
-Oh, that's right.

307
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:43,630
I guess I forgot to tell you
that I'm not an ordinary human.

308
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,464
I am a Quincy.

309
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:49,097
This is Hirenkyaku, a Quincy
high speed maneuvering

310
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,597
technique.

311
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,264
I happen to think it's better
than the Soul Reaper's Flash

312
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:55,430
Step, but that's my opinion.

313
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:56,964
-A Quincy?

314
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:59,297
You mean you're some kind
of higher level human?

315
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,097
I never knew anything
like that existed.

316
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,564
-You didn't know?

317
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:05,530
That's too bad.

318
00:19:05,564 --> 00:19:06,964
I guess you really are ignorant.

319
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:13,930
-Even if you can keep
up with my Sonida,

320
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:17,430
that's not going
to change anything.

321
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:20,497
The only weapon you've
got is that bow,

322
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,264
and there's no way it can defend
you against my Una Tirotear.

323
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,397
Oh, what?

324
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,397
You really think you'll
be able to shoot down

325
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,330
all of my Tirotear?

326
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:41,330
What a childish tactic.

327
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:44,497
You'll have to think of
something better than that.

328
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,530
Go ahead.

329
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:47,530
Give it your best shot, Quincy.

330
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:49,930
But I think there's
something you should know.

331
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:54,030
My Una Tirotear is able to
fire a continuous stream of 108

332
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:55,464
shots at once.

333
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:58,564
Let's see how long you
can stand up against that.

334
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,730
URYU: Oh, I see.

335
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:04,030
108 shots all at once
is very impressive.

336
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:08,764
The only thing is my Ginrei
Kojaku fires slightly more.

337
00:20:08,797 --> 00:20:20,230
Like 1,200.

338
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:23,597
[screaming]

339
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:44,630
-Huh?

340
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:46,064
Dammit.

341
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:48,430
You'll pay for that.

342
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:51,464
I won't lose to a
weakling like you.

343
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:53,430
You hear me?

344
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:54,297
I won't lose!

345
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,397
No!

346
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,664
He couldn't!

347
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,164
No way!

348
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:25,597
-Are you done?

349
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,764
Since you waited until
now to use that attack,

350
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:30,330
I'm guessing it was
your last resort,

351
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:33,497
and you've got nothing left.

352
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:38,497
So I think it's time I
show you my final attack.

353
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,964
I'd rather not.

354
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:42,897
You see, I don't
enjoy finishing off

355
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,230
an enemy who's lose
his will to fight.

356
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:48,364
It just doesn't
sit right with me.

357
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:53,364
But in this situation,
I just can't

358
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:56,130
allow myself to feel
any pity for your kind.

359
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:02,864
El Directo.

360
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:17,452
[theme music]

361
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,174
CHAD: It looks
like we'll finally

362
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,774
get to see all of the Espada.

363
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:49,141
ICHIGO: More new characters?

364
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:51,341
We've already got Soul Reaper
captains, Visoreds, and now

365
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:52,308
Espada?

366
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:53,441
It's getting so
crowded around here.

367
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,708
Someone's going to
have to disappear soon.

368
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:56,574
URYU: Better stay on
your toes, Ichigo.

369
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:58,574
You can't afford to
let your guard down.

370
00:23:58,608 --> 00:23:59,708
ICHIGO: Again?
