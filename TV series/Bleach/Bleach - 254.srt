1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,833
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,566
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,100
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:29,066
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,300
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:23,081
I won't... give in!

7
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:35,481
What the hell?

8
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:42,681
Unbelievable!

9
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:43,681
Ichigo!

10
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,781
This really isn't good!
A Garganta is opening!

11
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:16,914
And we're trapped!
We're gonna have to
do something fast!

12
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:28,247
Tsuginomai Hakuren!

13
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:47,081
Sodenoshirayuki.

14
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,447
You didn't think we'd
let you have all the fun,
did you?

15
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:20,981
Sorry it took us so long!

16
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:21,981
Renji!

17
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:24,981
It looks like they
brought some back-up.

18
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:28,847
Are they the Zanpakuto
we've been hearing about?

19
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:34,614
What's going on?
Weren't their Zanpakuto
rebelling against them?

20
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:38,847
Please explain,
Sodenoshirayuki.

21
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:45,614
Yes Ma'am. Captain
Kurotsuchi is responsible.
He reversed the mind control
that ruled us.

22
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:54,714
Well, that explains
everything.

23
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:57,947
We apologize for the
trouble we may have
caused.

24
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,214
We're here
to help.

25
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:05,847
I promise that we will
make it up to all of you.
Now Snap!

26
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:07,514
Now Roar!

27
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:10,914
Roar!

28
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:13,547
Extend!

29
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,214
Tear in Frenzy!

30
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:31,947
Damn it. You should let
your master mount an attack
before you charge in!

31
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:37,714
What's that you're
blabbering?! You think you
could do any better? Well,
let's see it then!

32
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:43,714
Have you no shame? Do
you realize how ugly it
is to go rushing in and
take all the credit?

33
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:45,747
You know what's far
more ugly?

34
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:50,214
Someone like you being
petty and jealous about
getting beat to the punch
by someone else.

35
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:59,281
They're coming!

36
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:00,281
You're right.

37
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:03,481
Somenomai, Tsukishiro!

38
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:16,714
It's a Cero!

39
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:27,781
That wasn't going
to work.

40
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:31,914
We can't let a job like
this be done by those
hot-blooded Zanpakuto.

41
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:33,647
Thanks a lot
for helping us.

42
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:39,447
Helping you was not at
all my intention. I have to
do my job whether you're
here or not!

43
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,947
Shunko!

44
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:48,381
Uryu?!

45
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:50,081
What are you
doing, Uryu?!

46
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:52,547
You'll pay
for that.

47
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:56,947
Your reckless attack
could've caused major
damage to this town!

48
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:01,514
Ichigo's still trapped
inside that thing! He
could get hurt!

49
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:06,347
I don't care. The only
thing I need to do is
get rid of it.

50
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:08,614
And I won't let you
interfere.

51
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:09,814
Please don't do it!

52
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:11,281
Enough!

53
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:18,747
We cannot focus on
fighting each other now.
Instead, we must defeat
these Hollows.

54
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:21,881
Have it your way.

55
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:24,881
What now, Captain?

56
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:26,514
There's not much time.

57
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:31,747
We should start searching
for Ichigo's Spiritual
Pressure. We need an
update on him.

58
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:36,547
Thank you very much,
sir. I will do that.

59
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:02,781
Their numbers are
continuing to grow.

60
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:07,747
This fight is going to be
difficult even with the
ability to utilize our
Zanpakuto.

61
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:11,481
Captain Kurotsuchi is
working as fast as he can

62
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:15,181
to free the remaining Zanpakuto
from Muramasa's mind control.

63
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:17,881
But we can't wait
any longer.

64
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,480
Alright Soi Fon.

65
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:28,413
We will have to take care
of all the Hollows that are
here. Are you ready?

66
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,313
Let's do it.

67
00:08:41,513 --> 00:08:43,280
I will be right behind
you.

68
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:44,913
I can handle this.

69
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,047
<i>Roar!</i>

70
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,213
Monkey, I don't
trust 'em.

71
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,013
Yeah, they had us
completely fooled.

72
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,280
Let it go, just
stay focused!

73
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:14,380
All right, but I
understand how
Hozokimaru's feeling.

74
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:20,480
He put on that big act.
Kept claiming there was
no way he'd accept Soul
Reapers.

75
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,947
Whatever the reason may
be, this just doesn't
seem right.

76
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:26,547
This is not the time to
talk about that!

77
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,213
But--

78
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:32,180
Sort out your feelings
later, when you have the
time.

79
00:09:32,213 --> 00:09:36,413
But right now, we must
fulfill our duties as
Soul Reapers and
Zanpakuto.

80
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:40,713
Yes, I do agree! Let's
all do our best!

81
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:44,613
You know, you really
haven't been yourself
lately.

82
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:46,447
You think so?

83
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:49,347
It's not a change for
the good.

84
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,347
Enough!

85
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:56,113
She can't help it. You
Zanpakuto aren't the only
ones who are feeling that
way right now.

86
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,980
Rangiku...

87
00:09:58,713 --> 00:10:02,147
All of us are members of
the same Thirteen Court
Guard Squads.

88
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,313
But we just don't feel
bound by this mission.

89
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:12,113
How all of you feel is
really none of my concern.
Why don't you babies just
shut up and fight.

90
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:30,280
You all right there,
Captain?

91
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:35,013
The injuries you had were
minor, you're not going to
tell me you're finished,
are you?

92
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:43,347
Karakura Town has been
placed in an Area Freeze.
We're now able to use our
full power.

93
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,613
What do you mean
full power?

94
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:50,280
If you get carried away
and make things a mess,
we're not gonna clean up
after you.

95
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:54,913
I don't think you want
someone with a big butt
cleaning up after you, do
you, Renji?

96
00:10:55,713 --> 00:10:59,147
Why do you always have to
act like your dumb master?!

97
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,480
Because the fact is, he's
a dummy! I can't help it!

98
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:06,347
Damn it! Cut that out,
already!

99
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:10,713
Captain... There is
something you should
know.

100
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:15,713
There are a lot of people
that still won't be able
to accept your actions.

101
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:24,513
But Captain, to me...

102
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,213
You are still my---

103
00:11:28,347 --> 00:11:29,713
<i>Renji...</i>

104
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:31,947
Let's go.

105
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:38,313
That's what you get for
trying to play it cool.

106
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:39,713
You suck!

107
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:42,613
Just shut up! Come on
now, let's go!

108
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:52,613
All right, let's
go, Lieutenant.

109
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:57,213
I'm itching to show
them why they should
never test the Lieutenant
of Squad Two!

110
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:00,180
Now smash 'em!
Gegetsuburi!

111
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:01,213
No!

112
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:06,213
Damn it, why the hell
did you just kick me?!

113
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:10,113
Don't try to tell me you
haven't been released from
Muramasa's mind control!

114
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,680
It's not that!

115
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:16,313
Then what's the big
idea?! Kicking your
beloved master in the
back like that!

116
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,713
Call me Mister!

117
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:20,080
Huh?!?

118
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:23,980
Say, "Smash 'em Mister
Gegetsuburi". Say it!

119
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,680
Huh?!

120
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:31,980
Uh, excuse me?

121
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,847
[arguing]

122
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,180
Man, these guys are
hopeless.

123
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:38,213
Huh!?

124
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:41,513
We wouldn't be in this
mess if you had just
listened to me!

125
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:43,947
No, it's because you
wouldn't call me
mister!

126
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,380
Now Raise
Your Head---

127
00:12:57,513 --> 00:12:58,647
What!?

128
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,613
Captain Komamura?!

129
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,047
Oh wow.

130
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,147
That kind of grazed me.

131
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,547
Huh. Maybe I've
rested too long.

132
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:19,113
I feel tired and a little
bit fatigued. I think it's
best that you two stop
wasting your time.

133
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:26,547
I will take care of this
by myself. But can you
at least do me the favor
of staying out of my way?

134
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,047
Uh, yes, sir.
Sorry about that.

135
00:13:29,713 --> 00:13:31,947
I think I just
peed a little.

136
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:39,980
It's no use. I can't
sense Ichigo's Spiritual
Pressure.

137
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:41,447
That's not good.

138
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,880
There's no sense
in just waiting.

139
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:45,313
We need to take action.

140
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:46,380
Wait!

141
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,480
What just happened?!

142
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:56,980
Muramasa's Spirit
Energy is out of control.

143
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,013
Even with the power of a
captain's Bankai, it won't
be easy to defeat him.

144
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,947
But we're going to have
to at least try to help.

145
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,947
What's that?

146
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:27,213
More Menos!

147
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:45,532
Oh no!

148
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:48,299
Just, great... More and
more of them are coming
out!

149
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:50,432
It never ends.

150
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:54,065
So are we going to have
to battle all of those
new ones as well?

151
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:55,932
Guess we'll have to.

152
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:58,999
Man! We've got a lot
more work to do, huh?

153
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:01,932
Well, Captain?

154
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:04,032
Hmmm...

155
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:07,432
Looks like there won't
be enough time for
arguing.

156
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:10,332
We've got no choice.

157
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:14,532
The only time you two
get along are times
like these.

158
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:18,265
Not good. We won't
get anywhere like this.

159
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:30,132
The Spiritual Pressure of
the sphere has increased
even more.

160
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:40,165
The tear in the sky is
continuing to expand,
allowing more Menos to
gain access to this world.

161
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:46,365
If this keeps up, we
will be up against an
infinite number of them.

162
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:50,232
Damn. They just keep
coming and coming.

163
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:51,899
I'm going in!

164
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:53,365
Going where?

165
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,465
Into that opening. If
I seal it, that should
help, right?

166
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:03,165
Are you an idiot?! How
the hell are you going to
seal something that big?!

167
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:17,199
Here they come!

168
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:20,232
Oh, no. Look, now they're
beginning to pour right in.

169
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:22,399
We must stop it!

170
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:24,499
But what can we do?!

171
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:25,832
Do something!

172
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:27,799
You should do something!

173
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:56,665
Captain Kuchiki!

174
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:58,465
What's he doing?!

175
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:02,132
You see that?!

176
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:03,999
What Spiritual Pressure!

177
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:11,899
In his weak condition.

178
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,899
Where's that power
coming from?!

179
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:17,832
He's using his Spirit
Energy to force them
back!

180
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:20,032
This is reckless.

181
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,899
Will he be able to pull
it off?

182
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:28,199
It might be possible with
an immense amount of
Spirit Energy.

183
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,665
But at what cost?

184
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:51,332
Be careful.

185
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:52,665
Amazing.

186
00:19:58,299 --> 00:19:59,799
Go right now!

187
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,032
We did it?

188
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:50,099
We did.

189
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,132
Are you all right?

190
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:56,665
Who do you think I am?

191
00:20:59,932 --> 00:21:02,399
That guy, really is
reckless.

192
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:04,765
Huh. He's not
that great.

193
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:09,032
The truth is, without our
power he wouldn't have
succeeded.

194
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:12,065
I'm feeling beat.

195
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:14,699
Maybe your age is finally
catching up with you.

196
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:15,532
Hmmm.

197
00:21:20,265 --> 00:21:22,799
All right, let's
take care of the rest.

198
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,799
Right!

199
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,365
What?! That thing is
still expanding!

200
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:46,065
Nothing has changed.

201
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:49,432
How about Ichigo? Can
we save him?!

202
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:51,099
I don't know.

203
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:54,332
The fact is we can't
take the chance of
getting near that thing,
so we're stuck leaving

204
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:56,499
it up to Ichigo to save
himself.

205
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:57,865
That's awful!

206
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:00,132
Ichigo!

207
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:02,265
Ichigo.

208
00:22:02,632 --> 00:22:04,165
Please be okay.

209
00:23:47,965 --> 00:23:52,865
I hear a voice. Who is
it that calls for me?

210
00:23:52,899 --> 00:24:01,932
So, it's you. Fine.
Let's settle this
once and for all.
