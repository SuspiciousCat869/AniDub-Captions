1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,466
Let go of the girl!

2
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:10,033
Ichigo!

3
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:12,766
Scatter,
Sembonzakura!

4
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:15,466
Who is that?!

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Aah, ha ha ha ha!

6
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,166
Go, Kenny, gooo!

7
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,466
So how do you
think I look?

8
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:27,733
Okay, everyone,
quiet on the set,
and action!

9
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:15,324
We're going to make movies!

10
00:02:15,357 --> 00:02:18,124
Say what?... We're gonna what?

11
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:20,724
We're coming up
on blockbuster
movie season.

12
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:25,791
Now, as you all know,
these are difficult economic
times for many people.

13
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:28,724
Consumers are
tightening their belts
and spending less.

14
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:34,157
On everything, that is,
except the movies, one of
the few industries that
is actually thriving.

15
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:38,124
No matter how bleak the economic
picture, people still flock to
the multiplex

16
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:41,091
and put their money down for
an hour or two of escape.

17
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:44,324
We have to find a way to tap
into that revenue stream!

18
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:48,291
Are the Thirteen Court
Guard Squads really
that hard up for cash?

19
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:50,491
As a matter of fact,
from what I've heard,

20
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:55,424
the Seireitei's suffered a
lot of damage recently from
all the battles and calamities
that have been going on.

21
00:02:55,457 --> 00:02:57,591
The repair costs have
been astronomical.

22
00:02:57,624 --> 00:03:01,657
It's not like you worry about
damage to a few buildings when
you're fighting for your life.

23
00:03:02,924 --> 00:03:08,591
So we have decided to hold
the First Annual Seireitei
International Film Festival,

24
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:11,657
to coincide with the
release of Bleach Movie 4.

25
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,491
[cheers]

26

"Bleach Movie 4,"
where the hell'd
that come from?

27
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:21,657
Don't think so hard.
Let's just make a
kickass film that'll
blow everyone away.

28
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:24,491
He's right, Ichigo.
Come on, let's go!

29
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:27,057
Egh, How did I
get roped in?

30
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:39,091
Cut! Not like that!

31
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:42,091
I Can't believe how
gung-ho everybody is here.

32
00:03:42,124 --> 00:03:44,357
And where the hell
did all this equipment come
from?

33
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,857
Gangway!!

34
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,291

Hello there.

40
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,857
So are you guys
shooting a movie, too?

41
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:18,491
Mmm. Squads Four and Seven
have decided to pool our
resources. Our film is a
joint co-production.

42
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:20,691
Really?
What's it about?

43
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:24,524
It's set in a
post-apocalyptic world.

44
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:28,057
It tells the story of
how the human race is
saved by animals.

45
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:31,324
Saved by...?
Oh! You're the lead?

47
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:36,857
Got a problem?

48
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:37,657
Eyahh!

49
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:39,591
What are you
looking at?

50
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:44,091
Oh, nothing! It's just that
you don't look much like a
savior of the human race.

51
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:45,524

[gulp]

53
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:52,124
Actually, I was
thinking that myself;

54
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:55,157
there's something wrong
with that costume, though I
don't know exactly What...

55
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:58,291
You can be honest!
It's me, isn't it,
Captain?

56
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:00,891
It's because of my
acting, isn't it?
I'm not good enough!

57
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:03,091
I'm dragging down the whole
production, aren't I?

58
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:05,224
Well, the costume
isn't helping.

59
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:08,757
[Sajin]
Now that you mention it,
Tetsuzaemon, you could
use an acting lesson.

<i>I'd be honored, sir! Woof!</i>

61
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:14,324
Do you think maybe
we should ask Squad
Twelve to help us?

62
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:20,291
Captain Kurotsuchi did say
they're constructing full-body
costumes for the science
fiction film they're making.

63
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:24,357
A science fiction film, huh?
With full-body costumes?

64
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:26,324
Ichigo?

65
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:26,957
Huh?

66
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:28,391
Are you free
right now?

67
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:29,824
Yeah. I guess.

68
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:34,324
Well, as it happens, we find
ourselves short of actors and we
could really use your help.

69
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:38,057
Do you think you might
be available to play a
small part in our movie?

70
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:40,757
Oh, uh, I don't
think I, uh...

71
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:43,457
As I say, we're short of actors,

Oh. Okay.

74
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:50,491
Oh, it looks very
good on you.

75
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:54,757
Now what?
Do I have to fetch?

76
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:59,524
All right, we're shooting scene
15, the big fight between our
hero and the human,

77
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:02,224
who was turned into a
dog-man by the curse
of the dead dog.

We're making a movie, of course!

86
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:25,524
You guys might as well pack it
in, because we in Squad Eleven
are making a blockbuster hit
with our captain as the star!

87
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:31,624
We show him going around making
mincemeat of everything,
buildings, people, even worms.
It's an action f
lick.

88
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:36,024
Yeah, and without
any special effects,
it's all for real!
Awesome, isn't it? Bam!

89
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:40,224
Yeah, but it doesn't
sound like there's
much of a story.

Aahh!

91
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:44,591
Yeah, Ichigo!
You'll be perfect!

92
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:49,757
Just the sort of worthy
opponent I can cut up
into little pieces for
the big climactic scene.

93
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:52,591
Come on and fight me!
It'll be good!

94

Eh, no thanks.

95
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:58,624
Huh?? What's wrong?
Are you saying you're
afraid to fight me?

I'm sorry, but you see,
Ichigo has already been
cast in our film.

100
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:12,324

you and your colleagues to
please clear the set.

Aren't you guys
making one too?

122
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:22,957
Well, yeah. In fact, I came
up with what I thought was
a killer idea for a movie,

123
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:24,524
but Nanao vetoed it.

124
00:08:24,557 --> 00:08:27,957
I will not be associated with
any film rated "adults only."

guys hoping to make?

00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:02,257
That's me! Like the scar?
Cute, huh?

149
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:07,691
And Ichigo, you get to
play the part of the high
school Soul Reaper who
comes to Rukia's rescue.

150
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:09,157
Sounds like
real life.

151
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,724
And here we have
the rest of our
cast and crew.

152
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:18,091
Ichigo, what exactly are we
doing? I was just told to show
up here if I wasn't busy.

153
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:19,557
Mmm.

154
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:22,891
Orihime, you play
a human victim of
Rangiku's evil
mind control.

155
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:25,991
And Chad, you'll be
our trusted production
assistant and gofer.

156
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:30,191
And I've been put in
charge of designing the
costumes, of course.

157
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:34,957
Sure, it figures. No wonder the
maid and the alien are wearing
dorky little capes.

158
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:37,657
[Renji] Uryu, you're also
going to be my cameraman.

159
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:41,591
Oh, and last but
by no means least,
Captain Kuchiki.

160
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:43,957
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Byakuya??</i>

161
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:49,057
Yeah, the captain's in
charge of supplying visual
effects using his kido.

162
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:54,457
As the honor of the Seireitei
depends on the success of
this film festival,

163
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:58,924
it is the duty of every
captain to play his part
in achieving that end.

164
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:00,391
Right.

165
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:03,491
Okay now, let's
get started, we're
losing the light!

166
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:14,357
Scene 62! Ichigo, you're going
to rescue Rukia from Chad and
Orihime who are under Rangiku's
evil mind control, got it?

167
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:15,924
Places, everyone!

168
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:18,691
Whoa, I didn't know I'd
be in the first scene!

169
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:21,357
Wait, wasn't I supposed
to be the gofer, Renji?

170
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,691
Just let me worry
about the details.

171
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,724
Wait, How did you get
to be the director?

172
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:28,757
Listen up.
Here's how the
scene plays.

173
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:32,757
<i>Okay. Rukia's been captured</i>
<i>and is about to be executed</i>
<i>by Chad and Orihime.</i>

174
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,424
<i>But Ichigo, your hands</i>
<i>are tied, because even</i>
<i>though they're</i>

175
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:37,924
<i>under Rangiku's mind</i>
<i>control, they're</i>
<i>innocent people.</i>

176
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:41,624
So, you find yourself in a
hopeless situation, got it?!

177
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:44,957
And?

178
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:47,591
Well, and then you rescue
Rukia, of course, what do
you think happens?

179
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,724
Okay, how?

180
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:50,957
It's up to you to
figure that part out!

181
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:52,457
I need an agent.

182
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,591
All right,
places, everyone!

183
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:58,291
Okay now, I'm counting
on you for any visual
effects, Captain.

184
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:00,791
But whatever you do,
try and make 'em
really dramatic.

185
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:02,124
Understood.

186
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:03,557
Action!!

187
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,991
You'll never get
away with this,
you evil alien
mastermind!

188
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:11,091
No? Don't make me laugh,
who's going to stop me?

189
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:14,191
You, Maid Cop? You look a
little tied up at the moment.

190
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:16,257
Ha ha ha ha!

191
00:12:16,624 --> 00:12:19,691
You can laugh and mock me all
you want, I will not lose heart.

192
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:23,724
I know my friends will be here
to rescue me any minute now.

193
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:26,857
Too bad you won't
still be alive to
welcome them.

194
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:28,491
You! Execute her!

195
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,691
Okey-doke!

196
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:32,791
Sorry about this Rukia.

197
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:36,857
But remember, we're under
her mind control and we
aren't responsible for
our actions.

198
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:41,024
Orihime, I don't think
somebody whose mind is
being controlled would
really say that.

199
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:46,357
Oh no, time is running out!
Great Cosmic Gollygosh,
this is a desperate pickle!

200
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,357
What will happen?
Could this be the end of
Intergalactic Maid Cop??

201
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:52,491
Hold it right there!

202
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:54,524
Who is that?!

203
00:12:55,457 --> 00:12:57,257
Let go of the girl!

204
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:02,457
Or else prepare to feel the
righteous blade of Ichigo,
High School Soul Reaper!

205
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:06,657
Look at you. You didn't even
want to do this and now you're
chewing up the scenery.

206
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:08,091
Shut up!

207
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:12,391
Ha ha ha! I think
you're forgetting the
situation you're in.

208
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:18,924
I have these hostages,
remember? Make one false move
and your fellow humans will
perish. Is that what you want?

209
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:23,291
Sorry we can't help out.
But she's got us under
mind control.

210
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:24,057
Rgh.

211
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:25,757
Gah! You evil fiend!

212
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,591
Don't flatter me.
Now, my mind slaves,
kill him!

213
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:33,557
We never rehearsed
this, what are we
supposed to do now?

214
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,524
I don't know,
just attack him!

215
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:37,191
Ichigo, you dodge 'em.

216
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:39,257
Isn't the director
supposed to direct?

217
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:41,157
Hrrm. Whatever.

218
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:43,191
El Directo!

219
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:52,491
Nice try. But you'll
have to do a lot better
than that to beat me!

220
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:53,524
Uh!

221
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:56,624
I don't know,
it's missing
something.

222
00:13:56,657 --> 00:13:58,891
Captain, I think it's
time to show your stuff.

223
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:00,124
Very well.

224
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,624
Orihime! Stick your hands out
and go into your stance!

225
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,957
Me? Why?

226
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,791
Just strike a pose!

227
00:14:06,824 --> 00:14:08,291
Oh. Okay.

228
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:12,057
Hado Number 33. Sokatsui!

229
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:14,757
Huh?

230
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:18,824
Hey, that was close!

Hado Number 4. Byakurai!

232
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:30,124
I get it that you're trying to
make it look good, but come on,

233
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:31,724
do you have to make
it look this good?!

234
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:33,791
You're not even the guy
I'm supposed to be fighting!

235
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:36,824
Hello?! Why are you
just standing there?
Keep attacking!

236
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:39,524

Eyyahhhhh!!!

239
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:58,291
Oh, poor Ichigo!
How could you do that to
him? That does it!

240
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,357
I don't care if you are
helpless mind slaves, you're
going to pay for this!

241
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:04,757
Take that and that
and that and--!

242
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,791
All right, mind slaves!
Drop to the ground now!

243
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,591

However, luckily for you,
I'm gonna let you off easy.
Farewell!

247

Ichigo. Thanks to your
noble sacrifice, I'm alive
to fight another day.

Farewell. Farewell forever,

I wasn't acting!

Story, shmory, who cares?

287
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:25,272
We're going to rearrange
everything in the
editing stage anyway.

288
00:17:25,572 --> 00:17:28,572
We can always erase
the soundtrack and
dub in new dialogue.

Cover up any rough
spots with CGI and music...

just making it all
up as you go along!

Maybe, but that's
fine with me.

<i>[Rangiku]</i>
<i>Look at Shuhei's group.</i>

294
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:45,638
<i>They're still working on</i>
<i>their script, they haven't</i>
<i>even started shooting.</i>

295
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:49,672
<i>They're way</i>
<i>behind schedule.</i>
<i>Momo is about to</i>
<i>blow a fuse.</i>

296
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:53,005
We don't want to end
up like them, do we?

297
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,972
Oh, wow, those
poor guys.

298
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:58,072
When the script's late, the
whole cast and crew suffers.

299
00:17:58,105 --> 00:17:58,872
Hmm.

300
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:00,372
Whatever!
The main
thing is,

301
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:03,138
why does your
aim have to be
so accurate,
Byakuya?

302
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:05,705
You got a grudge
against me or
something?

303
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:07,272
No, not at all.

304
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:08,972
But,

305
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:14,972
It's simply that I believe
that true art requires me to
be truthful in my performance.

306
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:16,572
Nobly said,
my brother!

307
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:20,305
If the name of the
Kuchiki Clan is to
appear in the credits,

308
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:22,905
I cannot allow
mistakes to be made.

309
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:25,338
Well, I'm glad
you're happy.
Cause I quit.

310
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,438
What? No, you can't!

311
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:30,038
When we're so close to
finally finishing the movie?

312
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:32,805
Sorry, I just can't
take it any more.

313
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:35,005
Auggh!

314
00:18:36,738 --> 00:18:38,505
Hey! What the hell
was that for?!

315
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:40,205
What are you
so afraid of?

316
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:41,538
Mmph!

317
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:45,205
So you got a little
beat up during filming.

318
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:47,705
You're going to get discouraged
over something like that?

319
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:49,205
It happens all the time!

320
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:53,005
Are you afraid you're not
going to look good on camera?
Is that it?

321
00:18:53,838 --> 00:18:58,105
Or maybe you're afraid you're
not a good enough actor to make
it look truthful and real?

322
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,838
[gasp]

323
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,905
If you don't have confidence
in your acting, make up for
it with passion.

324
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:07,638
If you're afraid you
won't be able to make it
real, then find a way to
fake it so it looks real.

325
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:13,438
If you find that the work is too
hard and the schedule too long,
then try nailing all your scenes
in one take!

326
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:17,572
Stand tall, speak clearly,
and stop worrying what
other people think!

327
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:22,538
Now come on, get on your feet
and be the man I've always
known you to be, Ichigo!

328
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:32,305
Hm! You talk too much,
you know that?

329
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:43,272
Okay, now that we're all on
the same page, you ready?
Let's get back to work!

330
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:44,572
Yeah!

331
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:48,838
What are you people
doing here?!

332
00:19:49,072 --> 00:19:49,872
Huh??

333
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:51,172
Crap! They
found us!

334
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:52,672
<i>Intruders! Sound the alert!</i>

335
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:53,872
Hey, what's going
on here, Renji?

336
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:55,672
Never mind,
just get moving!

337
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:58,572
Wait, I thought you
said you got permission
to shoot here.

338
00:19:58,605 --> 00:20:00,305
Yeah, I kinda
lied about that.

339
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:01,338
[appalled gasp]

340
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:03,505
It's called guerilla
filmmaking, everybody does it.

341
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:05,705
Beats having to deal with
all that stupid paperwork.

342
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,172
Intruders!
Seal the area!
Get them!

343
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:09,672
[Ichigo]
Great, we're surrounded!

344
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:10,738
[Orihime]
Oh, no!

345
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,138
Now roar! Zabimaru!

346
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:16,738
Follow me! Hurry!

347
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,038
Wait! Renji,
where you going?

348
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:20,905
Never mind, just run! Run!

349
00:20:21,872 --> 00:20:23,138
Don't let them
get away!

350
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:30,205
[Ichigo]
Where are we?

351
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:31,305
[Renji]
Hell if I know.

352
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:32,505
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Look, a dead end!</i>

353
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:34,672
<i>[Renji]</i>
<i>Well, I guess I've</i>
<i>got no choice.</i>

354
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:37,972
<i>Bankai! Hihio!</i>
<i>Zabimaru!</i>

355
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:48,905
[Renji]
There, y'see?
Just like I planned it.

356
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:50,138
[Ichigo]
Yeah, right.

357
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:55,438
Damn! How did they
get here so fast?

358
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:57,305
Is this still
"just how you
planned it?"

359
00:20:57,338 --> 00:20:59,738
[gasp] They're
behind us, too!

360
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:01,605
Hmm.

361
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:03,038
Captain?

362
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,972
I will not jeopardize my
clan's honor by allowing
myself to be captured here.

363
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:12,405
I think your clan's honor
went in the dumpster when
you signed on to this movie.

364
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,805
Hey! Wait, Byakuya,
don't do anything crazy!

365
00:21:15,305 --> 00:21:18,972
Bankai Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

366
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:27,572
Yeah! He did it!

367
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,072
YAHHH!

368
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:40,838
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>And so, evil is defeated</i>
<i>and peace is restored to</i>
<i>the Soul Society,</i>

369
00:21:40,872 --> 00:21:44,538
<i>thanks to the noble sacrifice</i>
<i>of young Ichigo Kurosaki.</i>

370
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:47,038
<i>We would like to add that no</i>
<i>actual sacred sites</i>

371
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,405
<i>were trespassed upon or</i>
<i>destroyed in the making of</i>
<i>this motion picture.</i>

372
00:21:50,838 --> 00:21:53,805
<i>We hope you enjoyed it and</i>
<i>thank you for your support.</i>

373
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:59,405
How could you not enjoy it?
it's got everything!
Thrills, laughs, action!

374
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:02,938
I think the grand prize
for the best film is as
good as mine!

375
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:08,205
YAAAHHH!! I knew I
should've quit when I
had the chaaaance!

376
00:22:09,472 --> 00:22:10,372
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>The End!</i>

377
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,717
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>So does the festival's grand</i>
<i>prize come with any money?</i>

378
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,917
<i>[Byakuya]</i>
<i>It's been withdrawn.</i>

379
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,650
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>What? Why?</i>

380
00:23:51,683 --> 00:23:54,583
<i>[Byakuya]</i>
<i>The prize money is going to</i>
<i>be used for repairs instead.</i>

381
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:58,350
<i>It seems the Seireitei</i>
<i>was nearly destroyed</i>
<i>during filming.</i>

382
00:23:58,383 --> 00:23:59,983
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>But that was all your fault!</i>
