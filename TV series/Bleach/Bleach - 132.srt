Ichigo.

00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:05,605
I'm sure he's somewhere safe,
doing something important.

5
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:11,838
Argh.

6
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:12,771
Oh, man!

7
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:20,205
No!

8
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:34,071
Huh?

9
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:45,571
-This this yours?

10
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:47,571
-Uh, yeah.

11
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:49,305
-You should be more
careful with it.

12
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:53,305
-Huh?

13
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:08,238
-Nice air on that ball, dude!

14
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,238
Kick it over here, dude!

15
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:14,671
-When are they gonna get
off the field, already?

16
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:17,705
-Looks like they're
middle school students.

17
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:18,571
-Excuse me.

18
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:21,605
It's our turn to use the field.

19
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:23,205
-What?

20
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:24,505
-Huh?

21
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,605
Who are you?

22
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:28,871
-We're the ones who reserved
the field for this time

23
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:30,705
to practice.

24
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:31,671
-Yeah?

25
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:33,571
Well, you didn't
reserve it with us.

26
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:34,438
Beat it!

27
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:36,005
We're not giving up the field.

28
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:36,738
-Aw.

29
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:38,271
Come on.

30
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:42,171
-Go use that little empty
lot on the other side.

31
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:43,738
-Why don't you guys?

32
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:46,105
This is our time to
practice on the field.

33
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,305
Those are the rules, so move it!

34
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:49,371
-Oh, boy.

35
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:51,205
You brats are always
reserving the field,

36
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:52,771
even though you
guys don't need it.

37
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:54,705
So the only time we
never get to practice

38
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:57,038
is when we take
it for ourselves.

39
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,305
-What makes you think that
we don't need the field?

40
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:01,438
Our practice is just
as important to us

41
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:02,938
as yours is to you.

42
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:03,605
-That's right!

43
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:04,571
-Yeah, that's right.

44
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:05,538
-What's goin' on?

45
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:06,505
-What's the hold up?

46
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,205
-Hey, get off our field, kids.

47
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:10,805
Why don't you go
back to grade school?

48
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:13,071
-This is mad, Karin.

49
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:15,571
-So what if we are
in grade school?

50
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,738
The rules are the rules.

51
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:18,838
-Oh, yeah?

52
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:19,938
-That's right.

53
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:22,505
-An empty lot is good
enough for you kids.

54
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:24,905
They're not even serious
about practicing.

55
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:25,805
KARIN: We are serious.

56
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:27,538
We're more serious than you.

57
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,105
You can't even follow the rules.

58
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:34,738
-Just forget about it.

59
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:36,805
Bad players shouldn't
even bother practicing.

60
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:39,705
-Oh, you really think
you're better than we are?

61
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,905
-Of course we are,
you little brat!

62
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:44,205
-Enough already.

63
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:47,005
If you're really that confident,
then let's play a game.

64
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:49,005
-A game?

65
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:49,771
-Yeah.

66
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:51,005
A game against each other.

67
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:53,238
And the winning
team gets the field.

68
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:54,971
And they get to
practice whenever

69
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:56,871
they want to from now on.

70
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:58,071
-What should we do?

71
00:04:58,105 --> 00:04:58,938
-Forget it.

72
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:00,105
No way.

73
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:00,938
-We'll just lose.

74
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:01,438
-Fine.

75
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:02,305
You're on.

76
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:02,971
-Huh?

77
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:03,971
What are you saying?

78
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:04,471
No way!

79
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:05,305
-Why not?

80
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,538
What are you so scared of?

81
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,838
-All right, then!

82
00:05:09,871 --> 00:05:11,438
You're on for next Saturday.

83
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:14,438
The winner gets the field.

84
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:16,871
-And if you lose, we're going
to make you guys eat grass

85
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:17,971
off the field.

86
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:18,705
-What?

87
00:05:18,738 --> 00:05:20,805
That's disgusting.

88
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:21,971
-It's a deal.

89
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:26,405
Just make sure that
none of you back out.

90
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:28,005
-Karin, what are we going to do?

91
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:29,838
You got us into a real mes.

92
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,005
-What are we going to do?

93
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:32,571
We're gonna win, that's what.

94
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:36,638
-But if we lose, we'll have
to eat grass off the field.

95
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,971
-Well then, let's just make sure
we win, so we won't have to.

96
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:43,305
-How can we?

97
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:45,905
-By having more team
spirit than those guys!

98
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:49,305
-Team spirit can't
kick a soccer ball.

99
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:53,738
-We've gotta come up with
some sort of plan, guys.

100
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,871
-I know!

101
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:57,871
How 'bout we ask your
brother to play for us?

102
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:58,738
-Huh?

103
00:05:58,771 --> 00:05:59,938
-Yeah.

104
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:02,771
Ichigo's probably better
at soccer than all of us.

105
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:03,905
-That's right!

106
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:05,705
The other team are all
middle school students,

107
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:08,038
so let's get a high school
student to help us win.

108
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:16,438
-No.

109
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:18,205
My brother can't
help us right now.

110
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:20,171
He's away on a trip.

111
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:21,338
-Aw.

112
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:22,071
-Oh, well.

113
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:25,938
-Don't worry.

114
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:28,238
I'll find somebody else
who's really good at soccer.

115
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:29,338
BOY: Someone else?

116
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,538
There is no one else

117
00:06:31,571 --> 00:06:33,205
-But there just has to be.

118
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:54,605
Uh-- It's that kid
from this morning.

119
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:55,671
-Hey, where are you going?

120
00:06:58,438 --> 00:06:58,905
-Hm?

121
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:04,338
-Hi, there.

122
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:05,338
It's me again.

123
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:06,871
You picked up my ball, remember?

124
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:07,738
-Yeah.

125
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:09,471
-Uh, thanks a lot.

126
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:10,505
-No big deal.

127
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:11,005
Really.

128
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:13,171
[beeping]

129
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:16,305
-So, I was wondering,
what school do you go to?

130
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:17,105
-Huh?

131
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:18,371
What are you talking about?

132
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,905
I don't go to any school
should, so just leave me alone.

133
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:23,571
Can't you see that I'm busy?

134
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:26,438
-Hey, do you play
soccer, by any chance?

135
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:27,571
-I don't know.

136
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:29,938
KARIN: Well, we've got
a big game coming up.

137
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,971
Do you want to play with us?

138
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:33,838
-What--?

139
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,705
-Hold on a minute.

140
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:37,071
-What are you doing?

141
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:39,171
-Why are you talking to
that strange guy, Karin?

142
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:39,838
-Yeah.

143
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:40,838
Take a look at him.

144
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:42,171
He bleaches his hair.

145
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:44,738
-You can't put a kid
like that on our team.

146
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:47,305
Who knows what kind
of trouble he's into?

147
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:48,638
-Yeah.

148
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:51,171
He looks just like one of
those juvenile delinquent kids.

149
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,138
-And besides, he
looks way too little

150
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:54,705
to be playing soccer with us.

151
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:56,271
-What did you say?

152
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:58,738
And who are you calling little?

153
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,038
-He didn't mean anything.

154
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:04,871
-Hey.

155
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:05,671
Wait up!

156
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:11,438
Watch this!

00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:24,205

-All right!

161
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:37,205
-Nice kick!

162
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:38,138
-All right!

163
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:39,471
-I've never seen
anything like that.

164
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,138
-That was totally amazing!

165
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:41,638
-Yeah!

166
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:42,138
-Awesome!

167
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:43,071
-Oh, yeah!

168
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,971
-That was so cool!

169
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,871
What's your name?

170
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:49,271
-I'm Toshiro Hitsugaya.

171
00:08:49,305 --> 00:08:50,405
-Toshiro, huh?

172
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:52,505
Wow, that's a pretty cool name.

173
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:54,405
-How do you get your
hair that color, Toshiro?

174
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:55,538
-Yeah.

175
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:57,371
Can you teach me how to
do that to my hair, too?

176
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:58,705
-What's your secret?

177
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,605
I want to learn
to kick like that.

178
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:01,505
-Look.

179
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:02,605
I'm not what you think.

180
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:06,105
[beeping]

181
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:07,705
(THINKING) It's just
a regular Hollow.

182
00:09:12,638 --> 00:09:14,105
-(THINKIGN) That same sensation.

183
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,438
It's back.

184
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:19,171
[beeping]

185
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:21,805
-(THINKING) I'm the
only one nearby.

186
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:22,705
-Hey, Toshiro.

187
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:23,371
Wait.

188
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:24,238
Where are you going?

189
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:25,305
HITSUGAYA: I've gotta run.

190
00:09:25,338 --> 00:09:26,271
-Hey!

191
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:26,971
HITSUGAYA: Sorry.

192
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:29,238
I can't help you.

193
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:30,238
-Hey, wait!

194
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:31,671
Please change your mind!

195
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:32,838
We need you!

196
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:35,138
We practice every day
at the park on the hill.

197
00:09:35,171 --> 00:09:36,405
Please come tomorrow!

198
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:45,371
[laughter]

199
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:47,905
-There isn't enough room
for us to practice here

200
00:09:47,938 --> 00:09:49,771
with all these people around.

201
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:52,838
-Toshiro didn't show
up today, anyway.

202
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:54,171
-Yeah.

203
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:56,405
And there's no way we'll ever
win the game without him.

204
00:09:56,438 --> 00:09:58,238
-Instead of
practicing soccer, we

205
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,971
should start practicing
our grass eating technique.

206
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:02,971
[sigh]

207
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:03,471
-Man.

208
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:07,205
-Huh?

209
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:09,738
-I'm gonna go look
for Toshiro, you guys.

210
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:11,938
-Hey, wait a minute, Karin.

211
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:13,505
-Just keep practicing
while I'm gone.

212
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:27,805
I knew he'd be here.

213
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:29,271
Toshiro!

214
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:31,305
[beeping]

215
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:38,271
-You again, huh?

216
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:38,805
-Yeah.

217
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:39,871
Hey.

218
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,905
Why didn't you come
to soccer practice?

219
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:44,838
-Look, I never said that
I was going to help you.

220
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:47,405
Besides, I really
don't have the time.

221
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,105
-Come on.

222
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:49,471
You're in grade school.

223
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:51,238
What are you are so busy doing
that you don't have the time?

224
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:54,005
-Just go away.

225
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:55,138
-Hey.

226
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,705
Why do you keep coming
here to this same spot?

227
00:10:57,738 --> 00:11:00,338
Do you live nearby,
or something?

228
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:01,005
-Not really.

229
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:04,838
Hm?

230
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:18,538
I like to come here because this
is the best view of the sky.

231
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:19,305
GIRL: Come on.

232
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:22,038
Are you listening, Shiro?

233
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,938
[munching]

234
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:24,971
-Oh!

235
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:27,338
-I told you to stop
calling me Shiro.

236
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:30,605
-When you finally go to the
same grown up school as I do,

237
00:11:30,638 --> 00:11:32,071
I'll use your real name.

238
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,305
-No way.

239
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:34,238
Who'd want to go there?

240
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:45,538
-It brings back a
lot of memories.

241
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,838
-Hm?

242
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:48,338
Memories?

243
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:51,038
How old are you, anyway?

244
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:52,705
-That doesn't concern you.

245
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:55,305
[beeping] Huh?

246
00:11:58,805 --> 00:11:59,605
-No, wait.

247
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:00,605
Don't go over there.

248
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:01,571
-Huh?

249
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:04,671
-It's-- uh-- how
should I put this?

250
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:09,271
I'm sensing something
bad in that direction.

251
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:12,405
(THINKING) Could
it be that she--

252
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:16,238
[beeping]

253
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,371
-(THINKING) Someone
defeated the Hollow.

254
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,738
-What is it, Toshiro?

255
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:21,171
Is something wrong?

256
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:21,971
-No.

257
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:24,805
No, it's nothing at all.

258
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:29,005
-But you are going to be
there tomorrow, right?

259
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:29,505
-Who knows?

260
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,059
-Hey, kick it to me.

261
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:40,792
-Nice stop.

262
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,526
-Thanks.

263
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,759
-Come on, it's my turn.

264
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,226
BOY: Hey, good job.

265
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,292
-Kick it over there.

266
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:47,859
-Practice using the
inside of your foot.

267
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,426
-Captain.

268
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:50,959
Hi!

269
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,992
Are you stalking someone?

270
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:54,992
-No.

271
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:57,492
I'm just curious about
something down there.

272
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,026
-Huh?

273
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,492
Captain.

274
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:04,126
You're interested in a girl
from the world of the living?

275
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:04,692
-No.

276
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:05,726
Of course not.

277
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,626
That's not it.

278
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,059
-Aw, come on, now,
it's all right.

279
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:10,326
You don't have to be bashful.

280
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:10,992
-That's enough.

281
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:12,126
-I understand, sir.

282
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,259
A man gets lonely sometimes.

283
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:15,759
Huh?

284
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:32,259
-It's game time, and
Toshiro's not even here.

285
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,726
-And what's worse, we couldn't
find anyone else, either.

286
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,892
We're screwed.

287
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:37,159
-We sure are.

288
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,692
See, I told ya.

289
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:42,059
Now we're going to have to
eat grass off the field.

290
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:45,159
-Well, maybe they'll
accept an apology from us?

291
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,826
-Stop your whining.

292
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:47,926
We've come this far.

293
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,192
Now let's see it through.

294
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:50,992
[sigh]

295
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:52,726
-What's wrong with you guys?

296
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,192
Come on.

297
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:54,259
Let's go.

298
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,326
Yay!

299
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,659
-Yay.

300
00:13:57,692 --> 00:13:58,992
[whistle]

301
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:06,692
-Huh?

302
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:08,126
-You're doing good, Karin!

303
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:08,659
-Yeah!

304
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:09,492
Just keep going!

305
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:09,992
Go!

306
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,926
[whistle]

307
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,459
-Karin!

308
00:14:17,492 --> 00:14:18,092
Are you OK?

309
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:22,459
-What cheaters.

310
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:24,526
-Those guys are playing dirty.

311
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,759
-What's wrong?

312
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:26,726
You done already?

313
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:31,126
-Yeah, you wish.

314
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,892
This scratch is nothin'.

315
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:33,926
Come on, guys.

316
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:34,926
Let's go.

317
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,426
[shouting]

318
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:44,426
[whistle]

319
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:48,426
-All right!

320
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:50,126
BOY: Nice shot!

321
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,526
Gotta stay focused!

322
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,026
This game isn't over yet!

323
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,126
Come on!

324
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,526
Keep it up!

325
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,859
-Middle school students sure
are strong, aren't they?

326
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:01,459
-I'm afraid we're no
match for them at all.

327
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:02,259
-Nonsense.

328
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:03,592
We can still win this game.

329
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:04,159
-What?

330
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:05,092
We can't win.

331
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:06,759
Not with your leg
hurt like that.

332
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,359
-What are you talking about?

333
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:10,259
I told you that I'm fine.

334
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:10,759
Look.

335
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:15,892
See?

336
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:17,392
What did I tell ya?

337
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,759
-I don't know.

338
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,259
Maybe we should just give up.

You're late.

never even said I was coming?

-Who's the new kid?

strong spiritual energy,

How do you know
about Soul Reapers?

453
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:28,759
-Because my brother's
a Soul Reaper, too.

454
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,092
His name is Ichigo Kurosaki.

-Kurosaki?

456

So then that must mean you're
Ichigo's younger sister.

That makes sense.

don't know where Ichigo is.

he's somewhere working on his

I suppose he's just like you.

No matter what, he sticks
it out until the very end.

Because that's just the
sort of person he is.

Hey, don't worry.
