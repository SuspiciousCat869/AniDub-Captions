[grunting]

3
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:45,154
-He's here, Captain.

4
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:46,921
It's the Ryoka.

5
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:48,187
Captain Kyoraku!

6
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:50,821
KYORAKU: Already?

7
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:54,354
I wasn't expecting
the guy so early.

8
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:55,821
But what the hell?

9
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:58,887
Guess I better head out there
and give him a proper greeting.

10
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,354
-I still don't get
why you won't send me.

11
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,921
Though I'm only your
lieutenant, for a single Ryoka,

12
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:05,954
I'd be more than enough.

13
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:08,087
-Nanao, we've been
over this already.

14
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:12,254
This is a direct order
from old man Yamamoto.

15
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:14,221
He doesn't want anyone
to know we're still

16
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:18,487
having problems with
these pesky Ryoka.

17
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:19,821
Don't look so worried.

18
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:21,221
I'll be fine.

19
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:23,987
It won't take long.

20
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:25,621
I'm just going to
go have some fun.

21
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:31,987
[explosion]

22
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:36,387

[groaning]

24
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:47,754
ENJOJI: Hold it
right there, Ryoka.

25
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:49,654
That's as far as you go.

26
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:51,254
No doubt you've heard of me.

27
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:55,021
I'm the assistant adjutant
and Third Seat of Squad Eight.

28
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:57,987
I am Tatsufuso Enjoji.

29
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,987
I'll bet you're wishing
you'd chosen some other path.

30
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:05,387
[laughs] Surely even you
realize that this road

31
00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:08,054
became a dead end for you
from the second I appeared.

32
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:14,454
[scream]

33
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:18,421
[fighting noises]

34
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:23,187
What's the matter, Ryoka?

35
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:24,521
Are you confused now?

36
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:25,387
Afraid?

37
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,054
Can't even make a move, can you?

38
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:28,021
But don't feel bad.

39
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:29,454
That's a typical
reaction for someone

40
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:31,687
faced for the first time
with the incredible technique

41
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,954
of the great swordsman
Tatsufuso Enjoji.

42
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:38,054
Though for you, it will
also-- [grunt] [scream]

43
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:48,254
CHAD (VOICEOVER): In the
beginning, two blasts a day

44
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:49,621
was my limit.

45
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:52,554
Now I can strike like
that more than five times

46
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:55,421
and still not feel tired.

47
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:57,487
I'll have to remember
to thank Yoruichi

48
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,654
for training me so well.

49
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,987
MAN: Whoa, that was pretty good.

50
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:25,554
-Hm?

51
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:47,687
-My name is Shunsui Kiraku,
Squad Eight captain.

52
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,287
It's a pleasure to meet you.

53
00:04:54,454 --> 00:04:57,087
-So I take it you're
that last guy's captain.

54
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:57,754
-Mhm.

55
00:04:57,787 --> 00:04:59,421
For what it's worth.

56
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:03,354
[laughs] Hm?

57
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:04,754
Oh.

58
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:08,487
Hey, Nanao, enough with
the flower petals already.

59
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:09,287
Hm.

60
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,187
I guess she didn't hear me.

61
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:13,387
Hey, Nanao!

62
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:14,621
It's very nice.

63
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:17,321
But that's another enough
set decoration, all right?

64
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:18,954
I think we get the point.

65
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:21,987
Save some for later,
my sweet Nanao.

66
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:26,387
Lovely, lovely
Na-- [sputter] Ugh.

67
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:36,954
-Sorry, but I don't have time
to stay and watch your routine.

68
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:38,754
Please, just step aside.

69
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:40,054
-Oh, come on?

70
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:42,787
Can't you loosen up a little
and try to have some fun?

71
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:45,954
Life's too short to
take it seriously.

72
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:47,454
-I've asked you nicely.

73
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:49,321
I'm in kind of a hurry.

74
00:05:49,354 --> 00:05:51,487
You seem like a
decent enough guy.

75
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:55,221
So if there's any way to avoid
it, I'd rather not fight you.

76
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:59,021
-[laugh] Then I guess we
have a slight problem,

77
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:01,254
since neither one of us
is anxious for a fight.

78
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:04,454
But of course, I can't just
let you through, either.

79
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:09,187
I don't suppose you'd be
willing to retreat, would you?

80
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:12,221
-I could never do that.

81
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:13,521
-I thought as much.

82
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:15,087
I guess that leaves
us no choice.

83
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:23,421
We'll have to have
a friendly drink.

84
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:24,987
-Huh?

85
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:25,954
-Why not?

86
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:27,587
If you won't
retreat, at least you

87
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,154
can take a break
here for a while.

88
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:34,821
Let me show you a
little hospitality.

89
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:36,087
-No, thanks.

90
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:37,521
-Come on, relax.

91
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:39,154
-It's a rule.

92
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:41,554
Miners are not allowed
to drink any alcohol.

93
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:42,321
-Oh.

94
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:44,354
Well, that's unfortunate.

95
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:47,587
I hate to drink alone.

96
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:49,321
But maybe it's just as well.

97
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:50,921
This whole thing
will be over soon,

98
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:53,221
now that the other captains
are all on the move.

99
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:54,921
Probably, if you were
smart, you'd just--

100
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:56,987
-The other captains?

101
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:58,954
Wait, you mean
Ichigo and the others

102
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:01,654
are being pursued
by captains, too?

103
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,687
-Hm.

104
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:05,554
CHAD: That changes
things, Mr. Kiraku.

105
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:08,087
So I suggest you move, now.

106
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:11,687
-And if I refuse?

107
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:12,687
Mm.

108
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:15,654
-I'll move you! [grunt]

109
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,621
-My, my.

110
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:31,621
-Huh?

111
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:41,054
-I had hoped that we
could avoid all this.

112
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:43,021
But here we are.

113
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:57,854
-[gasp]

114
00:07:57,887 --> 00:08:01,821
[grunting]

115
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:14,587
-You missed again.

116
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:27,854
CHAD (VOICEOVER):
How is he doing this?

117
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:29,221
It's impossible.

118
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:31,754
He deflected my first
blast with one hand.

119
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:35,487
And since then, he's dodged
every one without any effort

120
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:36,721
at all.

121
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:38,221
I know I'm not that weak.

122
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:42,854
But somehow, I haven't even
put a scratch on him yet.

123
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:45,421
I had no trouble dealing
with that last guy.

124
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:48,054
And he called himself
an assistant adjutant,

125
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:50,854
so there should only be two
levels' difference between him

126
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:52,454
and this captain.

127
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:53,387
Just two levels.

128
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:57,087
And yet so very far apart.

129
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,821
Are captains really
that powerful?

130
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:06,254
-So are you ready
to reconsider yet?

131
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:08,654
Surely you can see
that this is futile.

132
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:09,987
You have great skills.

133
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,054
And for a human, your
destructive power

134
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:14,187
is impressive.

135
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,187
But you're never going
to be able to hit me.

136
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:20,554
You're smart enough to realize
how this is going to end up.

137
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:23,721
Why don't you go home
while you still can?

138
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:25,854
-Thanks for the advice.

139
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:27,754
But nothing's going to stop me!

140
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:32,187
-Have it your way.

141
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:47,287
You ought to know,
my friend, there

142
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,454
are two kinds of attacks-- those
that run out of gas completely

143
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,121
when you reach the
point of exhaustion,

144
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:54,421
and those where you can
still push beyond that point,

145
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:56,787
but at the expense
of your life force.

146
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,321
Your attacks are
obviously the latter type.

147
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:05,787
-[grunts]

148
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:20,421
-I'll spare you
the usual insults

149
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,554
and allow you to
withdraw now, gracefully.

150
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,787
You are quite stubborn.

151
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:33,421
What is it that makes
you so unreasonable?

152
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:35,021
What's your purpose?

153
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:39,587
Why did you come here
in the first place?

154
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:43,321
-I've come to save the
life of Rukia Kuchiki.

155
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:46,087
-Oh, come on.

156
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:47,787
You mean Rukia,
the Soul Reaper who

157
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,954
went missing in the world of
the living a few months ago?

158
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:53,654
That's not enough time
for a true friendship.

159
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,521
A relationship like
that can't be worth

160
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,721
risking your life over.

161
00:10:57,754 --> 00:11:03,121
-I can't deny I don't know
very much about Rukia.

162
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:04,654
That's not the point.

163
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:07,154
I might not risk
my life for her,

164
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:10,787
but Ichigo wants
to save her life.

165
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:13,687
And that's all I need to know.

166
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:16,454
What may seem like an
unworthy cause to you

167
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:20,621
is more than enough
reason for me.

168
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:22,987
-Well, I tried.

169
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:24,654
But if you're that
determined, it

170
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:29,687
would be insulting for me
to ask you to back down.

171
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,154
I guess it can't be avoided.

172
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,321
Unfortunately, it
means now I'm going

173
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:37,487
to have to take your life.

174
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:49,954
CHAD (VOICEOVER): Ichigo,
I will defeat him somehow,

175
00:11:49,987 --> 00:11:54,021
I swear-- even if
it costs me my life.

176
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,487
And should I
survive this battle,

177
00:11:56,521 --> 00:12:00,487
I vow I will renew
the pledge I made

178
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:03,487
to you in the same
words that were spoken.

179
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:14,609
[fighting noises]

180
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:19,209
MAN: [laughs] Oh, come
on! [laughs] Oh, oh!

181
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:22,676
[laughs]

182
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,243
-Damn you, why
don't you go down?

183
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:30,943
-This'll finish him. [laughs]

184
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:34,243
[grunting]

185
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:41,843
-Not you again!

186
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,876
I'm out of here, man.

187
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:47,776
-Hey, wait for me!

188
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,776
-You're both dead!

189
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,243
You hear me?

190
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:02,943
-What I don't get is why you
were just standing there, Chad.

191
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:03,743
-Sado.

192
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:05,609
-Yeah, Sado, Chad, whatever.

193
00:13:05,643 --> 00:13:08,143
The point is you're lucky
I came along when I did,

194
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:10,376
or you would've got your
brains bashed out with a rock

195
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:11,776
just now.

196
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:13,176
You're incredibly strong.

197
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,543
So why would you
just stand there

198
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,876
and let those two punks
wail on you like that?

199
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,309
Why the hell didn't
you fight back

200
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:20,009
like that time you saved my ass?

201
00:13:23,976 --> 00:13:27,209
-The thing is, I made a
promise that I would never

202
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:30,243
use my fists for my own sake.

203
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,843
It's a vow I made to abuelo.

204
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:34,209
-A-what?

205
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:36,309
Is that name?

206
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:38,709
-Abuelo means grandfather.

207
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:41,643
His name is Oscar
Joaquin de la Rosa.

208
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:46,576
-Is he Spanish?

209
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:48,209
-Not Spanish.

210
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:50,543
He's actually Mexican.

211
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:53,743
You see, I lived down in
Mexico before I moved here.

212
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:55,109
-Wait.

213
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:56,676
When you and I first met, I
asked you where you were from,

214
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,209
and you said Okinawa.

215
00:13:58,243 --> 00:13:59,009
-Hm.

216
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:00,643
Is that right?

217
00:14:00,676 --> 00:14:01,776
-Damn it.

218
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:02,809
Oh, fine.

219
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,409
If you don't want to
tell me the truth,

220
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,543
you make up whatever
story you want.

221
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:09,843
Just don't expect me to save
your sorry ass next time.

222
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:11,276
-Hm.

223
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,309
-What is that medallion
thing you wear around

224
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:14,909
your neck, anyway?

225
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:17,576
Is it valuable?

226
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:18,509
-Hm?

227
00:14:18,543 --> 00:14:20,309
Oh you mean this.

228
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:21,843
Absolutely.

229
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:25,643
Probably worth
more than my life.

230
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:27,609
-Hm.

231
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:31,809
Looks to me like it's
some kind of foreign coin.

232
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:34,943
Where's it from?

233
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:37,176
-From Mexico.

234
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,476
-Should've figure that.

235
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:40,309
Huh?

236
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:42,576
Hey, whose cell phone?

237
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:46,243
-It must belong to one of
those guys who took off.

238
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,543
Guess the thing to do
is to return it to them.

239
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:49,743
ICHIGO (ON PHONE): Heh.

240
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:51,876
You should throw it in
the river, if you ask me.

241
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:53,309
[crashing]

242
00:14:53,343 --> 00:15:00,643
[beeping]

243
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:03,143
CHAD (VOICEOVER): Both
of my stories were true.

244
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:04,809
I was born in Okinawa.

245
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:07,509
And I lived for a while in
Mexico before I came here.

246
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:14,976
I lost my parents
when I was young.

247
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:18,709
And I didn't have any other
relatives to take me in.

248
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:21,976
So I ended up with
my abuelo in Mexico.

249
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:23,309
I was just eight years old.

250
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:33,909
-Yasutora!

251
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:38,509
CHAD (VOICEOVER):
But back then, I

252
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:41,976
was a rotten kid, completely
spoiled and always angry.

253
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,143
I relied on my size.

254
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,843
And if anyone so much
as looked at me wrong,

255
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:47,043
I punched them out.

256
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:58,543
The only one who ever even tried
to keep me in line was Abuelo.

257
00:15:58,576 --> 00:16:02,143
But I was such a jerk back
then-- a hopeless case.

258
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:13,409
And then came that fateful day
when I was so utterly careless.

259
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:20,876
Huh?

260
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:26,343
[grunting]

261
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:27,843
[crash]

262
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:39,809
CHAD (VOICEOVER): These
ropes are awfully thick.

263
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:42,876
I don't think I can
break out of this.

264
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:46,576
-This is the end for Sado,
tough guy in middle school.

265
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,109
So, you scared now?

266
00:16:48,143 --> 00:16:52,343
You're not going to start
pissing yourself, are you?

267
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:54,376
-I don't have to
go at the moment.

268
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:57,243
I guess you just aren't
quite scary enough.

269
00:16:57,276 --> 00:16:58,676
Sorry, guys.

270
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:00,309
-[laugh] Aw, man.

271
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:10,376
Well, then, in that case,
I'll just take this.

272
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:11,743
Now what did you say?

273
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:14,843
Something about this being
worth more than your life.

274
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:16,643
Then if I take it
away from you, you

275
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:18,943
might as well be dead, right?

276
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:22,609
So then die, loser.

277
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,943
-We've got to now!

278
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:29,809
-[gasps]

279
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:34,643
[grunting]

280
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:37,143
-Do what you will.

281
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:41,076
[grunting]

282
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:47,543
[gasping]

283
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:09,376
-Mijo, you were given a strong
body and fists for a reason.

284
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:12,609
But you must learn for
yourself what that reason is.

285
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:14,676
This amulet will
guide you and help

286
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:16,276
you to learn their purpose.

287
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:22,976
CHAD (VOICEOVER):
Thanks to Abuelo,

288
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:25,576
I eventually grew up
to be a decent person.

289
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,543
I could thank him until
my voice failed me.

290
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:31,976
And still, it would
never be enough.

291
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:38,809
[grunting]

292
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:40,043
-Don't be stupid.

293
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:41,309
Give it up.

294
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:46,043
-[together] Huh?

295
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:50,776
-What do you know?

296
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:52,109
-Huh?

297
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:53,209
-What the hell?

298
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:54,009
-Oh, great.

299
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:56,209
That damn Ichigo again.

300
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:57,243
-Get away from him!

301
00:18:57,276 --> 00:18:59,043
What do you think you're doing?

302
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:01,909
-You got a lot of never going
through the boss's pockets.

303
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:03,543
-Ah, here it is.

304
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:07,709
-Yo, Weasel, are you all right?

305
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:09,376
-Weasel?

306
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,509
-Damn it.

307
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:12,309
Didn't I tell you guys
never to call me that.

308
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:13,976
You're always supposed
to call me boss!

309
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:14,976
ICHIGO: Shut up, Weasel!

310
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,176
Oh, hello.

311
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,243
Yes.

312
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,476
I'd like to request
an ambulance, please?

313
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,176
-What?

314
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:24,443
Calling an ambulance?

315
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:26,476
-You think you're
getting pal Sado out

316
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:28,409
of here without even
fighting us first?

317
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:29,109
Ha!

318
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:30,409
You can forget about it.

319
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:32,543
-In fact, send a few down
to the end of Second Street,

320
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:34,043
right under the bridge.

321
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:35,243
How many?

322
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:39,243
One, two, three, four, five.

323
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:40,743
Yeah, five.

324
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:45,543
[shouting]

325
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:47,643
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
I've got an idea, Chad.

326
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:49,443
How about if you
just stay the way

327
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:52,476
you are and never throw
a punch for yourself.

328
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:55,576
Instead, throw those
punches for me.

329
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:57,676
And I'll throw my
punches for you.

330
00:19:57,709 --> 00:20:00,209
If there's ever anything so
important you'd protect it

331
00:20:00,243 --> 00:20:04,743
with your life, I'll protect
it with mine as well.

332
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:06,143
What do you say?

333
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,343
CHAD (VOICEOVER): Sure.

334
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:14,343
Yes, Ichigo.

335
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:15,309
I promised.

336
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:17,809
And that's why I
know I can't lose.

337
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:50,543
ABUELO (VOICEOVER): But
you must learn for yourself

338
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:51,476
what that reason is.

339
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:53,376
This amulet will
guide you and help

340
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:55,076
you to learn their purpose.

341
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:16,243
-[shout] [gasp]

342
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:21,576
-I'm sorry.

343
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:24,309
[gasping]

344
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:49,320
[theme music]

345
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:52,575
GIRL: Kenny, it looks like
one of your bells fell off.

346
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:53,575
-Oh yeah?

347
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:54,542
Hang on a sec.

348
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:55,542
I'll it back on.

349
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,009
-Did you do your
hair all by yourself?

350
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,442
-A man's got to look good.

351
00:22:58,475 --> 00:22:59,775
GIRL: Kenny, you're so talented.

352
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:01,042
KENPACHI: Want me
to do you hair, too?

353
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,242
ICHIGO: No, no thank you.

354
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:03,909
-It'll make you look cooler.

355
00:23:03,942 --> 00:23:05,342
ICHIGO: You think so?
