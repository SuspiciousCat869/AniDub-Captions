00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:52,680
-(IN HEAD) What's this?

3
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:54,414
Her spiritual pressure
is out of control.

4
00:01:57,414 --> 00:01:59,180
Ran'Tao.

5
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:00,447
Hang on.

6
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,314
I think I can use the artifact
to remove the unstable spirit

7
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:04,414
energy inside you.

8
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:27,414
I-- I've reached my limit.

9
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,947
We're not safe here.

10
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,080
We'd better go.

11
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:32,614
KARIYA: You think you
can just walk away?

12
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,014
Now it's your life that's about
to come to an end instead.

13
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:03,047
-Having problems Uryu?

14
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,547
-Ichigo.

15
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,014
-You again.

16
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:20,047
-Uryu, are you all right?

17
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,614
-Yeah.

18
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:21,514
Don't worry about me.

19
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:23,414
I can take care of myself.

20
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:24,947
-And Ran'Tao.

21
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,147
You OK?

22
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,447
-Yes, I think I'm all right.

23
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,214
-Both of you, get to
some place safe now.

24
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:35,247
I'm gonna take care of
Kariya once and for all.

25
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,014
-Given my condition, I suppose
that's out only option.

26
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:39,514
-Yeah.

27
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:47,714
Bankai!

28
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,647
Come back here!

29
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,247
Getsuga Tensho!

30
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:14,980
-Let me help you.

31
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,114
-Thank you.

32
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:17,214
-Oh.

33
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:19,014
There you are Uryu.

34
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,180
-Hm?

35
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:21,380
Orihime?

36
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:23,114
-I'm so glad you're safe.

37
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:27,080
I have to admit, I was
worried about you, Uryu.

38
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:28,014
-Hey, wait.

39
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:30,980
Where's your artifact, Uryu?

40
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,947
-I'm afraid it disintegrated.

41
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,547
-It disintegrated?

42
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,447
But I thought you said if
anything went wrong with it,

43
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,414
it would mean a huge explosion.

44
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,514
-That's true, but
then I figured out

45
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:46,347
that my best chance
was to only use

46
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,680
the artifact to amplify reishi.

47
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:52,114
So as a result, there
was no explosion

48
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:55,347
when I reached my limit
because it was already empty.

49
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,080
-Yes, that makes sense.

50
00:05:57,114 --> 00:05:58,080
-You understand that?

51
00:05:58,114 --> 00:05:59,980
-Not a word of it.

52
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:01,047
-Stop it.

53
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,614
The only thing that matter
is that Uryu is safe.

54
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:04,980
But listen, Uryu, please!

55
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:08,114
You have to stop going off
on your own all the time.

56
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:10,147
How can we possibly help
you when you do that?

57
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,414
-I suppose you're right.

58
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,080
-Is everyone all right?

59
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:17,014
-Yes, we're OK.

60
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:18,247
-Where is Ichigo?

61
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,047
-He's fighting Kariya.

62
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,547
-Wha?

63
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,014
-Captain, sir.

64
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,947
-Yes.

65
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,180
I know, Lieutenant.

66
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:32,614
I am not about to let Ichigo
fight this battle on his own.

67
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:35,980
We're going too.

68
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:36,647
-Captain.

69
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,514
Wait.

70
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:38,314
Hm?

71
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:40,280
And who are you?

72
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:43,714
URYU: Uh, this is
Ran'Tao, Captain.

73
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:45,214
-You're Ran'Tao?

74
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,647
The engineer who was exiled?

75
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,980
-You're the one who
originally created the Bounts.

76
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:53,314
-That's right.

77
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,614
And you're the caption
of Squad 10, aren't you?

78
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:57,614
-Why do you ask?

79
00:06:57,647 --> 00:07:01,314
-It's not my place, but
if you don't act now,

80
00:07:01,347 --> 00:07:04,314
I fear the Seireitei is doomed.

81
00:07:04,347 --> 00:07:07,314
-What are you talking about?

82
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:10,080
-I assume you already know that
Kariya has absorbed the Jokai

83
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:12,314
Crest into his body.

84
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:13,947
-Yes.

85
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,480
And we're aware of how
powerful the Jokai Crest is.

86
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:19,047
But our research also
revealed that Kariya's still

87
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,480
going to need more time before
he can use its full power.

88
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:25,514
In other words, we believe
that he is most likely

89
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:28,047
trying to buy himself
some more time.

90
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,014
-Yes.

91
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:29,947
I'm sure you're right.

92
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,680
Unfortunately, the
Jokai Crest power he has

93
00:07:32,714 --> 00:07:34,514
isn't the main problem now.

94
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:36,680
There's a much
greater danger here.

95
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:39,280
-Greater than the Jokai Crest?

96
00:07:39,314 --> 00:07:43,247
-Jokai is the general term for
giant reishi-generating devices

97
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,480
that were once used
in the Soul Society.

98
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:49,014
At one time, there were
probably several dozen

99
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:51,180
of these devices
in the Seireitei.

100
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,247
One day during a
series of experiments,

101
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,614
one of the Jokai Crests
suddenly went out of control.

102
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,680
When it exploded, the blast
annihilated almost 1/10

103
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:01,147
of the Seireitei.

104
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,147
Central 46 was so
alarmed by the accident

105
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,480
that they took immediate
steps to seal away

106
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:12,080
the rest of the
Jokai Crests forever.

107
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,447
-One Jokai Crest was
bad enough, but this?

108
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,480
-If I'm right, then we cannot
allow Kariya to detonate

109
00:08:27,514 --> 00:08:31,080
the Jokai Crest that he's
already absorbed into his body,

110
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:34,014
because that explosion will
surely set off the other Jokai

111
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:39,214
Crests, and I'm certain that's
what Kariya is planning.

112
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:41,947
If all of the Jokai Crests
were to explode at once,

113
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,014
their destructive force
would be unfathomable.

114
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:46,947
[screaming]

115
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,514
-Why does the Soul Society keep
such horrible and frightening

116
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:50,514
things around?

117
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:52,414
-That's because horrible
and frightening things

118
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,314
are always less horrible
and frightening when

119
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:55,980
they're kept out in the open.

120
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:57,480
-I think I get it.

121
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:59,447
Like hiding your dirty
clothes under your bed.

122
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,114
-Uh, not exactly.

123
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:04,114
-So, what should we do?

124
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:05,547
-At this point,
our only option is

125
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,580
to use Kido to seal away
all the Jokai Crests.

126
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:12,147
The original seals
will be weakened now

127
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,480
after so many years.

128
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:16,980
They'll be vulnerable
to Kariya's explosion.

129
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:17,647
-Captain.

130
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,580
-Let's do it.

131
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:21,080
We'll begin resealing
them immediately.

132
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:23,080
Do you know where the other
Jokai Crests are located?

133
00:09:26,214 --> 00:09:26,547
-In here.

134
00:09:32,047 --> 00:09:33,447
I'll be all right.

135
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
It's just like I told you.

136
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:37,580
I've been fighting with my
spiritual pressure sealed

137
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:39,547
inside and overextended myself.

138
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,514
Now I've reached the
limit of my endurance.

139
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:48,480
I'm afraid that I must
leave the rest to you.

140
00:09:51,614 --> 00:09:52,647
-Lieutenant.

141
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,014
Let's go.

142
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:54,980
-Yes sir.

143
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:56,380
-What about the rest of you?

144
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:58,147
-We're going to help Ichigo.

145
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,680
That's the least we can do.

146
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:03,680
He's out there
fighting somewhere,

147
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:06,580
and we can't just
let him do it alone.

148
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:08,580
There's a possibility
that he's been injured,

149
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:11,447
and I have to be there
to help heal his wounds.

150
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,147
-Easy, Orihime.

151
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,314
-Uryu, let me carry Ran'Tao.

152
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:19,947
We'll take her to a safe place,
and then we'll find Ichigo.

153
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,647
-All right.

154
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,580
Thanks, Chad.

155
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:24,180
-All right!

156
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:27,380
Now that that's finally
decided, let's get going!

157
00:10:27,414 --> 00:10:29,980
-I can't wait until this
whole nightmare's over.

158
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:30,547
-Right.

159
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,980
Thank goodness.

160
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:33,614
-All right, everyone.

161
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:35,080
Let's get going.

162
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:36,180
Ichigo needs us.

163
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,080
-I must commend you for
being able to keep up with me

164
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:52,080
as long as you have.

165
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,947
-It's like I said, I intend
to settle this thing now.

166
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,014
-Tell me, do you know what
kind of a place this is?

167
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:05,447
-Yeah.

168
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,114
You could say that.

169
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:08,414
I'm very familiar
with this place.

170
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,514
-It's just perfect, isn't it?

171
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,214
For settling
something like this.

172
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:16,514
-I agree.

173
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,647
-Flash and burst.

174
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,347
Nijigasume!

175
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,547
-Aren't you--

176
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:10,804
UKITAKE: What?

177
00:12:10,837 --> 00:12:14,837
-Ron'Ta gave me this map to
lead us to all the Jokai Crests.

178
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:15,804
-My, my.

179
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:17,637
Who would've thought
that such things still

180
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,937
existed here in the Seireitei?

181
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:22,637
Well, it looks like we stayed
up all night for nothing.

182
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:23,804
-Captain, please.

183
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:26,037
You must take this
situation seriously.

184
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:27,037
-Hm.

185
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:28,737
-Does the Head Captain know?

186
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:30,971
-I sent Rangiku to inform him.

187
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:34,171
We should be receiving
his orders shortly.

188
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:35,871
-One thing's for certain.

189
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:38,837
To re-seal so many Jokai
Crests all at once,

190
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:41,704
we're going to need every
captain, lieutenant, as well

191
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:44,537
as every able seated
officer we can mobilize.

192
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:47,071
-What do we do about Kariya?

193
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:49,504
-Ichigo Kurosaki has
gone off to engage him.

194
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:57,071
RANGIKU: The following is an
urgent message to all captains,

195
00:12:57,104 --> 00:13:00,904
lieutenants, and squad members
of the 13 Court Guard Squads.

196
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:03,604
The Bounts' plan is to detonate
ancient generators known

197
00:13:03,637 --> 00:13:05,104
as Jokai.

198
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:08,137
We have confirmed the existence
of a large number of them.

199
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:11,737
They must be sealed
away immediately.

200
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:15,437
A level one precautionary
warning is hereby in effect.

201
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:17,871
Everyone is to proceed
to a Jokai Crest.

202
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:20,171
The hell butterflies
will lead you there.

203
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:27,071
-You must go too, lieutenant.

204
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:29,704
Find a Jokai Crest and
assist with sealing it.

205
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:30,571
-Yes, sir.

206
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:32,504
-Given the grave
nature of this threat,

207
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:36,137
I too must get involved and
direct the sealing process.

208
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:39,071
Captain Komamura,
you will assist me.

209
00:13:39,104 --> 00:13:40,104
-Yes, Head Captain.

210
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:41,104
-If you'll excuse me.

211
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:47,137
MAN: What's going on
up on the Sogyoku hill?

212
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:48,837
MAN: A big fight's
about to start.

213
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,871
I hear every Soul Reaper in the
Seireitei has been mobilized.

214
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:52,671
MAN: Yeah.

215
00:13:52,704 --> 00:13:54,737
And that Ichigo
Kurosaki is taking

216
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:56,504
on the leader of of the Bounts.

217
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,704
MAN: I guess that means we
should probably clear out.

218
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,904
Let's ask Captain
Kuchiki for instructions.

219
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:01,537
MAN: Good idea.

220
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:09,004
-Ichigo.

221
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:15,171
-Well, well.

222
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:15,771
You're still alive.

223
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,871
-Master Kariya.

224
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:28,471
Before I proceed, there's
something I need to ask you.

225
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:30,537
-What is that?

226
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:33,871
-What happened to
Koga and the others?

227
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:36,471
-They died.

228
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:37,604
-All of them?

229
00:14:37,637 --> 00:14:38,737
-Yes.

230
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:40,137
They all died.

231
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:44,104
-Oh.

232
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:46,871
Is that so?

233
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:47,971
-Hey!

234
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:48,837
Why are you doing this?

235
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:00,837
Stop this!

236
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:07,104
I said stop it!

237
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:18,504
-I can't stop.

238
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:19,937
-Why are you even here?

239
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,137
You're not in any
shape to fight.

240
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:35,471
-What do you think
you're doing, Ichinose?

241
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:42,604
-Before, if you told me
to destroy the Seireitei,

242
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:45,671
I would have had no
choice but to obey you.

243
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:48,704
I abandoned this place
long ago, and I would not

244
00:15:48,737 --> 00:15:51,071
mind seeing it all disappear.

245
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:52,104
At least that's what I thought.

246
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:57,871
When I looked at
you, I thought I

247
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:02,637
was reminded of the captain
I once revered and respected.

248
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:05,071
That's the reason why
I fought by your side

249
00:16:05,104 --> 00:16:07,604
in the first place.

250
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:09,737
But--

251
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:11,904
Why do you insist on
standing in our way

252
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,471
when we've come here to see that
justice is finally delivered?

253
00:16:17,204 --> 00:16:19,637
-Are you an idiot?

254
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:23,071
Are you sure that justice
is your goal, Ichinose?

255
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:26,171
Or is it just revenge
that you're after?

256
00:16:26,204 --> 00:16:28,504
-You don't understand!

257
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:30,104
-Come on, then!

258
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:31,604
-Kenpachi Zaraki!

259
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:35,971
[shout] It was during
my battle with Kenpachi

260
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:37,737
that I remembered
something I had forgotten.

261
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:46,137
Back then, I wanted
to change things.

262
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,771
I wanted to make the 13 Court
Guard Squads into something

263
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:51,137
better.

264
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:54,737
That was my desire.

265
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:57,504
My captain and I had
the same beliefs.

266
00:16:57,537 --> 00:16:59,871
That's why I worked
so hard by his side,

267
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:02,837
and why I felt my ideals
would never change,

268
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,571
even if he wasn't there anymore.

269
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:11,037
But when he was killed, the
sheer emptiness of his death

270
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,671
changed my ideals into
a desire for revenge.

271
00:17:19,437 --> 00:17:21,871
So tell me, you
have the power now

272
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:24,704
to change the Soul
Society, Kariya.

273
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:28,071
If you will use that power
to rebuild the Seireitei,

274
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,837
to make it the way it should be.

275
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:35,971
If you promise this, I shall
kneel before you once more.

276
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:41,071
But, if not, if you choose
to use your power only

277
00:17:41,104 --> 00:17:48,071
for destruction and revenge,
then I will stop you.

278
00:17:48,104 --> 00:17:50,937
Nothing can be
born of vengeance.

279
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:53,671
Now that Koga and all
the others are dead,

280
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:57,571
the only one left who
can stop you is me.

281
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:01,504
So what's it gonna be?

282
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:07,971
-Ichinose, I'm afraid
that's impossible.

283
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:12,571
-Don't try it!

284
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,971
-You don't have sufficient
power to stop me.

285
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:25,671
[gasping]

286
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,937
-But I do appreciate your help.

287
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:29,604
Thanks to your
interference, I've

288
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:32,404
had just enough time for
the Jokai Crest's full power

289
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:34,671
to spread throughout
my entire body.

290
00:18:59,171 --> 00:18:59,637
-Kariya!

291
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:06,604
[scream]

292
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:13,504
-Hey, Kariya!

293
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:16,604
What the hell have you done,
you backstabbing monster?

294
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:18,171
-What are you talking about?

295
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:20,137
-That man was your comrade.

296
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:22,104
He served faithfully
by your side,

297
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:24,071
and that's the
way you repay him?

298
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:25,771
-What difference does that make?

299
00:19:25,804 --> 00:19:28,971
-What difference?

300
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:31,004
-Ichinose was your enemy.

301
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:34,437
It makes no sense to me
that you should pity him.

302
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:36,437
-Well, I don't pity him.

303
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:38,537
But I can never forgive
you for ruthlessly

304
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:42,737
murdering one of
your own comrades.

305
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:44,871
-To tell you the truth, I
never thought of any of them

306
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:47,071
as my actual comrades.

307
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,071
They were all just
pawns for me to use

308
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,671
until my goals were achieved.

309
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:53,171
-Bastard!

310
00:19:56,604 --> 00:19:58,771
-In any case, it's time
to settle this with you

311
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:00,471
once and for all.

312
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:04,971
Zeige deke!

313
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:05,571
Now, Messer!

314
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:18,671
-What the hell's this?

315
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:30,904
-What's happening?

316
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:32,871
-I've never felt wind like that.

317
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,837
And I can sense Kariya's
spiritual pressure

318
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:37,004
starting to rise rapidly, too.

319
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:38,471
-Let's hurry up!

320
00:20:49,837 --> 00:20:52,037
-I didn't think I would
need to show you my Doll,

321
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:53,571
but it seems I'm
almost out of time.

322
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:02,004
Allow me to introduce
you to my Doll, Messer.

323
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:06,837
Now you'll find you can no
longer come anywhere near me.

324
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:08,504
-Arrogant to the very end.

325
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:21,571
-Yah!

326
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:30,904
-Hey.

327
00:21:30,937 --> 00:21:33,837
Where are you going?

328
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:35,571
-Renji.

329
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:37,104
Why are you here?

330
00:21:37,137 --> 00:21:38,671
-I hadn't heard
from the captain,

331
00:21:38,704 --> 00:21:41,604
so I decided to come
here and look for him.

332
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:44,604
What's going on, Rukia?

333
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,071
-Renji.

334
00:21:47,104 --> 00:21:48,571
I need a favor.

335
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:49,071
-Yeah?

336
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:51,171
What's that?

337
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:54,037
-I need you to take me--
take me to the Sogyoku.

338
00:21:58,704 --> 00:21:59,171
-Why, Rukia?

KIRAYA: Soon.

341
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,908
Soon I'll be filled with the
power of the Jokai Crest,

342
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:53,308
and I will wipe the
Seireitei from this world.

343
00:23:53,341 --> 00:23:56,341
There's nothing anyone
can do to stop me anymore.

344
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,908
ICHIGO: Kariya, I'm
going to stop you.

345
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:02,641
I won't let you destroy
the Soul Society!

Is?

This the place?

-Yeah.

352

We were told that Ichigo and the
others would be resting here.

353

-Wow, those other guys
sure do have it rough.

354
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:27,275
I think I'll use
my soothing powers.

00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:41,008
Huh?

Oh, not again!
