We've learned many important
things about this fortress.

We've analyzed the Intel
collected by Don Kanonji, who's

out can be disconcerting.

Anyway, I'm tied up
with other things

95
00:05:57,945 --> 00:06:00,094
right now, so I've asked
Tessai to brief you

on the mission for me.

97
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:02,309
And thanks.

98

It's been a huge
help having you all

a team like this.

You don't understand
how much help,

101
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:09,827
but it lets me concentrate
on other priorities.

102

So, keep up the good work,
and I'll be in judge later.

-Other priorities my ass.

104
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:17,144
-While the boss is
tied up, I'll be

105
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:20,903
in charge of the operation
I'm about to explain to you.

106
00:06:20,937 --> 00:06:22,615
This entire
structure is composed

107
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,830
of combined Hollows that
have joined together

108
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:27,684
under the hollows that
form the central nucleus.

109
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:30,436
However, in their natural
state, these combined Hollows

110
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:32,248
are not very powerful.

111
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:33,927
As a result, it's
taking time for them

112
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,410
to build up what
power they do have.

113
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:38,391
-I'm afraid I'm not
following you very well.

114
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:39,733
Can you repeat that?

115
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:42,116
-It's not important that you
understand everything he said.

116
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,365
The point is that the
combined Hollow fortress will

117
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,446
be complete within the
next several hours,

118
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,393
and if that happens, we
won't be strong enough

119
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:49,500
to overcome their power.

120
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,951
-How are we going
to beat them, then?

121
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:54,468
-You'll take care of that with
the power of your friendship,

122
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:55,609
of course.

123
00:06:55,643 --> 00:06:56,113
-Uh.

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,281
-The power of our friendship?

125
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:02,927
Really?

126
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,168
-All right, count me in.

127
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:05,645
-What?

128
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:07,826
-Right now, Ichigo and
the others aren't here,

129
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:09,170
so I think we have to do it.

130
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:10,982
There are no other options.

131

-Uh, Tatsuki?

132
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,399
You feeling all right?

133
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,890
-I'm forced to recharge
from a home outlet.

134
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:24,911
How demeaning is
that for a superhero?

135
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,220
Ah!

136
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:27,831
I was just in the
middle of something.

137
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,047
You can't just come
busting in here.

138
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,926
-Uh.

139
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,142
-What's the problem?

140
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:36,491
-That body that you're using.

141
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:38,102
It belongs to Ichigo, right?

142
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:41,559
-Well, I really, uh--

143
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:42,835
-You don't have to answer.

144
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:47,399
It'd be better if
you didn't lie to me.

145
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,387
I was trying to keep an eye
on him for a while, but he--

146
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:58,241
-It's none of your business.

147
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,263
-We don't have any
choice except to let

148
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:10,190
him take care of Orihime, but
the truth is, he's an idiot.

149
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,506
At this point, I've
done everything I can.

150
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,117
-About what?

151
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,291
-I'm telling you, though.

152
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:19,789
I won't be satisfied
with the situation

153
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:22,810
until I find a way to get
rid of all this anger.

154
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:25,126
He's so damn frustrating!

155

-Ah.

156
00:08:26,536 --> 00:08:28,348
Finally I see what's
happening here.

157
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,933
How long have you been out here?

158
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:37,277
I thought you were in the house.

159
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,686
-It was kind of
cramped upstairs.

160
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,169
I was more comfortable
coming outside to read.

And I'm not alone.

So, tell me something.

164
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,857
Why did you agree to
become a Karakuraizer?

165
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:56,341
-Truthfully, it wasn't
because I wanted to.

166
00:08:56,374 --> 00:09:00,805
-Wah, ha ha ha ha ha!

167
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,121
KEIGO: A friend of mine told
me Don Kanonji was filming

168
00:09:03,155 --> 00:09:04,867
on location for the
first time in a while,

169
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,417
so I went to have a look.

170
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,075
I went to his dressing room
to ask for an autograph.

171
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,560
Kisuke was there, talking to
him in private, when suddenly,

172
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:16,346
one of those strange monsters
appeared in the rafters.

173
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:17,285
I tried to warn him.

174
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:19,165
Above you, sir!

175
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:19,669
-Hm?

176
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:23,763
Wah!

177
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:24,502
Super Spirit Cane!

178
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:30,241
KEIGO: Kanonji
defeated the monster.

179
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:32,289
Then he realized that
I'd been able to see it,

180
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,799
and he said to me--

181
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:37,189
-You don't realize it, boy,
but you possess a superb power.

182
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:38,666
What's your name?

183
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,646
-In the end, I
became a Karakuraizer

184
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:43,700
without even knowing
how it happened really.

185
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:44,674
-Amazing.

186
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:46,318
I mean, your story's
just like mine.

187
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,735
-I didn't wanna be the
only one this happened to,

188
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,320
so I tried to get my friend
Mizuiro involved as well,

189
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:52,662
but he wouldn't hear of it.

190
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:54,207
-I don't want anything
to do with it.

191
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,884
Count me out, Keigo.

192
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:58,099
KEIGO: He got away from
me as fast as he could.

193
00:09:58,134 --> 00:10:01,557
That's why Chizuru
came in his place.

194
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,202
-I feel for ya, buddy.

195
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,719
-Look, man, I don't
need your pity.

196
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:08,706
Just do something
about it, will ya?

197
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,552
-Hello, everyone.

198
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:11,391
What's wrong?

199
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:12,398
Is something the matter?

200
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:13,875
-What's the matter?

201
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:16,090
Having you pop up in our
faces like that just gave us

202
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:17,601
a heart attack, that's all.

203
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:19,547
-Well, how very rude of you.

204
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:21,293
But that's a side issue, really.

205
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:25,354
I need to speak to everyone, but
I can't find Beast or Erotic.

206
00:10:25,387 --> 00:10:27,469
-You can stop looking.
we're right over here.

207
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,241
-Heh, heh.

208
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:29,751
We were out picking flowers.

209
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:32,503
-In the bathroom, huh?

210
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:33,175
-Wise ass.

211
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,417
-Sorry about that.

212
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,847
-Very good.

213
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,163
Now we have everyone assembled
here except for Spirit,

214
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:44,418
who is continuing his
reconnaissance duties.

215
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:46,601
We've just completed
an extensive analysis

216
00:10:46,634 --> 00:10:48,547
of the combination
Hollow fortress.

217
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,192
It's weak point is
the single Hollow

218
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:52,944
that forms the central
nucleus of the whole.

219
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:55,595
We want your team to
sneak inside the fortress

220
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,576
to destroy that single Hollow.

221
00:10:57,609 --> 00:10:59,859
-Assuming we're even
able to sneak in there.

222
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,241
-That's where the coordinated
teamwork with your friends

223
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:02,946
comes in.

224
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,625
-Of course, obviously.

225
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:06,672
But on the other hand,
we could use your help

226
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:08,786
in coming up with a
plan to get inside.

227
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:10,767
-That won't be possible.

228
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,116
Unfortunately, the
boss, Jinta, and myself

229
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,761
are tied up with
other priorities

230
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:16,640
that demand attention.

231
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,057
However, we're going to
assign Ururu to join you,

232
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:20,836
and she should be
quite a bit of help.

233
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,361
-I promise you I'll do my best.

234
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:24,897
-Oh, whoopie.

235
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,925
ALL: Karauraizer!

236
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:36,297
DON KANONJI: Karakuraizer!

237
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:38,049
-Career change!

238
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:57,080
[roar]

239
00:11:57,114 --> 00:12:00,369
-So the bad spirits
have appeared!

240
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:01,074
Riser Cannonball!

241
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,098
Goodbye!

242
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:16,648
Ha ha ha ha ha!

243
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:19,702
-I should point out, the main
feature of Spirit's suit design

244
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:22,656
is the mask, which showcases
his natural facial hair.

245
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,301
-Shouldn't you be
paying more attention

246
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:27,188
to the battle related features?

247
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:29,771
-Because of this mask, the
subject's spirit energy

248
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:32,827
intensifies his striking power
when he goes into battle.

249
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,799
-You're kidding, right?

250
00:12:36,552 --> 00:12:37,492
[gasp]

251
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:38,330
-How rude.

252
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:39,337
They should have been destroyed.

253
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:52,999
-Great work, Tiny Devil.

254
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:55,113
You're showing a lot of style
in your attack technique.

255
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,042
Right!

256
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,055
Tiny Devil and I will
handle things on this end.

257
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:08,841
The rest of you need to
sneak into that fortress.

258
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:09,882
-Let's go.

259
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,835
-Guess this isn't
open for discussion?

260
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:14,346
-We're outta here!

261
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:15,554
-Wah!

262
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,340
[screaming]

263
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,441
-So far, so good.

264
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:26,227
-Well, we should
probably go inside.

265
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:28,073
-We're finally about
to go into battle!

266
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,450
I'm so excited!

267
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:30,490
-What is your problem?

268
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,470
Have you been loading
up o sugar again?

269
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:37,170
[roar]

270
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:37,975
-Ah!

271
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:39,418
Here's the welcoming party.

272
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,761
-Forget about these idiots.

273
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:42,540
Just leave 'em to me.

274
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:44,017
[shout]

275
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,267
-Now you've got me
in a really bad mood!

276
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,253
I'm open for business, starting
with those who want to die!

277
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:54,824
-See that?

278
00:13:54,858 --> 00:13:57,174
She's an ogre.

279
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,281
-Don't freak out, buddy.

280
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:01,538
Everything's going to be fine.

281
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:03,819
Hate to bring this up, but
can these two guys fight?

282
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:04,357
Huh?

283
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,297
[beeping]

284
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,840
TESSAI (OVER WATCH):
They'll be fine.

285
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:08,989
Keigo has a body
enchancing mechanism

286
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:11,607
that takes advantage of
his ability to run away.

287
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,687
And we've given
Chizuru a special power

288
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,937
that's tailored to her
particular talents, which

289
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,420
will be revealed at
the appropriate time.

290
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:22,649
-Will either of them
really be any help?

291
00:14:22,683 --> 00:14:23,354
-Wah!

292
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:24,260
-Don't hide behind me!

293
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:30,000
-Karakuraizer, we'll
take care of things here.

294
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:32,182
You need to get yourself
to the core of the fortress

295
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:33,591
and attack the nucleus.

296
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,162
-Really?

297
00:14:34,196 --> 00:14:35,203
Are you sure?

298
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:36,512
TESSAI (OVER RADIO):
She's right, Kon.

299
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:38,961
Your Riser Beam is strong
enough to destroy the Hollow

300
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:40,573
at the central nucleus
of the fortress.

301
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:42,855
As a matter of fact, it's
the only thing strong enough

302
00:14:42,888 --> 00:14:44,131
to do the job.

303
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:45,204
-Come on.

304
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:47,017
You waited until
now to tell me that?

305
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:48,058
Are you nuts?

306
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:50,575
I'm mentally unprepared
for this assignment.

307
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:51,918
-Stop babbling and get moving.

308
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:57,154
-Heh, heh.

309
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,798
You dodged that pretty well.

310
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,718
Not bad for a lowly human.

311
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:03,766
-Who are you, anyway?

312
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,149
-I'm an Arrancar, with
powers given to me

313
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:08,197
by my creator, Lord Aizen.

314
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,680
-Are you the person in
charge of this fortress?

315
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:12,056
-Hmph.

316
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,681
Let's just say I'm going to
stop you from going any further.

317
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,159
CHIZURU: Boobalicious!

318
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:19,642
[scream]

319
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:20,615
-How impertinent!

320
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:28,839
-Here's what's going on.

321
00:15:28,872 --> 00:15:31,390
Erotic's suit is equipped
with a hyper-erotic mode that

322
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:33,874
responds to and
augments her instincts.

323
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:36,827
When that mode is activated, it
gives her access to a variety

324
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,579
of techniques that cannot
be shown on free television.

-I thought all the Arrancars
were nothing but boring

326
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:45,453
monsters, but you
are one hot woman.

327
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:49,749
I mean, just looking at
you gets me so turned on.

328
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:50,690
Oh!

329
00:15:50,723 --> 00:15:53,106
Oh!

330
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:54,516
-What?

331
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:57,167
-When she' in hyper erotic
mode and pursuing a woman,

332
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,356
Erotic's speed exceeds
even that of Sonido.

333
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:02,436
-I don't know what's
going on here.

334
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:03,410
Get away from me!

335
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:04,820
You're crazy!

00:16:04,853 --> 00:16:07,673
-Riser Doggy Style!

[scream]

338
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:11,700
-You'd better get moving now.

339
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:15,023
-I think you're right.

340
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,735
-That poor Arrancar.

341
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:20,327
Does Chizuru get like this with
women, or can it be anyone?

342
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,468
-Hard to tell.

343
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:23,146
But we do know that
her strength increases

344
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:26,771
to the point of invincibility
with a beautiful woman.

345
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,516
You've got more important
worries, though.

346
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,061
You'd better look behind you.

347
00:16:30,094 --> 00:16:31,470
-What?

348
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:31,974
-Ah!

349
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,505
-You'll be fine.

350
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,519
The situation was
anticipated, and your suit

351
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:39,895
is equipped with
a mechanism that

352
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:41,606
enhances your
ability to run away.

353
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:42,412
-Oh, great.

354
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:43,620
You're telling me this now?

355
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:45,870
How come no-one ever
explains these things to me

356
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:47,346
before I'm about to be eaten?

357
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,904
-The details aren't
that important.

00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:52,884
[scream]

359
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:54,059
-Good morning.

360

Tsuchinamazu!

361
00:17:00,873 --> 00:17:04,162
-Afro dude, you gotta help me!

362
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:06,310
-I respond when
anyone needs my help,

363
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:08,760
because I am the executive
Soul Reaper currently

364
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,774
in charge of affairs
in Karakura Town.

365
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:11,781
I'm Zennosuke Kurumadani.

-Damn!

367
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,937
Why in the world is
this happening to me?

368
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:25,811
Huh?

369
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:33,128
Ah!

370
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:34,370
I didn't mean to intrude!

371
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,196
Huh?

372
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,144
Hello?

373
00:17:40,177 --> 00:17:42,593
Maybe this monster can't move.

374
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:43,432
Wait a minute.

375
00:17:43,466 --> 00:17:45,950
That means-- yeah!

376
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:48,668
I can beat you with one
hand behind my back.

377
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:51,588
Huh?

378
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:53,502

-What?

381
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:59,175
You mean there's another one?

382
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,680
Ah!

383
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,996
I knew this deal was
too good to be true.

384
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:12,768
Hey, you!

385
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:13,675
Phony shopkeeper!

386
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,513
Do something.

387
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:15,017
Hurry!

388
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:21,529
I'm screwed.

389
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:22,013
I'm no match for
these big gorillas.

390
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:23,923
I should never have agreed
to be a part of this.

391
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:26,174
Ah!

392
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:27,670
DON KANONJI: Wah,
ha ha ha ha ha!

393
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,154
-Is that Kanonji and the others?

394
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:33,545
-Boom.

395
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:37,840
Karakuraizer!

00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,418
I mean, King Karakura!

Throw everything
you've got at it,

398
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,573
and you'll become a real hero!

it the finishing blow!

You're the only one
close who can do it.

00:18:57,342 --> 00:18:57,979
-Ah!

403
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:58,785
What is it with her?

404
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:01,269
She's out of her mind!

405
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:02,779

-Maybe this can work.

TESSAI (OVER WATCH):
Karakuraizer, you

412
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:18,722
need to move now.

413
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:20,132
Don't be afraid.

414
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,944
We'll record everything
that happens here

415
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:24,798
and provide a full
report to Rukia.

I've had it.

This place is gonna be toast.

Oh, yeah!

00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:21,891
Serves you right!

-Karakuraizer did it.

But now we really have
to get out of here.

-They should all be fine.

They're just sleeping for now.

But don't worry, though.
