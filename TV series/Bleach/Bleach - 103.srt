[theme music]

2
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,166
-Honestly.

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,700
If you wanted to have
a chance against us,

4
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,333
then you should've
brought a better weapon.

5
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,633
-You are even more naive
than I thought, Quincy boy.

6
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,333
Hm?

7
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:09,966
You little brat.

8
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:19,400
-You should've just died and
made it easy on yourself.

9
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:26,133
-I told you.

10
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:30,033
I'm going to put it and to
this meaningless battle.

11
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,266
-Awfully confident, aren't you?

12
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,600
Do you really think
you can defeat us

13
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:37,266
with a tacky little bow?

14
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,300
-(IN HEAD) I'm beginning
to understand what it takes

15
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,266
to control this power.

16
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,533
All that's left is my aim.

17
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:49,500
[giggling]

18
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:51,500
-I just can't master the aim.

19
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,133
Damn it.

20
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,000
I lost power that time.

21
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,266
-You said before that you wanted
to end this meaningless battle,

22
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,066
but over the years
I've discovered

23
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,133
there's no such thing
as a meaningful battle.

24
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,366
They're all meaningless.

25
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,200
-If that's true, then why fight?

26
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:26,700
You must have some
justification.

27
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:30,133
-Kariya has devised a plan to
exterminate every single Soul

28
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,566
Reaper living in the
Seireitei, and it will work.

29
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,033
But honestly, I
couldn't care less.

30
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:37,500
I just came along
because I thought

31
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:40,400
it might be fun to
bust this place up.

32
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:43,200
It didn't used to be like this.

33
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:45,566
There was a time when I would
dive into battle and risk

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,533
my life to get what I wanted.

35
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:50,066
I was willing to
sacrifice everything.

36
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,633
I found a certain
satisfaction in that.

37
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,033
But then time marched on
and the world changed.

38
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:58,266
I'll never understand
what's wrong with the strong

39
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,266
killing the weak.

40
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,933
I have denied my thirst
for far too long.

41
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:10,433
And now my thirst has grown
into an unquenchable desire.

42
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:17,133
But I don't have to hide
in the shadows anymore.

43
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,966
I can proudly display the heads
of the weaklings I defeat.

44
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,300
I'm surprised that
you can stand.

45
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,600
That's wonderful.

46
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,366
You're making this
very exciting.

47
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,966
Now then.

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,933
I get to have the pleasure
of finishing you off.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
-Increasing numbers of
casualties have been reported.

50
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,300
Do you have an update on the
condition of Captain Sui-Feng

51
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,133
and the rest of the
punishment force?

52
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,566
-Yes sir.

53
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,500
Right now they're
in stable condition

54
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,466
and there's no reason to
believe that they won't all

55
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,033
make a full recovery.

56
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,433
But they're weak and can't
be moved in this state.

57
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,400
-I see.

58
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,133
It was an unfortunate situation.

59
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,200
Squad 8 Captain Shunsui Kyoraku.

60
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,966
-Sir.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,700
-What are the ramifications
of this report from squad 12?

62
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:46,666
-Uh, it's difficult
to be certain.

63
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,933
A sealed facility
deep in the basement

64
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:50,966
of the Department of
Research and Development

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,100
has been uncovered.

66
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,700
-What is it?

67
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:57,700
-We cannot ignore the
seriousness of this.

68
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:01,166
This Bount has somehow
uncovered the Jokai Crest,

69
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,700
a power that was
sealed away long ago.

70
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:08,700
No one knows the full
extent of its capabilities.

71
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,666
-The substitute Soul
Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki

72
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,033
was present when the
Bount discovered it.

73
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:17,166
He says the Jokai Crest was
used as the source of power

74
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,633
for mod-soul
experiments in the past.

75
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,933
Should it accidentally
go off, the effects

76
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,266
would be devastating.

77
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,933
The entire Seireitei
would be reduced to ashes.

78
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:30,066
-We have to take into account
that the Jokai Crest was sealed

79
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,100
away long before the Department
of Research and Development

80
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:35,200
even existed.

81
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,366
And the original source
of this information was

82
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,600
Ran'Tao, a known criminal.

83
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,700
How are we supposed to
know if it's really true

84
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:44,266
or just some elaborate lie?

85
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,000
-That is not the issue.

86
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:50,033
It is a known fact that at that
point in history, Central 46

87
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:53,400
sealed the Jokai Crest away
and hid its very existence

88
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,300
from everyone in
the Soul Society.

89
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:59,200
Until we have proof that this
immense power does not exist,

90
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:02,033
we must treat the
threat as real.

91
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:05,933
Whatever the case, we cannot
rest until this Bount is found.

92
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:08,566
Everyone must make it
their highest priority.

93
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,433
-Yes sir.

94
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:15,600
-Jokai Crest?

95
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,433
-That's right.

96
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:19,633
-I never knew that
such a thing existed.

97
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,333
-Yes.

98
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:26,600
Now we can blow the
Seireitei into oblivion.

99
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:30,233
In less than 24 hours,
it'll all be over.

100
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:34,000
What a glorious feeling.

101
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,700
-Master Kariya.

102
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,133
It isn't really necessary
for you to do this.

103
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,000
-Don't tell me you're
worried about me.

104
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,366
You know me better than that.

105
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,233
I have no intention of
dying in a place like this.

106
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,366
-That's not it.

107
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,433
What you plan to
do is atrocious.

108
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:52,066
Just how many of us must
die to fulfill your cause?

109
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,400
Enough is enough.

110
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,366
If you really have
this power, then you

111
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,933
could make every Soul Reaper
in the Seireitei kneel

112
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:59,033
down before you.

113
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,000
-It's too late.

114
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,666
-What do you mean?

115
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,300
We came here for
revenge, but you

116
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,200
intend to obliterate every one.

117
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,500
What's the point in that?

118
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,366
-That's the way it
was meant to be.

119
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,133
-You're not saying that.

120
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,100
You wouldn't do that.

121
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,666
I've been worried about
this since this day we met.

122
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,966
You're a loose cannon without
discipline or control.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,433
The Bounts endured
centuries of hardships

124
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:35,300
and were mesmerized by
your strength and passion.

125
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:39,266
That's the reason I followed
you up tp this point.

126
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,400
But if you're planning
to use the Jokai Crest,

127
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,366
that changes things.

128
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,966
If it really is the source
of our power, as you say,

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,300
then it shouldn't
be used as a weapon.

130
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:52,066
It should not be an
instrument of death.

131
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,133
-I don't think I've seen
you this passionate before.

132
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,600
I like it, Koga.

133
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:56,366
It's charming.

134
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:08,700
-Kariya.

135
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:11,133
Don't do this.

136
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,166
It's like spitting on
the gates of heaven.

137
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,666
-You've taken care of me
and been a good companion.

138
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,466
I'm eternally grateful for
everything you've done, Koga.

139
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:47,200
-Kariya.

140
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:09,821
-And here I thought
you just looked

141
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:12,621
like an obnoxious little brat.

142
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,687
But I hadn't noticed that
stern look of determination.

143
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:20,487
SOGEN: A Quincy's
arrow must only

144
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:23,654
be released in the
name of justice.

145
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:25,854
-In the name of justice.

146
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:27,654
-I don't mean
justice for yourself,

147
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:30,687
but for those whom you
have sworn to protect.

148
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:36,887
Once you master the
basics I just taught you,

149
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:39,221
the rest is simple.

150
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:41,687
Everything beyond that
will depend on your heart.

151
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:46,654
URYU: My heart.

152
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,721
-Quincys release arrows
from their hearts,

153
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:51,187
in the name of justice.

154
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:06,587
-I'll try, Sensei,
to do as you say.

155
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:11,287
I will release the arrow from my
heart, in the name of justice.

156
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:20,721
-I have to admit, it's
impressive your powers could

157
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,554
actually increase
at this late stage.

158
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:32,754
It appears that you are
reaching your limit.

159
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:34,687
[laughter]

160
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:38,154
-Please, let this work.

161
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:43,587
[laughter]

162
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:44,854
-Now it's my turn.

163
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:52,754
-What the--

164
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:53,454
-Ah!

165
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:53,754
Gotcha!

166
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:58,254
-Is that all you've got?

167
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:07,154
What the hell is wrong with you?

168
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:08,221
-What are you blaming me for?

169
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:10,321
You're the one who folded
me up without looking

170
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,554
to see if he was
attacking again.

171
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:14,721
-What was that just now?

172
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:23,287
-Could that have been--

173
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:25,921
-I think that surprised
you as much as it did me.

174
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,187
Just an accident.

175
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,587
-In that case, come on.

176
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,587
Don't let up.

177
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:45,887
-You've already reached
your limit, so why bother?

178
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:48,754
[laughter]

179
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:49,887
-Ah!

180
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:52,254
It's useless to keep trying.

181
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:53,487
My defense is impenetrable!

182
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:57,721
-I'm going to finish this!

183
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:06,254
[scream]

184
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:21,687
[groan]

185
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:23,521
-When you fuse together
with your Dolls,

186
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,421
you form a powerful bond.

187
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:28,387
But you think and
act independently.

188
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:32,654
This union has given you
superhuman abilities.

189
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,187
But not when you transform
between your powers.

190
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:39,187
I noticed that you couldn't
attack when you're defending,

191
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:41,587
and you couldn't defend
when you attacked.

192
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,887
I looked for the
transition, and I

193
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:46,787
realized that whenever you
switch between the two forms,

194
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:50,487
you have to temporarily revert
back to yourself for a moment.

195
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:53,221
When my Kojaku arrow
accidentally went off,

196
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:55,321
the explosion caught
you by surprise.

197
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:57,754
You assumed I had nothing
left, and then transformed back

198
00:13:57,787 --> 00:14:00,721
to yourself before transforming
again to move in for the kill.

199
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:04,387
In that moment, you were
completely unprotected.

200
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:08,354
So theoretically, you need time
to go from defense to offense.

201
00:14:08,387 --> 00:14:10,321
I wasn't sure if I
had much of a chance,

202
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:12,287
but it was your one
and only weakness.

203
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,854
[groaning]

204
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:22,554
-But you used up all
the energy you had.

205
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:25,687
How did you get off
that second shot?

206
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:28,554
-Something my sensei taught me.

207
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:30,554
An arrow must not be fired.

208
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:32,454
It must be released.

209
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:34,587
And to fly true,
a Quincy's arrow

210
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:37,754
must be released from the heart.

211
00:14:37,787 --> 00:14:39,187
-I guess you win.

212
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:41,354
And I lose.

213
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:43,187
Can't say it wasn't fun.

214
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:20,821
[coughing]

215
00:15:27,787 --> 00:15:29,154
-My, my.

216
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:30,687
For someone who's
faking an illness,

217
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,421
you certainly have
a realistic cough.

218
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:38,254
Did you find anything out?

219
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:40,321
-A little.

220
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:43,387
But sifting through all this
data to find it is tedious.

221
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:45,854
Did the enemy give us
anything at all to go on?

222
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:48,721
-He just said that
we've got 24 hours.

223
00:15:48,754 --> 00:15:51,721
When our time's up, boom.

224
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:54,321
-I understand.

225
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,454
You better take a look at this.

226
00:15:56,487 --> 00:15:56,754
-Hm.

227
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:02,154
-This is a book
written by Ran'Tao.

228
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,254
It's a summary of
the Jokai crest.

229
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:06,587
-Why is something
like that in here?

230
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:08,921
-It's obvious that Ran'Tao was
one of the most intelligent

231
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:11,721
minds of that era.

232
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:15,421
If Ran'Tao had secrets to keep,
they most certainly wouldn't be

233
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,921
hidden in the usual
places, would they?

234
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:20,587
Ran'Tao would expect us to look
in the official information

235
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:23,821
storage facilities, where other
secret documents are kept.

236
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:26,154
But if it was in the
reference room among thousands

237
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:29,387
of other documents, think how
difficult it would be to find.

238
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,187
-Oh.

239
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:31,854
-I checked with
Captain Hitsugaya

240
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:34,221
to see if the information
the Bounts had stolen

241
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,621
had come from this section,
and he confirmed it.

242
00:16:36,654 --> 00:16:39,187
I have to believe that the
answer we're looking for

243
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:41,354
is hidden somewhere
in these books.

244
00:16:41,387 --> 00:16:43,487
Whoever snuck in
and erased the data

245
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:45,854
must not have been aware of the
documents regarding the Jokai

246
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:47,621
Crest.

247
00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:49,387
-What now?

248
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:52,521
-I stumbled across this Jokai
Crest document by accident,

249
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,554
but after examining
it I'm convinced

250
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:56,554
there's something else.

251
00:16:56,587 --> 00:16:58,154
-Something else?

252
00:16:58,187 --> 00:16:59,421
-There's some
crucial information

253
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:00,787
missing from this book.

254
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:02,687
The writer broke
up the information

255
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,154
and separated it among
several different books, which

256
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:07,654
are scattered
throughout this library.

257
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:09,354
-Wait a minute.

258
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:12,521
Are you saying we have to
search through all of them?

259
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:15,554
-I hope you weren't planning
on getting any sleep tonight.

260
00:17:15,587 --> 00:17:18,387
-I-- uh--

261
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:19,654
-I appreciate it.

262
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:22,387
You did say you
wanted to help, right?

263
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:22,687
-Yeah.

264
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:24,854
You bet.

265
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:26,287
Can't wait to get started.

266
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:50,354
-Master Sogen?

267
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:57,187
-You did your best.

268
00:17:57,221 --> 00:17:58,487
I'm proud of you.

269
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:03,854
-But why?

270
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:07,487
-You fought harder than
anyone could ever expect.

271
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:12,487
And you released an arrow worthy
of your pride as a Quincy.

272
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:16,354
-But Sensei, I'm not done yet.

273
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,487
-You can't do it all, Uryu.

274
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:21,721
-Even the strongest
of men has his limits.

275
00:18:21,754 --> 00:18:25,821
You have fought to your limit,
and that is all anyone can ask.

276
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,221
You can do no more.

277
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:31,587
Now is the time to take
the rest that you deserve.

278
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:35,154
-Not until I have finished.

279
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:39,254
I still-- there's
something I must do.

280
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:42,754
-A heart of vengeance forges
a soul firm with resolve.

281
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:45,421
But if one's not
careful, vengeance

282
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:47,621
can be blinded by
obstinance and pride,

283
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:51,487
thereby dulling the blade.

284
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:53,221
Have patience.

285
00:18:53,254 --> 00:18:55,221
Take time to consider my words.

286
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:00,154
-Sensei, don't go.

287
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:06,187
-Uryu.

288
00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:13,387
-So, Uryu, you fought
a Bount, didn't you?

289
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:14,654
-Yes.

290
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,454
I was able to defeat her.

291
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:18,487
What about you?

292
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:20,421
-I found Kariya.

293
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:21,887
That bastard.

294
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:24,521
He's planning to blow away
the entire Seireitei tomorrow.

295
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:27,454
-We've got to stop him.

296
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:29,454
-Take it easy, Uryu.

297
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:31,721
-You can't let Kariya do this.

298
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,754
I'm going with you, Ichigo.

299
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,454
-I won't try to stop you.

300
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:38,187
But before we go, let's
take care of those wounds.

301
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:06,354
-Damn it, Kariya.

302
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:10,187
Think before you do this.

303
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:13,521
There's no need to
destroy the Seireitei.

304
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:15,354
You'll be wiping
out innocent kids

305
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:17,154
who had nothing to do with this.

306
00:20:17,187 --> 00:20:19,154
Kariya.

307
00:20:19,187 --> 00:20:21,587
-Huh?

308
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,187
Don't let him get away.

309
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:25,554
-Move away.

310
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:28,654
My business doesn't involve you.

311
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,487
-We've trapped a Bount.

312
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,821
We'll restrain him
until you arrive.

313
00:20:32,854 --> 00:20:36,154
-One of the other teams
discovered a Bount.

314
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:38,154
-Order them to keep
their distance.

315
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:41,354
Don't engage him
until we get there.

316
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:41,921
-Don't move.

317
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:10,787
-Zeige dich, Dalk.

318
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:25,187
-Shall I deal with them?

319
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:25,821
It can't be helped.

320
00:21:31,854 --> 00:21:33,254
-What's happening there?

321
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:34,821
Answer me!

322
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,854
All I could hear was
everybody's screaming,

323
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:38,354
and then the signal
just went dead.

324
00:21:38,387 --> 00:21:40,854
-Damn it.

325
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:41,687
We've got to hurry.

326
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:42,187
-Right.

327
00:22:06,864 --> 00:22:10,130

328
00:23:36,964 --> 00:23:39,730
-There' a request from
squad 10 asking us to help.

329
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:40,497
MAN: Are you serious?

330
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,464
GIRL: All right!

331
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:42,730
Let's do it!

332
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:44,097
HITSUGAYA: But they
only need one of us.

333
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,097
MAN: Well, obviously I'm
the most worthy, so I--

334
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,564
GIRL: What are
you talking about?

335
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:48,764
It should be me.

336
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:50,030
MAN: No, no, I'm the one.

337
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:50,464
GIRL: Me!

338
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:51,597
MAN: Me, me, me!

339
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,497
-Just quit arguing and come!

KON: Illustrated
Guide to Soul Reapers.

342
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:06,430
VOICEOVER: Golden!

343
00:24:06,464 --> 00:24:08,630
-This meeting of the female
Soul Reapers Association

344
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:09,997
is called to order.

345
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,664
Uh, just you, Kotestu?

346
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:12,930
-Yes ma'am.

347
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:13,864
Captain Sui-Feng and
Lieutenant Kurotsuchi

348
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:16,630
are absent due to
injuries, and my sister

349
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,030
is acting as their nurse.

350
00:24:18,064 --> 00:24:19,897
I've received word that
Lieutenant Matsumoto

351
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,764
is working and
couldn't get away.

352
00:24:21,797 --> 00:24:23,497
-And Lieutenant Kusajishi?

353
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,997
I'll just mark down
whereabouts unknown.

354
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,830
-Oh!

355
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:26,764
And speaking of
unknown whereabouts,

356
00:24:26,797 --> 00:24:29,664
Captain Ukitake seems
to have vanished.

357
00:24:29,697 --> 00:24:32,830
-Now that you mention it,
I haven't seen my captain.
