1
00:00:05,722 --> 00:00:11,255
Konso Cop Karakurizer!
Five super powered
misfits created through
the whim of Professor

2
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:15,688
Urahara! No, wait,
scratch that!
[clearing throat]
They are champions

3
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:19,622
of justice! United under
Professor Urahara's dream
for world peace!

4
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:22,655
Each one designed to
defend the innocent!

5
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:25,088
They fight to save the
people from evil!

6
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:30,822
Go, Karakurizer! You are
the protector of peace in
Karakura Town! Now, go
get 'em!

7
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:27,381
[breathing heavily]

8
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,547
[gasping]

9
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:33,347
[roaring]

10
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:34,814
[gasping]
Somebody...!

11
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,347
Somebody, please help me!

12
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,681
Hold it right there!

13
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:44,414
Uh!

14
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:49,747
Don't worry, miss, I've
got you covered. This
guy's just gonna be a bad
memory in a minute.

15
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,581
Karakurizer...!

16
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:55,247
Career...

17
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,114
...Change...?

18
00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:58,514
Get out of the way!

19
00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:04,681
Huh? What the hell?

20
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:05,847
[roaring]

21
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:09,181
Huh!

22
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:13,281
Ah!

23
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:19,447
What are you doing, man?!
That guy was mine!

24
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:20,547
Hmpf!

25
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:22,514
Thank you so very much
for saving me!

26
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:24,381
It was my pleasure. Don't
mention it.

27
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:34,481
So are you all right? You
weren't injured, were you?

28
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,314
That was Michel!
Oh, my hero.

29
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,347
[gasping and grunting]

30
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:42,281
[grunting]

31
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:54,481
<i>Everything is going as</i>
<i>planned.</i>

32
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,547
Impressive. But...

33
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:59,047
...Now that I think
about it...

34
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:03,381
Maybe I'm giving you too
much credit. Maybe I should
be more impressed with
myself for creating you.

35
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:05,447
[laughing]

36
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:09,447
Just you wait and see!
Before long, Karakura
Town will be all mine!

37
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:17,514
Hey, are you in
here, Kisuke?

38
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:20,181
Sorry, Kisuke's out
buying supplies.

39
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:22,014
Come in...
Karakurizer!

40
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,314
Beast?

41
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:30,981
Why is everyone gathered
in Urahara's shop?

42
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:33,314
He asked us all to come
here.

43
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:34,447
Have some tea.

44
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,981
Why didn't he ask me to
come in, as well?

45
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:39,281
I think he forgot
about you.

46
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:40,214
[chuckling]

47
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,481
That's unbelievable!

48
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:45,347
Oh, and Spirit's busy
doing a shoot overseas.

49
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:48,114
I mean... He's absent
because he's carrying out
a mission.

50
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:53,114
Now that you're all
here, I'm supposed to
read Kisuke's orders.

51
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:55,414
'Hello everyone, and
thanks for coming.'

52
00:04:55,447 --> 00:05:00,614
'It appears the Female
Arrancar you previously
defeated, is once again
causing trouble...'

53
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:03,081
'... Please investigate
immediately.'

54
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:03,814
'The end.'

55
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,214
That's the whole message?

56
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:05,947
'Fraid so.

57
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:08,314
Man, how sketchy can he
get?!

58
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:12,381
But the important news
is, there's a guy in town
who has the power to
defeat Hollows!

59
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:16,281
He wears a cape and flies
through the air like a hero!
I've seen him out there myself.

60
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:17,414
Ah!

61
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:19,047
[gasping]

62
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:21,447
I've heard about him! I
think his name's Michel,
isn't it?

63
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:25,447
Yeah. I think that was
what she called him.
Things were a little
hectic.

64
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:27,447
That was Michel!

65
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:29,047
Who in the hell is this
guy?

66
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:30,981
Whaaat?

67
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,281
Huh?! Huh?!

68
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:35,081
Why are you looking at me
like that? What's going
on?!

69
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:38,314
Hold on a minute! You
really have no idea?

70
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:39,581
You're so behind!

71
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:41,147
Huh?!

72
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:42,881
He's the handsome
Spiritualist everyone's
raving about!

73
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:44,581
Come on, you've
gotta be joking!

74
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:51,914
Ha!

75
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:54,847
He's really cool!
Everybody's crazy about
him! He's good-looking,

76
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:56,981
friendly, and he can fly
through the air with his
cape!

77
00:05:58,081 --> 00:05:58,947
Heh.

78
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:01,981
[cheering]

79
00:06:02,014 --> 00:06:05,514
He's become so popular,
they're even selling
replicas of his cape!

80
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:08,247
These days, you hardly
see anyone in town who
doesn't have one!

81
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,947
Sorry guys, but
you look lame.

82
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,314
These capes reflect his
heroism! In fact, you
hardly see anyone in
town without one.

83
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:23,181
Huh? What's going on?!
I thought you weren't
even interested in men!

84
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:25,347
Oh, I wasn't?

85
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:29,381
I have a picture of the
love of your life! It
happens to be my favorite
photo of Orihime!

86
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:31,114
She's a nice-looking
girl.

87
00:06:31,147 --> 00:06:32,947
What?! That's all you
have to say?

88
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:38,347
She is a cute girl. But
what more did you really
expect me to say? I'm a
girl myself.

89
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,447
Are you serious?

90
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:41,747
I'll take this.

91
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:43,481
Ahhh!

92
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:46,247
And as long as we're on
the subject, what was
Michel like when you
met him?

93
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,781
What was he like? Let me
see... Well, umm...

94
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:52,314
You're so lucky! I wish
I could have met him!

95
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:55,814
He was no help, believe
me! All the guy did was
get in my way!

96
00:06:55,847 --> 00:07:00,214
AND, no matter what you
think, there's no such thing
as a perfect guy who's both
handsome and pleasant!

97
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:02,714
Yes there is. It just
doesn't happen to be you!

98
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:06,747
Yeah. I'll bet he
saved your sorry butt
when you were about to
screw something up!

99
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:08,114
Wha---?! That's
not true!!

100
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:11,314
Come to think of it, why
is Michel in Karakura
Town?

101
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:15,214
Maybe he's also here to
investigate the activities
of the Arrancar.

102
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:17,281
If that's so, we could
team up with him!

103
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:21,847
So if we go investigate
the Arrancar, we might
run into Michel, as well.

104
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:24,181
All right! Let 's all go
meet him!

105
00:07:24,214 --> 00:07:25,147
<i>Yeah!</i>

106
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:27,147
Think we can get him to
sign our capes?

107
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,481
What?! Wait a minute!

108
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:34,147
I'm tellin' you guys,
that dude had no
intention of helping me.

109
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:36,014
Are any of you people
even listening to me?

110
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:41,347
Jeez...

111
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:44,247
Everything he said to me,
he said with a sneer! The
guy's a jerk.

112
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:47,147
You must have done
something to get him
upset. He's a good guy.

113
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:50,681
Oh, is that so? And how
come you're so sure?

114
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:56,214
I'll tell you how... the
other day there were hidden
TV cameras following him around
without his knowledge...

115
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:58,681
...And he was super nice
the whole time!

116
00:07:58,714 --> 00:08:00,147
Oh, I saw that show, too!

117
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:01,814
<i>He was seriously cool!</i>

118
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:06,814
No shoving now, ladies.
[chuckling]

119
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:08,314
Thank you, folks!

120
00:08:08,347 --> 00:08:09,747
Oh, you want
an autograph?

121
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:14,414
That guy's a bastard.

122
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:18,114
Hey! What are you
staring at?

123
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:18,981
Huh?

124
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:21,181
[chatting]

125
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:22,781
Look! It's Michel!

126
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:25,781
Wow! It is true! He is
here in Karakura Town!

127
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:28,047
Huh?

128
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:30,247
Hey! He looked over
here!

129
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:32,047
[chatting]

130
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:33,081
Bye, now.

131
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:34,181
Bye!

132
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,614
He's coming this way!

133
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:37,414
Hi!

134
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:40,814
Hmm?

135
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:43,614
I know you! You're the
young man who was
attacked by the Hollow
earlier.

136
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:45,214
Are you okay, my friend?

137
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:45,881
Huh?

138
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:51,114
I had a shoot to go to,
so I couldn't stay around
to make sure you were all
right at the time.

139
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:52,881
You weren't injured, were
you?

140
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:54,047
Uh...

141
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:55,381
Ah!

142
00:08:55,414 --> 00:08:57,147
Come on, Kon! Don't you
have something to say to
him?!

143
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:59,047
What are you talking
about?

144
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,614
Say thank you! He saved
your butt, so a thank you
would be in order, right?

145
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:06,247
Hold on a minute! As I
recall, I didn't ask to
be saved by him!

146
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:07,581
Ah!

147
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,747
We're sorry, but he
really has no manners.

148
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:11,781
Oh, that's all right.
It's no big deal.

149
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:16,581
Isn't he the best?

150
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:19,581
[growling]

151
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:22,714
I'm disappointed in you,
Kon!

152
00:09:22,747 --> 00:09:24,981
Rukia?! But I didn't do
anything wrong!

153
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:29,114
Even if you don't want to
say it, he did save you,
so it's only polite to
say 'Thank you'.

154
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:31,014
Really, Orihime?

155
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,314
Of course! You're only
going to make yourself
look bad!

156
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:38,181
No one's going to
sympathize with your weird
excuse that he bothers you
because he's perfect.

157
00:09:38,214 --> 00:09:41,114
Hey! I've got an idea.
Why don't you let us help
you out?

158
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:41,881
Good idea!

159
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:46,347
Okay! I guess it's time
for me to grow up and be
a man!

160
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:52,014
So.. Th-Th-Thank
you.

161
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:53,547
Huh! Where
did he--?

162
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:54,747
Michel!

163
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:56,181
We're some of your
biggest fans!

164
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:57,881
Can we have your
autograph?!

165
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:58,981
You look so heroic!

166
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:00,214
Oh brother! Hm?

167
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:03,781
What's that?!

168
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:06,581
Watch your backs!

169
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:07,181
Hm?

170
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:08,147
Huh?!

171
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:09,814
[panicking]

172
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,781
[roaring]

173
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:17,581
I'll handle this! Stay
out of the way, guys!

174
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:20,781
Let's... Career
Change!

175
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:27,781
Wait a minute!

176
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:29,214
Ahhhhh!

177
00:10:33,114 --> 00:10:34,614
What happened?

178
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:36,014
[roaring]

179
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:37,047
[gasping]

180
00:10:37,747 --> 00:10:39,847
Ahhhh!

181
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:41,547
[roaring]

182
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:42,914
I'm in trouble!

183
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:44,881
Ha!

184
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:51,581
[gasping]

185
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:53,081
Are you all right, my
friend?

186
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:54,781
[screaming]
Uh, yeah.

187
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,914
He took him out with a
single blow!

188
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:01,181
As you know, monsters
like that are pretty
dangerous. If any more

189
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:04,747
of them turn up, don't
sweat it. I'll be glad to
handle them.

190
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:05,481
[sighing]

191
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:07,681
How cool is that?!

192
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:10,947
[giggling]

193
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:13,981
No, no, I'm fine. And so
is your friend here.

194
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:16,681
<i>Oh, thank goodness.</i>

195
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:17,914
<i>[cooing]</i>

196
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:18,647
Hmpf.

197
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:21,214
You were amazing!

198
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,681
This is crazy!
[grunting]

199
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:26,647
... in the face of such
a dangerous situation,
I don't know how you do it!

200
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:37,014
I know!

201
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:38,014
Right...

202
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:39,914
Hm?

203
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:42,614
Everybody's saying that
Michel's decided to stay
here in Karakura Town!

204
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,981
That means we might
run into him in person
again!

205
00:11:45,014 --> 00:11:45,681
[sighing]

206
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:51,981
[giggling]

207
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:54,647
Everyone's wearing
a cape, now.

208
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:58,714
Ah! He's all
over the place!

209
00:11:58,747 --> 00:12:00,981
<i>Hey, isn't that Michel on</i>
<i>TV?</i>

210
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:02,981
Huh?

211
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,914
Residents of Karakura
Town, I thank you for
your generous support.
My name is Michel.

212
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:09,814
And today, I have some
special news I'd like to
share with all of you.

213
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:10,647
Huh?!

214
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:15,081
This guy's everywhere!

215
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:19,747
Okay. Today I met some
special young men and
women!

216
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:24,047
They are the Karakuizers!
And unbeknownst to you
residents, they've been
protecting this town.

217
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:25,881
[grunting]

218
00:12:25,914 --> 00:12:29,781
Karakura Town is very
lucky to have such
wonderful young people..

219
00:12:29,814 --> 00:12:31,647
... who are so dedicated
to its safety.

220
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:34,047
I must say, I'm very
impressed with their
capabilities.

221
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:37,181
To aid their efforts, I'm
giving them a specially
made cape!

222
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,314
It's a genuine
Michel-brand flying cape.

223
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:43,647
[gasping]

224
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:47,014
That Michel sure is cool!

225
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:48,981
Whaat?!

226
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:53,414
He's generous, and also
very nice! I have to say,
the man's definitely a cutie!

227
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:56,081
Orihime, we're gonna have
to forget about this guy.

228
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:57,481
I'm afraid so.

229
00:12:57,514 --> 00:12:59,881
Ah! Wait a minute!
Don't leave me like this!

230
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:03,647
Whatever I did,
I'm sorry!
[sobbing]

231
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:09,847
These people are right.

232
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:12,114
Michel really is
better than me.

233
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:25,914
So how did it feel to fly
for the first time?

234
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,647
A little scary at first,
but I gotta tell you, it
rocked!

235
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:31,847
We owe it all to you
for giving us an
experience like this!

236
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:32,947
Mm.

237
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:34,847
Is something wrong?

238
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,347
Sort of. I was
thinking...

239
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,614
...maybe he would have
wanted to fly, as well.

240
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:42,681
Are you referring to
that fake Ichigo guy?

241
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:45,081
Mm-hm.

242
00:13:45,114 --> 00:13:48,681
You should just let it go.
I mean, come on. It's his
own fault for getting up
and leaving like that.

243
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:50,514
Yeah. But even so...

244
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:53,714
Are you really worried
about that young man?

245
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:59,914
I'm not so worried,
exactly... But he's
still our team-mate!

246
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:02,514
Is it that you'd rather
be with him than me?

247
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:04,047
Oh heavens, no! Not at
all!

248
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:07,381
That's ridiculous! You're
a way better team member,
Michel!

249
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:10,514
Yeah but... we've always
fought together, up to
this point.

250
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:14,481
So then why did he just
disappear, without even
saying 'thank you' for
being saved?

251
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:16,381
That was terrible!
He's a bad guy!

252
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:17,714
Hm!

253
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:20,781
Why are you all reacting
like this? I don't understand.

254
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:22,714
Can you explain
it, Michel?

255
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:25,881
Hold on! Wait a minute,
when did Michel's opinion
become so important to
me?

256
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:31,547
[sighing]

257
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:34,014
Well, I actually intended
to let you play a little
longer...

258
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,481
But the effects
wore off too fast.

259
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:37,747
[gasping]

260
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:39,547
[groaning]

261
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:40,981
Guys? What's wrong?!

262
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,214
[chuckling]

263
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:49,881
Karakurizer!

264
00:14:57,249 --> 00:14:58,683
Karakurizer!

265
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:08,249
[sighing]
Can't believe those guys.

266
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:13,049
[grunting]
What are you?

267
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:13,983
Huh?!

268
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:15,216
<i>Beast?</i>

269
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,683
...and that's Michel!

270
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:23,783
I've come here under
orders from a certain
individual, to invade
Karakura Town.

271
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:26,849
You people are in the way
of that objective,
unfortunately.

272
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:29,149
He is a bad guy, after
all!

273
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:30,083
[gasping]

274
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,016
That's the reason I was
forced to place everybody I
came into contact with,
including you, under hypnosis.

275
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:47,283
After that, I was able to
convince you to accept those
capes, which sucked away all
your Spirit Energy.

276
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:49,183
[gasping]

277
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:52,116
It's too late to fight
back. By now, you have
barely any powers
remaining.

278
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,049
[groaning]

279
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:59,083
You see? It's time for
me to dispose of all four
of you. So, prepare to
die.

280
00:15:59,116 --> 00:15:59,783
Bastard!

281
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,449
Ha!

282
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:07,583
[gasping]

283
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,383
I don't stand a chance
against him!

284
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:13,616
[gasping]
I need to report this
to someone and get help!

285
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,483
<i>Sorry pal! It's not</i>
<i>over yet!</i>

286
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:20,183
There's... one
more of us.

287
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:22,849
Karakurizer is still
left!

288
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:24,649
Huh?

289
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:28,816
Oh, you mean him? My
powers haven't seemed to
work on him, but so what?

290
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,916
He hasn't got the
guts... to come
after me.

291
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,249
Karakurizer will not...
lose to the likes...
...of you!

292
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:41,183
My, my, is that all you
have to tell me?

293
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:42,916
[choking]

294
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:46,583
It doesn't really matter
what you believe...
'Cause this is reality.

295
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:49,683
<i>Hold it right there,</i>
<i>you bastard!</i>

296
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:51,316
[gasping]

297
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:54,783
Oops. I guess I jumped in
without thinking!

298
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:55,949
I knew you'd come.

299
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:58,783
That's fine! I don't
have to look for you.

300
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,883
[grunting]

301
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:03,716
Are you all right?!

302
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:06,383
Yeah. Don't worry
about me...

303
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,716
You gotta stop him!

304
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:11,183
Don't I know it!

305
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,916
I guess it's time to fish
or cut bait!

306
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,383
Hey! I heard
everything, you
slime bag!

307
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:18,983
End of the line for you!

308
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:20,416
I think not.

309
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:21,649
Observe this!

310
00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:25,249
Huh!

311
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:28,849
Wha---! What's going
on?!

312
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:30,883
I'm just borrowing their
Spirit Energy.

313
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,883
So... Shall we begin?!

314
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,683
Let's... Career
Change!

315
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:45,549
All right...!

316
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:48,216
[yelling]

317
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:52,083
[yelling]

318
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:53,216
[grunting]

319
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:57,116
[grunting]

320
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:58,449
Damnit!

321
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:00,816
[snickering]
Seems you're no
match for me.

322
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:03,583
[grunting]

323
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:08,516
No matter what you do,
it's useless. I'm more
powerful than you'll
ever be.

324
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:10,583
And I'm also more
handsome!

325
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:11,783
Hmph!

326
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:13,983
Come on, you honestly
think you can beat me?

327
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:16,349
[growling]

328
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:19,783
Admit it, it's over,
Karakurizer!

329
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:22,083
[yelling]

330
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:22,716
Huh?

331
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:26,816
Don't let him win! You
can do this, Karakurizer!

332
00:18:27,883 --> 00:18:28,949
Go!

333
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:30,949
[growling]

334
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:32,849
No you don't! Huh?!

335
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:35,316
Whatever it takes...
... You're through!

336
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,516
I'm not losing to you!

337
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,449
[gasping]

338
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:44,983
Why am I wearing this
cape?

339
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:48,049
Really! Why do we have
these stupid outfits on?!

340
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:52,383
[chatting]
This is so strange!

341
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:53,883
Who's this goofy-looking
guy?

342
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,816
Some lame-o, I guess!

343
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:56,949
[grunting]

344
00:18:57,816 --> 00:18:59,816
You ready for some more?!

345
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:00,749
[grunting]

346
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,083
Are you through yet?

347
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:07,483
[snickering]

348
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:13,716
[laughing]
What's with your face,
pal? You seem to be short
a tooth!

349
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:15,816
[laughing]
It's a good
look for you!

350
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:16,916
What?!

351
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:20,849
Ah! What happened
to it?!

352
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:22,449
My tooth!
Where the hell
is it?!

353
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:27,783
[chuckling]
I'm more confident now!

354
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:30,716
There's no way I'm gonna
lose to such a goofy
looking dork!

355
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:32,016
How dare you?!

356
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:35,749
That does it!
[growling]

357
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,416
This is my true form!

358
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:47,449
I'm going to crush you
like a bug!

359
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,983
So the truth's out,
you're not even close
to handsome!

360
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:52,449
You're just an ugly
Hollow!

361
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:57,349
Ha! My great
kick!

362
00:19:58,816 --> 00:20:02,283
[kicking efforts]

363
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:04,449
Guess you underestimated
my leg strength!

364
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,083
Take this!

365
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:11,449
[grunting]

366
00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:14,616
Can't be!

367
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:15,483
Uh!

368
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:17,583
As I told you before...

369
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,649
There is no way I'm going
to lose...

370
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:23,083
...to such an
uncool-looking bastard
like you!

371
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,516
[grunting]

372
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:30,416
Special Technique...

373
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:35,383
R - I - Z - E-R...

374
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,816
...Beeeaaammm!

375
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:44,449
[screaming]

376
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:51,516
End Pose!

377
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:54,449
You defeated him...
Karakurizer!

378
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:58,249
Believing in myself is
what made the difference
as always!

379
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,616
Heh!

380
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,449
[growling]

381
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,783
I'll get you for this...
Karakurizer!

382
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:13,549
[screaming]

383
00:21:15,716 --> 00:21:16,849
[chuckling]

384
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,816
If I hadn't been there, I
guess you all would have
been goners! You should
be thankful to me.

385
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:24,516
Yeah, that would be why
we all said 'thank you'.

386
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,583
Ah!

387
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:26,916
We were behaving
strangely, for sure!

388
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:29,483
Guess I should have known
something was wrong...

389
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:32,349
...when I was turned
on by someone other
than Orihime.

390
00:21:32,383 --> 00:21:34,349
And by a man, of all
things!

391
00:21:34,383 --> 00:21:37,216
I figure you guys owe
everything to me!

392
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:39,316
Oh! You can pour me
another juice.

393
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:49,683
The reason Kon remained
normal through all this,
is because he's a Soul
Candy!

394
00:21:49,716 --> 00:21:52,516
[chuckling]
Guess I'll keep that
to myself.

395
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:58,549
Peace has returned to
Karakura Town, thanks to
the brave efforts of
Karakurizer! However, the

396
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:03,216
evil Hollows haven't
given up. They are always
a threat, attacking our
heroes when they least

397
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:08,449
expect it! But fear
not, someone is keeping
watch! Go, Karakurizer!

398
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:10,149
Your adventures have
only begun...?

399
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:50,584
The peace of Karakura
Town has been saved,
thanks to the efforts of
the Karakurizers!

400
00:23:50,617 --> 00:23:54,584
<i>Wait a minute! I'm the</i>
<i>one who saved the day!</i>
<i>Make that a single</i>
<i>Karakurizer!</i>

401
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:56,717
Thanks to the efforts of
multiple Karakurizers!

402
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,584
<i>Hey!</i>

403
00:23:57,617 --> 00:23:58,884
Go, Karakurizers!

404
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:00,250
<i>You're baiting me!</i>
