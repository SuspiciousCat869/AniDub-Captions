-Interesting.

23
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,521
I can sense a human
presence, but it's

24
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,954
almost as if this cave was
designed to keep anyone

25

from being able to detect
spiritual pressure.

just my opinion.

I don't think there's any
way Rangiku and the others

It's some kind of ruin.

Perhaps the remains of
some ancient civilization.

172
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:30,169
You still haven't recovered
from the last battle.

173
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:31,903
These things take time.

174
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:33,869
-Shuhei told me what happened.

175
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,436
He said that such
an attack often

176
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:37,303
causes direct
damage to the soul.

177
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,003
It's not like a physical injury.

178
00:12:53,036 --> 00:12:56,803
When your soul is damaged,
it takes much longer to heal.

179
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:57,369
-I know.

180
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:58,536
But I'm fine.

181
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,869
UGAKI (ON SPEAKER):
Can you all hear me?

182
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:02,236
[gasping]

183
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:04,803
UGAKI (ON SPEAKER): Allow
me to introduce myself.

184
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:06,369
My name is Ugaki.

185
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:08,669
I am a Bount.

186
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:10,836
My doll's name is Gesell.

187
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:12,603
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

188
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:15,536
ICHIGO: What the hell kind
of game are you playing?

189
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:19,769
-If you just listen, I'd
be happy to tell you.

190
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:22,736
We are in the business
of collecting souls.

191
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,369
Thanks to the Bittos,
we've been able to collect

192
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:27,303
a staggering number of them.

193
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:29,969
Once the Bittos bring us
the concentrated souls,

194
00:13:30,003 --> 00:13:34,236
we ingest them, which in turn
gives our dolls and ourselves

195
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:36,569
unimaginable power.

196
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:38,303
-That's about to come to an end.

197
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:40,236
We're going to destroy
those disgusting bugs!

198
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,969
UGAKI (ON SPEAKER):
How could you possibly

199
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:43,703
call them disgusting?

200
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:45,269
They are the new
dolls that were given

201
00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:49,303
life though Yoshino's death.

202
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:52,069
Absorbing the concentrated
extract of living souls

203
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:56,369
has made it possible for us to
evolve at an incredible rate.

204
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:59,269
Yet despite it all, the
one thing that alludes us

205
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:00,403
is happiness.

206
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:03,036
You treat us as if
we are monsters,

207
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:06,536
completely forgetting
that we were born human.

208
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:09,836
Even when we tried to fit
in, we were ostracized.

209
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:13,003
You tormented us,
treating us like freaks

210
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:15,169
simply because we have
slightly different abilities.

211
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:22,769
Rejected, persecuted,
we have no way

212
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:26,169
to leave descendants
to our legacy.

213
00:14:26,203 --> 00:14:28,569
No matter what, our numbers
will never increase.

214
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:31,269
We can only diminish.

215
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,469
You will never know
how that feels.

216
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:36,336
You can't fathom the pain!

217
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:38,269
-Get over it, will ya?

218
00:14:38,303 --> 00:14:39,236
-Renji!

219
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,769
-All of us have suffered.

220
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:43,736
It's not like we can't
sympathize with your situation.

221
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:45,636
But still, none
of that gives you

222
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:47,969
the right to take the
lives of innocent people!

223
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:01,269
Not that.

224
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,803
That I won't forgive.

225
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,369
-Renji.

226
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:07,436
UGAKI (ON SPEAKER): I had
hope that my words might

227
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:09,603
have made an impression on you.

228
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:13,336
Obviously, I overestimated
your tiny brains.

229
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:15,769
That leaves me no other choice
than to beat the message

230
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:16,803
into you.

231
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:19,103
I'll be waiting in the back.

232
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:21,536
Think you can manage to find me?

233
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:23,136
RENJI: He's making fun of us!

234
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:23,703
ICHIGO: Renji.

235
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:24,903
-Huh?

236
00:15:24,936 --> 00:15:26,769
-I'm coming with you.

237
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:28,703
-I'll come, too!

238
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:29,869
-Not this time.

239
00:15:29,903 --> 00:15:31,269
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:34,203
You need to stay and take care
of Rukia and Rangiku's wounds.

241
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:35,036
-Wait, I can still--

242
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:35,569
-No.

243
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:40,069
-Ichigo.

244
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:43,769
ICHIGO: Renji and I will be
going on from here alone.

245
00:15:43,803 --> 00:15:46,469
Chad, you stay here
with the ladies

246
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:48,869
while Orihime tends
to their wounds.

247
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:50,669
I need you to protect them.

248
00:15:50,703 --> 00:15:51,569
-All right.

249
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:53,136
-Be careful.

250
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:55,003
I think Shuhei and the
others are back there,

251
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:56,803
but it's still dangerous.

252
00:15:56,836 --> 00:16:00,003
I'll catch up to you and Renji
as soon as I've recovered.

253
00:16:00,036 --> 00:16:01,036
-All right then.

254
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:01,603
RIRIN: Wait.

255
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:03,769
What about us?

256
00:16:03,803 --> 00:16:05,103
-Yeah, that's right.

257
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:07,836
I realize that all we've done
till now is cheer you on,

258
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:09,603
but one mustn't
discount the power

259
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,669
of positive reinforcement.

260
00:16:11,703 --> 00:16:14,603
NOBA: Maybe you should
stay out of this.

261
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:17,303
ICHIGO: Ririn, you guys
stay here with the others.

262
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:20,303
RIRIN: Oh, all right.

263
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:22,169
KON: Sweet!

264
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:23,003
Don't worry.

265
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:24,803
Leave everything to me, Ichigo.

266
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:29,369
Rukia, Orihime, and espcially
this wonderfully endowed

267
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:31,836
goddess who just
arrived on the scene,

268
00:16:31,869 --> 00:16:33,269
don't you worry about a thing.

269
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:35,503
They're in good hands.

270
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,769
-Yeah, I'll be counting on you.

271
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:38,769
-Let's go, Renji.

272
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:39,636
-Right.

273
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:40,336
-Huh?

274
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:42,869
Wait a second Hold on!

275
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,036
I was just kidding!

276
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:50,436
ICHIGO: Renji.

277
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,769
RENJI: What is it?

278
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,103
ICHIGO: Are you all right?

279
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:54,536
RENJI: What are
you talking about?

280
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:57,036
ICHIGO: That guy seemed
to get under your skin.

281
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:58,336
RENJI: What, are you kidding me?

282
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:01,303
It takes a lot more than
that to get under my skin.

283
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:04,169
ICHIGO: It's just I know you
were concerned about that kid.

284
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:05,069
-Don't worry about it.

285
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:06,103
I'll be just fine.

286
00:17:06,136 --> 00:17:09,336
It's me we're talking
about, remember?

287
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:12,203
-Then let's get this freak.

-If what Rangiku said is
true, all we got to do

292
00:17:29,203 --> 00:17:30,736
is destroy anything
that's tall enough

293
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:33,036
to cast a shadow to keep
Gesell from developing

294
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,269
into its true form.

295

-Huh?

311
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:41,036
Yeah, well, can't
say that I came away

312
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,803
completely unharmed myself.

But you still saved us.

-Forget about it.

316
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:51,336
Hey, it was our own
fault that we got hurt.

317

We let our guard down.

It multiplies the weight
of whatever it cuts.

And with each additional cut,
it keeps doubling, over and over

again, till finally
it's just dead weight.

00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,903
-[shout]

335
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:26,303
Do it!

336
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:26,803
-Right.

337
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:43,836
--[groan] Stupid Soul Reapers
and your stupid abilities.

338
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:48,703
I'll have to get Gesell
back while I still can.

339
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:50,169
UGAKI (ON SPEAKER):
Gesell, return.

340
00:20:56,836 --> 00:20:59,169
-I'd say that we're
just about even now.

341
00:20:59,203 --> 00:21:00,836
RENJI: Shuhei, Izuru!

342
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:01,836
-What the hell happened?

343
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,569
Are you two all right?

344
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:05,769
[gasping]

345
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:19,036
-Renji, Ichigo, you
two go on ahead.

346
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,203
Yumichika should be there.

347
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:21,436
-Don't worry about us.

348
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:24,036
We'll find a different
route and catch up.

349
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:26,269
-Shuhei!

350
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:27,569
-Follow the doll, find him.

351
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,903
He's probably like a guard dog.

352
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:31,403
We find the Bount
that controls him,

353
00:21:31,436 --> 00:21:34,869
he'll lead us to the
other Bounts we're after.

354
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:35,803
-Let's go.

355
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,336
-Yeah.

356
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:36,836
All right.

357
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:03,303
-What is that?

358
00:22:03,336 --> 00:22:04,436
-It's very old.

359
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:06,303
It was designed for battle.

360
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,203
It's a Quincy artifact, passed
down through generations

361
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:12,103
to a select few for
hundreds of years.

362
00:22:12,136 --> 00:22:13,969
The Department of
Research and Development

363
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:17,769
discovered it and
saved it for study.

364
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,403
Go on, take it.

365
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:21,336
Perhaps it will help.

366
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:25,969
It is said to contain the power
to control spiritual pressure--

367
00:22:26,003 --> 00:22:29,336
that is, if you are
indeed a true Quincy.

368
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:40,211

369
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:08,469
RENJI: I get a big part
in the next episode.

370
00:24:08,502 --> 00:24:09,835
Come to think of
it, nothing good

371
00:24:09,869 --> 00:24:12,302
has happened to me since I came
to the World of the Living.

372
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:13,369
But just watch.

373
00:24:13,402 --> 00:24:14,769
I'm going to show you
how cool I can be.

374
00:24:14,802 --> 00:24:17,735
ICHIGO: Renji, Mr. Hat-and-Clogs
said that before you got out,

375
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:19,902
you've got to clean the
room you've been using.

376
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:20,502
RENJI: OK.

377
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:23,935
[theme music]

378
00:24:31,802 --> 00:24:34,069
RENJI: Illustrated
Guide to Soul Reapers!

379
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:34,969
MAN: Golden!

380
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:36,969
-The Female Soul
Reaper Association

381
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:39,269
is now called to order.

382
00:24:39,302 --> 00:24:46,135
First item-- what is Captain
Kurotsuchi doing here?

383
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:47,569
-Well, Nemu couldn't make it.

384
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:49,735
So I just thought I'd
come as her substitute.

385
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,002
I promise I--

386
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:52,369
-Please leave immediately.

387
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:53,935
-Oh, go on.

388
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:54,635
I'll be--

389
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:56,002
-I said, please leave.

390
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:57,335
-You've got it wrong.

391
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:58,102
That's true.

392
00:24:58,135 --> 00:24:58,635
No, it's not.

393
00:24:58,669 --> 00:24:59,202
Yes, it is.

394
00:24:59,235 --> 00:24:59,735
No, it's not.

395
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:00,402
Yes, it is.

396
00:25:00,435 --> 00:25:02,835
Now, listen. [cries]
