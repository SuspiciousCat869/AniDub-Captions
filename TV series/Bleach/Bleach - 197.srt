00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,456
NARRATOR: Ichigo finally
emerged victorious

3
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:53,789
after a brutal
battle with Grimmjow.

4
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:55,689
But before he could
celebrate his triumph,

5
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:58,323
he was confronted with an
even stronger opponent,

6
00:01:58,356 --> 00:02:00,489
Espada Number Five, Nnoitra.

7
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:02,556
Nelliel had regained
her Espada powers,

8
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,956
but as she attempted to
save Ichigo from Nnoitra,

9
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,989
she reverted to her
helpless childlike form

10
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:09,823
again just as she found herself
on the brink of victory.

11
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:12,923
With no one to help, Ichigo was
left in a desperate situation,

12
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:14,789
and Nnoitra moved
in for the kill.

13
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:17,289
Suddenly, Ichigo was
saved by the last person

14
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:18,489
he expected to see.

15
00:02:18,523 --> 00:02:20,489
ZARAKI: What's going on here?

16
00:02:24,856 --> 00:02:25,523
ICHIGO: Kenpachi.

17
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,089
-So, you next?

18
00:02:40,023 --> 00:02:41,223
Come on.

19
00:02:41,256 --> 00:02:44,789
You're next, right?

20
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:46,856
-Kenpachi, I don't get it.

21
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,089
Why are you here?

22
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:49,423
Am I wrong?

23
00:02:49,456 --> 00:02:53,089
I thought the Soul Society
had pulled out of this fight.

24
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:53,923
-Kisuke Urahara.

25
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:00,556
It seems that a while ago, he
was given a bunch of orders

26
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:01,989
from the old man.

27
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:05,356
That was back when the
showdown was set for winter.

28
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:08,756
Kisuke was ordered to stabilize
this underground cavern called

29
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,956
Garganta.

30
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,556
He was to make sure it
was safe so captain level

31
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:15,423
personnel could pass
through Hueco Mundo.

32
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:19,523
I swear, I already said that
I can more than handle this

33
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:20,156
by myself.

34
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:30,589
So you finally attacked.

35
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:33,089
-I would strongly suggest
that you stand down.

36
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:35,356
We are here only to
heal everyone's wounds.

37
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,889
We have no intention
of fighting you.

38
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:39,756
-Arrancar.

39
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,123
Arrancar.

40
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:42,623
Arrancar.

41
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:49,723
[laughter] Hueco Mundo is
a treasure trove of riches.

42
00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:52,423
BYAKUYA: Were you the one
who fought this woman?

43
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:53,723
-No.

44
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:55,623
I did not fight her.

45
00:03:55,656 --> 00:04:01,589
However, I was about to deliver
the blow that would finish her.

46
00:04:01,623 --> 00:04:02,356
-Were you?

47
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:16,356
-Among all the Espadas
my Sonido is the fastest.

48
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,523
And by adding a small step,
I've created something else,

49
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:24,223
something that resembles
a pseudo clone.

50
00:04:24,256 --> 00:04:27,589
Yes, you might think of
it as playing with magic.

51
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:38,289
Too bad for you
that Gemelos Sonido

52
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:41,223
is not limited to
only two bodies.

53
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:51,689
Farewell, nameless
soul reaper captain.

54
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:54,623
Your defeat was caused
by the arrogant act

55
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:56,189
of not stating your name.

56
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:07,523
-Actually, you are the
arrogant one here, Espada.

57
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:09,489
There's no need to fret.

58
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:11,823
Your arrogance will
not be your undoing.

59
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:13,989
Though you will taste defeat.

60
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:17,089
The reason is simply
a difference in skill.

61
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,856
[panting]

62
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:34,756
-I can't believe how cold it is.

63
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:35,756
I'm so stupid.

64
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:37,723
I should have worn
something heavier.

65
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:40,756
I've got to say, that wasn't
nice of Captain Kuchiki,

66
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:43,356
leaving me the moment
after we showed up.

67
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,523
I thought I made it clear to
him I can't use the Flash Step,

68
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:47,856
but he took off anyway.

69
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,023
I-- [screaming]

70
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,656
That really hurt.

71
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:05,756
I wonder which way
I'm supposed to go.

72
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,623
-What a funny thing to say.

73
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:15,389
I, arrogant?

74
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:23,756
Now, what makes
you believe that?

75
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:27,323
You are an enemy, but
you're also a captain.

76
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:31,389
The fact of the matter is I
consider you to be my equal,

77
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,689
and I have conducted
myself in that manner.

78
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:37,389
I am not an arrogant being.

79
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:39,056
-Now, that's interesting.

80
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,489
-Hm.

81
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:44,856
-Imagine an Arrancar
considering himself my equal.

82
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,456
That attitude already displays
a certain amount of arrogance.

83
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:51,323
-How very rude.

84
00:06:51,356 --> 00:06:53,456
It explains things.

85
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,556
It appears your
arrogance is part

86
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:58,223
of the very nature
of your being.

87
00:06:58,256 --> 00:07:02,789
Very well then, I shall
crush your pride along

88
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,389
with your body.

89
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:08,223
I shall turn them both into
pulp to be discarded along

90
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:09,656
with the rest of the garbage.

91
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:16,356
Subside.

92
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:26,823
Brujeria.

93
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:23,589
You're very jumpy.

94
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:29,489
You expected me to mount
an attack of some kind,

95
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:32,123
but surprisingly,
nothing happened.

96
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:34,456
Now, you're wondering
if my threats are empty.

97
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:38,956
It makes sense.

98
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,323
Unfortunately for
you, they're real.

99
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:54,523
You're left leg
now belongs to me.

100
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:56,223
-What's this supposed to mean?

101
00:08:56,256 --> 00:09:00,156
-All things are subject
to control in this life.

102
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:04,123
Subordinates are under the
control of their superiors.

103
00:09:04,156 --> 00:09:06,923
The masses are under the
control of their king.

104
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:13,223
Clouds are under the
control of the wind.

105
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:16,923
The light of the moon is
under the control of the sun.

106
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,656
The power of my
Brujeria is to control

107
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:22,156
whatever my eye stares at.

108
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:26,156
I call this power Amor, and
you will now experience it.

109
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:31,689
You still appear to
be confused, I see.

110
00:09:31,723 --> 00:09:33,956
I sympathize with
your predicament.

111
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:36,456
It must be frustrating
to try and grasp

112
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:39,323
this concept with a
limited intellect.

113
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,023
Though you don't
get it, your body

114
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:44,123
will experience the full effect.

115
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:46,023
Let me demonstrate.

116
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:50,189
Left leg, come to me.

117
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,423
It is meaningless to resist.

118
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:57,723
Your control does not
extend to that limb.

119
00:09:57,756 --> 00:09:59,456
Now then, another step forward.

120
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,823
-How astonishing.

121
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:11,156
You didn't hesitate
to slash the muscles

122
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:12,956
and tendons of your leg.

123
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:16,556
It really was your
only effective move.

124
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,589
I am now unable to
control that appendage.

125
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:20,389
Excellent.

126
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:22,656
A decision and swift action.

127
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,256
All right then, let's
try something else.

128
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,856
Oh.

129
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:41,456
You're able to move that
well, even on one leg.

130
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:47,089
I have to hand it to you,
captain, I am truly impressed.

131
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:48,556
-Damn you.

132
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:51,123
[panting]

133
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:52,256
-Ah.

134
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:54,556
I think I hear him at
the end of the hall.

135
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,589
Finally, I caught up with you.

136
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,156
That was pretty mean to leave
me behind, Captain Kuchiki.

137
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:02,423
I told you before I wasn't
any good at doing Flash Step.

138
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:04,689
Oh, this has been a
terrible experience.

139
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:07,089
I'm not very fast,
and I was so hungry.

140
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:09,289
And I felt uncomfortable
in this strange building,

141
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:10,923
and it was freezing
cold everywhere I went.

142
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,689
And I didn't know my
way around the inside.

143
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:14,256
And I almost got lost.

144
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,256
And ahh--

145
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:23,456
[gasp] Captain Kuchiki,
you've been injured, sir.

146
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:26,023
Your leg is really bleeding.

147
00:11:26,056 --> 00:11:27,456
What's happened to Miss Rukia?

148
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:28,156
Is she all right?

149
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:28,823
Miss Rukia.

150
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:34,223
-He is quite a chatterbox.

151
00:11:34,256 --> 00:11:36,489
Is he one of your subordinates?

152
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:38,656
-Hanataro Yamada.

153
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:40,089
-Yes, captain.

154
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:41,889
-Stay back.

155
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:43,523
-Yes, I'm moving back right now.

156
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:44,489
I'm very sorry, sir.

157
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:45,689
I'm in the way, aren't I?

158
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:52,389
BYAKUYA: Let me make
myself very clear.

159
00:11:52,423 --> 00:11:53,589
I will say it once more.

160
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:00,423
You have to stay back.

161
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:03,956
I cannot guarantee that I'll be
able to fight without getting

162
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:04,523
you involved.

163
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:26,459
-Captain, both of them appear
to have stabilized now.

164
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:27,926
That's good.

165
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,459
-Isane, it's important
we remain vigilant.

166
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,726
If we had been a little bit
later with our treatment,

167
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,992
we might easily have lost them.

168
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:38,559
If we're not home,
we're in Hueco Mundo.

169
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,192
We have to remind
ourselves we're

170
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,659
in the middle of enemy grounds.

171
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:44,459
There's no telling
what might happen,

172
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:46,326
so we have to be on guard.

173
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,292
-Yes, ma'am.

174
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:52,792
Can you feel that?

175
00:12:52,826 --> 00:12:54,492
It's Captain Kuchiki.

176
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:57,326
UNOHANA: It's not only
his spiritual pressure.

177
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,426
Captain Kurotsuchi
and Captain Zaraki

178
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,859
have also begun to fight.

179
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:07,359
Yes.

180
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:09,926
I can feel the three of them
have their spiritual pressure

181
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,026
operating at full strength.

182
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,326
They're severely challenged.

183
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,392
That's the kind of danger
they face with the Espadas.

184
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:17,226
-I'm worried.

185
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,926
Will they be all right, Captain?

186
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,692
-Let's have faith.

187
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,059
I'm sure they're up for the job.

188
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,392
That's what they're trained for.

189
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:26,892
When they're done, we'll
heal their injuries.

190
00:13:26,926 --> 00:13:29,692
After all, that's what
we're trained for.

191
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:48,326
-You're pretty tough.

192
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,692
I have to give you credit.

193
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,492
-So are you.

194
00:13:52,526 --> 00:13:55,626
I have to ask you though, where
you getting all that strength?

195
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,326
-What is that, Captain Kuchiki?

196
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,826
Captain, are you all right?

197
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:49,759
Ahh.

198
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:50,259
-Oh.

199
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,259
-What's happening?

200
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:58,926
Why did you cut
your arm like that?

201
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,292
-Hado number one.

202
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:02,792
Sho.

203
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:08,926
-Who's there?

204
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,459
Miss Kuchiki.

205
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:15,559
-Stay back, Hanataro Yamada.

206
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:17,459
-Yes, Captain.

207
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:18,959
ZOMMARI: I see.

208
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:20,859
-Miss Rukia, Rukia,
are you all right?

209
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:22,226
Can you hear me?

210
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,626
-You instantly disabled not only
your left leg but your left arm

211
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:26,959
as well.

212
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,459
Once those objects were
out of your control,

213
00:15:29,492 --> 00:15:31,126
you immediately
regarded them as enemies

214
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:36,992
and slashed them, even though
they were part of your body.

215
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:40,226
So coldly analytical,
an impressive display

216
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,192
of detachment in the
face of painful choices.

217
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:48,326
However, that detachment, in my
view, seems dangerously rash.

218
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:53,592
-Rukia, if you can
hear me at all,

219
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:55,126
we have to move you out of here.

220
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,526
Can you open your eyes?

221
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,359
-Of your four limbs, only your
right arm and your right leg

222
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,892
remain functional.

223
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:03,759
Under the circumstances,
you display

224
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:05,459
a high level of arrogance.

225
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:08,059
Considering your disabilities,
challenging an Espada

226
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,892
is hardly a rational act.

227
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:15,192
That must be
apparent, even to you.

228
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:16,626
-As I told you--

229
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:17,992
-Hm.

230
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:20,826
-The difference between
my power and your power

231
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:24,659
is as wide as the gap
between heaven and earth.

232
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,726
But this talk is tedious.

233
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,159
It's true I discarded my
left arm and my left leg,

234
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,892
but even without their use, you
and I are still far from equal.

235
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,126
-How unfortunate.

236
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,059
I thought you might
listen to reason,

237
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:46,292
but you appear to have even less
understanding of your abilities

238
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:48,126
than I first thought.

239
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,192
There was something
I forgot to tell you

240
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,026
when I explained myself.

241
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:55,659
These eyes of mine have fairly
unique and specific powers.

242
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:59,759
They control one
object for each eye.

243
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:03,092
I'm glad you realize so
quickly what that means.

244
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:07,559
Earlier, I released Amor using
just two of my eyes, which

245
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:12,792
means in addition to control
of your two left limbs

246
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:16,059
I have the power to
control something else.

247
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:18,192
And the unpredictability
of this power

248
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:21,426
makes it impossible for
you to defend against it.

249
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:53,126
As I mentioned, I am only able
to control one area per eye.

250
00:17:57,992 --> 00:18:00,926
However, if I control
the head, my control

251
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:03,059
extends to the entire body.

252
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:05,292
It's quite dynamic.

253
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,559
And it's not affected
by a person's injuries.

254
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,159
Don't move.

255
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:24,459
You see the dilemma.

256
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:26,559
Throw down your sword,
Captain Kuchiki.

257
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:34,092
Face the fact you have lost.

258
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,859
Hm.

259
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:47,726
-Bakudo number 61, Rikujokoro.

260
00:18:58,492 --> 00:19:02,126
-What is this?

261
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:04,059
Damn it, I command you.

262
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:04,559
Move.

263
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:07,992
Move.

264
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:09,126
Move.

265
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:11,559
Move.

266
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:14,626
-You wanted to control me.

267
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:19,959
Let me tell you, you don't
have nearly enough power

268
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,359
to ever make that happen.

269
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:27,893
Bankai.

270
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:33,093
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

271
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,627
-What?

272
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,127
What is this?

273
00:19:56,393 --> 00:19:57,860
Damn you.

274
00:19:57,893 --> 00:19:59,027
You want to see power?

275
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,793
I will control everything,
using every ounce of Amor

276
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:12,893
in my spirit.

277
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,627
BYAKUYA: Useless.

278
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,827
According to what
you said earlier,

279
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,560
you can control one
object for each eye.

280
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:27,193
And by my count, you have a
total of 50 eyes on your body.

281
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:33,327
Keeping that in mind,
tell me, with those 50,

282
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,727
which of the hundreds
of millions of swords

283
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,060
covering the sky, do
you intend to control?

284
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,927
You told me earlier it
was meaningless to resist,

285
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,460
that there was
nothing I could do.

286
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:52,627
I'm going to offer you
the same advice now.

287
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,127
Struggle as much as you like,
but it's meaningless to resist.

288
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:01,593
-Damn it.

289
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,927
No.

290
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,160
I'm in control.

291
00:21:05,193 --> 00:21:06,227
Move as I command.

292
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,860
Do you hear me.

293
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:11,793
Move as I command.

294
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,727
-Gokei.

295
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,893

296
00:21:27,693 --> 00:21:29,093
-This can't be happening.

HANATARO (VOICEOVER): That
Espada Zommari Rureaux

299
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,211
ended up looking like a pumpkin.

300

ZOMMARI (VOICEOVER): Yeah.

301
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:23,744
Well, your captain was a tube
of fish cake in his hair.

302
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,844
Pumpkins and fish
cake are both foods.

303
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:27,544
They're at an equal level.

00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:29,844
BYAKUYA (VOICEOVER): Fish
cake is a processed food.

305
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:33,377
It's at a much higher
level than a pumpkin.
