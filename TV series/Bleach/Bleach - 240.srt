1
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:13,533
The Zanpakuto. It's unique
shape an abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,033
The Soul Reaper is able to
harness the power of the
Zanpakuto, by learning its
name and forming a

3
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:23,766
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,833
The Zanpakuto is born with
its Soul Reaper and dies with
its Soul Reaper.

5
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:31,766
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:38,918
It's no good. I can't
sense any Spiritual Pressure.

7
00:02:57,918 --> 00:03:01,584
This is outrageous! What
are you planning to do,
Captain Kurotsuchi?

8
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:04,218
Nothing that really
affects you at this
point.

9
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:08,684
Silence, Lieutenant! I'm
just going to run some tests
on this sample in order to

10
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:11,551
figure out what caused the
Zanpakuto rebellion

11
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:12,551
Nemu...

12
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:13,551
Sir...

13
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,184
Let's begin,
shall we?

14
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:21,418
Please! Hold on
for a second!

15
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,351
Let's talk about this! You
might wanna re-think it a
little more!

16
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:27,184
What will happen to my
Zanpakuto if you just
cut him up?!

17
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:32,884
You know, that's a very
good question. I don't
have the answer, but we
can test to find out.

18
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:34,051
Here we go...

19
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:36,218
Come on, stop
this, just stop!

20
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,951
What is
it now?

21
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,851
He may just be a lab sample
to you, but at the moment,

22
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:43,284
he's the only Zanpakuto
we've captured!

23
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:45,918
Think about what you're doing!
He's all we've got,

24
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:47,684
shouldn't we treat him
a little better?!

25
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:49,118
Mm-hm--Mm-hm!

26
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:51,751
You're beginning
to annoy me.

27
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:54,218
I guess we have no choice.
Nemu...

28
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,384
Yes, Master
Mayuri.

29
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:01,784
Who are you aiming at?!

30
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:04,584
Don't point that thing
at me!

31
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:07,118
You're a crazy girl
stabbing at me like that!

32
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:10,118
Did you forget, I'm not
the one you should be
cutting open?

33
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,984
He's the one you're
supposed to slice up!

34
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:18,084
Sorry, pal The deal's
off. Better you than me!

35
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:22,351
Oh! That's amazing! You can
understand what your Zanpakuto
is saying

36
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,051
even though he's
been gagged?

37
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:27,684
The connection between a
Soul Reaper and his
manifested Zanpakuto

38
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:30,918
is more intricate and complex
than we had ever imagined.

39
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:35,418
Yeah, that's very true! It
isn't easy to comprehend us!
It could take many, many

40
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:38,418
years of research, and
then you could still be
way off-base.

41
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:42,584
Why bother? Experimenting
on us is going to be a big
waste of energy.

42
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,451
That's not necessarily
true.

43
00:04:46,884 --> 00:04:48,251
Huh?!

44
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,584
I believe he's dead.

45
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:08,351
I believe he's dead.

46
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:10,318
What do you mean? How
can he be dead?!

47
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,518
What are you going to do
about my Zanpakuto?! I
want him back!

48
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:19,018
According to the reports, when
a Zanpakuto is killed by its
owner, it reverts back to its
normal state.

49
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:20,851
<i>Yeah?</i>

50
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:24,984
But not this time. You
see, it appears that when
someone other than the
Zanpakuto's owner kills

51
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:27,184
it, a whole different set
of rules apply.

52
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:31,484
Wait a minute! Don't walk
away from me! I'm the owner!

53
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,584
Keep your voice down.
You must be quiet in the
lab.

54
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:39,084
Why do you keep pointing
that thing in my face and

55
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:41,018
exactly why should
I keep it down?

56
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,351
Be quiet.

57
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,051
That's dangerous! Get
away from me!

58
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:45,718
<i>Be quiet.</i>

59
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:48,551
Back off! Get
away! Noooo!

60
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:58,884
Well, it certainly looks like
I'm going to have a lot of
difficult, but intriguing
work ahead of me.

61
00:05:59,884 --> 00:06:03,651
Come on! Pay attention!
We want out! You hear me?!

62
00:06:03,684 --> 00:06:05,951
You women are very mean
and nasty!

63
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:08,584
How can you keep your own
Zanpakuto locked up in here

64
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,184
like we're some kind
of circus animals?!

65
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:11,351
Yeah, what she said!

66
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:15,518
I was hoping they'd be
quiet after we caught
them.

67
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,384
Just take them both away,
please, and deliver them
to Squad Four's barracks.

68
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:23,151
Yes, ma'am, no problem.
We'll get them to the Squad
Four Barracks safely.

69
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:27,318
Hey, what do you think you're
doing?! You can't just let us
be taken away like this!

70
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:29,984
You cruel and heartless
monsters! Hey!

71
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:34,151
Ugh! I can't hear
what you're saying!

72
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:35,518
We should go
as well.

73
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:39,251
Oh, you're right. We
shouldn't waste anymore time
here. Come on.

74
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:39,984
You ready?

75
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:40,984
Yeah.

76
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:51,918
Rangiku...

77
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:55,218
Maybe I'm mistaken, but
I'm not sensing anything.

78
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:57,351
Yeah, I know what
you're saying.

79
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:03,151
I can't sense the Captain's
Spiritual Pressure either.
I know he's not dead, but
where is he?

80
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:04,384
Let's hurry!

81
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:05,284
Right!

82
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:09,451
Huh?

83
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:18,351
Wow! Wasn't I wasn't
expecting that...

84
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:19,918
<i>Are you okay?</i>

85
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:23,851
I'm just fine, thanks for
asking. I feel quite comfy.

86
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,884
Glad you're comfortable, but
can you get off me?!

87
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:30,251
Oh, hey Ichigo. I wondered
what happened to you.

88
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,651
That explains why I
didn't get hurt.

89
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:34,918
Would you mind moving? You're
no lightweight, you know.

90
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:39,118
How rude! Watch your mouth!
Don't speak to a lady like that!

91
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:43,618
Toshiro?

92
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:46,118
Yes. Is my captain all
right?

93
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:48,384
Yeah, you don't have to worry.

94
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:15,384
My master hit me with all
of his strength.

95
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:18,651
It restored my memory, but
it took a toll on him.

96
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,684
Let him rest
for a while.

97
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:30,584
Honestly, my captain
sure is hopeless.

98
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:35,451
I know, but I figure he
must be relieved now. Good
for him.

99
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:03,651
My body still isn't
accustomed to Vasto Lordes.

100
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:16,118
Well. So we meet again.

101
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:21,884
I knew you'd come looking
for me. Ichigo Kurosaki.

102
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:24,051
Huh?

103
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:26,284
What is that supposed
to mean?

104
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:33,851
Whether you choose to admit
it or not, you know we are
linked to one another.

105
00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:36,551
You think that we're
linked?

106
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:44,151
That's correct. Your power will
be very valuable in helping me
to achieve a long term goal.

107
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,651
I'm sure you know what I
mean...

108
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:51,951
If not--let me remind you
that your excess power
doesn't have anywhere to
go.

109
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:56,684
What are you talking about?
As far as I'm concerned, I
know one thing.

110
00:09:58,118 --> 00:10:02,984
I'm determined to defeat you.
That is the only business I
have with you.

111
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:05,951
How foolish.

112
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:13,318
What is he doing? Is he
trying to take control of
Zangetsu again?

113
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:14,718
<i>Do not worry!</i>

114
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:20,451
He no longer has even the
least bit of control over
my mind.

115
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:25,251
He speaks directly to one
subconscious, but now that I
know his voice...

116
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:30,084
His corruption will not have
an effect on me. I am now
immune to his influence.

117
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:34,018
So, just let him try and see
how far he gets.

118
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:40,618
How very strange, it looks
like you're no longer afraid
to face me.

119
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:42,884
That will be a
fatal mistake.

120
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:46,484
Something's wrong
with that guy.

121
00:10:46,518 --> 00:10:52,284
Not only is he acting
weird, but his Spiritual
Pressure is unstable, as
well.

122
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:56,584
I am not as incapacitated
as you think.

123
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:01,684
Dammit, not
this again.

124
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:05,351
What did he
just do?

125
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:08,518
What happened?
I've gone stiff!

126
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:14,651
It's useless.

127
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:18,618
What?!

128
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:20,284
What's going on?

129
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:24,084
This power isn't
enough to sustain me!

130
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:34,984
What?

131
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,184
Are... you a...

132
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:41,618
...Zanpakuto?

133
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:43,218
Looks like you're right.

134
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:54,284
Tell me now! Whose
Zanpakuto are you?!

135
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:00,751
So you refuse to
answer me, huh?

136
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:04,151
You will find out
soon enough.

137
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:07,518
Scatter...

138
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:10,518
His Spiritual Pressure.

139
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,384
Senbonzakura!

140
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:25,129
Scatter...

141
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:31,896
Senbonzakura!

142
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:39,562
It's Byakuya's!

143
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:50,062
Bakudo Number
Thirty-Nine! Enkosen!

144
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:52,896
Watch out!

145
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:03,029
I sure haven't forgotten
that power.

146
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:07,596
Byakuya's Zanpakuto
Senbonzakura!

147
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:11,996
So you remember me.
Ichigo Kurosaki.

148
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,529
Whoa!

149
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,829
Yeah, I sense it too.
There was a sudden rise
in Spiritual Pressure.

150
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:23,896
I've felt this pressure
before.

151
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,129
Me too. If I'm
not mistaken...

152
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:29,062
Yeah, it has to
be Captain Kuchiki.

153
00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:30,796
Hey, look.

154
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:33,362
Sorry, we didn't know
you were here, sir.

155
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:42,896
What is this?

156
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:45,229
What do you think
he's here for?

157
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:47,829
Wait, why are
you... doing this?

158
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,862
Stand back.

159
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:01,696
Hmph!

160
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:07,862
It all makes sense now. Your
Spiritual Pressure's the same
as Byakuya's.

161
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:27,796
Which means you're the one
who attacked me last
night, right?

162
00:14:30,362 --> 00:14:32,729
You don't want to give me
an answer?

163
00:14:32,762 --> 00:14:34,429
Fine with me.

164
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:49,762
There you are!

165
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:58,429
Did you really think you
could defeat me with such
a cheap trick?

166
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:00,329
Not even close!

167
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,129
Not very impressive.

168
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,196
Brings back memories...

169
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:40,096
... My fight with
Byakuya.

170
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:47,829
Getsuga tensho!!!!!

171
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:16,229
You are good!
Let's test your ability!
Gokei Senbonzakura Kageyoshi!

172
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:19,462
What?!

173
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:26,329
Kageyoshi has a billion
blades. They surround
the enemy in a revolving
sphere, and cut in every

174
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:32,129
direction. I suspect this
is the first time you
ha've had to deal with
this, am I right?

175
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:35,562
I've got him now!

176
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,296
Ichigo!

177
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:47,262
I am impressed.
Ichigo Kurosaki.

178
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:50,929
...There you are, still
standing after that
attack.

179
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:58,962
I don't have a choice. If
I don't kill him, he'll
kill me!

180
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:07,762
Sorry, Byakuya. I have
to destroy your Zanpakuto.

181
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:10,262
Please forgive me.

182
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:18,762
Why do you hesitate? If you
do not plan to attack, then
I will.

183
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:21,862
I'm not hesitating.

184
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:26,162
Senkei Senbonzakura
Kageyoshi.

185
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,662
Getsuga...

186
00:17:37,196 --> 00:17:38,896
... tensho!!!

187
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:15,762
As you hesitated, I was
able to gather enough Spirit
Energy to withstand your attack.

188
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,462
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

189
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:26,296
What?! It
can't be!

190
00:18:27,129 --> 00:18:29,829
Sorry, Senbonzakura...

191
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:34,162
I'm not sure this would
have happened if you and
Byakuya had come at me
together...

192
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,362
...But without him, your
Spirit Energy wasn't strong
enough to defeat me.

193
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:46,662
You have humiliated me.
And I shall make you
regret that!

194
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:51,096
You just don't
give up, do you?

195
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:55,529
Do not be so condescending,
you disrespectful--

196
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:02,062
That's enough.

197
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:03,929
Byakuya!

198
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:16,062
Captain Kuchiki!

199
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:21,062
As far as I know, he's
been missing a long time.
I wonder where he's been.

200
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:37,429
Sorry, Byakuya. I decided to
take care of your Zanpakuto
since you were gone.

201
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:43,096
Ichigo. Step aside.

202
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:46,429
You want to fight him
yourself?

203
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:50,596
Well, he is your Zanpakuto,
so it probably makes more
sense for you to take him on.

204
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:53,729
You are misinterpreting
my intentions.

205
00:19:54,096 --> 00:19:55,462
Which are...?

206
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:58,896
Hado Number Thirty-three,
Sokatsui!

207
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:04,962
Captain Kuchiki

208
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,596
What are you
doing?!

209
00:20:08,562 --> 00:20:12,929
Hey, what's going on?!
Answer me, Byakuya.

210
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:18,596
What the---?

211
00:20:20,062 --> 00:20:25,562
Ichigo Kurosaki. I will not
allow you to decide the fate
of this Zanpakuto.

212
00:20:26,162 --> 00:20:27,462
What is he thinking?

213
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:35,596
Hold on a minute! Have you
joined up with Muramasa?! Is
that what this is all about?!

214
00:20:36,796 --> 00:20:39,729
Or have you gone and
surrendered to your
Zanpakuto?!

215
00:20:41,462 --> 00:20:47,529
Surrender? I would will
never surrender to a
Zanpakuto, no matter what
the circumstance.

216
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,962
I have made this decision
after much thought.

217
00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:57,929
You and many other Soul
Reapers were witnesses,
watching as the Zanpakuto
released themselves. Once

218
00:20:57,962 --> 00:21:00,729
they were free, they set
their own goals...

219
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:03,496
and then they soon
followed their desires.

220
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,329
I understand their
motivation...

221
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:11,362
I too, am free.. to
follow my desires,
wherever they take me.

222
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:23,296
You say very interesting
things, Soul Reaper. So
tell me, what are your
desires?

223
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:28,929
Perhaps there's one
stronger than the rest.
I'm wondering which one
motivates you the most?

224
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:31,429
It is really quite
simple.

225
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:33,729
My desire...

226
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:38,562
Is to uphold my self respect.
That is all.

227
00:21:41,962 --> 00:21:45,929
Ichigo. You will not
interfere with Muramasa.

228
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:47,962
If you can't live with
that...

229
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:53,829
...then be prepared to
die.

230
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:09,429
Byakuya!

231
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:49,447
It appears that Captain
Kuchiki has betrayed us.

232
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,114
<i>I've always wanted to</i>
<i>experiment on him and</i>
<i>now's our chance! Let's</i>
<i>go catch him! Get a</i>

233
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:56,247
<i>basket, a stick and some</i>
<i>bread crumbs!</i>

234
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,147
A photo of Rukia Kuchiki
might be more effective.

235
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,614
<i>A brilliant idea!</i>

236
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,714
<i>Are you serious?</i>
