[THEME SONG IN JAPANESE - "AFTER
DARK"]

2
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:50,281
NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

3
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:52,415
who was kidnapped
by the Arrancars,

4
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:55,048
Ichigo, Chad, Uryu,
Rukia and Renji

5
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,815
have snuck into Hueco Mundo.

6
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,715
On their journey to
Aizen's fortress,

7
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:00,481
they struggled against
endless attacks

8
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:02,248
from the Arrancar forces.

9
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:04,181
Upon breaking into the
fortress, the group

10
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:06,881
took five different paths
in search of Orihime.

11
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:08,881
Each of them
encountered an Arrancar

12
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:13,448
who, unknown to Ichigo and the
others, had been lying in wait.

13
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,048
A fierce battle begins.

14
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:20,181
Uryu is in a perilous
situation, as he

15
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:24,015
fights with Arrancar number
105, Cirucci Sanderwicci,

16
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:27,415
and her devastating
weapon, Golondrina.

17
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,915
Pesche, who has become lost
while searching for Nel,

18
00:02:29,948 --> 00:02:32,081
walks right into the
middle of the fight,

19
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:33,815
and is surprisingly
able to help.

20
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,548
Furious, Cirucci initiates
her release state,

21
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:41,015
and the battle intensifies.

22
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,281
-Rip, Golondrina!

23
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:00,515
Which one of you shall
I slice up first?

24
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:07,248
Woo-hoo-hoo!

25
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:08,215
Ha!

26
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:09,815
Not so fast, four-eyes!

27
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:11,548
I haven't started carving yet.

28
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:23,715
-I see.

29
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:25,481
Those wings are shielding
her from my attacks.

30
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:28,748
That explains the reverberation
I've been hearing.

31
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,381
Those feathers are all
vibrating at very high speeds.

32
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,115
-All right!

33
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:39,681
Let's see you get
away from this!

34
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:41,181
-I have no choice.

35
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:58,148
-(GASPING) No!

36
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:00,648
What the hell?

37
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:01,648
What is that?

38
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,548
-It's too bad.

39
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,848
I was really hoping to
hold off on using this

40
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:11,281
until much later in the battle.

41
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:15,748
So, shall we continue?

42
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:28,815
I'm glad that I
took precautions.

43
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:31,248
-Huh?

44
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:35,948
-Before Kisuke and I
snuck out of the hospital,

45
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:38,581
I took a few useful items.

46
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:42,381
Using Kisuke's skills, we were
able to find a hidden storeroom

47
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,648
where I borrowed this.

48
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:51,848
Seele Schneider, the only
bladed quincy weapon!

49
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,648
It cuts through spirit pressure.

50
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:00,848
-He borrowed it from
a hidden storeroom

51
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:02,815
without getting permission?

52
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:04,981
You-- you thief!

53
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:06,848
-Shut up, will you?

54
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:08,248
Did you actually
ever hear me say

55
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:10,015
that I took it
without permission?

56
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,281
-Well then, did you
take it with permission?

57
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:13,448
-No, I didn't!

58
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,548
-See?

59
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:15,815
You took it without
permission, you thief!

60
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,348
URYU: I don't believe this.

61
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,681
Whose side are you on?

62
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:19,315
Argh!

63
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:20,681
Shut up, already!

64
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:22,981
-How can you talk to someone
like that who saved your life?

65
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:24,415
You're pathetic, Ichigo!

66
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:26,115
-I'm Uryu!

67
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:27,048
-What?

68
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:29,181
-How can you be this stupid?

69
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,015
-So, you're Uryu, huh?

70
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:32,415
-Yes, that's right!

71
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:36,115
-Say for a moment you are
Uryu, then who is Ishida?

72
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:39,315
-I told you before,
I'm Uryu Ishida!

73
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:40,448
-Ah ha!

74
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:41,515
I see!

75
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,815
Which means that
you're not Ishida Uryu!

76
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,348
-Just drop it, OK?

77
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:47,315
-You're a quincy.

78
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,515
Hm.

79
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:57,248
Look at you, a quincy
standing right before me.

80
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:58,915
-You know about us?

81
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:01,248
I suppose I should be honored.

82
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,748
-I know about them.

83
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:07,681
They're that poor tribe that was
wiped out by the soul reapers.

84
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:11,415
But that's all I
know about them.

85
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:12,581
-You're exactly right.

86
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,181
-So tell me, quincy,
why would someone

87
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:26,248
like you want to
help a soul reaper?

88
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:29,248
I find that hard to comprehend!

89
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:31,815
-Look, I don't have
to answer to you.

90
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:35,248
I suggest that you pay
attention to those wings instead

91
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:36,548
of the history of my tribe.

92
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:45,781
Did you forget about earlier?

93
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:48,681
That wasn't a fluke
or a temporary rise

94
00:06:48,715 --> 00:06:51,181
in spiritual pressure.

95
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:52,148
-Whew!

96
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:53,448
You were in the air
so long I didn't

97
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,281
think you'd ever come down!

98
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,115
-Do you think you could
be quiet for five minutes?

99
00:06:58,148 --> 00:06:59,215
-Hoo!

100
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:00,781
I save you and this is
the gratitude I get?

101
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:08,048
-High-speed vibrations
are destroyed

102
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:11,815
by even greater
high-speed vibrations.

103
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,348
Seele Schneider is also
known as a soul cutter,

104
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:16,581
and is made of Reishi.

105
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:18,581
The Reishi that
make up its blade

106
00:07:18,615 --> 00:07:22,915
oscillate at three million
revolutions per second.

107
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:26,015
Quincies are skilled
at perceiving Reishi.

108
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:29,648
From what I can see, the Reishi
on the surface of your feathers

109
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:35,181
oscillate at about 1.1 to 1.3
million revolutions per second.

110
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:39,481
That's less than half
of Seele Schneider.

111
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:41,548
-So, in short,
what you're telling

112
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:44,848
me is that my feathers won't
work against you anymore.

113
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,715
Is that right?

114
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:47,748
-Yes.

115
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:48,381
That's correct.

116
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:52,315
-Well, OK then.

117
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:09,048
That's quite a
surprise, Cirucci.

118
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,948
I never would have guessed
it you could freely

119
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:13,848
shed your released
form in that way.

120
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:17,248
Can all Arrancars do that?

121
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:19,915
-We can't freely do this.

122
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:22,215
I discarded it.

123
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:25,015
-What?

124
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:27,981
-I can't go back
to that form again.

125
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:31,481
The formal name for our
release is Resurreccion.

126
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:33,448
It means "returning blade."

127
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,881
It resembles a regular
sword when sealed.

128
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,915
It enables us to
become manifestations

129
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:40,948
of our former Hollow selves.

130
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:43,148
The only way we return
to our normal form

131
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:47,481
again is by returning our
abilities back into sword form

132
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:49,381
again.

133
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:52,215
Changing our forms without
returning powers back

134
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:55,315
into the sword would
cause serious damage

135
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:58,215
like losing an arm.

136
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:01,148
I'm very bad at
conserving energy.

137
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:04,081
You'd be surprised at how
much spirit energy I end up

138
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:07,715
expending by wearing
these arms and feathers.

139
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,081
It's immense.

140
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,781
So if I can't use them, then
I might as well discard them!

141
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:20,362
This will enable me to
concentrate my spirit energy...

142
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:32,648
...into one powerful attack.

143
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:36,481
-Tell me, Cirucci Sanderwicci,
is this battle so important

144
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:38,648
that you'd go this
far to win it,

145
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:40,848
to lose your arms and feathers?

146
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:41,915
-Huh?

147
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,281
Don't you have a brain
inside that head?

148
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:45,315
Think about it.

149
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:46,881
If we didn't have
to win, we wouldn't

150
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:48,815
have started a war
in the first place!

151
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:54,315
An Arrancar is a loyal soldier.

152
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:56,981
They obey their
commanders, the Espada.

153
00:09:57,015 --> 00:10:00,348
We were born to defeat and
kill every single enemy.

154
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:04,115
To be defeated is unforgivable!

155
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,615
In our world, there's
no such thing!

156
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:33,015
This is a lot of fun!

157
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:34,848
I should have done it sooner!

158
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,281
Take this!

159
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:52,348
There!

160
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:10,215
When I stop and think
about it, quincy,

161
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:11,848
I really don't have
any desire at all

162
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,515
to fight you in a
form that leaves

163
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,681
me so vulnerable to
attacks from your sword.

164
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,015
If we both have swords
with equal power,

165
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:26,215
then the one with the
longer reach will win.

166
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:30,481
How about it?

167
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:32,515
Do you surrender?

168
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:35,281
-Both with equal power?

169
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:36,581
I think you are mistaken.

170
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,481
Seele Schneider's
Reishi vibrations

171
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:42,781
aren't meant for cutting.

172
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:48,348
Its vibrations weaken the bonds
that hold Reishi in place,

173
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:50,015
making it easier to steal.

174
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:52,448
I collect all of that
Reishi from my opponent.

175
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:03,948
The way a quincy battles is
by gathering all of the Reishi

176
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:09,615
from the surrounding area, and
then utilizing it as a weapon.

177
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:12,815
That which is the most powerful
embodiment of this method

178
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:16,981
is right before you,
the Seele Schneider.

179
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:20,081
All of your Reishi
belongs to me now!

180
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:29,248
-Not a chance, quincy!

181
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,315
-Also!

182
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:34,015
You've got another thing wrong.

183
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:36,781
You should be aware that Seele
Schneider is not a sword.

184
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:43,848
Quincies don't use any weapons
other than bows and arrows.

185
00:12:56,681 --> 00:13:01,581
You cannot win,
Cirucci Sanderwicci.

186
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,915
As you said, one's reach
was the winning factor!

187
00:13:44,838 --> 00:13:47,271
All right, let's go, Pesche.

188
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:48,804
-Are you sure?

189
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:50,371
I don't think she's dead yet.

190
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:52,338
-As you see, I defeated her.

191
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:54,504
Now, as the victor,
it's up to me

192
00:13:54,538 --> 00:13:57,704
to decide what fate
awaits this worthy foe.

193
00:13:57,738 --> 00:14:00,338
I pierced her soul
chain, the source

194
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:03,004
of spirit energy production.

195
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:04,838
Arrancars are
Hollows who've gained

196
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:07,038
the powers of soul reapers.

197
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:10,371
Their anatomy should be alike.

198
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:13,371
I don't know how she feels
about it, but letting her live

199
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:17,171
may be an even greater
insult than death.

200
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:19,071
But I assure you,
I have no intention

201
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:21,371
of playing by their rules.

202
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:24,804
Even if she recovers and
decides to come for her revenge,

203
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:28,704
the truth is, she won't
have the power to fight me.

204
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:29,904
-I see.

205
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:33,504
If that's the case, that's fine.

206
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:34,538
C'mon!

207
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:35,804
Let's go, Ichigo!

208
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:36,738
URYU: I'm Uryu!

209
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:56,138
-Damn quincy.

210
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:57,271
Damn him!

211
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:58,538
That quincy!

212
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:01,738
How can he insult me like that?

213
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:05,271
RUDBORNN: Cirucci Sanderwicci!

214
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,738
We've come for you.

215
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:13,238
Please, do not resist.

216
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:21,038
CIRUCCI: Dammit!

217
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:34,804
GANTENBAINNE: Pathetic.

218
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,938
You are completely loco, man.

219
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:43,538
There's no way you could
ever be a match for me.

220
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:47,438
I am Arrancar number 107,
Gantenbainne Mosqeda!

221
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:03,704
That'll never work.

222
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:09,271
A human who can't
even use a Sonido

223
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:11,971
will never connect with
his weak little punches!

224
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,571
I've tried to tell
you again and again,

225
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:25,638
but you're just too
stubborn to listen.

226
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:41,071
If you still want to fight,
I won't try to stop you.

227
00:16:41,104 --> 00:16:43,638
But you should know--
you're gonna die.

228
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,638
-We'll see about that.

229
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:50,871
My plan's to win.

230
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:24,338
-You'll need more
than strength, Sado.

231
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:26,804
You'll find that attacks
like mine are hard to beat.

232
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:35,671
Like I said before,
you're going to die, man.

233
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:38,704
-Yeah, well, I'm not going
to give up that easily.

234
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:46,271
-You got guts, man.

235
00:17:46,304 --> 00:17:47,771
There's no doubt about it.

236
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:23,138
-I told you, I'm
not ready to die.

237
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,438
-Now I understand.

238
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:31,338
I can see where you're
coming from, Sado.

239
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:34,371
What you really want is an
all-out fight with everything

240
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,504
I've got.

241
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:36,871
-I'm ready.

242
00:18:36,904 --> 00:18:41,604
Time to fight at full strength
so I can move on from here.

243
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:42,571
-Sounds like fun.

244
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:57,538
I'm not done yet.

245
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,313
You idiot!

246
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:41,813
Uno!

247
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:47,413
Dos!

248
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,046
Cientos!

249
00:20:22,413 --> 00:20:24,980
Get on your feet, Yasutora Sado.

250
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:26,613
Get up right now.

251
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:29,746
I know what you're
doing, hiding your power,

252
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,946
the true strength you possess.

253
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,346
Yes, you are very strong.

254
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,780
Someone like you shouldn't
be fighting like this.

255
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:42,980
This should be a fair fight.

256
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:46,113
So use all your strength,
and don't hold back!

257
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,613
No answer.

258
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:56,713
Is that it?

259
00:20:56,746 --> 00:20:58,646
You're breaking my heart, buddy!

260
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,246
-Sorry.

261
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,680
In truth, I wasn't
trying to hide it.

262
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,846
It's just that, ever since
I came to Hueco Mundo,

263
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,580
I sensed something
about my power,

264
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:33,346
something different from when I
was in the world of the living.

265
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:40,080
I was puzzled by
that difference,

266
00:21:40,113 --> 00:21:46,080
and I wasn't able to control
all of my power until now.

267
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:49,646
But I have finally
gained control of it.

268
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,146
The time has come,
and I can fight

269
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,346
with my full power from now
on-- Brazo Derecha del Gigante.

270
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,446
Take note.

271
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,180
What you see is my right
arm, but in its true form.

272
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,413
[END THEME IN JAPANESE -
"KANSHA"]

273
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:49,944
SADO: Ichigo and the others
have Nel in her group with them.

274
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:52,444
They're all together,
but no one's come to me.

275
00:23:52,477 --> 00:23:55,910
URYU: If you're jealous, I'll
trade places with you any time.

276
00:23:55,944 --> 00:23:57,410
PESCHE: What're
you saying, Ichigo?

277
00:23:57,444 --> 00:23:58,344
We're best friends!

278
00:23:58,377 --> 00:23:59,477
URYU: Oh yeah?

279
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,010
Well a best friend would
never get my name wrong!
