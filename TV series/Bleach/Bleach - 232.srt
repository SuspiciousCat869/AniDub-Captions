1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,986
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,533
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:22,766
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,400
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:31,100
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:24,239
Where do you want this
one?

7
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:25,739
Over there, against that
wall.

8
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,073
Uh-Brother??!

9
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,706
Hunh?! Rukia!!

10
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:42,506
You had me worried there!

11
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,139
But you're here! And
you look great! You've
recovered from that
beating you took---

12
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:48,006
Renji, stop it!

13
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:49,773
<i>I said stop!!</i>

14
00:02:49,806 --> 00:02:53,306
I'm still shaky from
what happened, so don't
touch me! Got it?

15
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,539
Right. Got it.

16
00:02:55,939 --> 00:03:00,073
I'm glad to see you
made it back. Most of our
Captains, are here now.

17
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:03,006
What about my brother?
Captain Kuchiki?

18
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,706
Oh, right.

19
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,939
There's a search party out
looking for him, but we
haven't heard anything
from them yet.

20
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,873
Hey don't worry.

21
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:16,506
There's no way the
captain would get killed
in a little skirmish like
this one.

22
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,139
You're right.

23
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:43,073
This night marks the end
of the Soul Reapers'
reign over the Zanpakuto.

24
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:45,873
From now on...

25
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:50,673
It'll be the
Zanpakuto who rule
over the Soul Reapers!

26
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:57,806
Brother!

27
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,073
Leave.

28
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,473
I will not repeat myself.

29
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:17,673
No brother! No..!

30
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:21,839
He's alive. He's
got to be.

31
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:44,706
Stop that!!

32
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:54,473
That's enough,
Sodenoshirayuki!

33
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:03,506
Rukia Kuchiki... I will
no longer tolerate your
demands.

34
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:06,039
Oh? That so?

35
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:10,606
All right.

36
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,839
Like Kisuke told us, we
have got to stay alert here.

37
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,106
Right.

38
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,306
If you sense any change
in Zangetsu, retreat.

39
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:21,139
Don't worry, Zangetsu
will be fine.

40
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:25,606
I know that Zangetsu is
special. I know he means
a lot to you.

41
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,073
That's right.

42
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:30,706
But the same can be said
for all Soul Reapers.

43
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:33,306
Everyone thinks their
Zanpakuto is special.

44
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:40,373
Just be careful, okay?
I'm going to check on
how the Stealth Force
is doing.

45
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,039
All right. See
you then.

46
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:43,039
See ya.

47
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:04,339
You no longer control me.
I am free now.

48
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:09,806
You may choose not to
believe it, but you may
no longer keep me from
doing anything.

49
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:15,806
I see. But why use your
new freedom to hurt
others who are innocent?

50
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:20,039
From now on, I will only
do as I please.

51
00:06:20,073 --> 00:06:24,239
And I will not spare the
life of anyone who gets
in my way.

52
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:32,506
There's something you
should know. I have no
desire at all to fight
with you.

53
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:35,873
However...

54
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:47,073
Dance, Sodenoshirayuki!

55
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:56,173
So it's true. I
can't do Shikai.

56
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:58,806
Of course you can't.

57
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:04,406
My energizing spirit no
longer lives in your
sword.

58
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:12,473
Until now, you had the
ability to harness my
power as a Zanpakuto
whenever you wished...

59
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:15,739
And I graciously allowed
you to do so.

60
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:21,939
We allowed it... Because
we Zanpakuto had no
choice in the matter.

61
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:24,239
I never thought of
it that way...

62
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:35,573
Well from here on,
Things will be very
different...

63
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:43,373
Now it's time... Time
to use my power for me.
However I choose.

64
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:50,473
You thought all of your
power came from within.
You truly believed that
it all came from you.

65
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:53,773
You are sadly mistaken.

66
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,706
For you see, without
me, you can do nothing!

67
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:59,406
I never thought that all
of it was just my power!

68
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,139
Somenomai Tsukishiro.

69
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,239
Impossible!
Tukishiro's freezing
range should only be--

70
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:19,673
Should only be the area
between the earth and sky
within range of its
blade.

71
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:21,506
Was that your thought?

72
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:29,706
Wait, you must stop!

73
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:46,406
You really believe it
You think without you,
I can do nothing?!

74
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:56,339
All things of the
universe that fly, that
which names all!

75
00:08:56,373 --> 00:09:02,106
In the name of truth and
temperance, dig your
claws into the wall of
sinless dreams!

76
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,139
Hado Number Thirty
Three!

77
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:05,806
Sokatsui!

78
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,106
It can't be!

79
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:26,473
How did you do that?
You stopped...

80
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:28,473
Sokatsui?!

81
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,539
You look shocked. Does it
really surprise you I
possess such power? Since
you obviously continue to

82
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:40,206
underestimate me, I will
gladly open your eyes to
my capabilities.

83
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:55,406
My sword...

84
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:08,206
Look at you... One of the
most beautiful beings in
all of the Soul Society.

85
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:15,029
Why are you filled with
such hate? You seek to
destroy life and have nothing
but pure venom for me.

86
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:18,639
Haven't we always
existed as one?

87
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:27,339
After all, haven't we
always existed peacefully
as one?

88
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:07,630
Is it true? Have I
monopolized your power?
Have I caused you to
suffer?

89
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:20,604
You should know...

90
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:23,937
Whenever you reflect on
the past, as you just
did...

91
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:26,704
You leave yourself open
for an attack.

92
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:55,104
Tsuginomai Hakuren!

93
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:16,278
Tsuginomai Hakuren!

94
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:41,578
Ichigo.

95
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:47,078
And just what are you
doing here?! It's too
dangerous when we still
don't know enough about

96
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:49,245
why the Zanpakuto are
turning against us!

97
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,345
Shut up!- You think I
could just sit back and
wait?

98
00:12:56,045 --> 00:13:01,145
Don't worry, Rukia. We
may not know the reason
yet, but you know we're
gonna find the answer.

99
00:13:03,578 --> 00:13:05,411
I hope so.

100
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:12,445
Welcome Substitute Soul
Reaper.

101
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:13,711
Not her!

102
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:16,011
She's strong.
Be careful.

103
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,778
I know that.

104
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:22,178
I mean, after all...She
is your Zanpakuto!

105
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:42,178
Why are you holding back?

106
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:52,278
Oh I see. Because you
know that I am Rukia
Kuchiki's Zanpakuto, you
have decided that you

107
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:55,045
<i>want to go easy on</i>
<i>me... Right?</i>

108
00:13:55,378 --> 00:13:57,378
A poor choice.

109
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:06,745
I will soon make you
regret it.

110
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:10,511
Somenomai Tsukishiro.

111
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,211
Wha---

112
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:17,911
Ichigo! Get out of
there! Quickly!

113
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:45,811
Ichigo!

114
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:10,245
Does the ice hurt?

115
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:16,445
So substitute Soul
Reaper... You have you
chosen to come all the
way to the Soul Society

116
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:18,478
to protect Rukia Kuchiki?

117
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:20,778
What the hell's it
matter to you?

118
00:15:21,678 --> 00:15:23,811
You're a fool.

119
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:25,411
You think so?

120
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:41,111
It's hard to imagine
what you can do with a
frozen arm. Since it's
clear you're still

121
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:43,111
<i>hesitant about trying to</i>
<i>kill me.</i>

122
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:44,345
Shut up!

123
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:54,145
Since you insist, I shall
teach you that such
indecisiveness on your
part, results in death.

124
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:16,311
Rukia!

125
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:28,178
Hey!

126
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:31,145
Rukia!

127
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:32,911
Stay out of this!

128
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,845
Why have you interfered?

129
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:41,945
Sodeno Shirayuki. If you
feel hatred, direct it at
me!

130
00:16:42,745 --> 00:16:47,478
You are quite correct, I
do hate you... That is
why he must die.

131
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:54,945
Killing him is the best
way to make you truly
suffer. I shall take
away everything and

132
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:58,978
everyone that is dear to
you. Your family. Your
friends.

133
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:01,811
And your pride in being a
Soul Reaper.

134
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:06,578
And all you will be
able to do is painfully
watch.

135
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:10,878
I see. You truly
are my Zanpakuto.

136
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:15,278
You know me so well; you
can hurt me deeper than
anyone can.

137
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:19,311
You are beautiful...

138
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:27,778
That always filled me with
such pride. It made me smile
having such a beautiful
Zanpakuto for my sword.

139
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:30,211
I am not just one of your
belongings.

140
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:35,211
You are right. You
are now free.

141
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:38,478
Rukia?

142
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:42,811
I now release you!

143
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:43,678
What?!

144
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:46,345
It is now time to put
away your anger.

145
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:55,845
Thank you for the time we
have shared. As one we
were great.

146
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:59,845
You are saying you will
go on without me?

147
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,345
I am.

148
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:07,845
Even if going on without
you causes me to lose
everything.

149
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:12,111
And if I have to return
to the Rukon District,
then I will.

150
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:21,711
Mask of flesh and
blood--

151
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:25,378
Can it be? You
seriously intend to
destroy me?

152
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:30,011
Carriage of Thunder...
Gap of the spinning
wheel...

153
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:34,011
You really believe you
can live and survive
without me being here?!

154
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:37,011
Carve twin lotuses into
the wall of blue flame.

155
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:38,445
What?!

156
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:46,745
Bakudo Number:
Sixty-One! Rikujokoro!

157
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:59,345
This I know... I can never
forgive anyone that attempts
to destroy what I must protect.
So it shall be.

158
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:05,511
I'm not afraid to lose,
to let go of everything.

159
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,678
You are willing to do
that?

160
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:15,045
I shall let go of everything.
My anger. My hatred. My sadness.

161
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:19,078
You are not me.
We are separate.

162
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:22,311
You are no longer a part
of me.

163
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:23,645
No don't!

164
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:31,111
I release you to be
free. You who were once
a part of me,
Sodenoshirayuki.

165
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:37,311
Your beauty. The power
you gave me as a Soul
Reaper. The memories
of what we achieved

166
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:40,445
together. Everything
in our past.

167
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:47,311
I now let go of it all.
All of it, because all
of what we shared has
become a burden to

168
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:49,778
me and to you.

169
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:54,578
You must stop!...No!

170
00:19:55,945 --> 00:20:00,511
Sodenoshirayuki. You are
now free forever.

171
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:05,578
Hado Number
Seventy-Three:
Sorensokatsui!

172
00:20:18,145 --> 00:20:19,945
Rukia!

173
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:29,845
How could you do
this?...I never imagined
you would possess the
strength to let go of me.

174
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:35,511
A Soul Reaper can never
go into battle if they
are consumed by the fear
of what they could lose.

175
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:42,611
Even if that means losing
the life's blood of a
Soul Reaper. One's
Zanpakuto.

176
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:44,978
Rukia Kuchiki.

177
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,845
Farewell my Zanpakuto.

178
00:20:52,145 --> 00:20:54,545
Rukia Kuchiki!

179
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:00,511
<i>You really intended to</i>
<i>die begging like this?</i>

180
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:06,611
Rukia!

181
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:14,878
You okay?

182
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:20,378
That was quite a
spectacle.

183
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:41,811
I didn't expect your
friend to risk so much.
But witnessing this
will prove useful for

184
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:43,211
future reference.

185
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:44,778
Who the hell are you?!

186
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:50,078
Muramasa.

187
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:52,645
Muramasa?? What
do you want?!...

188
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,311
I've never seen you
before. You a Soul
Reaper?

189
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:05,245
Hardly. I am...

190
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:07,745
A Zanpakuto.

191
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:51,581
I thought Zanpakuto are
supposed to look a lot
like as their masters.
But Sodenoshirayuki looks

192
00:23:51,614 --> 00:23:52,747
nothing like you.

193
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:55,347
<i>How rude! How 'bout</i>
<i>yours?-He's an old man!</i>

194
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:59,481
<i>You two have it easy.</i>
<i>Mine is a monkey and a</i>
<i>snake! I'm freaking out</i>
<i>thinking about what</i>

195
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:01,114
<i>they'll look like when</i>
<i>they show up!</i>

196
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:01,602
<i>Oh!</i>
