[theme song]

2
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,689
-After Izuru Kira
defeated Makoto Kibune,

3
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,389
Renji delivered Makoto's
bakoto to Head Captain Yamamoto

4
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:57,689
to convince him of
Gyokaku Kumoi's treason.

5
00:01:57,723 --> 00:02:01,056
The head captain then commanded
the 13 Court Guard Squads

6
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:03,089
to storm the Kasumioji
Clan's palace

7
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,556
to find further evidence.

8
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:06,623
Kumoi instructed his
band of assassins

9
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:08,623
to hold off the Soul
Reapers as he attempted

10
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:10,989
to make his escape,
but Yoruichi's actions

11
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:12,823
prevented him from getting away.

12
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:14,823
Having taken Rurichiyo
as his hostage,

13
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:16,956
Kumoi found himself
cornered and decided

14
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:19,823
that threatening to kill the
princess was his only way out.

15
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:20,789
-[laughing]

16
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:22,723
-Stop it!

17
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:23,223
-Huh?

18
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:29,623
-It's Captain Amagai.

19
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:44,256
-What's going on here?

20
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,823
What did you just do?

21
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:53,523
-You've been most
helpful, Soul Reaper.

22
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:55,223
-What do you mean,
I've been helpful?

23
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,656
-Ichigo!

24
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:05,156
-Rurichiyo!

25
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,589
-See you around.

26
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:22,756
-What the hell did he just do?

27
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:25,256
-I have never seen
a Kido like that.

28
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,156
It's like he used a technique
to relocate while completely

29
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:30,123
suppressing his
spiritual pressure.

30
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:30,923
-So?

31
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:33,123
-So it's not good.

32
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:35,123
There's no way for
us to follow him.

33
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:36,256
-We've got to find him!

34
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:37,123
He's got Rurichiyo!

35
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:56,323
-What brings you here?

36
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:57,089
Well, Captain?

37
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:07,623
You arrive here announced with
the Rurichiyo Clan's princess

38
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:10,289
in tow and look rather serious.

39
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:12,623
State your business.

40
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:14,023
-I thought you would know.

41
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,389
Though now that I think of
it, I suppose you wouldn't.

42
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:22,356
You would probably
never even dream

43
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,823
that someone in the Soul
Society would come here

44
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:26,956
with the intention
of killing you.

45
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:29,589
-You want to kill me?

46
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:32,556
-Tell me, for what reason?

47
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:35,356
-For Shin'etsu Kisaragi.

48
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:38,189
-Shin'etsu?

49
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:41,089
-Don't tell me you've
forgotten about him.

50
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:45,923
So now I've come here from hell
on Shin'etsu Kisaragi's behalf

51
00:04:45,956 --> 00:04:48,056
to vanquish you.

52
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,389
Bloom in glory, Benishidare!

53
00:04:56,423 --> 00:04:57,523
-Damn.

54
00:04:57,556 --> 00:05:01,356
I thought I'd suppressed
my spiritual pressure.

55
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,556
Just what I would expect from
the princess's guardians.

56
00:05:04,589 --> 00:05:06,389
But your efforts are in vain.

57
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:07,289
-Silence!

58
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:08,156
Benishidare, Sange!

59
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:18,956
-Princess!

60
00:05:18,989 --> 00:05:21,756
Quickly, run!

61
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,523
-That won't work.

62
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,989
-[yelling] [inaudible]!

63
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:40,756
-What?

64
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:48,123
-[groan]

65
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:49,089
-Princess!

66
00:05:49,123 --> 00:05:51,589
-Kenryu!

67
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:54,023
-You're finally safe now,
with nothing to fear.

68
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:54,589
-Princess!

69
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:55,189
-Thank goodness.

70
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:56,289
-Hi!

71
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:57,389
-Oh, Enryu!

72
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,689
This is great.

73
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:02,223
Now I know what your
voice sounds like.

74
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:03,656
There's no need to blush.

75
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:04,989
You have a fine voice.

76
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:07,489
-Pardon me, princess, but
we must be on our way.

77
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:07,989
-Right.

78
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:08,623
Of course.

79
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:13,489
-[scream]

80
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,323
-Oh, no, Enryu!

81
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:32,489
-Shusuke.

82
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:36,123
Just what are you
intending to do with that?

83
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:37,623
-Allow me to show you.

84
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:44,823
I now hold the bakoto's core.

85
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:47,489
Until now, all the battles
were with the intent

86
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:50,423
of allowing this core to
absorb the spiritual energy

87
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:53,056
of the strong.

88
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,289
But the time has come
to take this core

89
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:56,823
and feed it to my bakoto.

90
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:04,123
Witness a display
of its true power.

91
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:22,023
-So that's what you were
up to all this time.

92
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:25,156
You were after the
bakoto as well.

93
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,956
-That's correct.

94
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:30,923
-You are foolish!

95
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,256
Now all things in the
universe turn to ashes!

96
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,356
Ryujin Jakka!

97
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:55,923
Prepare yourself,
Shusuke Amagai!

98
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:02,256
-[yells]

99
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:16,056
-How did you-- explain this!

100
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,556
What have you done?

101
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:25,395
-The strength to cancel
the power of Soul Reapers.

102
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:27,728
My bakoto possesses
that ability.

103
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:32,895
As long as this
bakoto is functioning,

104
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:37,795
all of your zanpakutos will be
rendered powerless and useless.

105
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:45,962
All except for my
zanpakuto Raika.

106
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:46,928
Bankai!

107
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:47,595
Raika Goen Kaku!

108
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:12,295
[yelling]

109
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:38,262
-Are you all right?

110
00:09:38,295 --> 00:09:38,762
Kenryu?

111
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:39,328
Enryu?

112
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:39,895
-Don't worry.

113
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:40,628
I'll be fine.

114
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:47,728
-So you're still alive.

115
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:50,562
-[growl]

116
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:53,262
-Don't give me that
look, unless you

117
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:55,062
want to be the first to die.

118
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,795
-Shusuke, leave them be.

119
00:09:57,828 --> 00:10:01,662
You said your purpose in
coming here was to kill me.

120
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:03,695
Those three have
nothing to do with it.

121
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,595
They are innocent.

122
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:07,395
-They're innocent?

123
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:09,595
You're dead wrong.

124
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:13,428
You're not the only one who will
feel the sting of my revenge!

125
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:15,128
I'll kill the heir to
the Kasumioji Clan!

126
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:19,228
None of you will live!

127
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:21,095
Now perish!

128
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:22,095
-Rurichiyo!

129
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:23,128
-Huh?

130
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:27,195
-[growling]

131
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:27,695
-Ichigo!

132
00:10:31,028 --> 00:10:32,428
-Sorry I was late again.

133
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:39,395
-Explain.

134
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:41,295
How did you find us?

135
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:45,428
-Kenryu somehow left
behind a Hell Butterfly.

136
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:48,128
-So it made it in time.

137
00:10:48,162 --> 00:10:49,295
-What's up?

138
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:51,095
What's keeping you
from fighting him?

139
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:58,095
-He's already tried
to, but he can't,

140
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:02,495
because my bakoto cancels out
the power of Soul Reapers.

141
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,828
-What?

142
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:08,328
-His flame attack
has no effect on me.

143
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:11,528
[laughing]

144
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:13,162
-So, Shusuke.

145
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:16,195
I don't want to believe it, but
you're our enemy, aren't you?

146
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:20,562
Who the hell are you?

147
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:28,995
[sounds of fighting]

148
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,762
-Byakuya, are you done here?

149
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,428
-The lieutenants are
mopping up what's

150
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:41,728
left of the enemy forces.

151
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:42,962
-And your squad?

152
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,162
-We've taken control
of the bakoto workshop.

153
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:50,128
Captain Soi Fon is protecting
the site as we speak.

154
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:53,062
-More importantly,
where is Shusuke Amagai?

155
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:54,428
-Shusuke?

156
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:56,728
He entered the compound
when Ikkaku and others first

157
00:11:56,762 --> 00:11:57,928
stormed in.

158
00:11:57,962 --> 00:12:00,362
But come to think of it,
I haven't seen him since.

159
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:02,528
-Where is he?

160
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:05,428
-Why are you so
concerned about him?

161
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:09,528
-He orchestrated this entire
incident to gain power.

162
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,895
-What?

163
00:12:11,928 --> 00:12:13,728
YORUICHI (VOICEOVER):
Allow me to explain.

164
00:12:13,762 --> 00:12:16,562
Kisuke contacted me and
requested I thoroughly

165
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:18,728
examine the ongoing
confusion regarding

166
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:21,262
the logistics of
the Soul Society.

167
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:24,062
I began looking into
every aspect I could,

168
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,862
and while doing that, I
uncovered information that

169
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,962
revealed the Kasumioji
Clan's dark side.

170
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:35,495
I found out that Kumoi was
the first to create a bakoto.

171
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:38,428
He applied the clan's secret
techniques developed over

172
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:41,295
centuries for the royal
family, and continued

173
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,995
to produce superior weaponry.

174
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:48,528
The bakoto allows its bearer
to gain strength and fighting

175
00:12:48,562 --> 00:12:51,895
power far beyond its bearer's
abilities, but wielding it

176
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:53,895
can be fatal.

177
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:55,962
-We're not certain of
where Shusuke first

178
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:58,562
learned of the
bakoto's existence,

179
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:00,295
but once he learned
of it, he approached

180
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:02,995
Kumoi with the express
purpose of having it.

181
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:05,162
-He set into motion
his own grand plan

182
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:07,395
knowing that his
possession of the bakoto

183
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:09,395
was the key element
to it succeeding.

184
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:12,628
-To make that happen, he knew
he must become a squad captain

185
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:14,828
so he would have complete
knowledge of the movements

186
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,762
of both the Soul Reapers
and the Soul Society.

187
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:23,628
-And so Shusuke connived a
plan to become a captain,

188
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:25,928
knowing that would
advance his plan.

189
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:28,028
Right after he became
a captain, an incident

190
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:30,162
occurred in which a
restrictive current shutdown

191
00:13:30,195 --> 00:13:31,762
request was ignored.

192
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:33,295
By discreetly
voiding that request,

193
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:36,328
Shusuke created a chance to
show off his powers to his squad

194
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:37,762
and won their confidence.

195
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:40,095
He then met with the other
captains, gaining their trust,

196
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:42,528
and advocated cooperation
between their squads

197
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,428
and established training
exercises to create unity.

198
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:46,828
But his real reason
for doing that

199
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:49,995
was to analyze the fighting
ability of each squad.

200
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:53,828
As he think carefully prepared
to put his plan in motion,

201
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:57,662
an unexpected
windfall came to him.

202
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:59,628
-Ichigo Kurosaki?

203
00:13:59,662 --> 00:14:00,928
-Correct.

204
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:03,195
Originally, he intended to
take even more time to make

205
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:04,862
his move, but
Ichigo's intervention

206
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:07,795
caused upheaval for
the Soul Society.

207
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:10,328
He fanned Gyokaku
Kumoi's ambitious nature,

208
00:14:10,362 --> 00:14:14,028
and by overstating the conflict,
he plunged the Soul Society

209
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,195
into utter confusion and chaos.

210
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:18,628
He then used the Kasumioji
Clan's assassin squad

211
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:20,328
to make things worse,
and hand picked

212
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:24,362
his third seat, Makoto
Kibune, to wreak havoc.

213
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:26,462
-But I heard when they
fought, Lieutenant Kira

214
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:29,662
succeeded in defeating
Third Seat Kibune.

215
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:31,395
-Izuru?

216
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,395
-Makoto's defeat was
the first instance

217
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:36,495
in which Shusuke's plan
suffered a setback.

218
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:38,095
Apparently, Amagai
didn't foresee

219
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,695
Izuru winning that battle.

220
00:14:41,728 --> 00:14:45,128
-Guess he underestimated
Izuru's tenacity.

221
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:48,162
-We know Shusuke Amagai went
to all kinds of extremes

222
00:14:48,195 --> 00:14:51,162
with this, but for what?

223
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:52,595
-I have an idea why.

224
00:15:07,128 --> 00:15:07,928
-Shin'etsu Kisaragi?

225
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:15,262
Enlighten me as to how it
is that you know that name.

226
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:17,828
-To me, that name is special.

227
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:22,095
You see, that was the
name of my father.

228
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:28,495
-That's right.

229
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:32,062
My father was
Shin'etsu Kisaragi.

230
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,062
My father was the Soul
Reaper that you murdered.

231
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:59,584
-Head Captain
Yamamoto killed him?

232
00:15:59,617 --> 00:16:03,750
-Hey, old man, is there
anything to what he's saying?

233
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:06,917
-He speaks the truth.

234
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,817
Indeed, I did kill a soul
reaper whose name was

235
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,617
Shin'etsu Kisaragi.

236
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,017
-[yelling]

237
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,817
-I remember that time and place,
but how did you find out I

238
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,384
killed your father?

239
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:53,717
-He lived for several hours
after you left him for dead

240
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,050
in the field.

241
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:59,617
That last day, my father
had been acting strangely,

242
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,450
so I decided to go
looking for him.

243
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:04,884
-Father?

244
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:10,550
AMAGAI (VOICEOVER):
I knew my father

245
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:12,717
trained with his
zanpakuto in that field.

246
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:19,284
-Father?

247
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:24,417
Father, no!

248
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:24,917
Not you!

249
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,250
Why?

250
00:17:27,284 --> 00:17:29,284
Father, please open your eyes!

251
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:32,484
Please don't die!

252
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:34,484
-With his dying
breath, he told me.

253
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:37,750
He said it clearly.

254
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:41,284
He said that you
had cut him down.

255
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:44,450
-That can't be.

256
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:45,117
-Old man?

257
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,617
-It is true.

258
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,017
He killed his
subordinate, my father!

259
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:07,450
-Several years after his
death, I changed my name,

260
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:09,584
enlisted in the 13
Court Guard Squads,

261
00:18:09,617 --> 00:18:13,450
and lied that I was
from the Rukon district.

262
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:17,884
I did it to find out the
truth about my father's death.

263
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:19,717
I gathered many facts.

264
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,150
And then I recalled a word.

265
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,684
The bakoto.

266
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:34,450
That was the last word
my father ever spoke.

267
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:36,284
What was a bakoto?

268
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:40,250
Why did my father need
me to hear that word?

269
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:41,884
It took years for
me to understand,

270
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:45,650
but slowly, it all
fell into place.

271
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:50,950
Somehow, my father had stumbled
onto the bakoto's existence,

272
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:54,984
and it appears he was trying
to unmask its mystery.

273
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:57,284
So to learn the truth
about the bakoto,

274
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:59,317
he infiltrated
the Kasumioji Clan

275
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,617
and found himself
in over his head.

276
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,084
-You were an accomplice of the
Kasumioji Clan in those days.

277
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:16,617
You were also involved in
the bakoto's development.

278
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,484
My father was quite
aware of your actions,

279
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:24,517
so you decided that
you had to silence him!

280
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:29,817
In the years that
followed, there

281
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,584
were many more suspicious
decisions and activities

282
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:36,184
sponsored by the Kasumioji Clan,
but you refused to interfere.

283
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:47,384
I saw it all, and
swore I'd make you pay.

284
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,784
Through all those years,
as I was training myself,

285
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:58,417
all I could think about
was seeing you crushed.

286
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,917
Then I aligned myself
with the Kasumioji Clan

287
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,350
and was given the bakoto.

288
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:08,384
My prominent service in the
expedition unit was noticed.

289
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:11,050
That led to me being
promoted to Captain,

290
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,384
creating this long
sought after opportunity.

291
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:17,484
My time is now!

292
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,717
I will avenge my father!

293
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,684
[growl]

294
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:33,350
-I know you.

295
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:34,884
-Yes, you're Shu Kannogi.

296
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:38,317
Rurichiyo Kasumioji
is betrothed to you.

297
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,850
-And all of you are Soul
Reaper squad captains, right?

298
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:43,750
-Yes, we are.

299
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,817
Why have you come here alone?

300
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,550
-I'm here to beg you to
help Ichigo and the others.

301
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:51,017
-What?

302
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,884
-Ichigo and Rukia are
trying to catch up

303
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,817
with Rurichiyo and
Captain Amagai, who's

304
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,084
gone after the Head Captain.

305
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:02,484
-[growling]

306
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:04,250
-Stay out of my way, Ichigo!

307
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:05,784
Enough!

308
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:07,017
-Knock it off!

309
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,517
I've been here the
whole time, and I

310
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:13,084
heard all of your completely
self-centered nonsense!

311
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:17,050
-Every word I said
was the truth!

312
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:19,717
-I'm not arguing that what
you said was the truth.

313
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,750
Your selfish, destructive
actions have ripped apart a lot

314
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:26,117
of innocent people's lives,
including Rurichiyo's.

315
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,084
Where's the justice in that?

316
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:33,984
-Ichigo.

317
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:35,550
-She's been threatened
so many times

318
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:38,750
that her life's just an
endless, terrifying nightmare.

319
00:21:38,784 --> 00:21:42,117
She wants to be free
to live her life!

320
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,217
Get your revenge, but
leave her out of it.

321
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,850
Don't involve other
people in your business!

322
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:50,050
-You just don't get it!

323
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:51,417
You cannot save her!

324
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,684
Don't act like an idiot!

325
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:58,850
Move it!

326
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,150
-I don't think you
understand what's going on.

327
00:22:01,184 --> 00:22:04,650
You say you want me to move?

328
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:07,050
Well, you're gonna
have to make me do it!

329
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:18,191

330
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:48,946
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
What's up, Yoruichi?

331
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:51,112
Why didn't you tell
us you were here, too?

332
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:52,679
YORUICHI (VOICEOVER):
[laughs] Sorry,

333
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:54,246
but I'm all about
working secretly

334
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,446
undercover behind the scenes.

335
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,879
Want to know why?

336
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:59,446
I like seeing that surprised
look on everyone's face

337
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,779
when I show up so unexpectedly.

338
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:02,179
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
Just for that?

339
00:24:02,212 --> 00:24:05,712
YORUICHI (VOICEOVER):
Just for that.
