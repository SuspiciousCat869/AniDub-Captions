1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,133
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,600
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,500
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,500
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul Reaper.

5
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:32,333
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,314
The Head Captain's
Spiritual Pressure.

7
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,747
He's here!

8
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,047
Let's do this!

9
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:07,214
I gotcha!

10
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:13,847
Now, Snap!

11
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:21,480
I can't believe you
kicked me in the face.

12
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:38,614
Well that was just
a little warm-up.

13
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:45,114
Embarrassing. I had hoped
for more of a challenge. Am
I to believe this is all
you've got?

14
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,814
Of course not. Don't be
ridiculous.

15
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:51,947
It goes against my nature
to get rough with women, I
happen to be a gentleman.

16
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:56,214
That so? I see no
reason to match your
gentlemanly pace,

17
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:58,947
I'm not bothered using
full force against you.

18
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:05,614
Better pay attention,
here I come!

19
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:13,680
Pleasing a woman...
isn't easy.

20
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:21,380
Hey, slow down!
Where are you going?

21
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:26,214
No way, stranger! Speed
it up! Catch us if you
can, but I bet you can't!

22
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:29,280
It's very dangerous to
run around with those
weapons!

23
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:33,447
If you don't listen to
me, I won't keep playing.

24
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,614
You're talking about
this thing, right?

25
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:43,014
And this?

26
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:44,247
That's correct.

27
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:47,814
Let me hold on to
them. Once they're in
my safe-keeping,

28
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:50,147
we can play any type
of game you'd like.

29
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,347
So just hand them over to
me, children.

30
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:54,414
Hmmmm.

31
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:56,647
If we do that, you're
gonna play with us?

32
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,914
Yes. But you have to
hand those over to me
first.

33
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,680
You'll play for sure?

34
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:05,714
Yes, of course. Just
be good children and
give them to me.

35
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,147
You've got to promise,
okay?

36
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,514
Make it a pinkie promise!

37
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:15,714
Oh, alright. It's a
pinkie promise!

38
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:17,080
Here.

39
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:18,580
Such good children.

40
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:25,947
Yeah! It worked! He fell
for it!

41
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,480
Such bad children!

42
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,147
I think it's time
for you to die.

43
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,914
Huh?

44
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:52,080
Sneaky bastard!

45
00:05:56,514 --> 00:06:00,847
Hey, what gives? I
thought I was going to
have a lot of fun with you.

46
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,814
Is that the best
you can do?

47
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:07,814
Hey-Hey! You can't
defeat Kenny if all
you're gonna do is stand
around, playing defense!

48
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:10,814
Yachiru. Why don't you
try to keep your mouth
shut.

49
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:15,614
Well, it's just the truth
And so far this fight
is no fun to watch!

50
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,280
Neither one of them seems
to be giving their all.

51
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:21,914
Keep quiet. Let me handle
this.

52
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:28,014
Yachiru is right.
Something is a bit off.
Don't you want to settle
this and be done with it?

53
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:32,914
You see, for us it's not
just about winning or losing.

54
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:38,747
Oh. You weren't planning
on winning from the very
start, huh?

55
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:40,914
I'm so bored with this!

56
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:09,914
I'm glad you could
make it, Ichigo
Kurosaki.

57
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:12,580
Muramasa. I knew you'd
be here.

58
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,514
Then this was meant to be.
It seems we're destined to
cross blades.

59
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,447
What do you say we
get down to settling
our differences?

60
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:24,447
That's fine with me,
destined or not.

61
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:30,514
Although everyone is waiting
on me. They're expecting me
to bring the Head Captain
home safely.

62
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,214
And I intend to
do just that!

63
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,214
So enough screwin'
around! Let's get
this over with!

64
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:43,380
Yes. I've waited
for this.

65
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,614
Getsuga tensho!!!

66
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,447
I sense more Spiritual
Pressure! Ichigo must've
found Muramasa!

67
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:59,614
The behavior of these
Zanpakuto is very peculiar.

68
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,380
They're coming
after me,

69
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:05,247
but I have a feeling that
they know the level of
their attacks is ineffective.

70
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:08,614
I'm going to have
to test them...

71
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:19,080
Are you really incapable
of showing us more strength?

72
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:23,314
You're saying you're
not impressed? I think
my feelings are hurt.

73
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:26,947
I don't think being a
smart ass is going to
help you either.

74
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,380
Apparently that's all
I really need to do.
Because you...

75
00:08:31,414 --> 00:08:33,980
...have no intention of
cutting me, do you?

76
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,447
Uh! You should only
be so lucky.

77
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:41,347
My Zanpakuto comes in two
sizes. I use that difference
to my advantage.

78
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,147
That's my style of
fighting, which in turn,
means it's the way you
two fight as well.

79
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,080
But you haven't taken
advantage. Not even once.
And you're aware of how
effectively it works.

80
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:57,314
The short sword's speed is
used to confuse the enemy,
while the long sword delivers
the final blow.

81
00:08:57,347 --> 00:09:00,580
This is how you were
designed and how you're
supposed to fight.

82
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:03,447
But only the short
sword is attacking me,

83
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,380
while you, the long
sword, aren't doing
anything at all.

84
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,914
Really, it's as if you're
trying to avoid delivering
that final blow.

85
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:13,647
are only trying to avoid
my attacks / It is not
that I can't do
anything...It's not that

86
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,714
I think that you two are
just holding me off and
making it difficult for
me to strike back.

87
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:20,147
Am I right?

88
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,214
My, my. Apparently you're
quite an observant master.
That's troublesome for me.

89
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,280
Hey, Mister! Come
on! We're over here!

90
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:34,980
<i>Yeah, just follow our</i>
<i>clapping! You'll find</i>
<i>us!</i>

91
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:38,847
Now, come on out. I'm
going to get very angry
if you don't.

92
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,547
<i>That's fine with us.</i>

93
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,947
Yeah, we're not
bothered! Get angry!

94
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:49,347
Let's get him!

95
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:55,447
Hado Thirty-One!
Shakkaho!

96
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,380
All right I'm the
winner--

97
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,180
Yeah!

98
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:17,947
Damn. The easier I am
on them, the longer this
will end up taking...

99
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:21,247
They're stalling.

100
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,514
Don't you understand,
Ichigo Kurosaki? That
is not enough to defeat
me.

101
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:43,714
And you cannot move on
until you do defeat me.
So let's go...

102
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:46,514
...Hit me with everything
you've got!

103
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,114
All right.

104
00:10:50,747 --> 00:10:52,114
Have it your way.

105
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,680
What is this Spiritual
Pressure?

106
00:11:00,714 --> 00:11:02,914
Who knows? Does it
really matter?

107
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:05,914
Anyway, we're wasting
time. Let's wrap things
up, here.

108
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,880
I'm looking forward to
seeing you do that.

109
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,380
You asked for it!

110
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:25,580
Oh, no!

111
00:11:26,014 --> 00:11:27,947
You're not going
anywhere!

112
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,647
Hado Number Thirty-one!

113
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,114
Shakkaho!

114
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,947
Snap!

115
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:53,280
I think I'm beginning to
understand you, now. You
never intended to kill us.

116
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:58,080
All of you just wanted to
lure us here and keep us
busy.

117
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,980
That's been your
plan from the start.

118
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:34,524
More, Ichigo Kurosaki. I
thought I told you to hit me
with everything you've got.

119
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:36,791
Do not hold back!

120
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:47,491
Show your true
Getsugatensho...

121
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:57,258
Since you figured it out,
I guess I have no choice.

122
00:13:01,924 --> 00:13:03,324
How did he--?!

123
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:07,158
Sorry. You can try and
cut me, but it won't stop
me from moving forward.

124
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:10,691
No more games!
I'm warning you.

125
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,124
We can't do
that! Sorry!

126
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:16,291
We're not letting you
go any further!

127
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:17,291
Got it!?

128
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:21,824
You children
lack discipline!

129
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,858
Seems like there's a lot
going on in this cave,

130
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:34,591
but don't worry about it.
I'm gonna give you my full
attention.

131
00:13:34,624 --> 00:13:36,458
I'm staying right here.

132
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:38,791
So let's see what
you got, big guy!

133
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,391
Now that's more like it!

134
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:51,424
Hado Fifty Eight!
Tenran!

135
00:13:58,658 --> 00:14:01,524
Bakudo Thirty!
Shitotsusansen!

136
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:14,524
What the hell
was that?!

137
00:14:14,558 --> 00:14:20,624
Their goal all along was
to separate us from Ichigo.
It's clear now.

138
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:24,891
But what do they want
with him??

139
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:31,291
Judging from Muramasa's
Spiritual Pressure, I don't
believe he's planning to
kill him.

140
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:37,624
If anything, he's buying
time while Ichigo builds
up Spirit Energy.

141
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:44,324
And stringing Ichigo along
like that can only serve
one purpose.

142
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:48,024
Muramasa's been leading
him into a trap!

143
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:02,524
He's just waiting!

144
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:08,991
Waiting to use Ichigo's
most powerful attack.

145
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:11,591
Getsuga...

146
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,124
Stop, Ichigo!

147
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:15,924
...tensho!!

148
00:15:54,391 --> 00:16:03,491
[laughing]

149
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:40,791
The barrier's cracking...

150
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,158
Mm?

151
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:54,458
So then it's true!

152
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:57,091
What?! What are
you talking about?!

153
00:16:57,324 --> 00:17:02,124
Muramasa's goal was to
get you to use your
Getsugatensho while
Hollowfied.

154
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:03,891
What?!

155
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:09,924
It seems that he fused
your power with his own
to create a massive
amount of Spirit Energy.

156
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:16,124
And it worked. He wanted
to destroy Genryusai's
protective barrier with
it.

157
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:20,291
What do you mean?!
Muramasa created that
barrier, why would he
want to destroy it?!

158
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:24,491
In hindsight, it would
appear that we have all
be greatly mistaken.

159
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:26,391
You're right
about that.

160
00:17:31,124 --> 00:17:34,391
It would appear that our
enemy has taken the upper hand.

161
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:36,224
Captain...

162
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:42,558
He has relentlessly been
trying to gain access
to my subconscious.

163
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:44,724
Your subconscious??

164
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:54,391
Well, then was he actually
able to do it?!

165
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:56,724
Did he gain access
to your Zanpakuto?!

166
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:02,824
So all the events that have
lead us to this point were
just part of your plan to get
closer to the Head Captain.

167
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:07,391
Ah, a true Captain class
Soul Reaper, so quick to
grasp the complex.

168
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:14,324
You're right. My goal is to
gather and learn from all of
the memories within Genryusai
Yamamoto's mind.

169
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:18,924
In order to do that, I
needed to gain access
into the core of his
inner world.

170
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:24,024
But when I found him,
he immediately set up
a force-field

171
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:26,858
and isolated himself
within that barrier.

172
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:31,724
He then went into an
unconscious state to prevent
me from entering his mind.

173
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:39,924
I had expected that. So I
manifested the Zanpakuto
of multiple Soul Reapers

174
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:46,758
in order to cause a
distraction in the Soul
Society. This was the
beginning phase of my plan

175
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:50,691
to destroy Genryusai
Yamamoto's barrier.

176
00:18:50,724 --> 00:18:56,791
Next, I lead the Soul
Reapers and Zanpakuto to
believe that my goal was
to liberate the Zanpakuto

177
00:18:56,824 --> 00:19:03,958
from their oppressive masters.
I made absolutely certain that
you thought I was holding your
Head Captain against his will.

178
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:08,858
And all that was left to
do, was sit and wait for
you to come to his rescue.

179
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:11,924
[gasping]
Damn it.

180
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:19,458
Everything went according
to my plan. I would like to
thank all of you Soul Reapers.

181
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,824
And especially you...
Ichigo Kurosaki.

182
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:24,658
You bastard!

183
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,258
And what about us?!

184
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,291
Mm?

185
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,558
Was freedom for all
Zanpakuto just a lie?

186
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:36,158
And all along you were
only using us to achieve
your own goal?

187
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:39,591
I believe that is what I
said. Is there a problem?

188
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:44,391
Of course, you arrogant
fool! I have no intention
of aiding you any further!

189
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:46,158
You don't play fair You
tricked us!

190
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:48,658
You're a big liar and
you're mean!

191
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:49,891
Just hold on.

192
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,491
Remain calm,
now.

193
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,358
Great. Now the Zanpakuto
are turning on him.

194
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:59,324
Sorry, but I'm afraid
it's time for me to go.

195
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:04,358
As far as I'm concerned,
this conversation is over.
Do whatever you like.

196
00:20:05,158 --> 00:20:07,324
Oh, we'll do exactly
that!!

197
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:21,424
What was that?!

198
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:23,924
Where did it
come from?!

199
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:30,924
<i>Ryujinjakka...</i>

200
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:22,824
What a disaster!
Old Man Yama's
Ryujinjakka has fallen
into his control.

201
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:30,891
Farewell Genryusai
Yamamoto and Soul
Reapers.

202
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:35,158
It's too late, from now on,
you'll no longer be getting
in my way.

203
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:44,758
Captain. How shall
we proceed?

204
00:21:45,424 --> 00:21:46,891
Muramasa.

205
00:21:46,924 --> 00:21:52,958
He is a very clever Zanpakuto
who now possesses all the power
of Mukojochu.

206
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:59,258
He can enter speak to an
enemy's Zanpakuto and
utilize it as he wishes.

207
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:01,758
He is very unique.

208
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:03,924
But he will be stopped!

209
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,258
He will fall short
of his goal

210
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:10,124
as the Thirteen Court
Guard Squads bring him
to his knees!

211
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:49,496
What's a Mukojochu?

212
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:52,829
<i>Normally, it refers to a</i>
<i>tapeworm that gets inside</i>
<i>your body.</i>

213
00:23:52,862 --> 00:23:57,562
<i>I'm guessing Muramasa took</i>
<i>it's name in reference to</i>
<i>his ability to enter</i>
<i>people's minds.</i>

214
00:23:57,596 --> 00:23:58,729
A worm?

215
00:23:58,762 --> 00:24:01,962
<i>Hey, watch your mouth!</i>
<i>Don't call me a worm!</i>
