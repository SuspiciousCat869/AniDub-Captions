1
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:10,266
That's right... Come on.

2
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,900
Getsuga... Tensho!

3
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,040
Los Nueve Aspectos.

4
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:54,706
Shall we end this now?
What do you say?

5
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,640
Justice...

6
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,940
...isn't something that's
seen with your eyes.

7
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:07,206
Justice is something
mere words can't
completely describe.

8
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:15,073
<i>Forgive me, Kaname...</i>

9
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:20,640
I cannot kill you...
I know you too well.

10
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,740
That's enough. You're not
really Captain Tosen anymore.

11
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,973
Before this, when you
couldn't see, you could have
easily dodged my attack.

12
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:48,906
Reap...

13
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,973
...Kazeshini!

14
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,573
[choking]

15
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,073
<i>Over here!</i>

16
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:09,706
What's wrong, Sosuke?!
You look quite confused!

17
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,906
I've got you!

18
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,906
<i>So that's it...?</i>

19
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:25,740
Your whole strategy was nothing
more than an optical illusion.

20
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:34,640
Yours was a parlor trick. It's
quite a far cry from my ability
to control all five senses.

21
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:39,873
<i>It was child's play for me,</i>
<i>Shinji Hirako.</i>

22
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:47,040
Mm.. Uh?

23
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:57,706
Sajin...
Shuhei...

24
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,606
Don't speak. Your Hollow
powers are allowing you
to breathe, but your
throat's been torn open.

25
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,473
You don't need to talk
right now. It's better that
you save your strength...

26
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:14,540
Our relationship has been all
too superficial until now.

27
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,406
Even as friends,
it was our fate to
fight each other.

28
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,573
And by fighting,

29
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:24,640
We have come to a
greater understanding
between us.

30
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,506
<i>I can't ask you</i>
<i>not to hate me.</i>

31
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,606
<i>I know you'll probably</i>
<i>hold a grudge after</i>
<i>what's happened.</i>

32
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,473
<i>Just don't allow your</i>
<i>hunger for revenge to</i>
<i>change who you truly are.</i>

33
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:42,606
I feel just as you
must have felt when
you lost your friend.

34
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,740
If we were to lose you,
it would leave a
hole in my heart.

35
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,206
I thank you... Sajin.

36
00:05:57,706 --> 00:05:58,706
Uhng!

37
00:06:06,306 --> 00:06:07,373
Captain!

38
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:09,106
Captain!

39
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:13,973
<i>Aizen!!</i>

40
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:22,040
I won't forgive you... Aizen!!

41
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:34,640
You're mine!

42
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Yeeeaaah!

43
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:51,140
Ichigo Kurosaki!

44
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:54,340
Ichigo!

45
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,540
Yahhh!

46
00:07:02,373 --> 00:07:05,273
[panting]

47
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:17,106
What ?!

48
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:24,540
It's been a while, hasn't it?

49
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:28,540
...Ryoka boy.

50
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,306
Damn it... He blocked my attack!

51
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:42,906
Your attack was good, but
your aim was predictable.

52
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,640
The back of the neck is every
creature's worst blind spot.

53
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Did you think I would come
into this battle without
protecting my point of
greatest vulnerability?

54
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:58,273
Let me guess what you're
thinking at this moment.

55
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:02,040
You think you made an error
of judgment just now.

56
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:05,040
That you should have
Hollowfied before attacking.

57
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:09,206
You think if you had done that,
this would all be over.

58
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,373
Tell me I'm wrong.

59
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,973
<i>He's not wrong. I had to take</i>
<i>him down with the first blow.</i>
<i>I knew that!</i>

60
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,073
<i>I can't look at his Shikai!</i>
<i>My one hope is to take him</i>
<i>down quickly!</i>

61
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,473
<i>The only strategy</i>
<i>is to kill him!</i>

62
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,540
<i>There might not be</i>
<i>a second chance!</i>

63
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:38,140
<i>I was careless!</i>

64
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,506
<i>Somewhere deep inside,</i>
<i>I was scared!</i>

65
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,506
<i>I thought I might lose</i>
<i>control of my Hollowfication.</i>

66
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,440
<i>It WAS an error</i>
<i>of judgment!</i>

67
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:52,806
Attack me.

68
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:54,106
[gasp]

69
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,473
Take your best shot.
It'll only prove to you
how arrogant you've become.

70
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,573
That's right. Come on.

71
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:12,740
Getsuga... Tensho!

72
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:15,306
[gasp]

73
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,206
What's wrong?
It didn't reach me.

74
00:09:21,606 --> 00:09:22,806
Is that all you've got?

75
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,740
You're wasting your
time, Ryoka boy.

76
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:31,540
You can attack me all you
like, but your efforts
will be meaningless.

77
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:36,873
You seem very confident.
So my Hollowfication
doesn't scare you, is that it?

78
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:39,706
That's not what
I'm talking about.

79
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:45,773
Then what is it?
Are you saying that my
Zanpakuto is incapable
of killing you? Huh?!

80
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:50,540
Apparently, you don't
understand.

81
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:53,806
<i>I guess I'll have to</i>
<i>explain it to you in</i>
<i>much simpler terms.</i>

82
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:59,740
I'm telling you that no
matter what you do, your
blade cannot touch me.

83
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:03,873
That's quite the claim!
Care to put it to the test?

84
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:06,706
It's not a test if
I know the outcome.

85
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,773
But you won't believe
it unless you see it
for yourself.

86
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:13,140
You got that right!
So let's see if
you're lying or not!

87
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:23,740
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

88
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:26,273
<i>He says he can dodge</i>
<i>my Getsugatensho any</i>
<i>time he wants.</i>

89
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:28,106
All right,
then...

90
00:10:31,573 --> 00:10:33,073
Yahhh!

91
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,140
<i>What's wrong?</i>

92
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,306
You seem to have missed me.

93
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,440
<i>I don't understand! My timing</i>
<i>was perfect! I was sure of it!</i>

94
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:55,506
<i>Is his Zanpakuto that strong?!</i>

95
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,073
<i>Just so you know...</i>

96
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:02,473
I haven't been using my
Kyokasuigetsu's power
in our fight so far.

97
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:06,606
What you're seeing is
just my basic strength.

98
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:08,073
What?!

99
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,040
(Small nervous breath as he
jumps back)

100
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:12,406
<i>Why are you</i>
<i>pulling away?</i>

101
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,440
If you intend to attack me,
you'll have to come closer.

102
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:21,340
Or maybe...

103
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:25,373
<i>...you're afraid that</i>
<i>getting any closer will</i>
<i>put you at a disadvantage,</i>
<i>and make you vulnerable.</i>

104
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:30,106
If that's the case,
you need a reality check.

105
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:34,173
Keeping a distance between
yourself and your opponent

106
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:38,606
is only meaningful when
you're fighting someone equal
in strength and skills.

107
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,373
It's pointless for you
to do that with me.

108
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,540
See...?

109
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,373
I can reach out and
touch your heart.
Without even
breaking a sweat.

110
00:11:52,306 --> 00:11:55,373
Let me just ask you
something, Ryoka boy.

111
00:11:58,273 --> 00:12:01,340
Do you have any idea
why you're fighting me?

112
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:02,240
What?

113
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,740
Do you have a grudge
against me or something?
I don't really think you do.

114
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,840
<i>I have to assume from the</i>
<i>fact that you're here,</i>

115
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:16,040
<i>that you succeeded in</i>
<i>taking back Orihime Inoue.</i>

116
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:23,906
And from the expression on your
face, I can also assume that
none of your friends have died.

117
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,740
<i>With that in mind, do you</i>
<i>honestly despise me, from the</i>
<i>very bottom of your heart?</i>

118
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:32,973
I don't believe that.

119
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:37,040
At the moment, you
have no deep-seated
hatred of me.

120
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:40,373
You're fighting me out
of a sense of misplaced
responsibility.

121
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:42,873
You weren't motivated
enough to defeat me.

122
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:48,206
A fighting spirit that
lacks hate is like an
eagle without wings.

123
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,373
You have the will,
but you don't have
the tools to do the job.

124
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,706
And your powerless friends
are no help, either.

125
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,406
They only serve as weights
to restrict your movements,
and drag you down.

126
00:13:12,273 --> 00:13:15,873
Concentrate, Ichigo!
Don't let him into
your head!

127
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,606
Captain Komamura...?

128
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,640
He's a master at undermining
your confidence. If you let
him do that, he'll destroy
you for sure.

129
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,373
You mustn't let your guard down.

130
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,940
Keep your mind clear.

131
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:37,906
I know why the captains
who went to Hueco Mundo
sent you here first.

132
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,406
You haven't fallen
victim to Aizen's Shikai.

133
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:48,706
<i>Our job is to make sure</i>
<i>you remain unaffected</i>
<i>by that weapon.</i>

134
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,940
Ichigo, we will all
fight to protect you.

135
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:11,855
Ichigo, we will all
fight to protect you.

136
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:14,389
You're gonna fight
to protect me?

137
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:16,789
What are you saying?

138
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:20,722
<i>It's just crazy! Look at you,</i>
<i>You're all in terrible shape!</i>

139
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:26,322
That's a matter of perspective.
We think letting you fight alone
would be even crazier.

140
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:32,022
Besides, if we allowed that,
we wouldn't be able to
settle our own personal
grudges with Sosuke.

141
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,155
<i>It would be selfish of you to</i>
<i>take him on by yourself.</i>

142
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:41,455
This... is a battle...
for all of us.

143
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:55,022
You charged in without any
thought as to strategy or
strength. That was very reckless
of you, Captain Hitsugaya.

144
00:14:55,222 --> 00:15:02,155
We won't be able to win this
battle unless we attack first.
Missing this opportunity would
be playing into your hands.

145
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:07,955
I must commend you
though, Aizen, for not
using your Kyokasuigetsu,
right from the start.

146
00:15:09,022 --> 00:15:10,489
I commend you as well,

147
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:17,855
for having the wisdom
to not face me alone.

148
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:22,889
Are you saying we're
playing dirty with you?
How very insulting.

149
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,855
If that's how you're taking it,
I stand corrected,
Captain Kyoraku.

150
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:31,555
Can the two of them
get past his defenses?

151
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:32,889
We'll see, won't we?

152
00:15:34,055 --> 00:15:37,455
Thank you, by the way, for
coming to help me earlier.

153
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:49,189
I won't forgive you... Aizen!!

154
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,922
If you hadn't jumped in and
attacked Aizen when you did,

155
00:15:57,955 --> 00:16:01,322
I would have lunged
at him in a fit of
uncontrollable rage,

156
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:06,522
And I would be dead.

157
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:07,722
I'm glad I could help.

158
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:12,489
Aizen said, without hate in
your heart, you would never
be able to defeat him.

159
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:16,289
But the fact of the
matter is, we know that
statement's not true.

160
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:20,155
Even without hatred,
you've won countless
battles.

161
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:27,222
And you've protected countless
numbers of people. You need to
know that your desire to protect
people is enough to do the job.

162
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:30,655
<i>For you, it's a stronger</i>
<i>emotion than hatred.</i>

163
00:16:31,222 --> 00:16:35,489
You just have to focus
on that. The positive
will outweigh the
negative.

164
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:38,155
And that will be
enough to reach Aizen.

165
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,289
And when I say 'reach' him,
what I mean is,

166
00:16:41,322 --> 00:16:43,555
It won't be your blade,
but your soul.

167
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:48,489
That guy sure likes to
talk a lot, doesn't he?

168
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:54,355
Man, Ichigo, Why didn't you
bring Orihime with you when you
came for this fight?

169
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,989
I mean, doesn't it make
perfect sense? If she
was here, she could have
healed all our injuries.

170
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:02,822
<i>Then we would have been</i>
<i>in great shape to help</i>
<i>you take on Sosuke.</i>

171
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,122
Hirako...

172
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:06,722
But...

173
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:12,522
<i>You did bring back</i>
<i>Captain Unohana, who's more</i>
<i>experienced, so I have to</i>
<i>give you credit for that.</i>

174
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:22,855
<i>[Shinji]</i>
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>
<i>it was definitely the right</i>
<i>choice for this battle.</i>

175
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:29,155
Listen to me, Ichigo. We're
going to protect you as much as
we can. Just make sure...

176
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,222
<i>...you're fighting to protect</i>
<i>what's important to you.</i>

177
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:41,555
<i>[Soi Fon]</i>
<i>How long are you going</i>
<i>to just stand there?</i>

178
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:47,289
They can only create an
opening for an instant.
You need to take advantage
of that opportunity.

179
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:53,155
Don't assume that we're
prepared to die in this
battle. We're actually
fighting for our survival.

180
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:56,155
Saving the world puts a
nice gloss on the mission.

181
00:17:56,555 --> 00:18:00,489
But the bottom line is,
we're all desperately trying
to defeat this monster,

182
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:04,789
so we have a future
that doesn't involve
being enslaved by him.

183
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:09,889
It's a pretty strong
motivation, and in the
process, the world ends
up getting saved anyway.

184
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:14,122
Don't fall behind,
Ichigo Kurosaki. You're
the key to this battle.

185
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:17,355
Hold on! I'm
coming, too, Wait
for me captain!

186
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:26,722
<i>That's right...</i>

187
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:28,222
What is your duty?

188
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:32,755
<i>You know the answer.</i>

189
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:35,122
Your duty is to
protect Karakura Town.

190
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:39,689
Go on... You are their
Substitute Soul Reaper.

191
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,389
<i>What is there for</i>
<i>me to worry about?</i>

192
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,822
<i>The Visoreds and the</i>
<i>Captains are behind me!</i>

193
00:18:48,722 --> 00:18:50,922
<i>I have to believe in them...</i>

194
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:54,722
<i>They're committed to</i>
<i>this battle. They'll be</i>
<i>there if I need them!</i>

195
00:18:56,155 --> 00:18:59,822
<i>Focus on their fighting! Wait</i>
<i>until they give me an opening!</i>

196
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,955
Good thing you
moved when you did.
I almost had you.

197
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:22,522
You seem quite confident,
Captain Kyoraku.

198
00:19:23,522 --> 00:19:27,522
If that's how it appears,
I must be doing pretty well.
Thank you.

199
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:31,189
For someone who's
launching sneak attacks,
you are.

200
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:32,322
Aizen...

201
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,822
I heard what you
said to Ichigo,

202
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:38,589
At the moment, you
have no deep-seated
hatred of me,

203
00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:41,622
You're fighting me out
of a sense of misplaced
responsibility.

204
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,289
You aren't motivated
enough to defeat me.

205
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:46,455
(Small CT defiant breath as he
sets himself)

206
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:50,255
A fighting spirit that
lacks hate is like an
eagle without wings.

207
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,522
You have the will,
but you don't have
the tools to do the job.

208
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:59,055
I want to explain
something to you.

209
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:04,522
The only time a Captain ever
swings his sword, is when
it is clearly his duty.

210
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:14,989
Swinging a sword out of
hatred is nothing more than
mindless violence. There is
no honor in such behavior.

211
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:16,555
<i>Aizen...</i>

212
00:20:18,522 --> 00:20:21,322
Your words and actions
prove that you were never
worthy of being a captain.

213
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:22,889
Hmf.

214
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,955
How interesting.

215
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:29,989
You hate me more than
any other Captain in
the Thirteen Court
Guard Squads.

216
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,789
I never expected you to
make such a statement.

217
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:39,389
Can you honestly say you're
not directing hatred at me
with your sword right now?

218
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:45,455
Or perhaps, when Momo
recovered from her
injuries and came to the
World of the Living,

219
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:52,822
...all your anger
evaporated and disappeared?

220
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:04,655
How rude...

221
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:08,022
I'm talking right now,
Captain Kyoraku.

222
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:11,889
You still love to interrupt
people's conversations.

223
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,522
It's a bad habit of yours.

224
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:18,855
I guess I'm busted.
I'm not very good at
listening to men carry on.

225
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:22,155
The fact is, I usually
find them quite boring.

226
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:24,689
I'm sorry you feel that way.

227
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:30,622
But you might as well
know, I intend to continue
talking as I take on the
two of you in battle.

228
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:34,122
[Toshiro]
Say what you will.
But you can stop
talking for now, Aizen.

229
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:36,289
Bankai!

230
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:41,655
Daiguren Hyorinmaru!

231
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,722
I guess what you said
earlier was right.

232
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:51,822
This sword is filled with
hatred, hatred of you!

233
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:56,355
I realize now I didn't
come here to fight you,

234
00:21:56,822 --> 00:21:59,455
I came here to destroy
you and end your terror!

235
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:08,522
Hrraaaaahh!!

236
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:49,677
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Komamura! What the hell?</i>
<i>What happened to you?!</i>

237
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:51,244
<i>[Komamura]</i>
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

238
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:54,577
<i>Your fur! It looks so weird!</i>
<i>It's all fluffy!</i>

239
00:23:54,611 --> 00:23:59,644
<i>Sorry about that. Captain</i>
<i>Hitsugaya's Spiritual Pressure</i>
<i>was so cold, my body reacted</i>
<i>this way instinctively!</i>

240
00:23:59,677 --> 00:24:01,677
You mean that's
your winter coat?
