1
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:17,920
(Shukuro Tsukishima)
Hi, Ichigo.

2
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:35,431
So, it's been a while.

3
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:38,067
(Ichigo) (Gasp) Tsukishima!

4
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,469
You bastard! What are
you doing in my house?

5
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:41,437
Ichigo!

6
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,072
What's wrong with you?!

7
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,107
(Yuzu Kurosaki) Stop it Ichigo!
What's gotten into you?!

8
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:50,112
Yuzu's right! Have you gone crazy?!
Let go, you're hurting him!

9
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:51,514
Answer me!

10
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,483
(Doorbell)

11
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:55,885
(Gasp)

12
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:58,421
(Keigo Asano) Shu, we're here!
Huh?!

13
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:00,590
Oh, I see Ichigo's here,
as well.

14
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,058
Oh, yeah.

15
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:05,194
Hey Ichigo! We here you've been
staying out late for a few days!

16
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:07,530
(Tatsuki Cont'd) You should be
more sensitive to your sisters!

17
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,665
(Cont'd) You've been leaving
them here all alone each night!

18
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,068
(Karin Kurosaki) It's okay. We
were all right without him.

19
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:12,635
(Yuzu Kurosaki)
Come on, Karin!

20
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:14,937
I asked everybody
to come.

21
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:17,406
(Tsukishima cont'd) I
wanted to see the whole

22
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,575
gang since it's been
such a long time.

23
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:22,144
Don't give me that
scary look.

24
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:28,259
I'm sorry I invited everyone so late. But
tomorrow's Sunday, so it's okay, right?

25
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:31,454
(Tsukishima)
You know what?

26
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:34,991
Maybe I'll call Chad
and Orihime, as well.

27
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:40,096
(Gasps)

28
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,264
Ahh!

29
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:43,532
Ugh!

30
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,067
Ah!
What the hell?!

31
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,570
Tsukishima!

32
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,538
All right, Tsukishima!

33
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:53,476
Tell me, what in the hell
did you do to everyone!

34
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:54,610
Tsukishima!

35
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:56,579
Ichigo! What's wrong
with you!

36
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,147
(Gasp)

37
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,883
(Tatsuki) What's your problem!
Apologize to him!

38
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,552
Wait a minute! You
don't understand!

39
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:05,788
You need to say you're
sorry, right now!

40
00:04:16,332 --> 00:04:18,167
What's the matter?

41
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,102
Ichigo!

42
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:22,672
(Keigo) What's gotten into you? You're
not acting like yourself at all!

43
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:24,340
(Cont'd) It's like
you've gone nuts!

44
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:26,008
(Mizuiro) I've never
seen you like this!

45
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:27,977
(Karin)
Ichigo!

46
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,578
Why are you
so upset?

47
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,247
(Yuzu) What did he
ever do to you?

48
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,082
(Karin) You're being so mean!

49
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:34,583
(Mizuiro)
Just apologize!

50
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:36,252
(Karin)
Come on, Ichigo!

51
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:37,887
(Keigo)
Ichigo!

52
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,056
(Keigo) Talk to me,
what's going on?

53
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:40,990
(Yuzu)
It's all your fault,

54
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:42,058
(Karin)
Yuzu's right!

55
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:44,460
Apologize!

56
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,329
(Gasps)

57
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:52,435
What is this?! What
the hell's going on?!

58
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:54,503
Somebody!

59
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:56,138
Anybody!

60
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:57,606
Isn't there anybody
left,

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,878
who's still sane?!

62
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:04,146
Ichigo!

63
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,048
(Gasps)

64
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:07,650
(Ichigo)
Ginjo!

65
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:10,086
(Ginjo)
He got them!

66
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:13,155
(Ginjo cont'd)
Riruka! Kutsuzawa!

67
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:16,192
Yukio! And Jackie!

68
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:19,662
All of them! Tsukishima
got all of them!

69
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:20,376
(Gasp)

70
00:05:31,107 --> 00:05:33,309
(Heavy Breathing)

71
00:05:42,017 --> 00:05:45,187
(Ginjo) We should be safe
here for a little while.

72
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,523
I kept this place in the
event that Tsukishima

73
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,059
was able to find all of
our other safe houses.

74
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:52,194
Looks to me like
it paid off.

75
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:57,666
(Ginjo) No one, not even Riruka and
Kutsuzawa know about this place.

76
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,903
(Ichigo)
Damn it!

77
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:03,672
Why in the hell did all this
have to happen? Damn it!

78
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,208
Why, now!

79
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,910
Ichigo...

80
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:10,279
All of this is your
fault, Ginjo!

81
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:13,649
None of this would have
happened if you hadn't

82
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:17,319
come along and dragged me
into your stupid mess!

83
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,055
Yeah, you're right.

84
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,993
(Ginjo)
I'm sorry...

85
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:27,563
Damn it!

86
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:34,017
(Ichigo) I know, it's not your fault.
You were only trying to help.

87
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,207
And it's not your
fault either.

88
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,002
(Ginjo cont'd) So stop
blaming yourself, Ichigo.

89
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,082
Just before Yukio and the others attacked.
He had something interesting to say.

90
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:53,355
It's just that we
finally remembered.

91
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:56,158
About what?

92
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:59,128
(Gasp)
Damn it!

93
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:02,782
He remembered? What's
that supposed to mean?

94
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:10,072
(Ginjo) I'm not sure. From what Chad
said before, I though Tsukishima's power

95
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:13,342
(cont'd) was centered around his
ability to disrupt memories.

96
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:17,213
(Cont'd) But now I'm not so sure that's
what's going on. Rather than their

97
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:20,449
(cont'd) memories being disrupted, they
sounded more like things were becoming

98
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:23,419
(cont'd) clearer as
they remembered them.

99
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:26,555
Now I think that Tsukishima's
true power is not

100
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:29,391
a disruption of memory,
but a manipulation

101
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:31,493
of past history.

102
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,229
(Gasp)

103
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:38,934
Tsukishima's Fullbring is called 'Book of
the End.' It takes form from a bookmark.

104
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:42,338
(Ginjo Cont'd) Just so we're clear, this
is all based purely on speculation.

105
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:46,275
(cont'd) But if a new power has arisen
from the 'Book of the End', it has to

106
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:51,513
(cont'd) coincide with the
original form of his bookmark.

107
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:55,084
(Ginjo) Tsukishima has to have placed
himself in the pasts of the people

108
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:58,387
(cont'd) he cuts down.
It's the only explanation.

109
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,957
Wait, is that even
possible?

110
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:08,212
Not sure, but you saw the reactions of
your friends and family. I know you did.

111
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:13,202
It's far beyond a matter of trusting or not
trusting the man. To them, Tsukishima's

112
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,305
always been in their lives.
He's now part of

113
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:19,241
their memories accepted
without question.

114
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:26,496
(Ginjo) Tsukishima is seen as family,
as a friend, or even as a lover.

115
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:30,252
(Ginjo cont'd) Someone that they
feel a strong connection with.

116
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:32,454
(Gasp)

117
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:34,123
(Ginjo) Otherwise, there's
no way they would

118
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:35,557
talk like they've all
known him for years.

119
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:38,193
(cont'd) It's an amazing power.
I've never

120
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:40,896
seen it before, and I
still don't understand

121
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,567
(cont'd) how it works. His victims aren't
confused and show no signs of having been

122
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:49,972
(cont'd) manipulated. It's
like he's always been there.

123
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:52,207
In case you hadn't
noticed.

124
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:57,012
The two of us who don't know Tsukishima
are considered the crazy ones.

125
00:08:57,046 --> 00:09:01,583
(Gasps)

126
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:07,056
(Ichigo) Let me ask
you something.

127
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:11,977
If we kill Tsukishima, will
that return things to normal?

128
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:17,333
(Ginjo)
I'll be honest with you.

129
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:21,303
Even if we were able to
pull that off there's

130
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:25,207
no guarantee things would
go back to normal.

131
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,544
(Ginjo) We might end up being despised
by our family and friends as nothing

132
00:09:28,577 --> 00:09:32,414
(cont'd) but murderers. Or they might
believe we've gone crazy, and try to lock

133
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,483
(cont'd)
us in an asylum.

134
00:09:34,516 --> 00:09:38,253
But after seeing what's going
on here, I've become convinced.

135
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,323
We're out of options.
There's only one way.

136
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:45,294
We can break his stranglehold,
we have to kill him!

137
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:47,463
(Gasps)

138
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,565
(Ginjo)
The question is...

139
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:52,134
Can you really kill
the guy...

140
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,337
(cont'd) ...when there's no
guarantee it'll undo everything.

141
00:09:55,337 --> 00:09:56,939
Yes-

142
00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:01,643
(Yukio) Well now, this is a
disturbing conversation.

143
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:05,948
(Yukio) So this is where
you've been hiding.

144
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,351
Ahh!

145
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:21,096
What the hell, Ginjo! You said you were
the only one who knew about that place!

146
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,131
That's right.

147
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:27,436
Then how'd he know?
Damn!

148
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:30,539
Well however they found out,
we have to get away from here!

149
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:36,445
(Yukio) I can't let you do that.

150
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:40,616
(cont'd) You two should be more careful.
You could easily hurt yourselves, running

151
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,317
(cont'd) around in the
streets like this.

152
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:46,255
Yeah, and just how did
you know where we were!

153
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:48,223
Excuse me?

154
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:51,998
What are you talking about?
The same way I always know.

155
00:10:55,998 --> 00:10:58,200
Don't you remember the
system we set up? We

156
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,536
made sure we can make
contact with each other

157
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:03,672
whenever we were
separated.

158
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:08,343
(Yukio) I guess you really
aren't yourself today, Kugo.

159
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,446
Come on, let's go back.

160
00:11:10,446 --> 00:11:14,616
(Yukio) Relax guys. In case you're
wondering, neither Mr. Tsukishima, nor

161
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,587
(Cont'd) anybody else, is angry with
you for your behavior. In fact, we

162
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,524
(cont'd) feel sorry for you.
Everything's going to be okay, though.

163
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,060
(cont'd) We'll bring you
back to your senses.

164
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,563
(Ginjo)
Hmm..

165
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:30,032
(Ichigo)
All right, then.

166
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:34,236
Hold on!

167
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:40,042
Our little friend is offering to take us to
Tsukishima. That sounds like a good plan.

168
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,643
Ichigo...

169
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:45,159
I'm ready to do
whatever it takes.

170
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:31,086
We're here.

171
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,249
Let's go!

172
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:02,276
(Gasps)

173
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:03,844
Welcome!

174
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:07,748
Tsukishima!

175
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:09,416
Hold on!

176
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,418
Let go!

177
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:13,887
We can't charge in there
without thinking! Don't

178
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:16,290
forget, if Tsukishima's power
is what I think it is.

179
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,462
(Ginjo) One single
strike ends everything!

180
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:24,056
Take it easy. Look,
I'm unarmed.

181
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:31,772
I mean it. I have no intention
of fighting either of you.

182
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:33,774
Come in, let's
talk.

183
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:38,312
You have to be kidding! With a house full
of potential traps, you think the two of us

184
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:40,214
would just walk in!

185
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:42,750
You're very paranoid. If
I were going to set a

186
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,985
trap, I wouldn't wait
until the last minute.

187
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:47,221
I would have set it in the
forest, on your way here.

188
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:50,796
(Yukio) You heard the man. Now
hurry up, and come inside.

189
00:13:57,264 --> 00:14:02,703
(Yukio) You heard the man. Now
hurry up, and come inside.

190
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:05,172
Hey, welcome back,
you guys!

191
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:08,409
(People Giggling) Hey
Ichigo how's it going?

192
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:13,147
What are you doing just standing there?
Come on in, and join everybody!

193
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,951
Ichigo!

194
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,987
(Giggling)

195
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,155
Join in!

196
00:14:21,188 --> 00:14:22,890
Glad you could
make it!

197
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,058
Ichigo!

198
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:25,259
Good to see ya!

199
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:26,293
Ichigo!

200
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,362
We've been waiting!

201
00:14:28,395 --> 00:14:31,365
(Laughter)

202
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:36,203
It's all right, Ichigo. These people
consider Tsukishima to be a friend, but

203
00:14:36,236 --> 00:14:40,674
apparently, from their behavior, they
consider you to be a friend, as well.

204
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:44,011
You don't have to worry about them
attacking you. Just stay calm.

205
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:45,879
You should be happy!

206
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,381
(Gasp)

207
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:53,320
Cousin Shu said he's not angry at you
for when you hit him and cut his head!

208
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:58,392
(Keigo) That's right! You're lucky that
he's the kind of person who's so forgiving!

209
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:01,195
Make sure to apologize to him
while you have the chance!

210
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:04,898
(Ikumi) He's right. You
should apologize, Ichigo.

211
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:06,967
(Mizuiro) Great idea!
How 'bout it?

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,236
Come on, it's the
right thing to do!

213
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:13,071
Apologize! Apologize! Apologize!
Please Apologize!

214
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:25,252
Tsukishima!

215
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:26,753
Ichigo!

216
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:27,754
Where are you
going?!

217
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:29,189
Damn it!

218
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:30,844
He just couldn't
bear it!

219
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:40,734
Bastard!

220
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:44,171
(Ichigo) I wish I just could've
killed him back there!

221
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:47,007
But I couldn't. Not
in front of everyone.

222
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:49,810
(Ichigo cont'd) If I
did that I would've

223
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,946
endangered my friends and family.
All of them.

224
00:15:52,980 --> 00:16:00,354
(cont'd) Yuzu, Karin, Tatsuki,
Keigo, Mizuiro, Ms. Ikumi!

225
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:02,168
I won't let that
happen!

226
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:17,137
Hello, good to see you. You
seem to be doing well.

227
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:18,772
(Tsukishima)
Yes...

228
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:20,407
(Gasp)

229
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,380
In fact, he appears to be brimming with
energy. That actually makes me quite happy.

230
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:29,249
Interesting. I thought you
didn't like me, but I

231
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:32,319
could be wrong. I mean you
came up here by yourself.

232
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:36,434
(cont'd) And voluntarily put yourself
in a position where you're surrounded.

233
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:42,296
Now then...

234
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:46,867
(Explosions)

235
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,871
(Ginjo) I destroyed the stairway. Yukio's
the only one who has the power to get

236
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:55,108
(cont'd) up here. That
levels the playing field.

237
00:16:55,142 --> 00:16:59,046
(cont'd) So now, there's really
nothing to hold you back.

238
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:00,981
Fight them with
everything you've got!

239
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:06,253
(Ginjo) Let 'em have it, Ichigo!

240
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:07,421
(Gasp)

241
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:09,289
Aghh!

242
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:09,844
(Gasp)

243
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:34,628
Enough!

244
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:41,475
Just back off!

245
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:54,968
(Grunt)

246
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:58,138
You're not getting
away!

247
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:01,441
Aghh!

248
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,196
Huh! Heh!
Agh!

249
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:10,971
Ahh!

250
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:23,997
So that's your Fullbring
in it's completed form?

251
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:27,200
If so, you've come a long
way in a short time.

252
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:30,003
Is that supposed
to be a compliment?

253
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:34,408
You might as well speak while
you still have the opportunity.

254
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:37,844
My mission is simple.
I came here to kill you.

255
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:38,540
(Gasp)

256
00:18:55,796 --> 00:19:01,735
(Gasp)

257
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:04,709
Chad! Orihime!

258
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:11,178
Sotenkishun!

259
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:12,792
(Orihime cont'd)
I reject!

260
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,157
Don't do it!

261
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:30,097
Stop it, Orihime! Don't help
him out by healing his wounds!

262
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,292
That guy is...

263
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,411
Hm.

264
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:48,749
Well, as always, that was amazing.
Thank you, Orihime.

265
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:53,420
Sure, any time!

266
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,822
Tell me, Chad.

267
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:59,993
(Ichigo cont'd) Have you and
Orihime lost it like the others?

268
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:03,997
What are you talking about, Ichigo? I
don't know what you mean. If you ask me,

269
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,133
you're the one
who's losing it.

270
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,801
(Gasp)

271
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:12,305
(Chad) I don't understand. Why did you
try to kill Mr. Tsukishima just now?

272
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:15,275
Ichigo, how could you do
something so terrible

273
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:17,844
to Mr. Tsukishima?
Have you forgotten,

274
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:19,813
he's always helped
us!

275
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:20,907
(Gasp)

276
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,711
(Chad) That's right. Like the
time when we saved Rukia.

277
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:42,987
(cont'd) Or the time we went to Hueco Mundo
to rescue Orihime from the Arrancar.

278
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:50,025
(cont'd) And finally,
defeating Aizen.

279
00:21:00,153 --> 00:21:06,026
We were only able to accomplish all
that, thanks to Mr. Tsukishima!

280
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:07,387
(Gasp)

281
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:31,303
(Chad) Even back when our
powers were first awakened.

282
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:42,762
(cont'd) And when Orihime
went alone to Hueco Mundo.

283
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:46,458
(cont'd) It was Mr. Tsukishima
who was there for us!

284
00:21:49,035 --> 00:21:54,374
We were able to overcome our challenges,
all thanks to Mr. Tsukishima!

285
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:58,011
(Gasp)

286
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:00,380
You see what's
happening?

287
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:01,982
Ichigo...

288
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:48,487
(Ginjo) Snap out of it, guys!

289
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:50,723
(Yukio) What are you talking about?
Mr. Tsukishima bought me this new

290
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:51,624
(cont'd)
game console!

291
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:53,392
(Ginjo)
Huh?!

292
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:55,261
(Giriko) And that's not all.
He also renovated my bar.

293
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:57,029
(Ginjo)
What?!

294
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:58,597
(Yukio) Join us, and something
good will happen to you, too!

295
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:02,168
(Ginjo) I'm not gonna fall for that!
I won't! I- I think.
