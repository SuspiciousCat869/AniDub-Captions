No way! Impossible!

4
00:02:18,162 --> 00:02:23,001
[Renji]
Listen carefully!
We put all of our Spirit
Energy into that sword!

5
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:27,805
[cont'd]
That's more than enough
to restore Ichigo's
Soul Reaper powers!

6
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,807
Ichigo!

7
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:32,744
[Rukia cont'd]
Show them, Ichigo! Show
them that despair, no
matter how deep,

8
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,046
[cont'd]
will never be
enough to stop you!

9
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:40,151
Right!

10
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:48,993
(Attacking Grunt)

11
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:54,165
Ha! Your Getsugatensho
is much more powerful, but
is that all you've got?

12
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:59,304
Because the bottom line
is, that isn't going to be
enough to kill me, Kurosaki!

13
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:02,307
[Ichigo]
You've got it all
wrong.

14
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,910
That wasn't a
Getsugatensho at all.

15
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,180
Just a strike.

16
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,787
Ahh!

17
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,989
What's happening?

18
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:20,758

this Spirit Energy!

I won't.

You're not going
anywhere.

everything I expected!
I wonder if the Fullbring

he learned increases

And even the old
Head Captain...

72
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,736
You now have all our
powers, Ichigo.

73
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,775
What's up? I thought
it was a serious crime
to transfer your powers
over to a human.

74
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:36,314
We really didn't have
a choice in the matter.
The orders came directly
from the Head Captain.

75
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:39,717
I completely understand
the situation.

76
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,088
Very well then, Kisuke
Urahara. Bring the
sword to me.

77
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:47,291
But Head Captain!
You're sure about this?

78
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:53,631
Despite what people may
think, it remains that
Ichigo Kurosaki has saved
us all. We cannot ignore

79
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:57,134
a debt like that. Now
it is time for us to
repay him.

80
00:07:57,168 --> 00:08:02,239
[cont'd]
We must do this even if
it means breaking tradition.
It would bring perpetual

81
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:09,080
[cont'd]
shame to the Thirteen
Court Guard Squads, to
ignore what we owe him.

82
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,383
This is a direct order
from your Head Captain!

83
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:17,355
Hear me, all Captains
and Lieutenants of the
Thirteen Court Guard
Squads! You are hereby

84
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:24,028
ordered to place your
Spirit Energy into this
sword! We will help Ichigo
Kurosaki regain his

85
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:25,630
[cont'd]
Soul Reaper Powers!

86
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:27,231
[Renji]
That's what happened.

87
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:29,967
Nice move on the part
of the Head Captain,
don't ya think?

88
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,268
[Toshiro]
Don't be ridiculous!

89
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:35,172
It wasn't the rational
idea you'd expect
of a leader.

90
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:38,909
[Toshiro cont'd]
I can tell you, the Head
Captain would have never
made a decision like that

91
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:40,811
[cont'd]
in the past.

92
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:45,049
[cont'd]
The truth is, you're
the one who brought
this on, Ichigo.

93
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:47,652
All these powers are
a gift to you.

94
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:50,855
[Toshiro cont'd]
You're receiving them as
a result of the changes
you made to the Soul

95
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:57,061
[cont'd]
Society in all of your
battles. Accept them
with honor.

96
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:58,629
(Proud Breath)

97
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,232
(Explosion)

98
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:09,373
[Ichigo]
What is that?!

99
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:13,177
You're kidding me.

100
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,049
There are two reasons
why the Head Captain
decided to restore your
Soul Reaper powers.

101
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:20,751
The first one is
just as we told you.

102
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:25,890
[Toshiro cont'd]
And the second has to
do with him.

103
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:30,027
[cont'd]
Long before you ever
appeared, there was another
man in the World of the Living

104
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:34,331
[cont'd]
who was issued a Combat
Pass as a Substitute Soul
Reaper. Only to later

105
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:43,007
[cont'd]
relinquish that position
and disappear.

106
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:52,650
[cont'd]
And that is him! The
first Substitute Soul
Reaper, Kugo Ginjo!

107
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,687
The first Substitute
Soul Reaper?

108
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,622
How is that possible?
But I thought-!

109
00:09:58,656 --> 00:10:02,893
When Jushiro handed you
the Combat Pass, he must
have told you about this.

110
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:08,899
The Soul Society has a
law. It covers the
emergence of a Substitute
Soul Reaper.

111
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,103
[cont'd]
According to that rule,
if the Substitute Soul
Reapers are deemed

112
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:17,041
[cont'd]
beneficial to the Soul
Society, they are given
this Combat Pass as proof

113
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,177
[cont'd]
of their status.

114
00:10:20,177 --> 00:10:25,316
[Toshiro]
The law governing
Substitute Soul Reapers was
created for Ginjo himself.

115
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:27,651
(Gasp)

116
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:29,320
Captain Hitsugaya...

117
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,288
Hm?

118
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:34,391
[Toshiro]
Yes, I know. I'll save
the details for later.
For now, concentrate

119
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,327
[cont'd]
your attention on
him.

120
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,766
Ha! Now that's a good
idea! You guys are gonna
have a very big problem
if he's not focused on me!

121
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,902
[Ginjo cont'd]
Oh by the way, thanks
Kurosaki...

122
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:55,012
If I hadn't borrowed
your powers, your last
attack probably would've
killed me,

123
00:10:55,045 --> 00:11:04,922
(Heavy Breathing
from Running)

124
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:09,827
[Orihime]
Ichigo, he was
crying.

125
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,830
[cont'd]
I don't understand.

126
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:16,767
[cont'd]
Ichigo and Mr.
Tsukishima are best
friends.

127
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:21,906
[cont'd]
So why did things
turn out like this?

128
00:11:21,906 --> 00:11:24,708
[cont'd]
Mr. Tsukishima is the
one I love.

129
00:11:24,742 --> 00:11:29,780
[cont'd]
Way, way before I even met
Ichigo, he was there in my
life, watching over me.

130
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:34,385
[cont'd]
He always protected me
and treated me with
kindness.

131
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:38,856
[cont'd]
For as long as I can
remember, I've always
looked up to him. He means

132
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:43,160
[cont'd]
everything to me. And
I would sacrifice anything
for Mr. Tsukishima.

133
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,897
[cont'd]
That's how I've
always felt.

134
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,866
[cont'd]
So then why?

135
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:56,774
Why does it hurt me
more to see Ichigo
cry like that!

136
00:11:56,807 --> 00:12:01,045
[Orihime cont'd]
I don't know why, but
I can't stand it.
It's so painful, it

137
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:05,649
[cont'd]
hurts in my mind,
my heart, and even in
the pit of my stomach!

138
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:07,818
Please don't cry,
Ichigo!

139
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,956
[cont'd]
It's tearing me
apart!

140
00:12:11,989 --> 00:12:22,967
Please don't cry!

141
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,104
Ichigo, thank
goodness you're
not crying!

142
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,372
(Gasp)

143
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:32,643
[Orihime]
Rukia! Renji!
Toshiro!

144
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:37,681
Do you see that, Chad?
They all came here to
stop Ichigo!

145
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,651
[Chad]
Something's not right.

146
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:45,322
Why is everyone up
there standing
behind Ichigo?

147
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:50,294
[Chad]
I thought they all came
to stop him. But now,
instead, it looks like

148
00:12:50,327 --> 00:12:52,763
[cont'd]
they've come to
defeat Ginjo!

149
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:58,002
(Scared Gasps)

150
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:01,839
(Chuckle)

151
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:05,042
[Tsukishima]
What's the matter,
you two?

152
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:09,280
[Tsukishima]
Could it be you're
having doubts about
your past.

153
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:27,598
Mr. Tsukishima?

154
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:29,800
[Tsukishima]
Why are you looking
at me like that?

155
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,671
Don't tell me you've
already forgotten all
the memories we've shared.

156
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:35,673
(Nervous Breath)

157
00:13:35,673 --> 00:13:37,207
[Tsukishima]
Think about it. Who
was it who protected
you from you parents,

158
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:42,813
[cont'd]
and raised you,
Orihime?

159
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:45,115
(Scared Breathing)

160
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:46,317
(Chuckle)

161
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,985
(Scared Breathing)

162
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:49,620
[Tsukishima]
And who was it that
gave you that pendant
when you were just

163
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:59,229
[cont'd]
a young boy, Chad?

164
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:03,000
Something's not
right with me!

165
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:08,172
I'm alive right now
because of Mr. Tsukishima,
so why am I having doubts?

166
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:10,040
I believe in...

167
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:15,245
I believe in..
I believe in Mr.
Tsukishima!

168
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,183
He's my true friend!
He's always been!

169
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:25,089
Tsukishima! Stop
drilling more memories
into them! You'll make
them useless to us!

170
00:14:25,122 --> 00:14:28,892
[Ginjo cont'd]
You realize how many
people you've broken
like that?!

171
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:30,127
(Painful Grunt)

172
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,997
(Painful Grunt)

173
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,799
Well, that was easier
than I thought it'd
be!

174
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,203
Really? I'm the one
with all the dead
weight on my shoulders!

175
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:41,105
(Nervous Breath)

176
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:46,110
Thanks to you careless
efforts to unsettle them,
Mr. Tsukishima, we were
easily able to come up

177
00:14:46,143 --> 00:14:48,145
behind and knock
them unconscious.

178
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,749
In the end, you
did us a great favor.

179
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:55,185
[Kisuke cont'd]
Now that they've both
been temporarily taken
out of action, we won't

180
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:59,356
[cont'd]
have to worry about
accidentally injuring them in
the event of a confrontation.

181
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,793
[cont'd]
And you don't have to
worry, Ichigo! We've
already moved the others

182
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:11,101
[cont'd]
to a safe place. So
now, you'll be able to
fight without holding back!

183
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:12,669
[Jackie]
Kugo!

184
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:14,238
Huh?

185
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:17,007
[Giriko]
What?! I knew
this would happen!

186
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,809
(Gasp)

187
00:15:18,842 --> 00:15:23,714
This is really quite
unfair! We had an
agreement! How could you
take Ichigo's power

188
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:24,948
all for yourself?!

189
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:26,183
Hold on, Giriko!

190
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:33,123
He's right! You promised
to split his powers
with all of us!

191
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:38,128
Everybody just chill out
here! I, for one, don't
really care about having
Ichigo's powers!

192
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:48,205
[Ginjo]
All of you, shut up!
I don't need to be
reminded of what I said.

193
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:55,279
There. I just shared a
portion of Ichigo's
powers. Happy?

194
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:58,015
Ah!

195
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,717
Ah! This feels great!

196
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,353
(Happy sigh)

197
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:13,597
Wait a minute!
Stop!

198
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:18,802
Wait a minute!
Stop!

199
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:20,204
(Angry grunt)

200
00:16:20,204 --> 00:16:25,976
It's wonderful!
Amazing! Ichigo's
Fullbring is truly an
awesome power!

201
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:31,281
[Giriko cont'd]
It feels like my entire
body is being rejuvenated!
I feel as I did in my youth!

202
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:38,922
I'm not surprised at
you reaction, it's what
I'd expect, for an old guy.

203
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,757
(Amused Grunt)

204
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,193
[Tsukishima]
Aren't you going to
share this with
Shishigawara?

205
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:45,762
It's not nice of you
to leave him out.

206
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,233
The truth is, I thought
it would be risky
to increase his power.

207
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:55,806
When this fight's
finally over. I want
you to kill him.

208
00:16:55,806 --> 00:17:01,712
(Sigh)
That's too bad, I
thought he had an
interesting ability.

209
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:05,215
All right! Here we
come, Ichigo!

210
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:09,686
[Giriko]
In a few minutes, you
will be able to fully
feel the wonderful power

211
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:13,390
[cont'd]
you've given us!

212
00:17:13,624 --> 00:17:17,661
Oh, listen to him,
all in your face.

213
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:22,299
Stay back, Ikkaku. It's
my fault their powers
have been allowed to
increase.

214
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:27,304
Let me handle this.

215
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,039
[Giriko]
What?

216
00:17:29,072 --> 00:17:32,276
Wait, what in the
world do you think
you're doing?

217
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:38,682
Don't tell me you're
going to try to take
on all of us at once!

218
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:42,386
(Stunned Gasps)

219
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:44,321
(Explosion)

220
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,956
(Painful Grunts)

221
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:47,124
Ah!

222
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:52,196
(Painful Grunt)

223
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,333
I went easy on you.
That's why you're
all still alive.

224
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,669
[Yukio]
Oh, really?

225
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:02,606
[cont'd]
I suppose you're
proud of yourself for
that! You think you're so

226
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:07,077
[cont'd]
cool, but you're just
a joke to us. You don't
get it do you? You think

227
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,981
[cont'd]
the tag here should be
'You have defeated the
enemy.' But in fact,

228
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:15,219
[cont'd]
the tag reads 'The
enemy has evaded your
attack.'

229
00:18:15,252 --> 00:18:21,725
Thanks to my Digital
Radial Invaders.

230
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:26,063
Pretty cool, isn't it?
It's one of the new
upgrades I just got.

231
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,166
Something that came
with taking away
your Fullbring.

232
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:37,007
That's right. We can
all now wear and emit
our Fullbring just like
you did.

233
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,145
Before, my Invaders
Must Die would only
work inside video games.

234
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,749
But thanks to you, I
can now extend its
powers to the real world
too.

235
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:48,719
[Ikkaku]
You're way too soft
on them, Ichigo!

236
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:52,022
(Painful Grunt)

237
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:53,957
Ikkaku!

238
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:58,061
There's no point trying
to end this fight by
striking your enemies with
the flat of your blade.

239
00:18:58,061 --> 00:19:00,030
You have to crush
them quickly!

240
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:03,700
[Ikkaku]
They started the fight.
They have to live with
the consequences.

241
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:13,110
(Gasp)

242
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:15,279
Stay sharp, Ikkaku.

243
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:17,147
Sorry, Captain.

244
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,018
Not bad. What do
you think? Should I
award bonus points?

245
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:23,320
No, don't bother.

246
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:30,127
Ahh!

247
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,599
[Ikkaku]
Who in the hell
are you?

248
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,902
Hm?

249
00:19:38,935 --> 00:19:44,207
Ugh.

250
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:48,812
Looks like we're all
properly positioned
for the battles that
are about to come.

251
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:58,088
[Yukio]
Let me assign spaces
for each pairing.

252
00:19:58,088 --> 00:19:59,122
Huh?

253
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,592
Hold on there,
Byakuya. That one
looks stronger.

254
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:12,636
[Kenpachi]
Switch with me!

255
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:27,250
[Kenpachi]
Switch with me!

256
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:31,722
[Giriko]
Excuse me, you wanted to
switch because another
opponent looked stronger

257
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:32,789
[cont'd]
to you?

258
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:36,927
I must say that's
quite insulting,
my friend.

259
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,666
I couldn't care less
if you're insulted.
It's boring to cut down
weaklings like you.

260
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:47,204
You seem to be a
muscle-bound idiot
as far as I can tell.
Let's see if you have the

261
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:57,214
same attitude after
I smash my way
right through you.

262
00:20:57,247 --> 00:21:07,290
same attitude after
I smash my way
right through you.

263
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:12,929
same attitude after
I smash my way
right through you.

264
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:18,668
Still think I'm just
a weakling? Or am I more
suitable, now that my
Time Tells No Lies has

265
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:20,670
transformed me?

266
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,340
[Giriko]
I've discovered that
the simpler the terms
of my contract with the

267
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,677
[cont'd]
Gods of Time, the
more powerfully it's
manifested!

268
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:31,081
[Giriko]
Are you impressed
so far!

269
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:35,051
My contract right now
is an increase in
power!

270
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,221
As you can plainly
see, I am more
powerful than anyo-

271
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:43,193
What happened?

272
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:51,001
Impossible!

273
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:53,870
(Chuckle)

274
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:57,105
What a waste of
my time.

275
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,845
[Ichigo]
You guys have
changed, Toshiro.

276
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:53,182
[Toshiro]
We've trained to become
stronger in both mind
and body. Our appearance

277
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,717
[cont'd]
reflects those
changes.

278
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:56,719
[Ichigo]
Well, I wouldn't
say you've changed
that much.

279
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:59,222
[Toshiro]
What do you mean?!
Look at me!
I'm a lot taller now!

280
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:01,524
[Ichigo]
I guess that depends
on your perspective,
shorty.
