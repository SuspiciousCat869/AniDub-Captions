1
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:09,086
The reason is, because
you're a human and--

2
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:12,204
Your Spirit Energy
works very well.

3
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:16,904
I'm very pleased.
You've matured
splendidly.

4
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:22,104
Just the way I wanted you to.

5
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:24,137
Eh? What?!

6
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:35,204
<i>The truth is, Ichigo Kurosaki,</i>
<i>All of the battles you've</i>
<i>fought up to now,</i>

7
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:39,437
were simply a
part of my plan.

8
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,137
Eh heh, heh heh heh.

9
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:58,937
Who the hell are you?
Hirako, answer me!

10
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:06,204
[gasp]

11
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:09,537
What do you see? Tell me.

12
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:14,804
Try and, guess, if ya can?

13
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:17,037
A Hollow mask!

14
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:21,304
Yes. A Zanpakuto,
and a Hollow mask.

15
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:23,537
You get it now?

16
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:29,071
You see, I'm a Visored.

17
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,471
You're one of us, Ichigo.

18
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,571
<i>You do not belong with them.</i>

19
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:42,204
You have got to know that you do
not belong with them at all.

20
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:55,471
Lord Aizen.

21
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:59,904
It appears Shinji Hirako
has made contact with
Ichigo Kurosaki.

22
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:02,204
I see.

23
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,704
What's your next move?

24
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:07,671
Let's see.

25
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:12,137
Contact Ulquiorra.
Let's have him go to
the World of the Living.

26
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:13,104
Yes sir!

27
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:17,104
So Captain.

28
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:20,804
I see that you're
still quite cautious.

29
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:23,437
Bankai!!

30
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:33,704
Tensa Zangetsu.

31
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:41,371
<i>[Ulquiorra]</i>
<i>The orange hair,</i>
<i>The black Bankai,</i>

32
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:45,971
There's no doubt about it.
This is our target, Yammy,
he's the one.

33
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:49,137
So he saved us the trouble
of searching for him, hah!

34
00:04:49,537 --> 00:04:51,004
Que Suerute!

35
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:54,304
Hmm?

36
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,871
Auuggghh!

37
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:04,937
[panting]

38
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:08,837
Damn! You little runt!

39
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:14,404
I can't believe you need
your Zanpakuto to deal
with a runt like this.

40
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:16,371
<i>Shut up and</i>
<i>stay back!</i>

41
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:17,804
That's a Zanpakuto?

42
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:21,571
<i>I should have known!</i>
<i>His sword is a Zanpakuto!</i>

43
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:26,404
<i>The cracked Hollow mask...</i>
<i>the hole in his chest and</i>
<i>the Zanpakuto...</i>

44
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:29,404
<i>I knew I felt something</i>
<i>odd about their</i>
<i>Spiritual Pressure!</i>

45
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:33,704
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Who are these guys!?</i>

46
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:34,971
<i>Are they visoreds!?</i>

47
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:36,771
<i>Like Shinji and me?</i>

48
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:38,871
Huuuah!

49
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,171
<i>Damn it, I can't move my body!</i>

50
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:56,304
<i>I rejected you, so now</i>
<i>you wanna get in my</i>
<i>way and sabotage me?!</i>

51
00:05:58,371 --> 00:05:59,771
<i>Damn it!</i>

52
00:06:02,804 --> 00:06:04,604
Time for you to disappear!

53
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:15,037
Hey there!

54
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,771
Sorry I couldn't get
here sooner, Ichigo.
You know how it is.

55
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:24,271
[Ulquiorra]
we've completed
our mission here.

56
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:28,337
It's time we deliver our
report to Lord Aizen.

57
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:34,671
I'll tell him the Soul
Reaper he's interested in
has no value whatsoever.
He's not even worth killing.

58
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,171
<i>[Shinji]</i>
<i>Good job finding</i>
<i>this place, Ichigo.</i>

59
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:52,904
My, so serious?

60
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:55,204
[chuckles]
Ah hah hah hah hah!

61
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:59,337
I wonder what that means?
Wait! Have you finally
decided to join us?

62
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:02,204
<i>I'm sort of impressed</i>
<i>you found our hideout.</i>

63
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:04,337
RrrraAAAAHHH!

64
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,337
Impossible!

65
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,337
[panting]

66
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:33,371
GrrrraAAAHH!!

67
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,037
He finally mastered
Hollowfication.

68
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:39,471
He's developed quickly.
I suppose that's to be expected.

69
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:40,404
Lord Aizen.

70
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:42,271
Yes, what is it?

71
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:45,571
Sir. I've made sure
everything is ready.

72
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:47,871
I see.

73
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:50,204
So this is it.

74
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:51,404
Sir?

75
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:54,104
Nothing.
It's not
important.

76
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:56,937
I will leave the
rest to Ulquiorra.

77
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:03,671
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Get up...</i>
<i>Get up!</i>

78
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,971
<i>I have to get up!</i>

79
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:12,004
<i>I promise... I will...</i>

80
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:16,004
I will protect you!!

81
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,404
Impossible!
With his bare hand?!

82
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:46,037
[animal roar]
Graaahh!!!

83
00:10:59,404 --> 00:11:02,337
You said all of the
battles I fought,

84
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:05,537
<i>were planned by you?!</i>

85
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:15,271
What exactly,

86
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:17,971
do you mean
by that?

87
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:22,871
I just asked you what you
meant, now answer me!

88
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:31,971
Your voice.

89
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:33,337
Nh?

90
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:36,671
You don't have to
raise your voice.
There's no need for that.

91
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,637
There's nothing to
be surprised about.

92
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,104
Allow me to explain.

93
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:45,904
I made a conscious
decision about you.

94
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:48,337
I decided to actively
assist your development,

95
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:51,571
because I believed that
you would be a great
research subject.

96
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:54,437
That is all I am saying.

97
00:11:55,237 --> 00:11:56,237
[gasp]

98
00:11:58,371 --> 00:12:00,571
Didn't you ever think
it was strange?

99
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:06,304
<i>You had never seen or even</i>
<i>heard of Hollows until you</i>
<i>met Rukia Kuchiki,</i>

100
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:11,537
<i>And yet, within a few days</i>
<i>after meeting her, you found</i>
<i>yourself attacked by one.</i>

101
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:19,071
<i>How do you suppose a Menos</i>
<i>Grande was drawn to that</i>
<i>Quincy's bait which could only</i>
<i>attract low-level Hollows?</i>

102
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:25,071
<i>Once you started getting</i>
<i>used to fighting as a Soul</i>
<i>Reaper, a very significant</i>
<i>event occurred.</i>

103
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:30,637
<i>Do you think it was a</i>
<i>coincidence that Rukia</i>
<i>Kuchiki's previously</i>
<i>undetected Spiritual Pressure</i>

104
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:33,337
<i>was suddenly detected and</i>
<i>reported to the Soul Society?</i>

105
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:38,804
<i>You battled Renji Abarai,</i>
<i>Kenpachi Zaraki,</i>
<i>Byakuya Kuchiki.</i>

106
00:12:38,837 --> 00:12:43,337
Don't you find it strange that
against all these highly trained
and formidable warriors,

107
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:46,004
<i>your power was somehow</i>
<i>comparable to theirs?</i>

108
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,804
I was in control of
all those events.

109
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:51,804
[gasp]

110
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,971
You thought all that
happened by chance?

111
00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:58,371
Hold on.

112
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:01,104
You thought that attack
was simply your fate?

113
00:13:02,204 --> 00:13:03,037
Wait...

114
00:13:04,104 --> 00:13:06,171
Your victories weren't
because of your hard work.

115
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,071
Grrahh!

116
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:17,837
Don't disappoint me.

117
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:21,871
By this point, your
power should be much
greater than this.

118
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:25,937
So now do you
believe what I've
just told you?

119
00:13:27,837 --> 00:13:29,271
Of course I don't!

120
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:31,604
Well, It's the truth.

121
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:33,004
You're lying!

122
00:13:34,737 --> 00:13:38,704
You planned all of my battles??
All of them were your doing?!
You controlled them!?

123
00:13:39,804 --> 00:13:42,071
You really expect me
to believe all that?!

124
00:13:42,837 --> 00:13:45,604
<i>You said before that when</i>
<i>you first found Rukia,</i>

125
00:13:45,637 --> 00:13:49,537
<i>it was after she went</i>
<i>missing in the World of</i>
<i>the Living! Remember?</i>

126
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:54,404
And yet now you say that
you knew about me since
the time I met her?!

127
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:56,571
That doesn't make any sense!

128
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:58,237
I knew you'd say that.

129
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:02,171
You heard what I said
and called me a liar.

130
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:05,004
Now you refuse to believe
what I've shared.

131
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:09,737
Your mind may not want to
accept these revelations.

132
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:15,004
But inside you there's
a voice saying,
"Accept it- It's the truth."

133
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:24,104
Soon you'll know.
Time will help.

134
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:26,904
I feel sorry about
your confusion.

135
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:29,371
But this world's never really
been about truth or lies.

136
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:33,137
In this world, there's
only one thing that's
worth knowing;

137
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:34,571
Hard facts.

138
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:36,937
<i>Despite this</i>
<i>universal truth,</i>

139
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:42,137
<i>people misguidedly</i>
<i>choose to only accept</i>
<i>the facts that appeal to</i>
<i>their way of thinking.</i>

140
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:46,437
<i>They're so limited, they can</i>
<i>only accept the truths that</i>
<i>are comfortable for them.</i>

141
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:53,404
So, this is simply
about wanting to hang on
to your personal power.

142
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:59,637
Realizing things may not have
been as we accepted them to be
unsettles us; it's overwhelming.

143
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:05,571
Are you absolutely sure
that you know the truth?

144
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:11,537
<i>Do you know who stationed</i>
<i>Rukia Kuchiki in the</i>
<i>World of the Living?</i>

145
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:18,337
Or who endowed Renji Abarai's
gear with the ability to detect
Spiritual Pressure?

146
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:26,404
And then, who was it that added
the information on your
whereabouts to that report that
was sent to the Lieutenants?

147
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:33,037
You think I wasn't able to
find where the Hogyoku was
for over a hundred years?

148
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:36,437
Do you really find that
completely believable?

149
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,604
Aizen. One thing.

150
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,004
I want to ask you.

151
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:53,404
You said that you
believed that I would be
a great research subject.

152
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:58,771
<i>Why did you think that?</i>
<i>What did you base that</i>
<i>thinking on?</i>

153
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:04,971
You're claiming you saw me
when I met Rukia. So tell me,

154
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:07,871
When the hell did I become
a project for you?!

155
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,337
Since the beginning.

156
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,437
Stop with that nonsense.

157
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:19,404
Listen to me.
I'm saying from
when you were born.

158
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:25,937
When I said "since the
beginning", I meant I've known
about you since you were born.

159
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:28,804
What?!

160
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:34,137
The moment you were born,
I knew you were a special case.

161
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:38,571
The reason is, because
you're a human, and--

162
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:44,771
Tch.

163
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,571
You talk too much... Aizen.

164
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:05,162
The reason is, because
you're a human, and--

165
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,162
<i>"I'm human and" what?</i>

166
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:15,195
<i>The rest of what he said was</i>
<i>drowned out by the noise.</i>

167
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:17,562
<i>I thought I'd lost my</i>
<i>chance to hear it.</i>

168
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:21,862
<i>But I was wrong.</i>
<i>I never needed to</i>
<i>hear his words.</i>

169
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:25,062
<i>Because right before my eyes,</i>
<i>the answer soon appeared.</i>

170
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:39,895
Dad? Is that...you?

171
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:47,862
Hey! Say something.

172
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:51,562
Dad?

173
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:57,895
Haiigh!

174
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:05,728
What the hellll!!!!

175
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:08,462
Hmph.

176
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:16,762
Keeping his distance.
A wise decision.

177
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:19,628
Must be in their blood.

178
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:34,662
[muffled shouting]

179
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:39,028
Shut up! I know what
you want to ask!
Be quiet or I'll--

180
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:42,762
[gasping inhale]

181
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:47,262
I know that I have to
be quiet, you idiot!
I was yelling to you
I couldn't breathe!

182
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:49,228
Oh! S-Sorry!

183
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:56,328
[rubbing off pain grunt]
Mmh. You're not imaging this.
I'm really here.

184
00:18:57,628 --> 00:18:58,995
Yeah, so it seems.

185
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:02,928
We'll talk later.

186
00:19:05,428 --> 00:19:10,028
There's gotta be a ton
of things you want to
ask me about. But to
tell the truth there's--

187
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:10,962
<i>No, not really.</i>

188
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:11,795
Hm?!

189
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:19,495
There's nothing I wanna ask.
You probably had your reasons
for not telling me
about everything.

190
00:19:20,195 --> 00:19:22,362
You had problems you
didn't want to talk about.

191
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,028
There's no good
way for me to ask
you about them.

192
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:36,228
<i>And I don't want to rip your</i>
<i>heart out with questions</i>
<i>right now. I'm sure one day</i>
<i>we'll get around to it.</i>

193
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:39,962
<i>I can wait.</i>

194
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:44,495
Until you feel like
telling me about it all.

195
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:48,195
Whenever you decide
that the time is right.

196
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:53,895
You can choose when we'll have
our little conversation.

197
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:58,062
Sounds like you've matured.
Seems you've learned to be
more patient.

198
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:00,762
Guess I have.

199
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:04,895
I guess you could say
somebody else has taught me a
lot of good habits that have
changed me for the better.

200
00:20:10,928 --> 00:20:13,128
Thanks for hitting me
so hard up there, dad.

201
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:19,695
I feel like...
I've finally
come back home.

202
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:23,262
Heh. Ichigo,

203
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:26,362
I didn't hit you,
I head-butted you.

204
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:29,428
Hitting or head-butting,
What's the difference?

205
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,428
Way to ruin the mood, old man.

206
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:51,295
They hid their pressures.
And have created a pretty
powerful barrier.

207
00:20:55,295 --> 00:21:00,028
You've been watching for quite
a long time, haven't you, Gin?

208
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:04,562
You shouldn't assume
I've just been watching.

209
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:07,995
I just didn't think you needed
my assistance with him yet.

210
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:11,328
I see.

211
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:22,562
[battle shout]
T'heeeyaaahh!

212
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:27,028
Huh?

213
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:42,895
[gasp]

214
00:21:57,128 --> 00:21:59,995
It's been a while since
I've fought you hasn't it?

215
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:07,562
This time, I won't
be holding back.

216
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,446
<i>[Isshin]</i>
<i>Say Ichigo! You sure you</i>
<i>don't want to ask me?</i>

217
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,213
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

218
00:23:50,246 --> 00:23:51,046
<i>[Isshin]</i>
<i>You sure?</i>

219
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,913
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

220
00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:54,646
<i>[Isshin]</i>
<i>Really? You don't want</i>
<i>to know what happened in</i>
<i>your daddy's past?</i>

221
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,046
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>I said I'm fine!</i>

222
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,646
<i>[Isshin]</i>
<i>Aw really?! Come on,</i>
<i>are you like SURE sure?</i>

223
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,613
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>You want me to</i>
<i>ask, don't you?</i>
