00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:52,402
NARRATOR: As the only surviving
heir of the noble Kasumioji

3
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:55,677
Clan, Princess Rurichiyo has
become a target for trouble

4
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,911
in her homeland.

5
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:59,111
For her own protection,
her guardians

6
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:02,244
took the unsuspecting princess
to the world of the living,

7
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:06,044
where Ichigo reluctantly
agreed to become her bodyguard.

8
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:09,277
Rurichiyo quickly turned
Ichigo's world upside down

9
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:10,911
with her spoiled behavior.

10
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:14,611
Assassins sent by the viceroy
of the Kasumioji Clan, Gyokaku

11
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:18,777
Kumoi, were taken down by
Ichigo and his friends.

12
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:21,277
Frustrated by the string
of missed opportunities

13
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:24,711
and spoiled plans, Kumoi
reassesses his strategy.

14
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:33,944
-Lord Kumoi, why was
Princess Rurichiyo

15
00:02:33,977 --> 00:02:37,977
allowed to return to
the world of the living?

16
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:41,611
-I cannot act hastily and
attract the attention of the 13

17
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:42,611
Court Guard Squads.

18
00:02:50,877 --> 00:02:53,877
Hanza Nukui, I'm entrusting
you with this sword.

19
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:03,744
I want you to visit the
world of the living.

20
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:07,244
Find and eliminate
Rurichiyo, as well as

21
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:09,911
anyone else who
dares to protect her.

22
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:17,544
-Hm.

23
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:31,811
-Now I can focus my attention
on what must be done right here.

24
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:52,677
-I'm so bored.

25
00:03:52,711 --> 00:04:00,144
[yawn] I wonder, where
has Rurichiyo gone?

26
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:01,844
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Master Kannogi?

27
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:03,844
-Huh?

28
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,644
In here!

29
00:04:05,677 --> 00:04:08,011
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Master Kumoi wishes to see you.

30
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:10,011
He requests your presence
in the meeting room.

31
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:11,511
-[sigh]

32
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:17,911
LIRIN (OFFSCREEN): I
said move out of the way!

33
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:26,111
Who do you think
you are, blocking

34
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:27,844
people's way with
that big, bulky body?

35
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:29,811
This is my house, you know!

36
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:31,044
-Ahem.

37
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:32,911
Technically, it's not
actually your house, Lirin.

38
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:35,477
I mean, after all, we are
just merely moochers here.

39
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:38,011
-I think you're
missing her point.

40
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:42,111
--[screams] Will you stop
nitpicking every little detail?

41
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:45,877
Hm.

42
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,311
Move it!

43
00:04:48,344 --> 00:04:51,211
[screams]

44
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:52,177
That's it!

45
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:53,244
Now I'm angry!

46
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:55,477
-You mean you weren't
angry before now?

47
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,877
-That was calm for her.

48
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:01,244
-Get ready for the pain!

49
00:05:01,277 --> 00:05:05,211
-Who knew a game this
simple could be so much fun?

50
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:07,177
-You're so good
at it, Rurichiyo.

51
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,844
-Oh, give me a break.

52
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:11,111
It takes no skill to
play a game like that.

53
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,777
A monkey could do it.

54
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:18,344
I suppose you're gonna tell
me that was just an accident!

55
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:19,944
-I just wanted to
show you that I

56
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:21,677
have better skills
than a monkey.

57
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:23,377
-All right, if it's
a fight you want,

58
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,377
you've come to the right guy!

59
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,344
Huh?

60
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:27,311
Uh, hello?

61
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:30,344
C-can I help you?

62
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:30,844
Whoa!

63
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:41,377
-Still, I am surprised you
all made it back safely.

64
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:44,644
Did you use the Kasumioji
Clan's private Senkaimon

65
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,411
for your return trip?

66
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:47,611
-Yeah.

67
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:50,077
Just to be on the safe
side, we waited until dark

68
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,077
before heading over to the gate.

69
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:55,611
But now that I think about it,
it was pretty easy to get back.

70
00:05:55,644 --> 00:06:01,144
-It was as if they just simply
let us go, almost on purpose.

71
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:03,811
-Not almost.

72
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:06,044
They did let you go on purpose.

73
00:06:06,077 --> 00:06:08,144
-It's much easier to
settle one's affairs

74
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:10,677
in the world of the
living, that's for sure.

75
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:12,911
I bet that's why you
got away so easy.

76
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,511
-Kisuke, we have a question.

77
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,077
-Is it true that
you might actually

78
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:21,677
be running low on supplies?

79
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:25,244
-Well I can't give you a lot of
details about that right now.

80
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:26,277
But it's true.

81
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:29,311
Products are getting
harder to obtain.

82
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:33,711
[sigh] Our supplies
have never been lower.

83
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:37,011
And there's definitely been
less of the raw material.

84
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:38,677
-Raw material?

85
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:40,244
-I'm talking about Reishi.

86
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:43,244
For some unknown reason, there's
one particular type of it

87
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,811
that's being
depleted drastically.

88
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:48,277
-But I went over there
recently, and I'm telling you,

89
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:50,911
there was no sign of that
happening whatsoever.

90
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,944
-That's because it's all
happening under the radar.

91
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:56,677
Still, it's hard to believe
that something like this

92
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:58,877
is occurring naturally.

93
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:01,911
-You think someone is
doing this intentionally?

94
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:04,344
-I checked many sources,
but I can't fully

95
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:07,511
come to that conclusion
without evidence.

96
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:09,477
However--

97
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:11,311
-What is it?

98
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:16,311
-There is one thing we can
connect to this phenomenon,

99
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:19,011
and it concerns our
little princess.

100
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:23,111
It seems it all began
as soon as she appeared.

101
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:25,877
-You don't think that's
just a coincidence?

102
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:30,844
-No, we can't
dismiss it so easily.

103
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:34,111
The high ranking Kasumioji
are second to the four

104
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:36,544
great noble clans,
but recently, there

105
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:39,477
have been suspicions about
something unusual happening

106
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:41,311
within the clan.

107
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,744
I don't know exactly
what that might be,

108
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:46,711
but I can tell you that
we have never before had

109
00:07:46,744 --> 00:07:50,111
a lack of raw material
in the Soul Society.

110
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:53,744
I have to believe they're
connected in some way.

111
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:56,977
-Kenryu, do you know
anything about this?

112
00:07:57,011 --> 00:08:01,377
-We are only interested in the
protection of Lady Rurichiyo.

113
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:03,011
Nothing else concerns us.

114
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:04,544
-That's convenient.

115
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:08,277
Gee, for somebody who
expects us to protect him,

116
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:11,644
you might want to help us
out every now and then.

117
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:12,677
-Quiet!

118
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:15,344
-Now, now, why don't
we just investigate

119
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:16,911
the situation a bit more?

120
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:21,944
Because I'm beginning to
think there's a lot more

121
00:08:21,977 --> 00:08:25,277
going on here than
what meets the eye.

122
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,811
-[growl]

123
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:38,944
-You are to lure them away from
Princess Rurichiyo as planned.

124
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:47,377
Now then, substitute
Soul Reaper,

125
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:50,177
time to show me how
good you really are.

126
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,244
-Feel that?

127
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:00,277
Spiritual pressure.

128
00:09:00,311 --> 00:09:05,111
-Rukia and Orihime, take
Rurichiyo home right away.

129
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,977
-What about you?

130
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:08,377
-I'm gonna check it out.

131
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:09,611
-I'm coming too.

132
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:10,111
-Mm.

133
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:10,611
-Fine.

134
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:20,011
-Chappy, I want you want
you to watch Ichigo's body.

135
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:21,944
-Leave it to me, Miss.

136
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:28,244
-What did you just say?

137
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:35,877
-I said Master Shu
Kannogi will become

138
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,544
the new head of
the Kasumioji Clan.

139
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:41,077
Why?

140
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:43,344
Is there some sort
of problem with that?

141
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:46,411
-I cannot agree to such an
important decision as that

142
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:49,244
in the time of Lady
Rurichiyo's absence!

143
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:50,511
-Agreed.

144
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:54,412
The Kasumioji Clan has always
had a female sovereign.

145
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:57,652
In fact, it has been an ironclad
law passed down generation

146
00:09:57,685 --> 00:09:59,719
after generation for centuries.

147
00:09:59,752 --> 00:10:02,352
A male cannot head our clan.

148
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:06,019
-But are you forgetting that
Lord Kannogi came to this clan

149
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,419
as Princess
Rurichiyo's betrothed?

150
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,152
Even though he will
be in this position

151
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:14,985
only while the princess
remains absent,

152
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,052
it is in the Kasumioji
Clan's best interest

153
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,185
to ask him to be our lord.

154
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,485
[murmuring]

155
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,619
-I am opposed to this decision.

156
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:27,385
-I won't abide by this either.

157
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:27,885
-Hm.

158
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:44,185
-The enemy's presence continues
to spread all over the town.

159
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:46,152
It must be a trap.

160
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:48,319
-We'll know as soon
as we fight them.

161
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:49,052
Let's split up.

162
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:49,552
-Yeah.

163
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:11,785
-Spiritual pressure,
same as before.

164
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,752
-I see.

165
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:20,052
You sensed it after all.

166
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:21,185
-Yeah.

167
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:23,219
I felt your spiritual
pressure when I was back

168
00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:24,985
in the Soul Society, didn't I?

169
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,252
-Hanza Nukui.

170
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:35,219
Now that I've introduced
myself, show me

171
00:11:35,252 --> 00:11:37,919
just how good a
substitute Soul Reaper is.

172
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:17,192
-Hm.

173
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,112
-Are there more
bandits after me?

174
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:24,212
-Yes.

175
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:26,412
-Why is my life being
targeted like this?

176
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,479
-I can't explain the
situation to you right now.

177
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,646
In any case, we will
protect you no matter

178
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,579
what dangers we encounter.

179
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:35,379
-That is not good enough!

180
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:36,979
Tell me everything now!

181
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:38,312
-In due time!

182
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:39,812
-I said now!

183
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,179
-What's wrong, Soul Reaper?

184
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:00,679
-You!

185
00:13:00,712 --> 00:13:03,046
That sword!

186
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:05,046
-Oh, I see you recognize it.

187
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:10,546
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
It's the same one.

188
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:11,546
It has to be.

189
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:18,379
-That Zanpakuto
doesn't belong to you.

190
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:21,479
So how are you able to wield it?

191
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:22,779
-You don't need to know.

192
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:47,479
-What's wrong?

193
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:49,279
Is that all you've got?

194
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,546
The guy I faced before
you was stronger.

195
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:54,412
-[laughs] You're right.

196
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:56,346
I'll have to change
my tactics to win.

197
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:09,979
-What?

198
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:23,979
-Now trap them, Saiga!

199
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:36,612
-Not much of a variety,
considering I've

200
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:38,179
seen that attack already.

201
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:45,846
Now I guess it's my turn!

202
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,346
-[laughing]

204
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,212
-Not again!

205
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:55,679
What the hell?

206
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:58,112
-This isn't the kind
of inferior attack

207
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:01,946
that you can defend against it
by simply turning and shielding

208
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:04,179
yourself from the light.

209
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:06,946

211
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,946
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
What will we do?

212
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,546
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): Master Kumoi

213
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,779
is trying to push
his agenda on us.

214
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:23,712
The order of the Kasumioji
Clan will be disrupted.

215
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:27,512
We must fervently object
no matter what the cost.

216
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:28,779
-Who's there?

217
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:30,112
-Identify yourselves!

-They're a lot faster than I've
been giving them credit for.

220
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:47,179
Hm?

221
00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:57,346
This is a bad place to fight.

222
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:00,560
I have to get out of here
and into some open space.

223
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:26,667
-Huh?

224
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,246
-Santen Kesshun!

225
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:34,712
Koten Zanshun!

226
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:39,679
Now's your chance.

227
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:40,713
-Thank you.

228
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,779
-OK, Orihime.

229
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:46,900
Get ready.

230
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,861
-Mmhm.

231
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:03,412
-Where the hell am I now?

232
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:07,627
[grunting]

233
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:13,679
My body.

234
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:19,446
--[laughing] It's
useless to struggle!

235
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,746
Your consciousness is
here in this place,

236
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,912
but your body is
somewhere far away.

237
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:26,746
-What?

238
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,846
-As long as you are locked
in this world of mirrors,

239
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:33,712
you will not be able
to move an inch.

240
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:36,879
This is the same sword, yet it
has completely different powers

241
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:38,779
from the last time you faced it.

242
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:41,812
-What the hell do you mean?

243
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:46,146
-This sword acts by consuming
its wielder's spirit energy.

244
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:50,312
In other words, the
higher the spirit energy,

245
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:52,746
the greater the power
it can draw upon.

246
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:57,279
-Depending on its wielder?

247
00:17:57,312 --> 00:18:00,212
-The sword continues to
consume spirit energy,

248
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,646
and only someone
who can endure it

249
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,546
is able to manifest
its true power.

250
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:07,712
Someone like me!

251
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:14,146
But I have wasted enough of my
time with these explanations.

252
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:17,412
I shall now kill
you in one breath.

253
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:20,046
-Keep dreaming!

254
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,279
I'm not rolling over for you!

255
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:29,054
[grunting]

256
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:38,179
-What?

257
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:39,612
A crack in Saiga?

258
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:41,012
No!

259
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:46,858
-[grunting]

260
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:50,112

264
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:00,971
Don't get too cocky!

265
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:02,005
-No good!

266
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:04,005
I still can't move!

267
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:06,005
-I told you, it's useless!

268
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:08,471
-Come on, let's go!

269
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:09,971
Move, now!

270
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:14,971

-Yoruichi?

273
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:33,238
-It appears that
ordinary methods simply

274
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:34,871
aren't going to work on him.

275
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:35,838
-Yeah.

276
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:36,405
Thanks.

277
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:39,471
I owe you one.

278
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:42,205
-Are you sure that you
still want to continue?

279
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:43,260
If I were you, I'd be careful.

280
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:45,560
Check on the spiritual
pressure of your subordinates.

281
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:46,511

-Impossible!

-Did you think you could
actually bring us down

289

with that pathetic
level of troops?

290

-Damn.

295
00:20:58,393 --> 00:21:02,693
I didn't expect someone like
Yoruichi Shihouin to be there.

296
00:21:02,726 --> 00:21:06,426
And also, Ichigo Kurosaki.

297
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,896
His power is greater
than I anticipated.

Huh.

299
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:22,893
So it won't be as
easy as I thought.

Well then.
