NARRATOR: Ichigo
and his friends were

4
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:54,056
on the brink of being defeated
by the powerful Espadas when

5
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:56,423
the captains of the
13 court guard squads

6
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:59,123
finally arrived in Hueco Mundo.

7
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:02,323
Under orders from head
captain Genryusai Yamamoto,

8
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,923
the captains came to Hueco
Mundo with the intention

9
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:08,023
of engaging the Espadas
in battle as they bravely

10
00:02:08,056 --> 00:02:10,623
attempted to rescue
Ichigo and the others.

11
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:12,756
Kenpachi Zaraki
arrived on the scene

12
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,423
and found a weakened Ichigo.

13
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:17,123
A fiercely-fought battle
with Espada Number Five,

14
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:19,323
Nnoitra Gilga, ensued.

15
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:21,523
Both of them took great
pleasure in the challenge

16
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:24,289
of fighting a strong opponent,
and their battle's intensity

17
00:02:24,323 --> 00:02:26,489
increased as they fought.

18
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:29,223
Yet despite Kenpachi's
powerful attacks,

19
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:31,823
he could not cut through
Nnoitra's Hierro, which

20
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:35,356
is reputed to be the
hardest skin of all Espadas.

21
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,589
Under the withering pressure
of Nnoitra's intense attacks,

22
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:41,156
Kenpachi continued to
search for a way to cut him.

23
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:49,189
-No matter what you do,
your sword cannot cut me.

24
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:51,723
That's why you are doomed
to lose this battle!

But guess what?

30
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:18,523
In all this time, I
haven't met a single person

31
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:20,789
whose eyes and throat
can't be speared.

are you gonna make

34
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:41,223
No matter how much you
try, I cannot be cut!

Ha.

36

I guess you can't
understand it, can you?

37
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:53,589
How can someone still
be alive after you just

38
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:55,589
ran a sword through their head?

39
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:57,856
Isn't that what's going
through your head?

40
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:03,423
Ha, ha, ha.

41
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:08,423
Well, here's your answer.

-Bastard.

43
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:21,689
I can't believe this.

44
00:04:21,723 --> 00:04:23,856
-It simply passed
through my head.

45
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,789
Now do you understand?

46
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:32,389
You can't defeat
me, Soul Reaper.

47
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:34,456
You don't have the power.

48
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:35,656
You might as well give up.

49
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,356
-Ha.

50
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,623
-You simple-minded fool.

51
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:45,056
What the hell's so funny?

52
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:55,623
-Sorry about that.

53
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:59,923
I'm feeling happy, so I
couldn't help but laugh.

54
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,156
-Happy, you say?

55
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,089
Why?

56
00:05:03,123 --> 00:05:06,456
-Well, there was no joy
thinking that even if I cut you,

57
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:08,889
it wouldn't affect the
outcome of our match.

58
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:15,456
But now I feel happy because
I know that if I do cut you,

59
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:17,856
you'll die.

You had four arms
