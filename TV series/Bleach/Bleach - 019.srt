2
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,893
-What?

3
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:55,226
What did you just
say, Captain Kuchiki?

4
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,693
What do you mean?

5
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:59,360
-It is as I said.

6
00:01:59,393 --> 00:02:02,093
Do I need to repeat myself?

7
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:06,593
25 days from now, she'll go to
the central execution grounds,

8
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,560
where she will suffer
the ultimate punishment.

9
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:12,060
That is the final decision
of the Soul Society.

10
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:25,426
And this will be the last
time that you and I shall ever

11
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,360
exchange words.

12
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:34,026
Rukia, the next time that I see
you will be at your execution.

RUKIA NARRATING: We are
taught never to shed teams,

15
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:46,560
for to shed tears
means that the body has

16
00:02:46,593 --> 00:02:49,293
been defeated by emotion.

17
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:52,693
And to us, that simple
act of crying only

18
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:57,026
proves without question that
the existence of emotion

19
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,193
is nothing but a burden.

20
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:08,093
-Lesson 2, Shattered Shaft.

21
00:03:08,126 --> 00:03:12,626
-May I have your
attention please?

22
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,126
You have a period of
72 hours at the bottom

23
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,126
of Shattered Shaft, Ichigo.

24
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,293
That is how long it will
take for the chain of fate

25
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,126
to be completely encroached.

26
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,960
By the end of that
time, if you have not

27
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:25,893
returned to the top of the
shaft as a Soul Reaper,

28
00:03:25,926 --> 00:03:29,660
then we will have no choice,
Ichigo, but to kill you.

29
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:31,593
-You bastard.

30
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:33,926
So you intend to kill me?

31
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,126
-That's right.

32
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,026
I do, once you've given up.

33
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,293
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): [grunts].

34
00:03:42,193 --> 00:03:43,293
CHAD (OFFSCREEN): [grunts].

35
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:55,193
-You're both
completely hopeless.

36
00:03:55,226 --> 00:03:57,960
At this rate, I'll
never be able to let

37
00:03:57,993 --> 00:04:00,360
you enter the Soul Society.

38
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:01,693
-Wait, that's not fair.

39
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:03,593
-Quit it, stop whining.

40
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,060
Unless you are able to
activate your powers at will,

41
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:09,693
you will die like a dog
in the Soul Society.

42
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:11,393
Do you understand me?

43
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:12,393
-Hmm.

44
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:14,193
-It's not that hard.

45
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:16,526
Just remember the first
time you used your powers

46
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,726
and retrace those steps.

47
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,060
-Well, that's easier
said than done.

48
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:23,760
I was so desperate
that first time.

49
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:25,826
-What were you so
desperate about?

50
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,826
-Huh?

51
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,460
-Think about it this way.

52
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:30,060
A person picks up
a sword when he's

53
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:31,693
trying to protect something.

54
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:34,293
Perhaps it's your
life, or social status,

55
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:38,126
maybe a reputation, a loved
one, or personal beliefs.

56
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,260
The motives may be completely
different, but in the end,

57
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:45,460
it's the same desire
to protect something.

58
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,593
Think back.

59
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:48,526
What were you trying to
protect when you first

60
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,826
called upon your powers?

61
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,293
-Let's see.

62
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,993
-Hmm, I was-- I was trying
to protect Ichigo's kid

63
00:04:58,026 --> 00:05:04,593
sister, a red cap, long hair.

64
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:10,693
And since she's Ichigo's
sister, she looks like Ichigo,

65
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:13,693
but she's still a girl.

66
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:14,193
[groans]

67
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:20,793
-It seems you
failed to remember.

68
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:23,393
And what about you?

69
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:26,193
-Well, I-- [sighs].

70
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:36,260
I, uh, at that time-- I was
so desperate, so desperate.

71
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:53,726
I, uh, at that time-- I was
so desperate, so desperate.

72
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,660
[tinkling]

73
00:05:58,526 --> 00:05:59,626
-It shined.

74
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,060
-Huh?

75
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:01,560
Really?

76
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:10,226
Hey, guys.

77
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,860
-You summoned?

78
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,893
If you ever need
us, don't hesitate.

79
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:16,793
Just call and ask for help.

80
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:20,760
-But considering this situation,
for what possible reason would

81
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:22,693
you need our help?

82
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:24,926
-Because that's our job.

83
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,760
-I'm sorry.

84
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:30,426
I was remember all sorts of
things, and then-- [shrieks].

85
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,493
-You weren't even in danger,
and yet you called for us?

86
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,560
You terrible little hussy.

87
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:35,826
-Ow.

88
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,193
-Tsubaki, you stop
that right now.

89
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:40,560
-Shut up.

90
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:42,160
Can't you see I'm pissed off.

91
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:42,660
-I'm sorry.

92
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,493
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:44,293
-Stop running, you little hussy.

94
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:45,693
-Ow.

95
00:06:45,726 --> 00:06:47,060
-You heard me.

96
00:06:47,093 --> 00:06:49,093
-Tsubaki, stop chasing her.

97
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:49,893
-Oh, dear me.

98
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:50,926
He's on a terrible rampage.

99
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,326
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
Ow, the hair.

100
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,326
-Sometimes Tsubaki is so rough.

101
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,893
-Well done, Orihime.

102
00:06:56,926 --> 00:06:59,393
Although it seems to me that
you're going to need a bit more

103
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:03,626
practice when it comes
to taming your own power.

104
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,693
What about you?

105
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:06,926
Any luck yet?

106
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,793
Tell me, why are you
going to the Soul Society?

107
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:18,960
[chewing sounds]

108
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:31,993
ICHIGO (IN HEAD): The fifth
encroachment has just ended.

109
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:35,193
There seems to be a
cycle to all this.

110
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:40,460
First they start chomping,
then they fall asleep.

111
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,193
During these periods
of encroachment,

112
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:46,426
I can hardly move.

113
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,726
The chains are so painful.

114
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,526
So if I'm gonna move, it'll have
to be while they're sleeping.

115
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:03,460
[groaning]

116
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:05,860
-It makes no sense
what he's doing,

117
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,660
but he's still managing to climb
up a practically straight wall.

118
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,060
For a human, this guy
sure takes changes.

119
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,826
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): [screams].

120
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,126
-Oh, you don't say?

121
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,626
-Idiot.

122
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,960
-Dammit.

123
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:22,926
-Hey?

124
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,526
Are you getting
hungry down there yet?

125
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,160
-No, I'm not hungry, yet.

126
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:31,893
Besides, jerk, I'm
in my soul form.

127
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:34,060
Why the hell would I be hungry.

128
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,826
-Well, that's great
to hear, because I'll

129
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,160
let you in on a little secret.

130
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:41,026
If you're in soul form and
then you start to get hungry,

131
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,593
it's a dangerous sign.

132
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:46,960
It means you're just one step
away from becoming a Hollow.

133
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,326
It's OK to feel thirsty though.

134
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,360
Oh, and if you do get thirsty,
go ahead and drink my spit.

135
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:54,426
-Why, you little.

136
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,426
-Come on, Ururu, get over here.

137
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,160
You can do it too.

138
00:08:57,193 --> 00:08:58,293
-OK.

139
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:00,593
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Come
down here and try that.

140
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:03,093
You brats!

141
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:03,693
Stop drooling.

142
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,193
Cut it out.

143
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:07,260
Stop it or I'll beat
the crap out of you.

144
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:08,693
Hey, I'm not kidding.

145
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:11,960
-Hmm.

146
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,793
I wonder if it's dark outside.

147
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:32,593
In this room, it's difficult
to tell the time of day.

148
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:40,426
ICHIGO (IN HEAD): Dammit,
I can't climb out.

149
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,293
How much time has passed?

150
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:45,193
I can't tell.

151
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:46,893
How can I climb
out of this place?

152
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:54,560
Huh?

153
00:09:57,826 --> 00:09:58,293
-Yo.

154
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:03,560
Thought I'd bring you a
little food down here.

155
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:07,360
I figured you'd be feeling
pretty hungry right about now.

156
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:09,293
-Ha, you must be nuts.

157
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:11,293
I'm not getting hungry at all.

158
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:12,526
Take a good look.

159
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,726
The way I see it, there
are still quite a few links

160
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,726
to the chain of fate.

161
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,660
-Hmm, well, that
can't be helped.

162
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:24,160
You'll find you lose track
of time in a place like this.

163
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:25,593
-Time?

164
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,526
-You know, you've been
down here over 70 hours,

165
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,660
and I'm just thinking,
some of the other souls

166
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:34,593
started turning
into Hollows by now.

167
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:37,593
Oh, and, uh, one more thing.

168
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:41,860
The final encroachment, it's
nothing like the other ones.

169
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,960
-The chains.

170
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:52,426
No way.

171
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,160
Stop, all of you.

172
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:55,660
Stop!

173
00:11:07,126 --> 00:11:07,593
[screams]

174
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:35,701
-All right, looks
like he's gonna

175
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:38,467
become a Hollow after all.

176
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:39,101
[screaming]

177
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:40,367
-I've got to help.

178
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,234
It's time I rescued him.

179
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,201
-Hold it.

180
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:45,501
-But Mr. Kisuke--

181
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:48,667
-Watch him closely,
nothing more.

182
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:51,401
Usually, when a hole
becomes a Hollow,

183
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:55,601
first the spiritual body
explodes, and then it reforms.

184
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:58,901
But in his case, the
order is all mixed up.

185
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:02,934
The mask is being created
while the body is still a hole.

186
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:06,234
This is a sign that
he is resisting.

187
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,734
There is still a
strong possibility

188
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:10,201
that in time, he'll
become a Soul Reaper.

189
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:14,101
So let's watch a while and
see if indeed he truly becomes

190
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:14,767
a Hollow.

191
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:19,267
Just a little longer.

192
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:19,767
-[screams].

193
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:29,967
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Ichigo can you hear me?

194
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,067
-Where am I?

195
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:52,534
MALE SPEAKER
(OFFSCREEN): Over here.

196
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:05,434
-So tell me, who are you?

197
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,067
-Who?

198
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:09,001
What are you talking about?

199
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:10,767
It's me, Zangetsu.

200
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:16,234
ICHIGO (IN HEAD): I
couldn't hear his name.

201
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:17,867
-I see.

202
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:19,534
So I still can't reach you?

203
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,167
How very sad.

204
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:26,267
Perhaps you can tell
me how many times

205
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:29,367
I must cry out before
you can hear me,

206
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:30,901
for there is no one
in this world that

207
00:13:30,934 --> 00:13:34,101
knows me better than you do.

208
00:13:34,134 --> 00:13:34,901
-Huh?

209
00:13:34,934 --> 00:13:36,767
What are you talking about?

210
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:39,567
I'm sorry, but unfortunately,
I don't know anyone

211
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:42,801
as depressing as you are.

212
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:46,334
How did you-- it's like
you're just floating in air.

213
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:53,601
-You surprise me.

214
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:55,734
How can you just sit there
in a place like that?

215
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:04,267
-[screams].

216
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:08,034
-If you can scream, then
you've got time, time to spare.

217
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:09,501
Why are you worrying?

218
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:11,967
Don't you know Soul
Reapers rule death?

219
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:15,067
In fact, they control
many spiritual beings.

220
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:19,001
-Uh, look, whatever you're
saying, I am not a Soul Reaper.

221
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:20,701
-Remember this.

222
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,401
The Soul Reaper power that
Byakuya Kuchiki managed

223
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:26,934
to remove from you was
nothing more than power

224
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:30,767
that you received
from Rukia Kuchiki.

225
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:34,701
Apparently, he had hoped to stop
things by taking your power.

226
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:37,901
By destroying it, he
thought he could end things

227
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:43,167
once and for all,
but he was careless.

228
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:46,901
His mistake was that he
failed to realize one fact,

229
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:51,434
you have Soul Reaper
power of your own.

230
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:52,367
-You mean I have it?

231
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:55,134
I have Soul Reaper power?

232
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,234
-Yes, the Soul
Reaper power you have

233
00:14:57,267 --> 00:15:00,967
was awakened with the help
of Rukia Kuchiki's own power.

234
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,567
It hid itself in the very
depths of your soul an instant

235
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:08,367
before Byakuya Kuchiki's
thrust, and it is still there.

236
00:15:08,401 --> 00:15:11,167
Now, find it.

237
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,167
If there ever was
a time when you

238
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:15,401
must find the power
of the Soul Reaper

239
00:15:15,434 --> 00:15:18,267
that has hidden itself in
you, then that next time

240
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:22,667
is now since the world
has begun its collapse.

241
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:26,601
See these boxes raining
down, surrounding you?

242
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,834
Inside one of them lies
your Soul Reaper power.

243
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:33,467
It is up to you to find it.

244
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:34,367
-What?

245
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,001
This doesn't make sense.

246
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:38,567
ZANGETSU (OFFSCREEN): not
tolerate any more excuses.

247
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:40,267
There is no time left.

248
00:15:40,301 --> 00:15:45,201
You must find it before this
world is completely destroyed,

249
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:48,201
or you will become a Hollow.

250
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:59,967
ICHIGO (IN HEAD): Yeah,
so what am I gonna do now?

251
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,434
How am I supposed to find
the one box out of all these

252
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,767
that contains my
Soul Reaper power?

253
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:09,001
What do I do?

254
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,101
What was he thinking?

255
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:14,567
I just don't have the ability
to search out spirit energy.

256
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:17,101
It's not possible.

257
00:16:17,134 --> 00:16:20,867
Hey, Uryu once said
the same thing to me.

258
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:23,667
Uryu, wait.

259
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:25,601
How did Uryu find out
that I was a Soul Reaper?

260
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:32,267
You know, it was
some simple method.

261
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,434
-Did you know?

262
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:38,901
ICHIGO (IN HEAD): He bragged
about it, but what was it?

263
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:45,667
-Did you know that a Soul
Reaper's spirit ribbon is red?

264
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:46,167
-That's it.

265
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,067
I found it!

266
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:04,401
What the hell?

267
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:06,401
The handle of a zanpakuto?

268
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:14,801
-You have done
well in finding it.

269
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:21,067
It is my hope that the next
time you will hear my name.

270
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:23,034
-You couldn't possibly be--

271
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:28,701
[explosion]

272
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:30,567
-What do you think you're doing?

273
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:31,367
It's crumbling.

274
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:32,067
Hurry up.

275
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:32,901
You must pull me up now.

276
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:37,801
-[grunts].

277
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:51,534
[screams]

278
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:57,401
-That is absolute limit, boss.

279
00:17:57,434 --> 00:18:00,701
I am switching to
suppression mode.

280
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:06,801
Bakudo 99, Part 2, [inaudible].

281
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:10,234
First incantation, bandage.

282
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:13,601
Second incantation,
[inaudible] deadbolts.

283
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,067
-Hey, be careful down there,
Tessai, If you do all of that,

284
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:17,534
there's a good
chance he could die.

285
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:20,334
-I can't hold him
down any longer.

286
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,701
He must be destroyed
immediately.

287
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,567
Right now, before
he becomes a Hollow.

288
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,801
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): [screams].

289
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,901
-Final incantation, fatal seal.

290
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:39,834
This is it.

291
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:51,534
-Look at that.

292
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:52,667
Something's shooting out of it.

293
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:03,501
That thing-- just
what the heck is that?

294
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:15,701
Hey?

295
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:17,667
Is that you?

296
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,134
Answer, Carrot Top.

297
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,467
If you're alive, answer me.

298
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:26,334
Oh.

299
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:36,434
A shihakusho and a mask?

300
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,201
Is he a Hollow, or
is he a Soul Reaper?

301
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:47,867
I may be small,
but I'll fight you.

302
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,201
Hey, wait a minute.

303
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:11,901
Aren't you supposed
to be a Hollow?

304
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,967
[clapping]

305
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:22,167
-Congratulations.

306
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:25,301
It seems you went and
became a Soul Reaper again.

307
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:26,267
Well done.

308
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:28,234
Lesson two completed.

309
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:29,501
-Shut up.

310
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:31,301
-Ow.

311
00:20:31,334 --> 00:20:32,634
[sobs]

312
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:35,167
-Well, well, well.

313
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:38,367
I bet you weren't expecting me
to come back alive, were you?

314
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:41,934
I swore to myself that if
I made it out of that hole,

315
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:44,634
I would kill you the
first chance that I got.

316
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:50,634
-Your timing is perfect.

317
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,567
With all of your
spirit, we should

318
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:55,534
be able to get you
started on lesson three.

319
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:57,667
-What did you just say?

320
00:20:57,701 --> 00:21:01,634
-And the best part is, lesson
three has no time limit.

321
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:04,034
Knock off my hat
with your zanpakuto,

322
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:05,334
and the lesson will be cleared.

323
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:13,234
Hmm.

324
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:18,234
Not bad, considering that
your zanpakuto is broken.

325
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:21,067
-I wouldn't be so smug,
because I haven't really

326
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:23,567
gotten down to business yet.

327
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:26,734
Look, why don't we just forget
about your concept of no time

328
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:27,934
limits?

329
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:31,234
I think we could end this
lesson in five minutes.

330
00:21:31,267 --> 00:21:34,534
-Sounds good.

331
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:37,201
Five minutes.

332
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:39,334
And you say that's all
the time you need, right?

333
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:54,898

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,513
-In order to release the
power of the zanpakuto,

335
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:58,613
one has to first discover
its name and then summon it.

336
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:02,413
Now then, the question remains,
can Ichigo find it in time?

337
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:03,613
-Bet you 1,000 yen he can't.

338
00:23:03,646 --> 00:23:05,979
-Bet you 2,000 I can.
