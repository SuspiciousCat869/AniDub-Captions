<i>Let me out of here!</i>

I'm telling you,
it's toy abuse!

00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:27,574
Somebody call the cops! The kid
who lives here makes me do slave
work, doesn't feed me, and keeps
me locked up all the time!

5

Hey! Quiet!

6
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:32,774
Get away from the window
and stop your whining!

7
00:00:32,808 --> 00:00:35,941
The neighbors are gonna
think I'm doing something
weird up here in my room!

8
00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:38,608
I don't care what they think!
That's none of my business!

9
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:44,574
I want to know why I have to
stay cooped up all day, every
day, in this crappy, cramped,
and filthy hole of yours!

10

[sigh] Life was good
while you were away
in Hueco Mundo.

11

There was no one to stop
me from going out and
stalking some hot chicks.

12
00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:55,808
Wait a minute.
You did what?

13
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:59,841
No wonder the neighbors have
been acting so strange and
giving me the stink-eye!

14
00:00:59,874 --> 00:01:01,941
You've been
destroying my
reputation!

15
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,941
Huh?

16
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:08,474

I love watermelons so much!

20
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,574
Even when they're
out of season!

21
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:14,779
Aagh! Put me down!
Let go of me!

You moron!
You're not going anywhere!

24
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:21,679
I wanna give her a hand or two!
Don't worry, melons, I'm coming!
What's the matter with you?!

25
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:23,846
Hello! Excuse me!

26

Yes?

27
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:26,279
I think I'm lost!

28
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:28,879
I heard the Karakura
Mart was somewhere
around here.

29
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:29,946
Uhh...

30
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:31,846
It's not that far away.

31
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,413
Just go back the way you came.
Then turn left at the
intersection.

32
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:36,846
Go straight,
and you'll see it.

33
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,646
Okay, I got it!

34

Thank you very much!

35

No problem!

36
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:45,846
Awwww! You sent
my melons away!

37
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,613
What's the matter with you?!
Get out of the window and
back in the room!

38
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:51,346
If she sees you,
there's gonna be
trouble! Are you nuts?!

Damn! It's a Hollow!

42

Get out of there!

43
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:14,779
Look after things
'til I get back!

44
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:15,779
Okayyy...

45
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:17,546
Behave yourself,

to sit at home and behave
myself on such a nice day!

53
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:57,279
It's been too long since I've
been able to use your body to
get out in the world and
experience some excitement!

Forget it, it's no big deal.

70
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:13,513
And besides, this body
doesn't belong to me,

71
00:06:13,546 --> 00:06:16,413
so the bottom line is,
if it catches a cold,
what do I care?

72
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:17,813
Hm?

73
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:19,813
Nothing. Don't listen to me,
I'm just talking to myself.

74
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,813
Oh, by the way,
Didn't you come by earlier,
asking for directions?

75
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:26,046
Did you find the place
you were looking for?

76
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:31,113
Yes, but afterwards I
got distracted by a man
flying through the air.

77
00:06:31,346 --> 00:06:32,346
Huh?

78
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:35,346
<i>Things like that happen</i>

Are you here, Ken?
I'm home!

80
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:40,646
I got lost for a while.
That's why I'm so late.

81
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,779
Sorry, I'll make your
lunch right away!

82
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:47,513
<i>Here you go!</i>
<i>Thanks for being patient!</i>

83
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:49,813
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Is it good?

84
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:50,779
Mmm-hmm.

85
00:06:51,546 --> 00:06:53,613
Oh, and by the way, guess what?

86
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,779
On my way home, I saw
someone flying through the
air in a black kimono!

87
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,346
Someone in a
black kimono?

88
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:03,113
Oh, do you know who it is?

89
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:05,179
I have no idea!
That's really strange!

90
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:06,779
I wonder if you saw a
ghost or something.

91
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:11,413
It's possible. I've been
seeing things like that ever
since I was a little child.

92
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:14,679
Well I tried to not let it
bother me, but then Ken, he...

93
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:17,279
[humming]

94
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:20,179
Hey sweetie,
should we go out,
or stay in tonight?

95
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:21,613
I think we
should break up.

96
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:22,546
Huh?

97
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:31,446
I mean, lately, you've been
getting more and more peculiar.

98
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:35,679
You see people no-one else
sees, and you talk to
people who aren't there.

99
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:38,579
It's getting really creepy.
You're a great cook and all,

100
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:41,179
but you're weirding me out
with all this 'ghost' stuff.

101
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:45,379
[breaks down crying]

102
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:48,946
I don't see these visions
because I want to!

103
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:51,013
They just appear
out of nowhere!

104
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,579
Then, to add insult to injury,
Ken told me he was going to
leave, right after he finished
eating! Isn't that awful?!

105
00:07:57,613 --> 00:07:59,479
Yeah it's kinda
odd, when you
think about it.

106
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,779
What difference would it make,
whether he left before or
after he ate his meal?

107
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:05,513
Well, that's it!
I'm killing myself!

108
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:06,313
What?!

109
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:07,913
It's too difficult
to bear!

110
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,846
I can't go on living,
now that Ken's broken
up with me!

111
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,779
Thanks for rescuing me,
even though it will only
postpone the inevitable!

112
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:17,779
Hey wait a minute!
You're not gonna like it
very much when you die!

113
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:20,613
Once you're gone, the
Hollows will come and
try to eat your soul,

114
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:22,979
and going to the
Soul Society isn't
that great, either!

Yeah. At the end
of the alley.

Do you think a
Hollow did that?

126
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:18,813
No, there's too much damage.
An ordinary Hollow would
only go after human souls.

127
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:20,779
So a Hollow's
not responsible?

128
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:23,713
I said an ordinary
Hollow wouldn't do this.

00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,479
Ah!

153
00:10:49,513 --> 00:10:52,213
<i>Did I hear you right?</i>
<i>You want to die?</i>

154
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:56,213
Well, today's your lucky day.

155
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:02,146
I've come here...

156
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:03,813
...to grant your wish!

157
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:07,146
Huh?

158
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,510
What? What are you
talking about?

159
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:25,610
It's simple, I'm going
to help you die.

160
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:27,843
[gasp]

161
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:32,277
I see. Apparently, you
can sense a Hollow's
Spiritual Pressure.

162
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,210
What are you saying?
Are you even human?!

163
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,443
Not really. I'm just temporarily
borrowing this human body.

164
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:42,377
Anyway, why are
you so afraid?

165
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,343
You kept saying
you want to die,

166
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:46,343
and I'm offering to
grant your wish.

167
00:11:46,843 --> 00:11:49,577
Yeah, I understand,
but this is so sudden.

168
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,010
It's, well, I feel I have
to prepare myself for it.

169
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:58,543
Heh! What a silly thing for
you to be focusing on, at the
moment you're about to die.

170
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,910
Relax, my dear, there's
no need to be afraid.

171
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:04,377
The pain will only
be momentary.

172
00:12:04,777 --> 00:12:06,877
Now, just open your mouth.

173
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:08,043
[gasp]

174
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:10,043
My mouth?
Why should I do that?

175
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,843
It makes it easier...
when I do this!

176
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:17,243
AAAAAAAAAAHH!

177
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,743
I'm sensing a Hollow!
And he's close!

178
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:29,810
Noooo!

179
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:32,843
Yes, that's good!
Open your mouth wider!

180
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,410
That way, I can leech onto you
and suck out your nutrients!

181
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:39,477
You'll end up just like
that man over there!

<i>The Great Kon,</i>

Kick Attack!

185

Hey come on, what are you
waiting for?! Run for it!

186
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,377
Oh, right!

187
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:57,743
Huh? The Hollow's Spiritual
Pressure disappeared again!

188
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:00,610
Damn! What the hell
is going on here?!

189
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:06,843
That was close, but we
should be safe for now.

190
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:09,877
I don't understand
what's happening!
What was that monster?!

191
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,310
It's called a Hollow.

192
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:13,343
A Hollow?

193
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:17,243
That's right. It attacks people
and sucks out their souls.

194
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,310
But it looked so
human at first.

195
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:21,410
I don't really
understand it myself.

196
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:25,310
But I think it's an
unusual type that uses
a human as a host.

197
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:26,443
Oh, dear!

198
00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:29,343
But why?

199
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:30,177
Huh?

200
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,043
Why did you save me?

201
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,577
I never asked you to
interfere, you know!

202
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,610
Huaah?!

203
00:13:37,677 --> 00:13:39,610
If you hadn't stepped in,
I could have died right there,
just like I wanted to!

204
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:42,710
It would have been
much better if you'd
just left me alone!

205
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:44,777
Come on, now...

206
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,010
You can't be serious.

207
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,243
How can you say
something like that?

208
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,377
[gasp]

209
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,410
Life is precious!
You should hold onto it
with all your might!

210
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,043
[Kon]
That guy who was
killed over there,

211
00:14:00,077 --> 00:14:04,210
I can guarantee you he didn't
want to die, especially in
such a hideous way!

212
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,177
How come you...
know so much?

213
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:10,510
I guess you've noticed
by now I'm not a
normal human being.

214
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,743
Fact is, I was
supposed to be killed
off a long time ago.

215
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,377
But in spite of everything,
I'm still here.

216
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,377
If I can survive what I had to
go through, then so can you!

217
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,510
But I'm just so frightened.

218
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,243
I'll protect you.

219
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,543
Hm?

220
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,777
I promise I'll
protect you.

221
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,577
And in return, you
have to promise not to
give up on yourself.

222
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,343
Do you really mean it?

223
00:14:46,577 --> 00:14:48,410
You have my word.

224
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:54,277
<i>Hold it</i>

[heavy panting]

227
00:15:01,677 --> 00:15:03,277
Excuse me, who are you?

228
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:04,877
My boyfriend.

229
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,577

00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:09,910
Huh?
Hm?

232
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,277
I'm sorry!
I was way off-base!

233
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:14,243
Huh?

234
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:18,410
I made a mistake! I want to get
back together, if you'll let me!

235
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:21,510
I miss your cooking!
It was so delicious!

Tell me, is it too late?

238
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,277
Of course not!
I forgive you!

239
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,510
I'm so glad you apologized!
Let's just forget what happened!

240
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,077

It's all for the best.

I suppose things weren't
meant to work out between me
and those beautiful melons.

248

Oh well.

249
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:56,243
Huh?

250
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:58,010
Forgot about that.

251
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:03,510
Nothin' else happening. I might
as well go home and throw this
in with the rest of my laundry.

to take over her body,
no matter what!

00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:59,777
And whose fault is that?
You didn't follow up to

You were inside Ken when
he found the two of us!

Yes, I was. But the little

Well, that guy's gone for good.
Are you feeling all right?

308
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,043
You saved me again!

309
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:18,377
[wails]

310
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,343
I was so scared! I thought
we were done for! [sobbing]

311
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:25,210
Ichigo, are you
all right?!

312
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,110
Huuh?

313
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:31,343
What is the meaning of
this?! Your behavior's
unacceptable, Ichigo!

314
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:32,877
Haruko!

315
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,643
Believe me, I have
no idea what's going
on here, Rukia!

316
00:20:35,677 --> 00:20:40,010
Please! I'm begging you, Haruko!
I made a terrible mistake!
Please come back!

317
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:41,510
Just forget it!

318
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:45,177
I've decided to start over with
somebody who appreciates me!

319
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,177
Right?

320
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:48,043
What?! Hold on!

321
00:20:50,377 --> 00:20:52,077
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>What's going on here?</i>
<i>I don't understand!</i>
<i>I never said--</i>

322
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,677
How can you say
that, darling? You
promised to protect
me, remember?

323
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,477
<i>Beg your pardon?!</i>
<i>That wasn't me! That</i>
<i>was another guy, Kon!</i>

324
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,177
What are you talking about?!
Those words came right out
of your mouth!

325
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,577
I've heard enough.
It's time to end this mess.

326
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:06,577
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>We'll sort it out later.</i>

327
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,877
Huh?

328
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,843
[coughing]

329
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:20,110
Tell me
something...

330
00:21:20,877 --> 00:21:23,543
'cause I can't remember.
Why are we at the park?

331
00:21:23,577 --> 00:21:25,410
Well... I have no idea.

332
00:21:27,443 --> 00:21:28,810
[stomach growl]

333
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:29,510
Huh?

334
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:30,177
Uhh...

335
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,843
Your stomach's trying
to pass on a message!

336
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:36,343
My bad. I must be a lot
hungrier than I thought I was.

337
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,210
<i>Well, let's go home</i>
<i>and take care of that.</i>

338
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:40,877
Sounds good to me!

339
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,877
I think I'll start
with a chicken, then
cook up some pasta...

340
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,177
Sounds yummy!

341
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,977
<i>And a nice chocolate</i>
<i>cake for dessert!</i>

342
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,877
Stop! I'm gonna need a towel
in a second! I'm starting to
drool on myself!

343
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,677
<i>[Kon]</i>
<i>Wait a minute! Is that it?!</i>

344
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,877
<i>After all that drama we</i>
<i>went through, and he</i>
<i>still gets the girl?!</i>

345
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:09,277
This isn't right! It's not fair!
I thought I was the star of this
episode! I demand a rewrite!
Call my agent!!

346
00:23:47,286 --> 00:23:49,053
<i>[Kon]</i>
<i>Damn, you get to</i>
<i>have all the fun!</i>

347
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:51,219
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>What's fun about this?!</i>

348
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:54,719
[Kon]
What's the matter, Ichigo? She
isn't your type? Just what kind
of girl do you like?

349
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:56,886
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>The kind that makes me</i>
<i>fall in love with her!</i>

350
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,286
<i>[Kon]</i>
<i>Ha ha ha! Oh, you</i>
<i>need to be romanced?!</i>

351
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,753
<i>[Ichigo]</i>
<i>You're making my head hurt!</i>
