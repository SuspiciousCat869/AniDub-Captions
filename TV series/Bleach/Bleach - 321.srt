1
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,567
Jushiro, do you
have a minute?

2
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,567
Yes. So why is it that
you needed to meet
with me so urgently?

3
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,734
I have some serious doubts
about recent events.

4
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:14,434
And I thought it would
be better to talk to you
about it privately.

5
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,867
Would it be about Ichigo?

6
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,734
Mmm. I'm very
concerned about him.

7
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,734
Something about this incident
doesn't sit right with me.

8
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,667
I have to agree.

9
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,634
The part that bothers
me is that everything
seems too perfect.

10
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:33,367
Yeah. That's my point.

11
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,734
So, what do we do?

12
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:42,234
I'm thinking, we may need to
take another, more critical,
look at this incident from
the beginning.

13
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:46,167
<i>[Yamamoto]</i>
<i>Captains Mayuri Kurotsuchi</i>
<i>and Kenpachi Zaraki,</i>

14
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,534
<i>who both disappeared into</i>
<i>the Precipice World earlier,</i>
<i>have now returned safely.</i>

15
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,934
Kurotsuchi. Report on
what happened while in
the Precipice World.

16
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,600
Hmpf! It was horrible!

17
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,700
In fact, just thinking about
it makes my skin crawl!

18
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:10,067
I will never forget the nasty
smirk on the face of Substitute
Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki,
as he stared down at us!

19
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,634
He interfered with our mission
inside the Precipice World!

20
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,900
We should send troops
to capture him at once!

21
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:19,567
Hmm. Captain Zaraki,
was there any question
about his identity?

22
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,600
You think I'd mistake
Ichigo when he was
standing right there?

23
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,567
Hmm.

24
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,734
[Unohana]
Not that it's proof-positive,
but we do have the Combat Pass
obtained by Captain Kuchiki.

25
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:35,467
Plus, the circumstantial
evidence of Ichigo's crimes
continues to accumulate.

26
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,767
And, of course, he refuses
to turn himself in to us,
or mount a defense of his
behavior.

27
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:45,000
Hold on there a minute!
Isn't it premature to draw
any conclusions just yet?

28
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:48,034
I don't believe Ichigo would do
the things he's accused of!

29
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,834
Captain Ukitake, I find it
hard to believe that Ichigo
is guilty, as well.

30
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:57,034
That is precisely why it's
so important that we hear
his side of the story!

31
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:59,534
Why are we wasting time
discussing this nonsense!

32
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:02,500
The man is guilty or
he'd come and face us!
Case closed!

33
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:09,567
Think about it! Even during his
battle with Aizen, he was doing
something in the Precipice World
he didn't want us to know about!

34
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:14,767
It's obvious! We must
capture and interrogate
him with whatever means
are available to us!

35
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,734
Okay, okay we get it.
Calm down.

36
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:23,767
The Soul Society owes
Ichigo Kurosaki a large
debt of gratitude.

37
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,500
But it does not
automatically clear him of
suspicion in this situation.

38
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:33,000
Send a team to the World
of the Living, to apprehend
the suspect, immediately!

39
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,267
I don't see how they can
commit the resources for such
an effort, just to capture
Ichigo. It makes no sense.

40
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:47,500
You hear that?

41
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:48,500
Yeah.

42
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:50,500
They're about to move out.

That damn Nozomi!

52
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,000
She snuck up on me, tied
me up, and then split!
What's going on?!

53
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:33,567
Nozomi!

54
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,000
Nozomi, where are you?!

55
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,467
Come on, Nozomi!

56
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,467
Nozomi!

57
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,534
[panting]

58
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,167
Any sign of her?

59
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Uh-uh.

60
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:49,500
It hasn't been
that long.

61
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:50,734
She couldn't
have gone far.

62
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,667
I can't follow her
Spiritual Pressure.

63
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,434
Are you sure this girl's
really a Soul Reaper?

64
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:58,334
Ichigo!

65
00:05:58,367 --> 00:05:59,767
Rukia! Anything at all?

66
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:03,034
Nothing. Not a trace.

67
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,400
<i>I put the lieutenants on it,</i>
but they haven't had any luck,
<i>either.</i>

68
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:12,467
Kon said she was looking for
something yesterday, but since
we don't know what it is, it's
not going to be much help to us.

69
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:15,767
Damn! We don't have
time for this.

70
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,967
The Captains are preparing
some kind of operation.

71
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,967
If they call for us, we can't
just be 'missing in action'.

72
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:22,834
[gasp]

73
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:24,500
What just happened?

74
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,800
It looks like a Senkaimon
just opened up.

75
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,534
I can make out the Spiritual
Pressure of several captains.

76
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,700
Egh. Of all the
times for them
to show up here.

77
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,500
We need to find that
girl, and fast.

78
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:37,400
Yeah. Kon!

79
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:40,400
What?! Now HE decides
to disappear?

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,900
And I don't have my
Combat Pass either!

81
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,700
Rukia, I need your help!

82
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:46,200
Okay, I'm on it!

83
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:48,667
Are you ready?

84
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,934
Okay. Let's go!

85

[chuckles]

86
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:58,767
You can run all
you want, Nozomi.
But it's futile.

87
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,867
[panting]

88
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,200

90
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,434
Huh?

91
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:24,267
Rawwr!

92
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:33,334
You... stupid idiot.
What are you doing in
a place like this?

93
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,500
How did you figure out
where to look for me?

94
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,434
Oof!
Beats me!

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,567
I just figured it out!
Listen, you, don't
underestimate my intuition!

96
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,000
Now tell me...! Why are you so
intent on being alone, anyway?!

97
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,434
I don't get it!
Do you hate all
of us that much?!

98
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:50,434
Or is it something else?!

99
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:53,067
Do you have some other
agenda going on?

100
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:57,805
Well?!

101
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:58,345
Augh!

102
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,567
That is none of
your business.

103
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:03,000
[gasp]

104
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:03,734
They're here!

105
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:10,834
Hey, where are you going?!
You just can't run off
like that!

106
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:14,234
I found you once, I'll
find you again, I swear!

107
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:27,534
Nozomi should be
with Ichigo Kurosaki
and his friends.

108
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:32,400
If we track every strong
Spiritual Pressure we
detect in the town, we
should be able to find her.

109
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:35,167
I'm way ahead of you.
Tell me something I
don't know.

110
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,334
Why are you bringing this up?
Our orders were very clear.

111
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,800
We've been sent here to
capture Ichigo Kurosaki.

112
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:44,334
Ignoring commands for the
sake of Kageroza's personal
mission is madness.

113
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,400
I beg to differ.

114
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:49,267
Whichever one we give priority
to, the distance to our goal
will still be the same.

115
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,634
Heh. I have to tell you,
neither mission suits me.

116
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,400
But since we've
already arrived,

117
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:57,934
Wouldn't it be more fun to
fight with the original
versions of ourselves?

118
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,367
Yes, it would. I'm very
interested in taking on
my original form.

119
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,200
[Yumichika]
That's well and good,
but I'm not
interested in you!

120
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:14,367
So you're here!

121
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:15,834
Excellent.

122
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,367
The originals!

123
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:23,934
It's time to get rid
of these phonies!

124
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,967
We have an advantage
in numbers.

125
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,600
What makes you say that?
We always fight one-on-one.
It's a matter of honor!

126
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:31,834

I'm not really supposed

It's prohibited.

Make sure no-one sees you, and
don't take it out of this room.

Sorry to put you
on the spot.

134
00:11:08,957 --> 00:11:13,457
I wouldn't ask, but Jushiro
didn't keep a separate record
of his subordinate's passages,

135
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,424
and now we have
to track someone.

136
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:15,557
Uh!

137
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,090
I have been asked to
put together a report,

138
00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:19,957
but without Jushiro's squad
records, I can't finish it.

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,390
I could be in
big trouble!

Hey, wait a minute,
I really don't...
Of course!

I'll make it up to you,

00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,457
Eh ha ha!

151
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:56,857
(Small OM grunt as he prepares
to fight back)

152
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,590
Eyaa-haa!

153
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:03,757
Get ready!

154
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:06,557
Where are they?

155
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,857
[Omaeda]
Huuaahh!

156
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:22,524
Hmm!

157
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,990
Who are you?

158
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,490
Hmpf!

159
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:28,590
What does it matter, anyway?
Now it's four against four!

160
00:12:29,224 --> 00:12:32,690
<i>Now we can face off</i>
<i>without worrying about</i>
<i>whether it's fair or not!</i>

161
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:36,890
If that's the case and we
don't have to hold back,
then we should each take
on our own impostor!

162
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,124
Rrrgh!

163
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:42,357
Well that's fine for you guys,
but where does that leave me?
I have to fight this idiot!

164
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,057
<i>I mean, look at him</i>
<i>with his silly hair and</i>
<i>his stupid outfit!</i>

165
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,790

<i>around his ne--!</i>

166
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:49,590
Huh?!

167
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:51,157
What is it?

168
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,790
That collar he's wearing!
I've seen it before!

169
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:58,824
Yeah, I guess you have, chubs!

170
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:00,424
Say what?!

171
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:03,524
You don't recognize me?
Maybe this will do the trick!

172
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:05,657
Smash'em! Gegetsuburi!

173
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,357
Aahh!

174
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,690
Gegetsuburi?
Wait a minute,
that means you're--!

175
00:13:16,724 --> 00:13:17,657
That's right!

176
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:19,524
Your worst fear!

177
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,324
You're looking at yourself,
Marechiyo Omaeda!

178
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:26,190
Huh?

179
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,757
Hold on, how can you be me?

180
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,857
[snort] Ha ha
ha ha ha ha!

181
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,857
HA HA HA HA HA!!

182
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,090
This bozo doesn't look
anything like you!

183
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:36,324
How could that
have happened?!

184
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,490
I don't know!
Why don't you give
me some answers?

185
00:13:38,524 --> 00:13:40,690
Are you making fun of me?
What's with that look?!

186
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:45,290
There's a simple explanation!
You're so damned ugly,
I refused to take on your body!

187
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,157
What?! You're telling
me they allowed that?!

188
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,624
Oh yes indeed.
And now that I'm the
new Marechiyo Omaeda,

189
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:54,724
I'm afraid I have no
choice but to eliminate
you from this world.

190
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:57,557
Ah ha ha ha ha!
That's hilarious!

191
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,157
He he he! Best idea
I've heard today!

192
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,057
I mean, you are ugly,
so why not have him take over?!

193
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,424
Then he can be the real
Soul Reaper, and you
can be the fake one!

194
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:10,257
How dare an impostor
embarrass me in front
of my comrades?!

195
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,324
Raagh!

196
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:14,857
Smash'em! Gegetsuburi!

197
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:17,257
Yaaaah!

198
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,024
Hold on! What do you
think you're doing?

199
00:14:23,057 --> 00:14:25,390
You can't just go and start
the fight without me!

200
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:26,090
I'm coming, too!

201
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:27,424
Hey, wait for me!

202
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:28,757
Take this
seriously!

203
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,257
Whoa! What?!

204
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,190
Nngh! This makes
absolutely no sense!

205
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:35,224
His Gegetsuburi is
way bigger than mine!

206
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,957
Naturally...!

207
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,090
Because everything about me,

208
00:14:39,124 --> 00:14:42,124
is superior to anything you've
ever been in your life!

209
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:45,390
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:59,924
Mmm. So beautiful.

213

216

That works both ways.
I have to say,
we look pretty good.

Just as I expected of me,
you're pretty good!

00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:29,324
So are you!

Excuse me, Ikkaku.

I'm sorry to bother you,
but would you mind doing
me a favor?

223
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:35,424
Can't it wait?
I'm kinda busy!

224
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:38,990
I'm sorry, but it can't!
It's very important!

225
00:15:39,024 --> 00:15:40,724
Let it go!
Concentrate
on the fight!

226
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,224
That's the problem I have.
I can't do it!

227
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,824
Huh?

228
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:51,457
I'm stuck! I tried and tried,
but I find I really can't
damage such a beautiful
specimen as myself!

229
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,224
So what do you think
about swapping opponents,
just for this fight?

230
00:15:54,257 --> 00:15:55,324
Are you nuts?!

231
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,490
Heh!
Heh!

Whoa!

234
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,790
Ha ha ha ha! Is that
what you call running?

235
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:17,857
With your body, it would be
faster if you rolled along,
like you did a minute ago!

236
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,257
Shut your mouth, smart-ass!
I didn't roll!
That move was hakuda!

237
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,190
Fine! Whatever!

238
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,290
Augh!

239
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:39,690

<i>[Shuhei]</i>
<i>Nice move, me.</i>

241
00:16:41,657 --> 00:16:43,690
You blocked that last
attack pretty well.

242
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:45,657
But why aren't you
using your Shikai?

243
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,857
Gah!

244
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:50,190
You're not still afraid of
your Zanpakuto, are you?

245
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,190
That's foolish.
In a fight, power's
extremely critical.

246
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:59,690
Given the chance, I'd have
no hesitation using
this power, believe me!

247
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,757
You originals suck!
That's the lesson
from this fight!

248
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:08,590
You outdated older models need
to be replaced with more
efficient versions, like us!

00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:23,290
Why wasn't your
attack effective?

253
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:25,990
Your impostor doesn't have
any more power than you!

254
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:27,890
He's using the same
weapons you are!

255
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:31,157
Not my fault! Don't you
remember what Captain
Kurotsuchi told us?

256
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,424
Interestingly, you'll find that
Reigai possess the exact same
powers as their originals.

257
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:38,357
However, there is
one difference...

258
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,724
<i>I've found that they become</i>
<i>much more belligerent.</i>

<i>aspect of their personality.</i>

261
00:17:48,824 --> 00:17:52,790
That definitely gives them an
advantage, because they can go
beyond their natural limits!

262
00:17:52,824 --> 00:17:55,157
Damn, we have to do
something about that!

263

Wait a minute!
I think I know
something that'll work!

264
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:03,890
Hey, Shuhei.
Just follow my
lead, all right?

265
00:18:06,624 --> 00:18:07,157
Huh?

266
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,357
What's the matter?
Did you finally decide
it was time to give up?

267
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,424
I'm afraid you've got
this all backwards.

268
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:19,424
If you guys apologize now,
we'll consider sparing you.

269
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,424
You really aren't
very bright, are you?

270
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:22,157
Oough!

271
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,090

00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:24,057
Bright enough!

273
00:18:25,257 --> 00:18:26,524
You'll regret that-- Huh?

274
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,057
What are you doing?!

275
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,057
Surprise. Your Gegetsuburi seems
to have gotten not only bigger,
but heavier as well.

276
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,390
With your movements that
big and heavy, capturing
you is an easy matter.

You little bastard!

278
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:43,924
Try not to forget that
I'm your opponent!

279
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,057
Ah!

280
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,857
Oof!

281
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:52,324
Whaddya know?
You guys
underestimated us.

282
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:55,024
You lost because you just
relied on raw power.

283
00:18:56,257 --> 00:18:58,524
You wouldn't be cut out
for the Stealth Force!

284
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:01,990

How could you?

296
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,624
You were under the
impression that in a
face-to-face confrontation,
I would never attack myself.

297
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,090
You were
mistaken.

Don't misunderstand me,
Yumichika.

299

I think you're beautiful,
just like you do.

300
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,357
However.

301
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,957
I thought your face would
look even more beautiful,
maybe transcendent, if it
was covered in blood!

302
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:08,257
I can see now that I was right.
There's a certain majestic
quality to your skin.

303
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,757
I wanted to try it
before this, but I
didn't want to damage my
own body in the process.

304
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,024
I'm so glad you became
available for the experiment.

305
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:20,957
Looks like their battle's
about over as well.

306
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,590
D'yahh!

307
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,657
Hah. What a bust.
I thought you'd put
up more of a fight.

308
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:34,957
Egh... Damn you!

309
00:20:35,324 --> 00:20:37,957
What do you think?
Should we finish them off?

310
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,590
Might as well,
they're done anyway.

311
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:44,924
Who was that...?!

312
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:49,157
Are you people... Reigai?

313
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,190
Oh! So you know
about us, do you?

314
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:53,190
Don't move!

315
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,624
Like hell!

316
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:55,524
Hrgh!

317
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:57,824
Forget about it, Ikkaku.

318
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,857
<i>There's no point</i>
<i>wasting our time,</i>
<i>fighting these</i>
<i>weaklings anymore.</i>

319
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,257
We need to start looking
for Nozomi Kujo.

320
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,224
Heh! I guess you're right.

321
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:09,957
Hey!

322
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:21,507
Hold on now, this is
definitely weird.

323
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,241
But who from here would
go and do such a-- Huh?

324
00:21:24,274 --> 00:21:25,941
Oh, it's you, Kageroza.

325
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:28,607
What's with that outfit?

326
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:32,107
Hm? What in the
hell's...happening?

327
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,374
[chuckle]

328
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:37,107
<i>[Shunsui]</i>
<i>Hmm. That's what</i>
<i>I was afraid of.</i>

329
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:40,407
This shows definite signs of
having been altered recently.

330
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,374
Then someone from Squad
Twelve must have-- Huh?

331
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:47,041
What do you want?!

332
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:49,241
Shunsui Kyoraku!

333
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:53,407
We're taking you into custody
on suspicion of altering
Precipice World records!

334
00:21:54,007 --> 00:21:55,341
Are you crazy?!

335
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,841
Interesting.
I should have known.

336
00:22:06,674 --> 00:22:07,774
[gasp]
[gasp]

337
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:49,408
<i>[Omaeda]</i>
<i>Heh! The original</i>
<i>Marechiyo was nothing!</i>

338
00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:52,175
<i>As his Reigai, I'm</i>
<i>definitely stronger</i>

339
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,942
<i>[Shuhei]</i>
<i>Sure...</i>

340
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,175
<i>[Omaeda]</i>
<i>Hey, Shuhei. If there's</i>

341
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,608
<i>[Hisagi]</i>
<i>Sure...</i>

342
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:58,475

Soon, I imagine they'll
make me a Captain!

343
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:01,042
<i>[Hisagi]</i>
<i>Sure, whatever.</i>
<i>The bottom line is,</i>
