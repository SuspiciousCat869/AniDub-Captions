although it's already
too late for them.

00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:59,470
So then, how would you
like us to proceed?

00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:02,137
-I think this would
be a good opportunity

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,804
to show them your power.

-And what about you, Kariya?

-Do you really think
I need to be involved?

00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,170
Ugaki will command
you on this mission.

00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:15,970
And call back the Bittos.

13

I'm sure they've
gathered enough for now.

How do you feel about that?

anyone among us who's

more fit to lead
than Kariya, do you?

-I doubt it would be wise
to go against his wishes.

I, for one, intend to do
whatever it is he asks.

Even if we did have a problem
with the way he was doing

safest to go along with him.

I mean, not that I have
any problems, of course.

167
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:10,904
He should be around
here somewhere, but--

168
00:10:10,937 --> 00:10:16,270
-It was as if his spiritual
pressure suddenly disappeared.

169
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:18,004
-Where's Ichigo?

170
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:20,137
-He just took off to
look for the Bounts.

171
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,937
-He was using the Bount sensor
the store owner made for him,

172
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,970
so we're not really sure
if he'll find them or not.

173
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:27,704
-He took Ririn with him.

174
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:30,537
You should find him, and see
if you can be of any help.

175
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,037
-What about you?

176
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,770
-I'm going to try to find Renji.

177
00:10:33,804 --> 00:10:36,104
Something's wrong, and I want
to get to the bottom of it

178
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,204
as soon as I possibly can.

179
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,770
-All right.

180
00:10:40,804 --> 00:10:42,870
-Look out!

181
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:43,504
-What was that?

182
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:49,904
-Oh, you'll have to
aim better than that.

183
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:53,270
-I'm terrible with
the little details.

184
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:55,604
Wouldn't it make more sense
to kill two or three of them

185
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:56,537
at once?

186
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,637
-I suppose so.

187
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,737
It really shouldn't
matter what your methods

188
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,137
are, as long as
you destroy them.

189
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,570
-I agree.

190
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:07,170
-Go on, I can handle her myself.

191
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:07,837
-OK, but--

192
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,670
-Ururu, go find Chad.

193
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:12,104
Jinta, you're going
to have to find Renji.

194
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:13,537
-Why me?

195
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,937
-Because you're such
good friends, that's why.

196
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,670
-Who said that we were friends?

197
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:18,237
-Hey!

198
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,570
Here she comes!

199
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:23,504
Move!

Sokatsui!

202
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:31,104
-I always find it more
satisfying to fight men

203
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,137
than women.

204
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,970
-In the end, victory
is all that matters.

205

-I thought you'd say that.

-Orihime!

207
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:43,204
-Let me stay and help.

208
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:46,970
We have a better chance of
winning if there are two of us.

209
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:48,437
-Ahem.

210
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,937
We'll stand an even
better chance with three.

211
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,537
-Listen.

212
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,770
-Now tell us where
Kariya is hiding.

213
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:58,904
-And just what you Bounts
are planning to so.

214
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:00,337
-Well, this should be fun.

-I'm so sorry, did I hurt you?

218
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,746
-You really need to
get over this bad habit

219
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,179
of toying with your
prey like this.

-Oh really?

221
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:41,479
Since he hasn't
much longer to live,

222
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:45,846
I'm trying to give him a taste
of what true fear and pain is.

223
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,279
It would be tragic for him to
die without really knowing.

-You guys have got
a lot of nerve,

some kind of push over.

I love that manly talk.

Let's put it to the test.

Now you will finally understand!

-You see me?

-So this human is able
to see Soul Reapers, huh?

242
00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:15,079
That's a sure sign he's close
to death, and most of his soul

243
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:17,979
has been sucked out.

Huh.

-It's pointless.

Even if you could
return his soul to him,

249
00:14:29,712 --> 00:14:33,679
his body wouldn't be
able to take the shock.

by stealing souls
with those weird bugs?

that was obvious.

I received from the Bittos

-Too slow!

331
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,846
You're not dealing
with Ichigo anymore!

332
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:04,846
That weakling doesn't
even compare to me.

-You.

336
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:30,546
No, you're going to
interfere with me again?

337
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:32,012
You're too weak!

338
00:20:32,046 --> 00:20:33,246
Stop!

339
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,746
If you chase me out right
now, you'll die for sure.

340
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,179
Don't you understand?

341
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:39,079
You're not strong enough!

342
00:20:41,946 --> 00:20:43,779

[screaming]

344
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,546
-To use strong
power, one must have

345
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,712
a strong mind, and
a stronger heart.

346
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:18,979
-What?

347
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:23,946
-You don't have
either one of those.

348
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:26,912
That's why you cannot
control your power.

349
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:28,046
-How would you know?

350
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,412
-The power within
you has no harmony,

351
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:31,846
which makes it imperfect.

352
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:33,646
Because of that,
you will only end up

353
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,379
destroying yourself
in the near future.

354
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:40,379
Before that happens,
Zeige Dich Dalk.

355
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,246
-Oh my, did I miss something?

356
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,346
-It's over.

357
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:57,579
End it, Dalk.

358
00:21:57,612 --> 00:22:00,279
-Too bad.

359
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:02,646
-Don't make him suffer too much.

360
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:03,546
-Whatever you say.

361
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,612
-Hey!

00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:14,146
Moocher!

You lazy.

00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:23,479
Oh.

00:22:23,512 --> 00:22:23,979
Hey!

-The most interesting and
complex character in "Bleach"

368
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:10,992
is me, Kon.

369
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:12,892
So what's up with my storyline?

370
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:14,058
Where are my scripts?

371
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:15,892
In the next episode, we'll
give you three stories.

372
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:18,125
Kurodo's transformation,
the secret

373
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:20,125
of the birth of the dolls,
and a helper arrives.

374
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:20,925
Tune in!

00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,258

-What are you doing at
the hairdresser's when

381
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:41,925
you haven't got any hair, baldy?

382
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:42,725
-It doesn't matter.

383
00:24:42,758 --> 00:24:43,758
Go away

384
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,025
-I'm going to draw
a line, so everyone

00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:46,958
knows where your face ends
and your head begins, OK?

-No, not OK!

387
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:49,458
Cut it out.

388
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:51,425
This is called a
shaved head, all right?

389
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:51,992
-That's it!

-Ah!

393
00:24:57,892 --> 00:25:00,625
I'll draw a line to separate
Koma Koma's face and head, too!
