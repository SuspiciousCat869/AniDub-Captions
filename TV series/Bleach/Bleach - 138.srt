[theme music]

2
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:03,667
-This is Ulquiorra.

3
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,667
Permission to enter.

4
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:13,903
-Welcome, Ulquiorra and Yammy.

5
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,134
It won't be long now.

6
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,334
-What's the status
of the Hogyoku?

7
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:25,834
-50%.

8
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:29,934
It is going to awaken exactly
when the Soul Society expects

9
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:30,667
it to.

10
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,667
But there's a secret.

11
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:35,367
A secret that only
those who have actually

12
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:39,167
possessed the
hogyoku are aware of.

13
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:44,767
I have my doubt that even Kisuke
Urahara, the man who originally

14
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:50,501
developed it, has the slightest
clue about this unusual secret.

15
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:54,834
When the Hogyoku, in a dormant
state with its seal removed,

16
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:57,967
is joined with someone who
possesses twice the spirit

17
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:02,401
energy of a captain,
for a very short time,

18
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:05,267
its full power is
suddenly released,

19
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:08,434
as if the Hogyoku were
completely awakened once again.

20
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:19,901
Can you tell me your
name, new comrade?

21
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,401
-Wonderweiss.

22
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:31,734
Wonderweiss Margela.

23
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:37,067
-Do you remember the
order that I gave you

24
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:41,334
approximately one
month ago, Ulquiorra?

25
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:42,567
-Yes.

26
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:45,567
-It is time to carry it out.

27
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,067
I will even give you a choice.

28
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:51,467
And take whomever
you like with you.

29
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:52,701
-Thank you, sir.

30
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:04,592
-Oh, by the way, would you
like to go as well?

31
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,552
Grimmjow?

32
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:16,301
-Ki-ya!

33
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:28,134
LOVE: You're already dead.

34
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:33,034
Whoa.

35
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:35,301
That's such a deep
line, isn't it?

36
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:37,301
Here he's telling these
guys they're dead,

37
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:40,534
but they don't even have
enough sense to realize it yet.

38
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:42,434
Don't you realize it yet?

39
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,067
You are alive.

40
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:47,201
Alive, yet you are already dead.

41
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:48,301
You get me?

42
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:50,001
-That's the fifth time
you've quoted that.

43
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:51,734
I'm so sick of you, love.

44
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:54,801
And will you please stop
reading all of my comic books

45
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:55,934
before I get the chance?

46
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:59,001
You keep spoiling
everything for me.

47
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:02,434
-Why don't you put up a
fight, you stupid idiot?

48
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,167
Do you have any
idea how many times

49
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:06,401
I could've killed you already?

50
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:07,701
I get it.

51
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:09,834
You thought Soul Reapers had
extra lives or something,

52
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,767
that they have the ability
to keep coming back

53
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,301
to live over and over again.

54
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:15,267
Well, they don't, dumb ass!

55
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:16,234
-Shut up.

56
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:21,601
-Chow time!

57
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:24,401
Get your butts over
here on the double.

58
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:27,267
The last one in line
has to do the dishes.

59
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:28,267
You hear me?

60
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:28,767
-Huh?

61
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:35,767
SHINJI: So, how's Ichigo's
training going, Hiyori?

62
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,001
-Weren't you watching?

63
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:42,101
It's not going anywhere.

64
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,534
The idiot's still only up
to a little over 10 seconds.

65
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:46,534
That dumb ass is a joke.

66
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:47,434
Real dog meat.

67
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:53,067
-Maybe he doesn't
have what it takes.

68
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:55,034
Maybe he should just give up.

69
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,934
-Shut the hell up,
you little pervert.

70
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,634
You're not even
involved in my training,

71
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:01,567
so I would appreciate it if
you kept your mouth shut.

72
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:04,067
-I'm already involved, moron.

73
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,334
I lent you my dirty
magazine to get your mind

74
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,934
off training the other day.

75
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,267
-You didn't lend me anything.

76
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:13,467
Why the hell would I wanna
borrow that crap anyway?

77
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:14,901
-It's totally cool.

78
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:16,634
I borrow it myself.

79
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,501
Every couple of days or so.

80
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:20,567
-I'm not like you, am I?

81
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,534
-Personally, I like to
look at them twice a day

82
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,201
to clear my mind.

83
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:25,601
-Yeah, I know.

84
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:28,267
Good for you, but I'm
not like either of you.

85
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:29,701
Those pictures are distracting.

86
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:32,067
-But I am not a pervert!

87
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:34,301
I'm just very
curious, that's all.

88
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:39,034
-Isn't that the definition
of a pervert, huh?

89
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,901
-That doesn't stop
you from constantly

90
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,034
looking at my magazines.

91
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:42,967
MAN: I do not.

92
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,667
-I saw you reading
it this morning.

93
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:46,567
SHINJI (VOICEOVER): A
little over 10 seconds?

94
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:48,801
After one month.

95
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,967
I guess it's just going
to take more time.

96
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:57,967
The Hogyoku wakes at
the end of December.

97
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,101
We've got two more months.

98
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:03,101
So little time.

99
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:04,134
We have to hurry.

100
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:18,201
-There you are.

101
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:19,634
What are you doing here?

102
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:22,367
-Oh, hi, how are you, Shuhei?

103
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,701
I was just taking a break
to watch the ladies train.

104
00:07:25,734 --> 00:07:26,334
Take a look.

105
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:32,334
They're in the middle of
preparing for the winter

106
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,901
showdown.

107
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:37,901
-Hold it, that's Rukia and
one of the humans, isn't it?

108
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:39,367
-Do you know that girl?

109
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:42,134
-It looks like Orihime Inoue.

110
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,434
-All right, then.

111
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,201
Hado 33, Sokatsui!

112
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:51,734
-Interesting.

113
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:53,734
Looks like they might be
enjoying their training

114
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:55,101
a little too much.

115
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:57,501
-Oh, you picked up
on that too, huh?

116
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,767
-Huh?

117
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,701
-Sorry to bother
you, Captain Ukitake,

118
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:11,201
but I have a personal
request to ask of you.

119
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:13,434
-A personal request?

120
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:15,667
What is it you want, exactly?

121
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:18,301
I want you to authorize the
opening of the training ground

122
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:20,401
behind the barracks for my use.

123
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,834
-Open the training ground?

124
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:24,634
What do you need it for?

125
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,301
-Sir, a friend and
I would like to use

126
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:29,367
it to train in preparation
for the showdown

127
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:30,301
this upcoming winter.

128
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:36,301
-Who is that?

129
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:37,867
-Oh, Captain Ukitake.

130
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:38,767
I'm glad you're here.

131
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,667
I've brought you Orihime Inoue.

132
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:43,001
-What are you talking about,
you armpit-smelling monkey?

133
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:45,634
I'm the one who brought her
over here and you know it.

134
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,701
-Don't lie, you
little booger eater!

135
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,867
Anyhow, Captain Ukitake,
would you like more tea?

136
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:51,367
-Hey!

137
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:52,434
No fair.

138
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,634
We made a deal that
we would figure out

139
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,067
who gets to pour him tea by
playing Rock, Paper, Scissors.

140
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:59,367
-Whoever makes the
first move wins.

141
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,301
-I'm sorry.

142
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,634
Sorry for the sudden request.

143
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,434
I know that I came
here uninvited.

144
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:06,834
-Orihime.

145
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,967
This is not the
time to be timid.

146
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,701
It's imperative that we're
ready for the final showdown

147
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:13,267
against Captain Aizen.

148
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:15,634
As long as we have
somebody with powers,

149
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:19,667
it doesn't matter if they're
a Soul Reaper or a human.

150
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,034
I mean it.

151
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:23,801
At a time like this, I would
even accept help from Chappi.

152
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,501
(HIGH PITCHED)
I'll do what I can.

153
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:26,767
-Rukia.

154
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:30,001
You really don't have to
bring things down to my level.

155
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:31,267
-Listen to me.

156
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:33,501
We need to start training!

157
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:34,034
-Yes.

158
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:34,901
Yes, sorry.

159
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:36,634
You're right.

160
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,034
RUKIA: It's fine, as
long as you understand.

161
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,467
Let's do our best, Orihime.

162
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:40,967
ORIHIME: OK.

163
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,801
-I was surprised
when she showed up

164
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:50,301
one day with that desperate
look and asked me to open up

165
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:54,301
the training grounds
behind the barracks.

166
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:57,134
But I'm happy for her.

167
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:00,034
She found a friend.

168
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,967
-I don't know.

169
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,967
Even if that friend's a human?

170
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,801
-You shouldn't talk like that.

171
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,301
-Please, forgive me.

172
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:11,067
-No.

173
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:12,634
It's OK.

174
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,934
Even if they live in
completely different worlds,

175
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,901
friendship's always
a fine thing to have.

176
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:21,401
And you know, Orihime and
her friends are unusual.

177
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:23,567
Maybe they'll even
become soul Reapers

178
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:25,401
after they've passed
on to the Soul Society.

179
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:33,267
-Hado 33.

180
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:35,334
Sokatsui!

181
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,001
-Santen Kesshun!

182
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:44,367
-I'm not finished yet!

183
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:45,001
-Koten Zanshun!

184
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:51,067
-Don't hesitate.

185
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:54,134
If you're indecisive,
you can't hope to win.

186
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,001
-OK.

187
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:56,534
-Hado 4.

188
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:57,901
Byakurai!

189
00:10:57,934 --> 00:10:58,567
-Santen Kesshun!

190
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:13,067
-So, tell me.

191
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:15,301
What did you come
here for anyway?

192
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:18,401
Was there, um, something
that you wanted?

193
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:19,467
-Oh, yeah.

194
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:21,734
That's right.

195
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:23,967
It's this month's
Seireitei bulletin.

196
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:26,401
The mail order catalog's inside.

197
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:29,101
-What the-- What are
you doing with this?

198
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:31,801
-It's chaos around here.

199
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:37,267
Squad 10 is still on assignment
in the world of the living,

200
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:40,134
Squad 11's captain
won't wake up,

201
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,234
and I don't know where
the Lieutenant is.

202
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,934
And all of the members of
Squad 12 are still in the lab.

203
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,534
They won't come out.

204
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,401
I guess it never
really occurred to me

205
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:54,234
for just how difficult a
captain's duties truly are.

206
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,801
When Captain Tosen
was in charge,

207
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:58,701
I don't remember him asking
his subordinates for any help.

208
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,167
Well, I guess I'd better
get back to my duties.

209
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,501
-No, no.

210
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:06,601
Don't be in such a hurry.

211
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:08,434
You should stay
awhile and relax.

212
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:10,067
-Sorry, I can't.

213
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:12,601
I still have a
lot of work to do.

214
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:14,767
Although I wouldn't mind
watching those two girls

215
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,701
train for a while longer.

216
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,501
Maybe later, when I have
a little more free time.

217
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:24,734
UKITAKE (VOICEOVER):
Four months, huh?

218
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:29,434
Not much time to mend
the heart, is it?

219
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:31,301
Much less to build strength.

220
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:43,201
If only this fleeting peace
could last a little longer.

221
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:52,916
[shouting]

222
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:54,783
-Damn it, damn it,
damn it, damn it.

223
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,749
Break, break,
break, break, break.

224
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:57,649
Take this!

225
00:12:57,683 --> 00:12:58,983
And this!

226
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:00,883
I hate you, I hate you, I
hate you, I hate you, damn it.

227
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:01,749
Damn it, break.

228
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:02,549
Ah!

229
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,783
Break, break, break, break--

230
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,849
-Shut up!

231
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:07,516
What is wrong with
you, anyway, Yumichika?

232
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:11,149
-My Fuji Kujaku is
totally ticking me off.

233
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:13,249
He's such an obnoxious
snob, and he's bossy,

234
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:15,916
and he thinks that he's the best
looking guy in the whole world.

235
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:17,783
I hate him, I hate
him, I hate him!

236
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:19,783
I can never fight
next to him again.

237
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:21,816
In fact, if he were the
last sword in this world,

238
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:24,683
you couldn't pay me to
fight alongside this jerk.

239
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:25,483
Not ever.

240
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:27,349
Even if he begged me.

241
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:29,049
-What are you talking about?

242
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,916
He's exactly like you.

243
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:32,649
-Argh.

244
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:36,583
-Now, my Heineko is a stupid,
needy, selfish, temperamental,

245
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,416
lazy, and moody slob,
which, when you boil it

246
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:41,616
down to basics, makes
her the total opposite

247
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:43,483
of my personality.

248
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:45,649
-Yeah, well I think
that's you to a T.

249
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:47,149
I bet you're the
kind of person who,

250
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:49,183
whenever she looks at a
picture of herself, says,

251
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:52,583
oh, look at me, I am so fat.

252
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:54,583
-What did you say, Yumichika?

253
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:56,083
I dare you to say
that once more!

254
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:57,283
-Argh!

255
00:13:57,316 --> 00:14:00,416
Will you two just shut the
hell up and concentrate?

256
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:03,483
Or I'll send you back
to the Soul Society.

257
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:05,649
Honestly.

258
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:08,149
Can't they at least talk to
their swords more quietly?

259
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:23,216
-The clouds are moving.

260
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:24,216
-Hm?

261
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:25,049
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,116
Did you say something, Ikkaku?

263
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:29,216
-Never mind.

264
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:29,849
Forget it.

265
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:30,616
It's nothing.

266
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:52,383
-Arrancars?

267
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,516
Already?

268
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:55,983
They're a little
early, aren't they?

269
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:56,749
-Yes.

270
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:58,383
They're definitely early.

271
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:02,316
But there's no time for us to
sit around and figure out why.

272
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:03,983
-Oh.

273
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:07,516
It looks like we picked
a good spot to show up.

274
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:10,283
There are some guys with
pretty high spiritual pressures

275
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:11,383
down there.

276
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,649
Wanna start with them?

277
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:14,816
-Take a good, long look.

278
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:16,649
Those are Soul Reapers, Yammy.

279
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,149
I wonder what
they're doing here.

280
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,349
Maybe they're reinforcements
from the Soul Society

281
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:22,683
that Mr. Six told us about.

282
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:25,416
Right?

283
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:26,049
Oh.

284
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,383
Sorry.

285
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,116
Of course I mean the former six.

286
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,016
-The guy that I'm
looking to kill.

287
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:37,216
He's not even down
there with them.

288
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:37,783
-Hey.

289
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:40,049
Wait, Grimmjow.

290
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:40,649
Damn.

291
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:41,949
That idiot.

292
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,316
-Don't bother about him.

293
00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:47,616
He's not even an Espada anymore.

294
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,316
He's worthless.

295
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,649
-Ugh.

296
00:15:55,683 --> 00:15:58,916
The guy I wanna to kill's
not down there either.

297
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:59,849
-Who do you mean?

298
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:01,216
The guy who chopped
your arm off,

299
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:02,549
or the guy who kicked your butt?

300
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,916
Or the one who
deflected your Cero.

301
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:09,649
With you, there are always so
many enemies to choose from.

302
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:11,316
-I want all of them.

303
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:12,016
Hey.

304
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,683
Let's get going, rookie.

305
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:16,049
Don't just stand there
drooling like that.

306
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,816
-Ah.

307
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:19,316
Ah.

308
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:21,183
-Ugh.

309
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:22,116
Just what we need.

310
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,783
Another freak to join the team.

311
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:32,916
-I think I've got it!

312
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,916
I've got some kind
of reaction here.

313
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:36,749
-What about the Gentei Kaijo?

314
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:39,183
-It's been authorized.

315
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:39,816
-The reaction.

316
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:41,216
What color is it?

317
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,016
-It's crimson.

318
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:43,983
They're Espadas!

319
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:55,416
-I'm Squad 10 captain,
Toshiro Hitsugaya.

320
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,316
-That's quite a coincidence.

321
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,383
I'm also a 10.

322
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,083
Arrancar 10, better
known as Yammy.

323
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:03,816
-You're number 10?

324
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:07,249
Then that means that
you are an Espada.

325
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:08,016
-Yeah.

326
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:09,683
You seem to know about us.

327
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:11,649
It seems that you've
been fighting somebody

328
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:13,483
who obviously has a big mouth.

329
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:27,183
-I take it you're an Espada too.

330
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:28,583
-That's right.

331
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:30,416
My name is Luppi.

332
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,516
I'm ranked number six.

333
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:36,183
-Huh?

334
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,516
-Can I-- can I cut that one?

335
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:46,716
[groaning]

336
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:48,616
ICHIGO: Let go of me.

337
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:49,316
-No.

338
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:50,649
You're not ready yet.

339
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:52,949
-This is exactly why your
friends from the Soul Society

340
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:55,416
are stationed here in
the world of the living.

341
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,916
So why don't you just
let them handle it?

342
00:17:57,949 --> 00:17:59,883
-Well, this just happens
to be exactly what I've

343
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,216
been training for, dammit!

344
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:03,249
Look, this is now
or never for me.

345
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:10,416
-Just let him go.

346
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:16,183
-Hey!

347
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:18,649
Are you nuts, or something?

348
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:19,149
Shinji!

349
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:30,049
-Rukia!

350
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,449
-Yes, sir.

351
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:34,783
I just received the report on
the Espadas' recent activity.

352
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:38,283
-The Kido Corps are working
on opening up the gate.

353
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:41,016
-Go to the Senkaimon in
front of the barracks.

354
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:42,383
-Yes, sir!

355
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,283
-Wait, Rukia!

356
00:18:43,316 --> 00:18:45,116
I'll go with you.

357
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,683
RUKIA: No, Orihime.

358
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:49,316
You don't have a hell butterfly.

359
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:51,783
If you try to pass through
the Senkaimon with me,

360
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:54,149
you'll end up in the Dongai,
the border between the world

361
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:57,616
of the living and
the Soul Society.

362
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:00,283
-I just ordered the outer
wall to be stabilized,

363
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:03,583
so you'll be able to pass
through the Dongai safely.

364
00:19:03,616 --> 00:19:05,349
It will take a little
time, but now you

365
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:07,983
can return to the
world of the living.

366
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:11,983
I know you're in a hurry,
but you have to stay calm.

367
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:14,516
Understand?

368
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:16,616
-Yes, sir.

369
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:19,083
-Don't make that face, Orihime.

370
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,178
I'll be waiting for
you on the other side.

371
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:30,216
This isn't right.

372
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:33,483
It's too soon for the
Espadas to show up.

373
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:36,883
The Hokyoku wasn't supposed
to awaken until the winter.

374
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:37,883
What's happening?

375
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:54,749
-Hey.

376
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:57,049
I've been looking
for you, Soul Reaper.

377
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,583
-And I've been waiting for you.

378
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,216
It's taken me some
time, but now I'm

379
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:06,283
ready to show you
what I've learned

380
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:07,716
since the last time we met!

381
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:12,083
Bankai!

382
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:28,716
-Bankai, huh?

383
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:30,583
So, what?

384
00:20:30,616 --> 00:20:32,583
Maybe you've forgotten.

385
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:35,383
Your Bankai couldn't
stop me, or do anything

386
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,483
to slow me down the
first time we met.

387
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:40,983
-Well, maybe you're the
one who's forgotten.

388
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:44,849
It was my Bankai attack that
originally gave you that scar.

389
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:55,883
I've got a question
for you, Grimmjow.

390
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,349
What happened to
that arm of yours?

391
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,149
-Oh, I got rid of it.

392
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:08,383
Because I'm only going to
need one arm to kill you.

393
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,449
-Is that right?

394
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:16,849
Then in that case, I guess
I don't need to hold back.

395
00:21:16,883 --> 00:21:19,849
-If you do, then
you'll just die faster!

396
00:21:25,516 --> 00:21:32,349
-I know I can Hollowfied
for exactly 11 seconds.

397
00:21:32,383 --> 00:21:35,616
I'll finish him by then!

398
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:36,116
-No way.

399
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:37,749
Forget it.

400
00:21:37,783 --> 00:21:39,216
You can't come with me.

401
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:41,916
You've used up too much
energy, so I'll go,

402
00:21:41,949 --> 00:21:43,283
and you stay here and rest.

403
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:45,049
Understand?

404
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:45,883
-I can't.

405
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,649
-Yes, that's right.

406
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:50,416
It's just as Renji
explained to you.

407
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:55,416
But it seems to me you're
nearly exhausted as well, Renji.

408
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:59,183
Both of you, stay here and rest.

409
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:00,957
Instead...

410
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,667
I'll go.

411
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:23,922
[theme music]

412
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,592
RENJI: Are you really
sure I don't have to go?

413
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:46,859
URAHARA: You don't have to.

414
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,326
Instead, organize the
merchandise that I purchased.

415
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,259
RENJI: You don't mean all those
things you bought, do you?

416
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:54,026
URAHARA: Kurodo, Noba, help him.

417
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:54,992
KURODO: Leave it to me!

418
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:55,726
NOBA: No problem.

419
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,926
URAHARA: Well, I'm off.

420
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,460
RENJI: Nice getaway.
