[theme music]

2
00:01:48,548 --> 00:01:49,982
NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

3
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:52,615
who was kidnapped
by the Arrancars,

4
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:55,415
Ichigo, Chad, Uryu,
Rukia, and Renji

5
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,048
have all snuck into Hueco
Mundo, the realm of the Hollows.

6
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:01,915
On the journey to Aizen's
fortress, Las Noches,

7
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:03,882
our heroes struggled
against endless attacks

8
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,548
from the Arrancar forces.

9
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:08,648
Upon breaking into the
fortress, the group

10
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:10,482
split up and took
five different paths

11
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:11,648
in their search for Orihime.

12
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:21,348
Rukia was confronted by Espada
number 9, Aaroniero Arruruerie,

13
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:24,882
who appeared before her outside,
on the roof of the fortress.

14
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:26,282
-Come with me.

15
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:32,748
NARRATOR: Shockingly, when
Aaroniero removed his mask,

16
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:35,615
he revealed the face of a man
who was supposedly deceased.

17
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,648
It was Kaien Shiba, former
lieutenant of Squad 13

18
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:41,915
and Rukia's mentor.

19
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:45,648
-It can't be.

20
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:46,982
Lieutenant Shiba?

21
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:48,382
-Ha.

22
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:49,815
Yeah.

23
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:51,115
It's been a while.

24
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:52,315
You're looking well, Rukia.

25
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:58,348
I'm just glad that it
was you ended up in here.

26
00:02:58,382 --> 00:03:00,082
I've got a plan,
and I think you're

27
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:02,548
the only person who can help
me pull it off successfully.

28
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:09,948
I want you to bring me the
heads of your four friends.

29
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:12,915
You're familiar with all of
their abilities and weaknesses,

30
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:15,982
so you don't have to
worry about getting hurt.

31
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:20,848
It shouldn't be too difficult
to catch them off guard.

32
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:23,748
If you do this, we'll wipe
the slate clean between us

33
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:28,048
and I'll completely
forgive you for killing me.

34
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:28,715
You see?

35
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:29,782
Pretty simple, huh?

36
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:31,648
I would say it's an
awfully small price

37
00:03:31,682 --> 00:03:35,715
to pay for taking my life,
don't you think, Rukia?

38
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,915
Well?

39
00:03:37,948 --> 00:03:40,782
What's wrong, Rukia?

40
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:45,315
-You're not gonna say it's
a joke this time, are you?

41
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:47,215
-Rukia.

42
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:50,048
-You want me to kill
my friends for you?

43
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:52,282
Something like that
could never be a joke.

44
00:03:59,182 --> 00:04:01,615
You'd never joke about
something like that.

45
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:09,815
The Kaien I knew would
never force someone

46
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:13,015
to choose between their friends
and themselves, no matter what.

47
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:14,415
Now dance!

48
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:15,215
Tsude no Shirayuki!

49
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:28,582
-Rukia's spiritual pressure.

50
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,148
She must be fighting again.

51
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:30,748
Is she winning?

52
00:04:34,515 --> 00:04:35,315
Damn it.

53
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:36,115
It's too far away.

54
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:37,815
I can't get a clear read.

55
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:41,148
[groan]

56
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:43,548
[screaming]

57
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:49,415
-Don't get in my face like that!

58
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:51,848
I'm telling you right now, if
you keep sneaking up on me,

59
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:53,715
you're gonna give
me a heart attack.

60
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:56,615
Hey, come to think of it,
what were you screaming about?

61
00:04:56,648 --> 00:04:59,015
-You started screaming out of
nowhere and it surprised me,

62
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,282
you know what I mean?

63
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:01,882
And just when I was
getting over that,

64
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,582
so suddenly stopped
screaming and started

65
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,548
talking to yourself.

66
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:06,115
Have you gone
completely bonkers?

67
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:07,482
-Get over it.

68
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,115
I wasn't acting crazy enough
for you to be worrying about me.

69
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:10,815
Come on.

70
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:11,815
Time to get moving.

71
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:13,315
-Wait, don't leave me behind.

72
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:14,782
I'm coming.

73
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,182
RENJI (VOICEOVER): Rukia.

74
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,782
Don't you dare die on me.

75
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:45,915
Dance.

76
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:46,648
Sode no Shirayuki.

77
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:52,815
-Some no mai.

78
00:06:58,148 --> 00:06:58,615
Tsukishiro!

79
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:11,715
-What's wrong, Rukia?

80
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:12,648
Is that it?

81
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,948
Is that the extent
of your power.

82
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:25,682
The first dance is Tsukishiro,
and the second dance

83
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:26,482
is Hakuren.

84
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:28,748
I know them both very well.

85
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,615
Who was it who helped you
practice those movies?

86
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,148
Me, if you recall.

87
00:07:33,182 --> 00:07:36,948
I watched you work them both
out, right from the very start.

88
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:38,182
Come on.

89
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:41,915
Do you really think they'll
work against me, Rukia?

90
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:43,848
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
I have to remember.

91
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:45,482
This man isn't
who he says he is.

92
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:51,315
He's not Kaien Shiba.

93
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:53,348
He's an imposter.

94
00:07:53,382 --> 00:07:56,382
Two of my friends
are in trouble.

95
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,982
It's Uryu and Chad.

96
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,848
-Are you worried
about something?

97
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:07,715
Your friends are fighting
very highly skilled opponents.

98
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:10,048
They're Privaron Espada.

99
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:12,015
That's the fallen Espada.

100
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:13,782
-They aren't even full Espada.

101
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:16,148
-Why are you so relieved?

102
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:17,882
Even though they're
ex-Espada, they

103
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,582
have the skills of trained
assassins and, as such,

104
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,382
shouldn't be taken lightly.

105
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:25,148
One of your friends defeated
an ex-Espada earlier,

106
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:27,115
but not without consequence.

107
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:29,782
He paid a heavy price
for his victory.

108
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:32,782
You can sense his
distress, can't you?

109
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:34,648
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): I
knew there was something

110
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:38,248
wrong with Ichigo's
spiritual pressure.

111
00:08:38,282 --> 00:08:40,548
KAIEN: It looks like I didn't
need to ask for your help

112
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:44,048
in bringing me your
friends' heads.

113
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:45,782
They'll all be dead soon.

114
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:49,548
One way or another, you'll see.

115
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:52,082
You think you're gonna
be a hero, Rukia?

116
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,448
There's nothing you can do.

117
00:08:57,848 --> 00:08:58,415
-Tsugi no mai.

118
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:07,182
Hakuren!

119
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:21,348
-What a clever idea, using
Hakuren to distract me

120
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:23,215
and then attacking me.

121
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:26,182
Good, but, not good enough.

122
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:31,848
You still don't get it, do you?

123
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:35,782
You don't have the experience
or power to defeat me.

124
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:37,315
I'm tired of this.

125
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:40,848
Rage through the
seas and the heavens.

126
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:41,348
Nejibana.

127
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:03,782
Does this bring back memories?

128
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:05,948
-But how?

129
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,415
-You're finished, Rukia.

130
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:12,982
Here I come.

131
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:13,815
Take your position.

132
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:54,948
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): His
unique upper body stance

133
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:56,815
is so familiar.

134
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:59,915
The spear techniques, like
a beautifully choreographed

135
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:01,215
dance.

136
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:03,648
Using one wrist as the
center of rotation.

137
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:05,448
The way he splits
the enemy in two

138
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:07,948
by crushing them with a
blast of spirit energy,

139
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:11,282
and slashing them
with his spear.

140
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:15,015
Without a doubt, these are
Kaien Shiba's techniques

141
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:18,982
No matter how much my heart
denies it, my eyes and my brain

142
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:22,582
try to tell me that this
man is the real Kaien.

143
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,982
But the core of my
being can't accept it.

144
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:30,015
I must trust in the
mentor who lives

145
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:35,248
on in my heart, not the
impostor who stands before me.

146
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:38,382
I must trust in the man
who taught me how to fight,

147
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:41,682
and gave me a place
where I knew I belonged.

148
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:44,915
I must believe in the warm,
kind-hearted Kaien I once knew.

149
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,115
NEL: Hey, whoa there!

150
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:58,348
What's the matter, Ichigo?

151
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:00,515
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): That
surge of spiritual pressure

152
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:01,815
I felt just now.

153
00:12:01,848 --> 00:12:03,615
Did it come from Rukia?

154
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:04,482
Wait.

155
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,882
It isn't just her.

156
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:07,248
It's Uryu and Chad, as well.

157
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:17,448
Are they going to be all right?

158
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:18,282
I can't have doubt.

159
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:19,582
I have to trust in their skills.

160
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:20,448
NEL: I can't breathe!

161
00:12:24,115 --> 00:12:24,948
Sorry.

162
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:25,948
I didn't mean to
squeeze so hard.

163
00:12:25,982 --> 00:12:27,248
I was lost in thought.

164
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:28,115
-Goodbye.

165
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,248
-Wait a minute, Nel!

166
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,148
You can't be dead!

167
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,448
I'm really sorry.

168
00:12:31,482 --> 00:12:35,182
-Tell me, Ichigo, are you
really, truly, honestly sorry?

169
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:36,682
-I really, truly am!

170
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,515
Will you forgive me?

171
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:42,082
-I suppose I'll forgive you if
you give me a piggyback ride.

172
00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:44,682
-Wha-- why you little--
this is serious business.

173
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:46,382
We don't have time
to be fooling around.

174
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:48,015
-You almost squished
me to death,

175
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:49,648
and now you're yelling at me!

176
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,115
I don't think you're very nice!

177
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:52,315
-All right, whatever you say.

178
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:54,248
Just stop crying, will ya?

179
00:12:54,282 --> 00:12:55,348
Come on.

180
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,282
-Ichigo, are you sure
you're really sorry?

181
00:12:57,315 --> 00:12:58,682
-Yeah, I'm really, really sorry.

182
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:00,415
-Then we'd better get a move on!

183
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:02,915
Giddyup, horsey!

184
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,848
Now we're really
gettin' somewhere!

185
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:06,348
Faster, faster!

186
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:08,715
-I swear, I'm never having kids.

187
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:21,015
-You lose, Rukia.

188
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:23,382
-Huh?

189
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:25,548
-Hado number 33, Sokatsui!

190
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:33,915
-Kido without the incantation.

191
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:35,115
You've improved.

192
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,248
I must admit, I'm impressed.

193
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,048
But it won't be
enough to defeat me.

194
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:50,582
-What?

195
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:52,515
Why did he run away?

196
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,848
He dodged my spell with ease.

197
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:57,248
I was completely open.

198
00:13:57,282 --> 00:14:01,915
He could have killed me in
one stroke if he wanted to.

199
00:14:01,948 --> 00:14:04,015
-Do you want me to
explain it to you?

200
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:12,065
-Come with me.

201
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:18,198
-Nothing he said has
made any sense, right

202
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:19,531
from the beginning.

203
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:21,531
Starting with his
explanation as why

204
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:25,898
we had to come inside for
our face to face encounter.

205
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,098
-Everywhere the light
touches in Las Noches

206
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:30,231
is being monitored my Aizen.

207
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:31,765
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
This much I know.

208
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:35,198
Everything he said so
far has been a lie.

209
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:37,598
Keeping that in mind,
the real question

210
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:40,331
is why did he invite
me inside this tower

211
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:42,365
before removing his mask?

212
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:43,498
-Sorry.

213
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:47,631
I simply cannot stand
the sunlight out there.

214
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:50,398
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): I don't
believe he's telling the truth.

215
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,298
But it's worth
testing him to see

216
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:56,631
if I can find out
what's really going on.

217
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:58,731
Bakudo number four, Hainawa!

218
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:04,098
-What do you think
you're doing, Rukia?

219
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:05,398
Stalling for time?

220
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,998
Weak moves like that
won't get you anywhere.

221
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,431
RUKIA: Mask of flesh and blood.

222
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:12,631
Universe, soar.

223
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:16,598
The one crowned with man's name.

224
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:19,865
Carriage of thunder, and
gap of the spinning wheel.

225
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:20,531
Divide into--

226
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:21,298
-A double incantation.

227
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:22,531
She's desperate.

228
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:24,598
RUKIA: --between lotuses
into the wall of blue flame.

229
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:27,798
Wake for the edge of the
great spire in the heavens.

230
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:29,865
Bakudo number 61, Rikujokoro!

231
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:36,765
-Dammit!

232
00:15:36,798 --> 00:15:39,165
-Hado number 73, Soren Sokatsui!

233
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:53,165
[screaming]

234
00:15:58,098 --> 00:15:58,565
-Huh?

235
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,874
[screaming]

236
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:30,716
-Huh?

237
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,350
Wait a minute.

238
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:46,850
What in the world are you?

239
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:47,716
-Hm.

240
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,150
I guess our cover's been blown.

241
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,383
-What's done is done.

242
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,616
At this point, we may as
well reintroduce ourselves.

243
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,916
We are known as Espada number
nine, Aaroniero Arruruerie.

244
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,750
-But you haven't
explained what you are.

245
00:17:03,783 --> 00:17:05,983
-Don't make us repeat ourselves.

246
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:09,916
We are known as Espada number
nine, Aaroniero Arruruerie.

247
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,083
-And don't ask us
about our faces.

248
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:14,783
We are tired of hearing
peoples' opinions.

249
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:17,583
-Let's talk about your
technique instead.

250
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:21,516
Rikujokoro, among the
current Soul Reaper captains,

251
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,516
Byakuya Kuchiki
is the most adept

252
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,316
with this particular Kido.

253
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,216
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): He
even knows about that.

254
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:33,316
-A double incantation using
Rikujokoro and Soren Sokatsui.

255
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,283
We don't have a
memory of your being

256
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:37,750
able to use those
particular techniques.

257
00:17:37,783 --> 00:17:39,383
But you blew your chance.

258
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,750
If you had the skills to hit
us directly with that Kido,

259
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:46,083
you might have easily
inflicted a serious injury.

260
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:47,716
-I didn't aim for you.

261
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,116
-Hm?

262
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,250
-I realized that the
sunlight would rob you

263
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:54,183
of your shape-shifting powers,
and in the process force

264
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:58,183
you to reveal your true form.

265
00:17:58,216 --> 00:17:59,416
-To what purpose?

266
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,850
-It was critically important
to me, and it proved my point.

267
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:12,216
I had to reassure myself that
you weren't actually Kaien.

268
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,716
Now that I kow the truth,
I have no reservations

269
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,983
about this battle.

270
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:19,483
I can fight you without
holding back, and destroy you.

271
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,950
-Did we hear you
correctly, Rukia?

272
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:24,050
Did you say you could
win now that you

273
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,683
don't have to hold
yourself back?

274
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:29,250
-You have good hearing
for someone without ears.

275
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,516
-You've made a mistake, Rukia.

276
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,783
-Don't take us lightly.

277
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:42,516
We can't use our power in
the sunlight, that is true.

278
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:47,016
But as long as we stay in the
shadows, we're indestructible.

279
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,950
We can use it endlessly.

280
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,950
-To be perfectly
honest, I don't know

281
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:04,583
what Lord Aizen was thinking.

282
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:06,883
Whether he put the light
there for security or not,

283
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,750
it's been a real
pain in the ass.

284
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:11,850
Hueco Mundo operates
just fine in the dark.

285
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:14,583
I can't believe Lord Aizen
tried to copy the sunlight

286
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:17,250
from the world of the living,
especially when there are so

287
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:21,850
many others who need the dark
to operate at their best.

288
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:23,550
You seem to be
under the impression

289
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,150
that I have the
ability to shape-shift.

290
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:27,083
-Why?

291
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:28,383
Are you telling
me that I'm wrong?

292
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,016
-Not exactly.

293
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,750
I'm just saying there's
much more you haven't seen.

294
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:36,516
-What are you talking about?

295
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,583
-Hm.

296
00:19:37,616 --> 00:19:39,716
You don't know, but
I'm the only Gillian

297
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,316
who's also a member
of the Espada.

298
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,083
-Oh, yeah?

299
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:44,150
So what?

300
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,850
-Under normal
circumstances, I wouldn't

301
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:49,016
have nearly enough power to
become a member of the Espada.

302
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,950
Yet here I am, a
full fledged member.

303
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:55,783
And I am number nine.

304
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:58,550
So why would they
make an exception?

305
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,016
They were impressed.

306
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,550
Out of all the Arrancars
in Hueco Mundo,

307
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,783
I'm the only one who has the
ability to evolve infinitely!

308
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,783
The power to merge
with another entity

309
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:10,816
originally belonged to a
creature called Metastacia,

310
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,083
who took over Kaien Shiba's
body when they fought.

311
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:17,516
When Metastacia died, his
body returned to Hueco Mundo.

312
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,983
That's when I made my move.

313
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:22,016
I ate him and made
his power mine!

314
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,283
-You are that monster's body?

315
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:25,783
-You bet I did.

316
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,450
[gasp]

317
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:39,650
-My true ability is
called Glotoneria.

318
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:40,983
It's quite simple.

319
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:43,850
I devour dead Hollows and
absorb both their spirit energy

320
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:45,616
and abilities.

321
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,416
Understand?

322
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,550
When Metastacia came back
in Kaien Shiba's body,

323
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,516
I devoured him and was able to
absorb both their abilities.

324
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,283
-That explains all
your knowledge.

325
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:00,550
-Of course.

326
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,116
You weren't wrong
to believe you were

327
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,983
talking to the
actual Kaien Shiba.

328
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:09,350
Because this body really
did belong to Kaien Shiba.

329
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:11,916
The muscles retain
all his experience,

330
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,683
and the mind retains
all of his memories.

331
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:17,183
They're accessible for my use!

332
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:20,783
It's an elegantly effective
system when you think about it.

333
00:21:20,816 --> 00:21:24,250
I simply accessed all of his
memories and acted accordingly.

334
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,216
It's the endgame.

335
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,850
Allow me to demonstrate for you.

336
00:21:27,883 --> 00:21:30,483
I'll show you what an Espada
sword release actually

337
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:32,350
looks like.

338
00:21:32,383 --> 00:21:33,650
Devour her, Glotoneria!

339
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:16,679

340
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:45,429
NEL: Riding on Ichigo's
shoulders is great!

341
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:47,062
It makes me taller and faster.

342
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:48,629
I don't ever wanna
get down from here!

343
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:49,462
DONDOCHAKKA: You're so lucky.

344
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:50,662
I want a piggyback ride, too!

345
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:51,696
Man, what gives?

346
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:53,262
RENJI: What are you
looking at me for?

347
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:54,496
DONDOCHAKKA: Please, Renji?

348
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:55,229
RENJI: Whoa, hey!

349
00:23:55,262 --> 00:23:56,296
Get off of me!

350
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:57,729
NEL: You boys sure
know how to have fun!

351
00:23:57,762 --> 00:24:01,262
RENJI: Gah!
