Huh?

00:01:59,089 --> 00:01:59,622
-Wow.

8
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:00,989
Nice view.

00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:02,689
Ah!

to get out of the way.

13
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,622
-Yeah, nice try.

14
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:17,455
But it looked to me like you
had the whole thing planned out.

15
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:20,089
-Honestly, Rangiku, it
was just a coincidence.

16
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:21,422
That's all.

17
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:23,389
Give me a break, I
barely saw anything.

18
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:24,889
My eyes were mostly closed.

19
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:25,622
Ah!

20
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:26,822
-Listen.

21
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,355
I'm the one who got perved
on, you little squirt.

22
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:30,855
I'll give you a
break, all right?

23
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:32,622
How about if I start
with your neck?

24
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,622
-You're kind of choking me!

Are you crazy?

00:02:46,822 --> 00:02:48,322
Be careful!

Ah!

00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:54,855
-We've gotta save her!

36
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:55,855
-The water's really cold!

37
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:56,922
-I know!

38
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:58,989
-OK, we jump into
the river on three.

39
00:02:59,022 --> 00:02:59,489
Ready?

-Speed it up!

46
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:20,189
Swim faster!

47
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:22,889
-I'm trying, but all the
water this body's absorbing

48
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:24,089
is slowing me down.

49
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,555
Hang on, I'm coming!

50
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:33,155
I thought I was gonna drown!

51
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:35,789
What was the big idea, Rangiku?

52
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:38,155
-It was going to be a lot
quicker than leaving my gigai.

53
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:43,789
Thank goodness.

54
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:47,489
You better just stay
still for a moment.

55
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:49,222
Are you OK?

56
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:50,155
-Yeah.

57
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,989
But where's Shintaro?

58
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:53,755
-Shintaro?

59
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:55,089
-What happened?

60
00:03:55,122 --> 00:03:56,322
Is she all right?

61
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:57,989
-She fell in the river.

62
00:03:58,022 --> 00:03:59,355
-That's terrible.

63
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:00,955
-My friend, Shintaro.

64
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,855
He's the one who saved me.

65
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:04,289
-Shintaro?

66
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:06,189
If anyone here is
named Shintaro,

67
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:07,755
you're a hero, my friend.

68
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,322
-Huh?

69
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:09,155
Wait a minute.

70
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,322
I'm Shintaro?

71
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:11,189
I think.

72
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:13,389
Rangiku, what do I do now?

73
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:16,255
-Have a good time, teddy bear.

74
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,555
[groan]

75
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:24,455
-Are you sure you're going
to be OK here by yourself?

76
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:26,889
-Yes, sir Thank you
for bringing me home.

77
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:39,422
Man.

78
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:43,389
Pretending to be a stuffed
animal is exhausting.

79
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:44,455
Look at this joint.

80
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:46,722
The family must
be really loaded.

81
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:48,822
That TV's huge!

82
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,889
The furniture looks
expensive, too.

83
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:53,322
Everything's first class.

84
00:04:53,355 --> 00:04:56,222
I wonder what kind of
work her parents do?

85
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:56,722
Uh-oh!

86
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:01,289
-Now, let's get you dry.

87
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:10,789
-Ow!

88
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:16,255
Wah!

89
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:16,755

90
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:17,255
Hot!

91
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:17,789
Hot!

92
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:19,655
-Um-- Shintaro?

93
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:20,155
-Huh?

94
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:28,422
Actually, I'm not-- that is--

95
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:29,922
-Hey!

96
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,755
Shintaro!

97
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,555
Wow!

98
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:33,789
This is the best gift ever!

99
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:36,022
You can really move
and talk to me.

100
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:37,489
-I can't breathe!

101
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:38,455
-Oh.

102
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:40,422
Sorry, Shintaro.

103
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:42,889
-Forgot how much
I like to breathe.

104
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:43,422
Hey.

105
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:44,722
Wait.

106
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:47,222
Aren't you surprised to see
that I can move and talk?

107
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:48,355
-Mm-hm.

108
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,022
But it just means that
I finally got my wish.

109
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:51,655
Every night when
I went to bed, I

110
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:54,722
wished that you would
be alive when I woke up.

111
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,389
-Somehow that just
makes me feel worse.

112
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:59,155
-So I didn't dream it, right?

113
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:00,989
You really were the
one who saved me

114
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:02,655
when I fell in the water.

115
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:03,789
-Yeah.

116
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,989
It's true.

117
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:06,855
-Well, then thanks very much.

118
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:07,955
I owe you my life.

119
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:08,955
-No big deal.

120
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:11,689
I was just being
a good samaritan.

121
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:12,522
Yep.

122
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,855
So, what was your name again?

123
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:15,955
-It's Miyuki, silly.

124
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:17,522
How come you don't know
my name after we've

125
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:19,155
been living together
for so many years?

126
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:23,589
-Uh-- well, it's just that,
you see, I-- of course,

127
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:26,289
I do know your name-- but--

128
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:27,855
-But what?

129
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,389
-Apparently when I
fell in the river,

130
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,755
I must have gotten amnesia.

131
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,622
It's the weirdest thing.

132
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:33,222
-Yeah.

133
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:34,422
That is weird.

134
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:41,722
-Anyway, are we the only
ones home right now?

135
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:42,455
-That's right.

136
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:43,855
-Where's your mommy?

137
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:45,589
-She's at work.

138
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:46,522
-And your daddy?

139
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:48,489
-He's not here.

140
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:49,755
-How come?

141
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:52,855
-Mommy dumped him because
he was a good for nothing.

142
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,289
-A good for nothing?

143
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:57,089
Does she even know
what that means?

144
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:58,822
-Mommy's very busy all the time.

145
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:00,655
She has a real important
job, and she always

146
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:01,955
comes home late at night.

147
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,189
I told here I was big enough
to stay alone in the house

148
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:05,755
by myself.

149
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:06,989
-Yeah?

150
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:09,255
You're pretty mature
for someone so young.

151
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:09,755
-Uh-huh.

152
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:14,355
Hey, Shintaro?

153
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:15,322
-Hm?

154
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:17,589
-Wanna play a game with me?

155
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:18,089
-What?

156
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:20,055
Huh?

157
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:24,522
What the-- why am I
dressed like this again?

158
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:28,655
I wonder if she's in cahoots
with Ichigo's sister.

159
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:30,789
-Here you go.

160
00:07:30,822 --> 00:07:35,022
I spent all day cooking, so
dinner would be ready for you.

161
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,789
Be sure and clean your plate.

162
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,155
Isn't it yummy?

163
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:42,822
-I can't eat this!

164
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:43,822
It's garbage!

165
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:48,655
Sorry.

166
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,689
I mean-- of course I'll eat it.

167
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:51,689
It looks delicious.

168
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,655
And you worked so hard on it.

169
00:07:57,622 --> 00:07:58,255
-Very good.

170
00:07:58,289 --> 00:07:59,589
Isn't it delicious?

171
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:01,922
-It really sticks to
your ribs, you know?

172
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:06,722
I'll never make it
out of here alive

173
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:09,222
if this is how it's going to be.

174
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,189
-Now that you've had
dinner, Shintaro,

175
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:13,022
what should we play next?

176
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,489
Should we play work, or
should we play school?

177
00:08:16,522 --> 00:08:18,589
-Uh, no!

178
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:20,089
Let's see.

179
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:20,589
Wait.

180
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:21,722
I know.

181
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:24,955
It's such a nice day,
let's go play outside.

182
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:27,489
I always find it's fun to
run around and play outdoors

183
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:30,755
with your friends on a
day as beautiful as this.

184
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,622
-I don't want to go outside.

185
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:33,622
-Huh?

186
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:34,589
Really?

187
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:36,422
What's wrong?

188
00:08:36,455 --> 00:08:37,655
-Nothing.

189
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:40,722
It's just I don't have
any friends, that's all.

190
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:41,922
-Why is that?

191
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:42,422
-'Cause!

192
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,355
Stop asking!

193
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,755
I don't need any friends!

194
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:46,522
-All right.

195
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:47,589
I won't ask anymore.

196
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:49,722
Please stop crying.

197
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:53,455
Oh, she's so touchy.

198
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,489
[sneezing]

199
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:58,055
-You know, you're
a real cry baby.

200
00:08:58,089 --> 00:08:59,022
-Stop teasing me.

201
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:00,522
You're being mean.

202
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:03,255
-Why were you outside earlier
today, if leaving this place

203
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:04,489
is so upsetting?

204
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:08,222
What was so important out there?

205
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:09,522
It's just a question.

206
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:10,922
Don't cry.

207
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,355
-I wanted to see my house.

208
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,622
-Huh?

209
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,155
-The house where we
all used to live.

210
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:20,922
You, and me, and
Mommy and Daddy.

211
00:09:20,955 --> 00:09:22,289
-Your old house?

212
00:09:22,322 --> 00:09:23,622
-Mm-hm.

213
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:27,055
Back when Mommy and Daddy
were both still together,

214
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:28,355
we lived in a different place.

215
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:36,989
It was a really big house on
the other side of the city,

216
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:38,755
and it was really fun.

217
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:41,389
I remember I used to
laugh all the time.

218
00:09:41,422 --> 00:09:43,455
my family lived there together.

219
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:47,655
Mommy, and Daddy, and me,
and my big dog Shintaro.

220
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:49,122
-Wait a minute, Miyuki.

221
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,189
I thought I was Shintaro?

222
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:55,122
-Well, yeah, but he
was the real Shintaro.

223
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:58,655
But then they wouldn't let him
live with us in this apartment,

224
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:01,122
so Mommy bought me a stuffed
animal Shintaro to take

225
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,622
his place.

226
00:10:02,655 --> 00:10:03,989
-Uh-huh.

227
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:05,022
I get it.

228
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:06,722
So what happened to
the real Shintaro?

229
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:09,389
Is he with your daddy?

230
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:10,322
-No.

231
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:11,622
He died when he
got hit by a car.

232
00:10:15,122 --> 00:10:15,889
-Whoa.

233
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:17,589
She's really had it tough.

234
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:18,822
-I understand.

235
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:20,689
-You're sad, because
you really didn't

236
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:22,289
want to move here
when you were having

237
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,589
so much fun at your old house.

238
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:25,922
-We had to move here.

239
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:28,022
Mommy and Daddy
fought all the time.

240
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,622
-Don't you think she's going
to be even more upset when

241
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:44,222
she finds out you left
here and fell in the river?

242
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:45,289
-Yeah.

243
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:47,022
Except I asked the
policeman who brought me

244
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:49,155
home not to tell her.

245
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,355
She goes out and works so
hard at her job every day.

246
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:56,089
I just don't want her to
have to worry about me.

247
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,789
And anyway, now that you're
here, I can have lots of fun

248
00:10:58,822 --> 00:10:59,622
inside.

249
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,022
I don't need to go out at all.

250
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:02,755
(THINKING) This kid
puts on a tough face,

251
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:03,822
but I'm not buying it.

252
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:04,922
She's lonely.

253
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,789
If she was OK with
her life, she wouldn't

254
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:08,855
have been out there trying
to find the place where

255
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,622
she was truly happy.

256
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:12,189
Hey!

257
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:13,355
I have an idea.

258
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:15,355
Let's visit your old home.

259
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:16,555
-Huh?

260
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,155
-You want to go, right?

261
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:19,489
-Yeah, but--

262
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:22,889
-Don't worry, I'll be
right there with you.

263
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:24,989
[gasp]

264
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:25,955
-Oh!

265
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,289
Thank you, Shintaro!

266
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:28,255
-Oh, boy.

267
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,503
Wow.

268
00:11:40,536 --> 00:11:44,103
What a huge house.

269
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,136
So you really lived
in this place?

270
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,403
-Uh-uh.

271
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:50,470
-It doesn't look like anybody's
living here right now.

272
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:52,270
-I don't know.

273
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:53,370
-Wait a minute.

274
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:54,870
Is this the first time
you've visited here

275
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:56,136
since you moved away?

276
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:56,636
-Mm.

277
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,036
-What's that vase doing here?

278
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,070
-We put it there after
Shintaro died, as a memorial.

279
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:12,470
-Sorry.

280
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:13,836
[gasp]

281
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,903
-Hey.

282
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:16,536
-What's wrong?

283
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,336
-There's danger.

284
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,303
We need to leave right now.

285
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:23,270
Huh?

286
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:27,203
(THINKING) There's
something evil here.

287
00:12:27,236 --> 00:12:29,270
-I'm scared.

288
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:30,736
[scream]

289
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:35,070
[scream]

290
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:35,570
-Miyuki!

291
00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:39,470
Let's go!

292
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:43,370
[scream]

293
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:43,936
-Damn.

294
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,336
We're cut off.

295
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,136
The only way to survive
is to get inside.

296
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:55,103
-Shintaro!

297
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:56,236
-Damn.

298
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,503
That thing was trying
to corner us in here.

299
00:12:58,536 --> 00:12:59,803
Huh?

300
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:01,070
Come on, let's get going.

301
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:06,336
-Shintaro, what's going on?

302
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,436
-It's a Hollow.

303
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,870
-A what?

304
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:11,003
-Trust me, it's an evil spirit.

305
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:12,403
This isn't good.

306
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:15,570
There have been a lot of Hollows
showing up in town recently.

307
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:18,136
I wonder if there's something
going on I don't know about?

308
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:21,936
[scream]

309
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,903
-Don't look back!

310
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:28,036
[scream]

311
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,936
-Oh, yeah?

312
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,203
Take that!

313
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:32,336
This is bad.

314
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,836
Let's hurry up and
get out of here.

315
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:43,336
So it's finally showing itself.

316
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,470
Oh no, there's two of them.

317
00:13:53,803 --> 00:13:55,770
Oh, it's just two-headed.

318
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:56,970
What am I thinking?

319
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,736
It's still bad news.

320
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,536
[growl]

321
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,103
-It doesn't plan on
letting us get past.

322
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:08,536
-Shintaro.

323
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,503
-Huh?

324
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:11,236
-What is that thing?

325
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,036
-Miyuki, you can
see that hollow?

326
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,370
-I don't know for sure.

327
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,536
It's kind of all blurry.

328
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,903
-She isn't able
to see it clearly,

329
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:24,803
but she can actually tell
that something's there.

330
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:33,836
[grunting]

331
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,336
-Run!

332
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:42,970
-Shintaro!

333
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:44,236
-It's gonna be all right.

334
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,403
(THINKING) What are we gonna do?

335
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:50,336
That gate's lock, and the
Hollow has us trapped.

336
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,436
I'm afraid the only
way we're getting out

337

342
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:04,270
This is getting really scary.

343
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,503
-Don't worry, Miyuki.

344
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:07,636
I will protect you.

(THINKING) Who's
going to protect me?

I don't even know if I
can fight in this body.

have a chance, run for it!

That was him.

Are you all right?

-I'm sorry, Miyuki.

I got you caught up

You're all messed
up from that fight.

-Miyuki?

Something really

-Huh?

-The one who came to save you
when the monster was going

404
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:39,303
to attack-- he was
the original Shintaro.

-Yeah.

407
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:46,870
He was really concerned
that you might get hurt.

408
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:48,670
I think this is it.

409
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,003
It's all over for me.

00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:51,503
-Huh?

411
00:18:51,536 --> 00:18:52,203
No!

412
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:54,503
I don't want you to go!

00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:55,870
-It can't be helped.

-It's not fair!

415
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,270
You can't go.

416
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,236
I need you.

417
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,170
You just started talking to me.

418
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,936
-No!

419
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,270
This is all wrong!

420
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:10,336
You've got to be strong and
stand on your own two feet.

421
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,003
It'll be fine.

422
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:14,036
Even if I can't talk,
I'll be watching over you

423
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,936
to make sure you're all right.

424
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,470
You need to get
out there and start

425
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:19,603
making yourself
some new friends.

426
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:21,870
-I don't need any new friends.

427
00:19:21,903 --> 00:19:23,836
I just need you, Shintaro.

428
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,803
-Stop saying that!

429
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,536
I understand.

430
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,870
-Huh?

431
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:35,970
-I know that deep inside,
you're very lonely.

432
00:19:36,003 --> 00:19:38,336
You had to move because
of your parents.

433
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,870
Your mommy is busy working,
so you try your best

434
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:44,570
not to cause her any trouble.

435
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:48,070
But that doesn't mean you
have to hide in a corner

436
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,503
the rest of your life.

437
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:55,236
I myself was a victim of
unfortunate circumstances.

438
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,636
They made me a modified soul.

439
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,170
And then, at someone
else's convenience,

440
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:02,270
they decided to destroy me.

441
00:20:02,303 --> 00:20:04,703
But I guess you wouldn't
know about that.

442
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,336
Anyway, things got
so bad I felt like I

443
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,536
didn't have any
control over my life.

444
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,403
But my friends saved me.

-You have friends?

446
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:14,470
-Of course.

447
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:17,370
I made some friends and
had some adventures.

448
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:19,836
Don't tell them, but
they're all so stupid,

449
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,070
they'd be helpless without me.

450
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:24,770
But that's what makes
them so amusing.

451
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:29,170
I discovered to have a friend,
you've got to be a friend.

452
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:31,236
I'm sure your Mommy would
agree with me, Miyuki.

-And believe me when I tell
you this, because it's true.

The original Shintaro and I
will always look after you.
