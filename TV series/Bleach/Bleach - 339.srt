1
00:01:52,097 --> 00:01:54,701
I'll have you out of
there in no time!

2
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:56,472
So far, so good...

3
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:58,409
Just a little
bit more...

4
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,117
Kon!

5
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:03,185
Huh?!

6
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:05,524
Ahhh!

7
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,665
[gasping]

8
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:13,807
Kon? Kon!

9
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,644
Kon!

10
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:24,763
What are you doing?!

11
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:32,813
[gasping]

12
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:36,420
No, stop it! Stop!

13
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:39,326
[grunting]

14
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:51,284
Kon...

15
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:03,543
[growling]

16
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:08,419
Hado Number Thirty-One!
Shakkaho!

17
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,590
[growling]

18
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:14,665
Get back!

19
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,602
[gasping]

20
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,408
Get back!

21
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:23,216
[growling]

22
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:25,320

[roaring]

24
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:36,878
What a pitiful creature.

25
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,426
Hmmm...

26
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:49,770
[gasping]

27
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,607
Tessai, have you heard
anything from Kisuke, yet?

28
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,678
No-No word from him yet.

29
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:56,250
The fact that we
haven't heard from
them isn't good.

30
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:58,221
Hmm.

31
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:01,461
If you're all so
worried-why not go
check it out?

32
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:04,935
Ikkaku! Have you
completely recovered?!

33
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:09,811
Ha! An injury as minor as
this doesn't even phase
me!

34
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:13,719
So c'mon, how about it,
Renji?

35
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,924
I don't know, man.

36
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,594
I say just go for it!

37
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:19,331
[gasping]

38
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:22,337
When we were
investigating earlier, we
were able to confirm
several captain-level

39
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,675
Spiritual Pressures
inside the Seireitei.

40
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:27,548
So my Brother and
the others are alive?

41
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:30,788
[gasping]

42
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:35,397
The Boss knew the
situation might change
and left us instructions
to be flexible in our

43
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:40,942
response. From what I
know-I'd say now is the
best time to attack.

44
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:41,977
Renji.

45
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:44,950
Right! Guess we're
going to the Soul
Society!

46
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:50,562
[growling]

47
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:59,079
The only thing that's
left for you, is
self-destruction.

48
00:04:59,313 --> 00:05:02,452
Well at least I won't
have to do it myself this
time.

49
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,624
[snarling]

50
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:06,327
[gasping]

51
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,308
Who is this guy? Is
he Nozomi? No, is this
Kageroza?

52
00:05:14,577 --> 00:05:17,550
[struggling]

53
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:24,598

[grunting]

57
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,006
Just between you and me,
fighting with brute force
really isn't my style.

58
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:51,553
Oh, I know. That's why
it makes even more sense
to engage you in a battle
that relies on brute force.

59
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:52,855
[grunting]

60
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:02,643
Unlike you who slacked
off during his training,
I didn't.

61
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:06,383
In fact, I used my time
here to make my skills
even sharper.

62
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:13,898
[yelling]

00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,112
[gasping]

00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:26,525
Bankai! Kokujo Tengen
Myo-oh!!

65
00:06:39,852 --> 00:06:42,958
[yelling]

66
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,069
Huh!

67
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,012
Ahhhhhhhh!

68
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,860
What do you think?

69
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:02,966
I'd say we have a
serious problem.

70
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:06,607
They act like they're
fighting us one-on-one,
but whenever they see an

71
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,078
opening, they're
attacking whoever they
can...

72
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:13,621
I know. That gives them
a strategic and numerical
advantage.

73
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:18,197
Yeah. We'd better start
changing that by taking
'em out one by one.

74
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:18,966
Huh?!

75
00:07:21,003 --> 00:07:23,909
[yelling]

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,088
[grunting]

77
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,134
Both of them are such
barbarians.

78
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:40,676
I'd like to see those
future guinea pigs left
in as pristine condition
as possible.

79
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,885
Well, well!... And
you're going to just
watch it all from your
lofty perch? How can a

80
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:48,125
person that's like you
be a captain of the
Thirteen Court Guard
Squads?

81
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:54,772
How amusing. A mod soul
with a sense of humor, just
like its original. I guess
you'd be perfect.

82
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:57,946
Oh? Perfect for
what, now?

83
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:04,058
I've decided that it would
be quite a pleasure to dissect
the Reigai of the irritating
Squad Four Captain.

84
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:06,763
Claw out!
Ashisogijizo!!

85
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:09,134

Heh.

90
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:30,077
That will never work on
me. Huh?!

91
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,081
What the hell?!

92
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:35,656

Impossible!...

I don't have any more

As I said... I am done
with wasting any more
time or energy by
spending it with you!

114
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,841
That Spiritual Pressure!

115
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,684
It appears that Kageroza
has at last achieved full
strength.

116
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:47,793
Well, finally. That's a
game-changing turn in
this battle.

117
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:50,766
Yes, victory is ours
now...

118
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,204
Bakudo Number Four,
Hainawa!!

119
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:58,682
Whoa! Gotta say, that's
a pretty sneaky move for
you.

120
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:02,690
Catching you off-guard
isn't going to be easy
if you can see it
coming.

121
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,730
In that case, I guess
I'll have to block your
view!

122
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,003
Bakudo Number
Thirty-Seven, Tsuriboshi.

You think that's
gonna stop me?

Ya missed me!

Firing bursts of

Bakudo Number Eighty-One,
Danku!

132
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:49,987
Didn't I tell you I'd
block your view?

00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:53,394
[gasping]

134
00:11:56,267 --> 00:12:00,809
You really thought I
wouldn't anticipate
what you'd try for your
next attack?

00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,767
I pity you.

138
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:17,377
Unable to return to being
a Soul Reaper, but also
unable to become a full
Hollow.

139
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:22,754
You're now the polar
opposite of the complete
being that I have
become.

140
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,324
Raiku.

Wait a sec, is that guy
supposed to be Kageroza?

151
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:57,358
Yeah, it looks like it.

152
00:12:57,392 --> 00:12:59,061
Where's Nozomi?

153
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,266
Damn it, guess we
got here too late!

154
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,208
Heh. So it's you
pests again.

155
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:12,088
You must know by now that
with my advanced powers,
even all of you combined
are no match for me.

156
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:14,527
So... why
are you here?

157
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,134
Why do you think?
We've come here to
rescue our friends.

158
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:19,203
Friends?

159

00:13:39,845 --> 00:13:41,248
No matter the
circumstances...

162
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:42,317
Yessir!

163
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,456
I do not need
help from others.

164
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:52,872
Other people only get in
the way.

165
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:57,080
To help... is
merely to pity.

166
00:13:59,452 --> 00:14:04,362
It is an act of jealousy
towards the strong. An
insult to a noble spirit.

167
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:12,011
To be alone is to be a
selected one. A privilege
reserved for a superior
soul.

168
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:17,522
Friends, you
say?....

169
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,125
Huh!

170
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,895
[laughing]

171
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:33,254
If your lives are of so little
value to you, that you'd
sacrifice yourself for someone
else without hesitation...

172
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:35,025
Then you will die here!

173
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:36,928
[gasping]

174
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:44,311
[grunting]

175
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:46,048
This ends now!!

176
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:49,387
What?!

177
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:56,234
Rangiku!

178
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:07,324
We've come here to
help you out, Captain.

179
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:12,134
No one here asked for
your help. Buuuuttt...

180
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:16,543
All these small fry are
making it too hard for me
to concentrate on my fight.

181
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:19,616
You guys handle
the cleanup.

182
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:22,188
Yes, sir!...With
pleasure!

183
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:30,037
[gasping]

184
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:30,739
[grunting]

185
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:36,083
Uryu!

186
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:40,259
His Zanpakuto takes
slices of space and
recreates them.

187
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:45,536
The last time we fought I
thought he was manipulating
time, but that's not what
he does.

188
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,377
He uses his Zanpakuto to
recreate a space that
didn't exist before.

189
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:53,686
Then he shifts his
location to that space in
an instant. Isn't that
right?

190
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,231
Oh? It seems I've
underestimated your
deductive skills,
Quincy.

191
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:03,439
As a reward, allow me to
show you my true power!

192
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,280
Oh, no you won't!
Roar! Zabimaru!

193
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:10,253
Seethe, Sumitsukigasa!

194
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:14,228
[screaming]

195
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:17,368
What was that?

196
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:19,272
You should be paying
attention!

197
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:22,512
Cry, Benihime!

198
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:25,050
[grunting]

199
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,292
This will end it!

200
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:33,635
Renji!!

201
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:35,572
[coughing]

202
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:37,609
[grunting]

203
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:38,711
[grunting]

204
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:42,185
I've got him!

205
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:45,325
[grunting]

206
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:48,565
What the--?!

207
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:51,070
Heh. Sumitsukigasa!

208
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:57,249
[yelling]

209
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,619
[screaming]

210
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:04,464
[groaning]

211
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:06,735
W-What just happened?

212
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:11,746
You just experienced the
true power of my
Zanpakuto, Sumitsukigasa.

213
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:13,482
True power?

214
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:19,662
Duplicating an
adversary's attack and
reproducing it exactly,
is the power of Raiku.

215
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:24,739
And Nozomi's
Arazomeshigure allowed
her to absorb an
adversary's Spirit

216
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,745
Energy and convert it
into her own power.

217
00:17:28,246 --> 00:17:32,756
But Sumitsukigasa
possesses the power of
both of them.

218
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:36,630
Raiku came with the risk
of being vulnerable when
reproducing an

219
00:17:36,664 --> 00:17:41,373
adversary's attack, as
well as consuming a great
deal of my Spirit
Energy.

220
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:46,784
But now that I possess
the power of
Arazomeshigure, my
problem is solved. Now I

221
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:51,126
am able to absorb any
attack and continue to
counterattack
indefinitely.

222
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,366
That's absurd. Can
that even be done?

223
00:17:54,366 --> 00:18:01,214
I assure you it can be
done. In my present fused
state, I am both Kageroza
Inaba and Nozomi Kujo.

224
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:05,589
It's only natural that
I have access to her
Zanpakuto power.

225
00:18:05,622 --> 00:18:07,460
Nozomi.

226
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:15,209
I don't care what you
possess-I'll crush that
power of yours right now!

227
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:16,812
Renji, don't do it!

228
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:24,528
Bankai! Hihio
Zabimaru!!

229
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,699
What a fool.

230
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:30,473
[yelling]

231
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,781
Sumitsukigasa.

232
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:37,688
[yelling]

233
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:39,425
Renji!!

234
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:46,606
If we attack him like
Renji did, the force will
be absorbed and directed
back at us. So what can we do?

235
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:53,320
Okay, since that's the
case... We have to mount
an attack that he can't
absorb.

236
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:57,930
[grunting]
Huh?

237
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:06,280
Tetsuzaemon! Don't get
distracted by other opponents.
Concentrate only on the
opponent that you are fighting!

238
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:07,850
I'll do that sir!

239
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:18,639
Those damn Reigai.

240
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:21,812
They've turned this
into a brawl, attacking
at random and effectively

241
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:25,486
exploiting our unguarded
positions.

242
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:30,831
The pride of the
Originals, who prefer
fighting one-on-one, isn't
working to our advantage.

243
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:33,335
I'd say at this
rate--

244
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:35,540
Heh.

245
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,408
Damn it!

246
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,480
Licht Regen!

247
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,851
Tsuginomai, Hakuren!

248
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,231
Hihio Zabimaru!!

249
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,239
Your efforts are in vain!

250
00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:02,027
I will eliminate you one
by one so that you won't
be able to coordinate
your attacks.

251
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:03,364
[grunting]

252
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:05,635
Now Rukia, do it!!

253
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:06,904
Hakuren!!

254
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,580
Don't mess with me!

255
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,919
What?!

256
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:18,428
Ahh!

257
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:20,366
[grunting]

258
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:22,970

259
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:26,544
Too slow!

260
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:31,956
[yelling]

261
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,398

[screaming]

265
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:50,560
Now that I am one with
Nozomi, my power is far
beyond all of yours.

266
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:53,901
Your clumsy attempts at
trickery will have no
effect.

267
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,439
Hm!?

268
00:20:56,439 --> 00:21:02,017
I see So you were after
Nozomi just to get this
power.

269
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,927
Yes. This is the full,
original power that my
Zanpakuto possessed.

270
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,871
But my original frail
body was too weak to
wield it at its full
strength.

271
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:16,681
That was always my true
objective for becoming a
Reigai.

272
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:20,555
It was the only
way to be able to fully
control this Zanpakuto.

273
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:26,501
I expect you're now
planning to use your
newly acquired power to
rule the Soul Society.

274
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:31,477
Rule? Heh. How could you
possibly think that's what
I really want?

275
00:21:31,477 --> 00:21:33,114
[gasping]
It's not?!

276
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,991
My objective is to
destroy the Soul Society.

277
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:45,339
Iro Oni. White!

278
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:52,487
That is why... Time is of
the essence...

279
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:54,624
[grunting]

280
00:21:57,765 --> 00:21:58,900
Now die.

281
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:01,706
[gasping]

282
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,983
Ichigo!!!!

283
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:51,583
Captain! If you keep on
using your Bankai, our
squad's repair budget
will run out!

284
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:53,685
Don't let it bother
you, Tetsuzaemon.

285
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:58,924
But your Bankai draws the
most attention! That's the
reason the other squads are
going to blame everything on us!

286
00:23:58,957 --> 00:24:00,559
You mean, all of this?!

287
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:01,527
Yes, sir.
