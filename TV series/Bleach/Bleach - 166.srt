NARRATOR: After his defeat
at the hands of Ulquiorra,

3
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:54,882
Ichigo was left clinging to
life with critical injuries.

00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,482
Then Grimmjow
arrived with Orihime.

-Now, heel.

00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:25,248
NARRATOR: Orihime used
her powers to heal Ichigo,

9
00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:27,915
leveling the playing field
for his battle with Grimmjow.

10
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:38,015
-All right, bring it on.

11
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:40,015
Now let's have a fair
fight to the death.

12
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:46,415
That's not good enough!

13
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:47,882
You're not at the
level yet where

14
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:50,315
I want this battle
to take place.

This is the ultimate Cero,
which only the Espada can use!

ICHIGO: Orihime.

Hold on!

telling you not

to worry when I look like this.

28

But I'll tell you anyway.

29

There's nothing to worry about.

00:04:39,715 --> 00:04:40,882
I'll finish this quickly.

Now we can get down to business!

your Santen Kessun

36

to protect you and Nelliel
until this is over.

No matter what happens,
don't take it down.

Do it now!

-[gasp] Yes.

Of course, Ichigo.

GRIMMJOW: What's wrong with you?

49
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:07,915
You can do better than that!

50
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:09,615
Come out and fight.

GRIMMJOW: [laughter].

00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:24,915
Yeah, Ichigo.

54
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:26,648
That's what I'm talking about!

55
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:29,882
Those eyes-- I hate
those damn eyes.

00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,648
And that's why you gotta die!

He's distorted the atmosphere.

MILA ROSE: A Gran Rey Cero.

60
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,282
You'd think he'd know
better than to use something

00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:47,548
that powerful within the
confines of Las Noches.

62
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,515
APPACCI: Ha!

63
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:52,648
Hey, what's the deal?

64
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,615
Are you scared, Mila Rose?

65
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:55,648
-Not me.

66
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:57,282
But I'm surprised
you can hear anything

67
00:07:57,315 --> 00:08:00,248
with your teeth chattering so
loudly, Appaci, you coward.

68
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:01,782
-What did you say?

69
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,815
-You heard me.

-Would you please stop
bickering, both of you?

72
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:09,615
When you raise your
voices like that,

73
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:11,148
it only makes you look weak.

74

--[together] Stay out
of this Sung-Sun.

very unattractive.

-What does Grimmjow
think he's doing.

81
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,348
This is starting
to get out of hand.

-Hm.

HARRIBEL: Try to relax.

84
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:39,982
This battle is being fought by
an Espada in his Resurreccion

85
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:41,182
from.

86
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,182
Your fear is understandable.

87
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:46,648
[gasping]

88
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:53,415
-But it is primordial fear.

89
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:56,882
Relish it.

90
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:58,382
-Yes.

91
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:03,848
-The question is, is the person
he's fighting really human?

92
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:07,515
It's hard to believe that any
human could possess spirit

93
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:11,315
energy as dense and
darkly powerful as his.

94
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:16,982
It's almost as if I'm watching
a battle between two Espada.

95
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:27,215
-I'm going to take you
down, Ichigo Kurosaki.

96
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:36,848
I see you've increased
the amount of time

97
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:39,848
you can sustain that
mask since we last met.

98
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:41,982
Have you been
training since then?

99
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,815
Or have you just been
ignorantly gaining

100
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:45,348
experience in the
battles you've had

101
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:47,948
since the last time we fought?

102
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:48,982
It doesn't matter.

103
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:50,748
In fact, I'm glad.

104
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:53,682
It wouldn't be any fun if
your mask cracked too quickly,

105
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:57,448
like it did last time!

106
00:09:57,482 --> 00:10:01,582
-So, you're worried about
this fight being boring?

107
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:04,482
I'll spice it up for you, then.

108
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:13,482
You know what I think
would be really boring?

109
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:15,982
If you weren't in
your release state.

110
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,282
So do me a favor, and
stay just the way you are.

That was quite impressive.

Was saving your
friends worth the pain?

What's wrong?

less time running your mouth,

You can drop the tough guy act.

I hit you with five of
those attacks already.

142
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:36,805
Your body has taken
significant damage.

143
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:45,905
You're mask must
be at its limit.

144

ICHIGO: It's limit?

145
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:48,705
Not even close!

But that's the way I like it.

-Hate to break it
to you, but you're

149
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:03,305
looking kind of
banged up yourself.

No.

they're not Ichigo's at all.

It's like they belong
to someone else.

And when Ichigo looks
at me with those eyes,

161
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:56,538
it's like he
doesn't even see me.

00:16:49,838 --> 00:16:51,771
is still defeating him.

168
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:54,271
And his fight with
Master Dordoni.

169
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:10,171
And against Master Ulquiorra.

170
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,705
Whenever Ichigo put
on his mask, there

171
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:24,071
was never any doubt that
he was going to win.

172
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:27,138
When Ichigo was
masked, there was

173
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,771
no one would could beat him.

174
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:30,771
But now--

175
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:38,605
[fighting noises]

176
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,271
-What's happening to Ichigo?

177
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:50,271
How could he be
losing like this?

178
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:02,171
[whimper] Hey!

179
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:05,171
You can do it, Ichigo!

180
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:06,171
Come on!

181
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,605
I know you can!

182
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:10,605
Well, what are you just
standing there for?

183
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:12,571
You need to cheer him on too!

184
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:13,371
-Huh?

185
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:14,738
-That's the best you can do?

186
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:17,305
He's out there risking his life
for you, and all you can say

187
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:18,138
is huh?

188
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:19,538
Why are you so afraid of him?

189
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:23,538
You think he's some
kind of monster?

190
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:25,505
You know that he
has a kind heart!

191
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,505
You said so yourself.

192
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,505
It's as plain as day.

193
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:31,305
Even Nell can see it!

194
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:34,105
And Ichigo cares
about you, too. he

195
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:35,905
cares so much that when
he heard your name,

196
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:39,505
he attacked Master Ulquiorra
with everything he had!

197
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:41,938
I know he's a Soul Reaper now.

198
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,438
But don't forget,
Ichigo's still human.

199
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:46,405
Think about what
he's gone through.

200
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:49,405
Every time he uses that
mask, he exposes himself

201
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:50,871
to its insane power.

202
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:52,371
He has to be suffering!

203
00:18:52,405 --> 00:18:56,338
But he's doing it for
you, so he doesn't care.

204
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:58,571
He uses the power and
endures all the pain

205
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,305
and suffering for you!

206
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:04,438
How will he feel-- how will
he feel when he doesn't even

207
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:06,105
hear your voice cheering him on?

208
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:18,338
[fighting noises]

209
00:19:21,838 --> 00:19:23,271
-[gasp]

210
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:29,138
ORIHIME (VOICEOVER):
That's right.

211
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:32,238
The whole reason I
came here was because I

212
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,638
wanted to protect everyone.

213
00:19:36,438 --> 00:19:40,305
I thought I was ready to
make whatever sacrifice.

214
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:44,205
But then, when I heard
that Ichigo and the others

215
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:47,571
had come to save me,
somewhere deep in my heart,

216
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:50,738
I felt such happiness.

217
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:54,038
Then I saw Ichigo
wearing a mask.

218
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:58,605
And his eyes, they looked like
my brother's eyes that night.

219
00:19:58,638 --> 00:20:00,705
I was so scared.

220
00:20:00,738 --> 00:20:07,171
I thought that maybe he didn't
come to save me after all.

221
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,538
I was wrong.

222
00:20:08,571 --> 00:20:13,105
All of my fears,
they mean nothing.

223
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:17,638
None of that matters anymore.

224
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:25,305
I-- I'm not afraid of Ichigo.

225
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:29,738
I-- I'm only afraid
that Ichigo will--

226
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,405
-It looks like you
were wrong again.

227
00:20:41,438 --> 00:20:42,538
You've reached your limit.

228
00:20:55,205 --> 00:20:58,605
It was fun, but now it's over.

229
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:07,571
-Please don't die.

230
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:10,071
Don't die, Ichigo!

231
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:22,838
You don't have to
win, and you don't

232
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:26,271
have to fight for me,
just don't get hurt.

233
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:28,705
I couldn't bear it.

234
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:34,638
-Kurosaki!

235
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:47,971
-So Grimmjow, here's the deal.

236
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:51,071
You see, I've had
a change of heart.

237
00:21:51,105 --> 00:21:54,738
And I can't allow myself to
get beaten by someone like you.

238
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,205

240
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,661
GRIMMJOW: I hate
it, the way he looks

241
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,694
at me with those
condescending eyes.

242
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:54,661
Damn.

243
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:56,528
He makes me sick.

244
00:23:56,561 --> 00:24:00,861
You bastards, I'll
slaughter all of you!
