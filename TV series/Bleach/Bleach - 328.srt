1
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:23,622

00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:52,688
<i>Apparently, this is the place.</i>

4
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:07,188
Kenpachi?

5
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,088
Hey.

6
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:14,222
Looks like we're the
only two left to
carry on this fight.

7
00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:17,322
<i>That's not bad,</i>
<i>all things</i>
<i>considered.</i>

8
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:22,222
We don't know if the
others were defeated yet.
We may still have help.

<i>[Kageroza]</i>
<i>He he he he he!</i>

[chuckles]

11
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:38,388
There you are.
What's so damn funny?

12
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:40,988
We've wiped out most
of your invading army.

13
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,455
And now that we've
tracked you down,

14
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,455
we're gonna crush your
invasion plans for good!

15
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:50,188
But first, Kageroza Inaba,
We need answers.

16
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,688
Just exactly who in
the hell are you?!

17
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:59,222
Heh! He doesn't want
to answer that.

18
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:02,288
Well, it doesn't really matter,
one way or the other.

19
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:04,722
There's only one thing
that matters to me.

20
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:07,988
Are you strong enough
to fight me, or not?!

21
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:13,022
[chuckles] Well,
how disappointing.

22
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,988
After all you've gone through,
you still don't realize.

23
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:19,355
You don't have any
chance of victory.

24
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,355
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>What's the situation?</i>

25
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:31,255
I'm scanning everywhere,
but I still can't get a
reading on Ichigo.

26
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:33,388
Give us the bottom line.
Does that mean he's dead?

27
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:36,822
I'm afraid I just
can't tell you for
sure, at this point.

28
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:45,855
Come on, you guys!
You know he's okay!

29
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:48,122
That bastard, Ichigo,
wouldn't die on us!

30
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,755
He's too
tricky for that!

31
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:53,022
He'll probably just show up
here, and have no explanation
for where he's been!

32
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:54,122
You know what I mean? Eh?

33
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:55,822
It's okay,
take it easy.

34
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:56,755
What?!

35
00:04:57,288 --> 00:04:59,622
Yeah, it's written all
over your face, pal.

36
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:01,655
You're more worried than
anybody else in the room!

37
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:04,655
Shut up! Who says I'm
worried about Ichigo?

38
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:07,088
Well I'm not, so
get out of my face!

39
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:08,055
Dahg!

40
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:13,155
<i>Ichigo makes it to the Soul</i>
<i>Society, then disappears</i>
<i>into the Precipice World?</i>
<i>[Renji & Kon fighting]</i>

41
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,822
<i>This has got to be</i>
<i>Kageroza's doing!</i>

42
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:19,822
<i>But how?</i>

43
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:23,555
<i>Despite all our interactions</i>
<i>and confrontations, we know</i>
<i>very little about Kageroza.</i>

44
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:25,888
<i>With the exception</i>
<i>of Nozomi.</i>

45
00:05:28,255 --> 00:05:31,655

<i>have better insight into how</i>
<i>Kageroza thinks.</i>

46
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:40,955
Once I return and I
have retrieved Nozomi,

<i>What in the world did</i>
<i>Kageroza mean by that?</i>

49

52
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:15,155
What's going on with this guy?
I don't sense any Spirit Energy
at all from his Shikai!

53
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:19,188
<i>Until the moment when we</i>
<i>actually cross swords,</i>

<i>exactly how strong he is!</i>

55
00:06:23,455 --> 00:06:27,422
I don't know how you're
hiding your Spirit
Energy, Kageroza.

56
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,122
But try your best to
make this fun for me!

57
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:33,055
Hold it, Kenpachi!

58
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:35,388
Rgh!
He's so impetuous!

59
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:41,088
Hyoryusenbi!

60
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,488
Sorry, Kenpachi, but
I'm not gonna let
you do this alone.

61
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:53,188
Whatever. But if
I kill him first,
we're done here!

62
00:06:53,855 --> 00:06:54,888
Hyaaah!

63
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:56,788
Raagh!

64
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,488
What's the matter,
scientist?

65
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:02,788
Don't tell me you showed up
here just so we could kill you!

66
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,988
<i>That would be</i>

68
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:26,788

71
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:43,355
What? Is this the
Precipice World?

72
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:45,488
Ah!

73
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:48,155

74
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,955
I'm...passing out.

75
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:04,888
[gasp]

76
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:14,455
Who are you?

77
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:33,022
Hey, Mr. Scientist.

78
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,988
I have to say, it was pretty
daring of you to confront
the two of us by yourself,

79
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:38,788
but I don't think you've
got what it takes!

80
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:46,422
You're not letting me
have any fun, are ya?

81
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:50,055
[Kenpachi]
I don't know if this is supposed
to be your true strength,

82
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:53,488
but if this is all you've
got and you aren't gonna
take me seriously,

83
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:56,022
I guess I'll have to
kill you right now
and be done with it!

84
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:57,755
Kenpachi, wait!

85
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,088
<i>[Toshiro]</i>
<i>He's planning to trap you!</i>

86
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:04,188
[gasp]

87
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:08,422
Guncho Tsurara!

88
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:21,722
I see. You were evading
us, in order to use that
technique of yours.

89
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:27,488
I almost forgot that
you're a specialist on
the Precipice World.

90
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:30,522
You create portals where
they shouldn't exist,

91
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:34,522
and seal your opponents
into the Precipice
World that lies beyond.

92
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:38,155
Obviously, that's the
power of your Zanpakuto.

93
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:40,055
You're able to
manipulate space.

94
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:44,522
Here I thought you possessed
some awesome power, but it
turns out to be a cheap trick!

95
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:46,388
How
boring is that?

96
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,022
Now that we've been alerted
to your sneak attack,
that technique won't
work on us again!

97
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:55,755
He he he he he!

98
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:58,422
Hrraahh!

99
00:09:59,188 --> 00:10:00,588
You're so predictable!

100
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:03,222
He was the decoy?

101
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:04,688
Huh?

102
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:06,955
Hyoryu...senbi!

103
00:10:10,122 --> 00:10:12,322
Apparently, you do
have some skills!

104
00:10:13,122 --> 00:10:14,088
Hyaah!

105
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:18,888
He he he! I could say
the same about you,
Captain Hitsugaya!

106
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:21,155
And what is that
supposed to mean?

107
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:25,088
You apparently thought I
would make the Precipice
World appear again.

108
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:28,522
So you switched your
tactics instantly,

109
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:31,255
...to a long-range attack.

110
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:35,155
[panting]

111
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:36,955
Do you mean that
as a compliment?

112
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:39,422
Or are you just
making fun of me?

113
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:44,322
Heh heh heh! I guess
you'll have to figure that
one out for yourself.

114
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:47,155
Yes. I manipulate space.

115
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,355
And as you said,

116
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:51,655
that is the extent of my
Zanpakuto's capabilities.

117
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:55,555
But that, my friend, is
a very powerful weapon.

118
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,588
No matter how much you change
your attacks, they mean nothing
if they cannot reach me.

119
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:03,055
Yes, I suppose not.

120
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:06,655
Guncho Tsurara!

121
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:11,122
[gasp]

122
00:11:11,155 --> 00:11:12,422
Yaaahh!

123
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:17,022
Where did you get the idea we
wouldn't be able to reach you?!

124
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:19,455
[Toshiro]
Hyaaaa!

125
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:23,322
It was all about setting
everything up for this
one last strike!

126
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:31,227
Yaaah!

127
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:35,361
Ha-HAH!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

128
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:37,894
[Toshiro]
Hyaaaa!

129
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:41,661
It was all about setting
everything up for this
one last strike!

130
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:42,961
Heh heh heh!

131
00:11:45,061 --> 00:11:46,994
What a coincidence!

132
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:49,361
I was setting you up, as well.

133
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:50,694
For this!

134
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:54,861
What?!

135
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:56,661
Eagh!

136
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:01,227
What just... happened?

137
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:04,294
That was definitely
my Guncho Tsurara,

138
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:05,561
but that's
impossible!

139
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:07,794
Space manipulation.

140
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,161
That was how you described
my powers, wasn't it?

141
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:15,527
Well, you were certainly
correct, but you made
one grievous error.

142
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:22,627
My abilities are not limited
to simply manipulating one
small dimension such as the
Precipice World.

143
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:28,361
It would be more accurate to say
that I can manipulate all space.

144
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,194
What?

145
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:32,461
My Zanpakuto actually
affects space itself.

146
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:34,727
It records it and
re-creates it.

147
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:38,527
When you two captains were
attacking me earlier,

148
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,027
I used it to re-create
the Precipice World,

149
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,594
in an attempt to trap
and neutralize you.

150
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:46,661
But as I watched the details
and patterns of your attacks,

151
00:12:46,694 --> 00:12:49,161
I also had it
record a new space.

152
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:52,094
So do you understand
my power now?

153

<i>[shattering]</i>

154
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,027
Huh?

155
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:58,927
<i>[Kenpachi]</i>
<i>Heh! No, I don't. It still</i>
<i>sounds like a silly trick!</i>

156
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:02,494
<i>And if you can't fight without</i>
<i>resorting to cheap tricks,</i>

157
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:04,627
then I have no
more use for you!

158
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:08,694
You're an eyesore!
And I'll put you out
of your misery!

159
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:09,761
Ha!

160
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,994
Quit screwin' around, bastard!

161
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:22,661
Huuh??

162
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:27,661
What the hell?

163
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:31,827
Careful, Captain.
You ended up
attacking yourself.

164
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:34,894
[chuckle]

165
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:41,561
So, you can even re-create
a Zanpakuto attack?

166
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:43,427
What will you do now?

167
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:47,894
It's useless!

168
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:51,994
Hyaaah!

169
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:59,027
Heh heh!

170
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:03,727
I can see now how your
Zanpakuto actually works!

171
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:07,727
<i>You spin it to the right when</i>
<i>you want to record space.</i>

172
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:11,227
<i>And you spin it to the</i>
<i>left to re-create space.</i>

173
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:16,727
If I prevent you from spinning
it to the right to record,
you're powerless!

174
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:18,327
It's all over!

175
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:21,261
Heh-heh!

176
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:25,094
Hngh!

177
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:35,561
I can re-create the last
recorded space, not once,

178
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:39,461
But as many times as I
need to, for strategic
advantage.

179
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:41,494

Heh heh heh!

182
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:48,794
Huh?

183
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,727
So this is where
you've been hiding!

184
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:02,061
Hm! Well, well, if it
isn't Captain Soi Fon!

185
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:05,727
Truthfully, I never
thought you'd make it
out of that barrier.

186
00:15:06,194 --> 00:15:11,061
Ugh! I have to give you credit,
you bastard, for deciding to
seal me in there, first!

187
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:16,627
Naturally. With you out of the
way, I would have free reign
over the Punishment Force.

188
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:18,627
<i>[Yoruichi]</i>
<i>You certainly went through</i>

189
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:22,027
[Kageroza]
Yoruichi Shihoin.

190
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,994
Kageroza Inaba,
we finally meet.

191
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:29,161
It's about time you
showed yourself.

192
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,894
I was beginning
to worry.

193
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:33,927
I searched everywhere,
but I just couldn't
seem to find you.

194
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:35,527
<i>Now I know why.</i>

195
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:40,327
Believe me, it was hard work,
rescuing Soi Fon and the others,
without you realizing it.

196
00:15:40,861 --> 00:15:43,627
I apologize for putting you
through all that trouble.

197
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:50,761
But I'm afraid it had to
be done, in order to make
sure everything was
brought under my control.

198
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:54,861
Oh please, you truly
believe you have the power
for such an accomplishment?

199
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:56,561
You're a very silly man.

200
00:15:57,227 --> 00:16:00,294
Do you presume that such a
thing is beyond my capability?

201
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,027
Am I wrong?

202
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:04,927
Hrrrghh.

203
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:10,661
Don't underestimate my power,
Yoruichi Shihoin!

204
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:14,494
There are others who have
made the same mistake,

205
00:16:14,527 --> 00:16:17,127
But they're no longer
around to oppose me!

206
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:21,527
In that case, it would be a big
mistake to underestimate your
adversaries!

207
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:22,727
Eh?

208
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:23,561
Huh??

209
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:26,594
[chuckle]

210
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,427
I don't believe it.

211
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,127
Byakuya! You're alive!

212
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:42,627
<i>[Byakuya]</i>
<i>Yet you still won't give up.</i>

213
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:46,461
There's only one head
of the Kuchiki Clan.

214
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:47,827
There can't be two.

215

Bankai.
Senbonzakura
Kageyoshi.

218
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:24,027
I have been a witness to
the pride exhibited by you
and all the other Reigai.

219
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:29,827
As I said, there can
only be one head of
the Kuchiki Clan.

220
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:52,294
We, the Thirteen Court Guard
Squads, will uphold our duty and
honor, to destroy your
ambitions.

221
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:55,194
Prepare yourself.

222
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:58,061
[Soi Fon]
There is no way for
you to escape!

223
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,827
[Toshiro]
This is the
end, Kageroza.

<i>What's so funny?</i>

226
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:11,594

<i>The idea that you think you</i>

I commend you originals
for fighting so well
against my Reigai army.

228
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:21,561
You all did better than I
originally anticipated.

229
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:24,361
But regardless, it won't
be enough to defeat me.

230
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:27,261
Your madness is going
to end here and now!

231

In numbers alone, we're equal...
