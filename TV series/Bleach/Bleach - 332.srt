Damn it!
[heavy breaths]

4
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:08,764
Heh. I did
enjoy that
a bit.

5
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:11,436
But now...
it's over!

6
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:14,175
(Nozomi)
Stop!
[gasp]

7
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:23,795
Huh? Well well,
did you come all
this way just to
be captured?

8
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:25,832
In your dreams,
Reigai!

(Izuru)
Shuhei!

14
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:07,416
Hey!

15
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:11,325
It's funny meeting
you two lieutenants
up here in the
clouds...

16
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,897
Whaddya say
we have some
fun?

[gasp]
Reap!
Kazeshini!

Raise your

Wabisuke!

00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:24,251
Hiya!

[battle grunts]

21
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,198
I see you decided
to go full force
right from the
start!

22
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:32,602
There's no
other way!

23
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:35,308
I won't hold
back against
a Captain!

24
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:35,942
Haha!

What's going on
here? He's stronger
than the original!

31
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:56,617
So that's what
Nanao meant by
their powers being
unrestricted!

[leaping grunt]

33
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:02,831
You two should
really be fighting,
not talking!

00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:03,631
[nervous gasp]

35

[nervous gasp]

36
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:13,386
Hmpf! So you
insects are
my opponents?

37
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,861
What a
disappointment!

00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:35,297
Hey Nozomi!
Are you OK!?

41
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,537
Don't worry,
I'm all right.

42
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,376
Well you sure
don't seem like
it to me!

43
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,348
Ugh shut up!
I just got a
little dizzy
for a second!

44
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:45,752
Yeah right.

45
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,457
But I saw
what you did
with that
Zanpakuto--

46
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,962
--Can you tell
me a little
more about
it's ability?

47
00:04:50,962 --> 00:04:53,334
First it
absorbs the
opponent's
power...

48
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:57,609
...then it converts
it into my energy, and
redirects it back
to the opponent.

49
00:04:57,642 --> 00:05:01,784
...That's the
power of my
Zanpakuto,
Arazomeshigure.

50
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,654
(Yumichika)
That's one
nasty power...

51
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:04,690
Huh?
Hm?

52
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,429
It's like
having to
fight off your
own attack,

53
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:12,339
Ikkaku...
We'll take
it from here.

54
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:14,544
[gasp]

55
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,997
[nasty chuckle]
Not bad, woman!
You're starting to
make this interesting!

56
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,771
Let me see you
pull off that
little stunt of
yours again, huh?

57
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:31,913
Sorry, she's not
going to be your
opponent this
time around...

58
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:33,348
[gasp]

59
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:35,820
I'm the one who
will make you pay
for what you did
to Ikkaku.

60
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:39,528
While I'm
fighting, please
take care of
him.

61
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:42,467
Wait! Yumichika!

62
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,973

[battle grunts]

64
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:50,651
Ha! I have to
say, you're
not much of a
challenge...

65
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,022
You should come
at me like you
really mean it.

66
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:55,026
I absolutely
agree!

67
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:57,130
I won't bore
you any
further, Captain.

68
00:05:57,365 --> 00:06:00,371
Now bloom...

[attack yell]

70
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,630
Nozomi, we can't
stay here. We have
to get Ikkaku to
safety!

71
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:17,038
Ichigo...

72
00:06:17,071 --> 00:06:18,708
Huh?

73
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:22,549
I'm going to
go help the
others.

74
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,420
Nozomi!

75
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:27,927
Now smash 'em!
Gegetsuburi!

76
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:31,568
What a filthy
weapon.

77
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:34,875
Huh?

78
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,753
And it's being
used by such a
filthy warrior.

79

00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:49,672
Please don't kill
me! I beg you! I'll
pay you anything
you want!

82
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:55,918
Trying to buy your
way to salvation
is something a
vulgar person does.

00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:57,020

I'll disinfect

I get back.
Hm?

I'm here to

you!

00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:37,235
Easy, kid!
It's our job
to take on
the Captains.

95
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,910
He's right. We
need you to look
after the
wounded, Nozomi.

I wanted

these guys are trying

161
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:02,746
Damn it, he's
more powerful
than we had
thought.

162
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:04,817
Rukia! Renji!

163
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,887
(Kenpachi)
Hey, Ichigo...

164
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:09,393
Pay attention
here, I'm
your opponent.

165
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:14,303
After I finish with
you I need to pay back
that girl for what
she did to me earlier.

166
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:17,743
[gasp]

167
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:20,248
(Toshiro)
[attack shouts]

[grunt]
[gasp]

169
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:27,162
What's happening,
folks? Still playing
around down there?

170
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:30,236
How about I
come and
join you?

171
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:32,106

[frightened gasp]

174
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:45,934
Get outta here.
These guys are
my prey.

175
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,015
[gasp]

176
00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:56,957
I have no real
interest in
fighting these
filthy beings.

177
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:06,944
I just
wanna help.

178
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:12,856
[gasp in pain]

179
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:15,228
(Toshiro)
You're still
able to move?

180
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:20,238
Let me fix
that for you.

181
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,310
Nozomi!

182
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,112
[gasp]

183
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:26,383
(Nozomi)
No more...

184
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,989
I won't put
up with it!

185
00:13:29,022 --> 00:13:38,008
If you're so
upset, allow me
to put you out
of your misery!

186
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:52,571
[screeching]

187
00:13:58,482 --> 00:13:59,284
[confused gasp]

188
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,622
Time for
your misery!

189
00:14:01,856 --> 00:14:07,868
Here we go!
Now rain
down...
Arazomeshigure!

190
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,433
Damn it..!
Ughhh...

191
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,014
What the hell
was that
incredible power!?

192
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:34,490
That was the
power of that
girl's Shikai!

193
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:40,168
As I said, it's
like having to
fight off your
own attack!

194
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,306
Good thing
she's on our
side!

195
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:47,550
(Kenpachi)
Interesting...

196
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,451
[gasp]

197
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:52,225
Your power
seems to have
gotten stronger.

198
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:56,101
I believe I'll
enjoy it even
more the second
time around.

199
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:57,970
(Byakuya)
Hold it.
Huh?

200
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:00,343
That confrontation
will have to wait.

201
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:03,449
First up we have
to get rid of the
other Soul Reapers.

202
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,589
Don't forget that's
what we promised
Kageroza.

203
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:10,029
[grunt]
All right then
let's finish
this quickly!

204
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:11,599
[fighting grunts]

205
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:15,139
Damn it!
Time to roar!
Zabimaru!

206
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:18,213
Tsuginomai...
Hakuren!!

207
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:25,695
Your crude attacks
will have no effect
against me.

208
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:28,500
My brother would
never say things
like that!

209

[landing grunt]

219
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:05,542
We can learn from
our mistakes. If her
Zanpakto uses her
opponent's power...

220
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:10,018
...then we simply
have to fight in a
manner that won't
let her do that.

221
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,624
(Kenpachi)
Pay attention,
Ichigo!

You asked
for it!

Damn...

228
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,422
Not even
close!

229
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,592
Ichigo!

230
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:32,598
I think it's
time for you
to die!

231
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:35,136
El Directo!

232
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:38,075
Heh!

233
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:42,251
Ichigo, you're
losing your
spirit energy,
[dodging grunt]

234
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:44,289
Damn you!

[attack growl]

236
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,735
Ichigo!
Nozomi,
you OK?

237
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:54,577
She's OK, what
about you, Ichigo
you're as pale
as a ghost!

238
00:16:54,577 --> 00:16:56,246
I'll be fine!

239
00:16:56,714 --> 00:16:58,718
Ichigo...

[painful grunt]

243
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:11,110
I shall finish
you first.

244
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:14,283
I don't
think so!

245
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:17,590
[attack yell]

246
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,826
Watch out!

247
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,504
Thanks, Nozomi.

248
00:17:24,537 --> 00:17:26,241
Sorry.

249
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:30,516
Don't worry
that was nothing.
I am able to
absorb a lot more.

250
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:33,556
Hm.

251
00:17:34,492 --> 00:17:37,731
Hey! What's that
look supposed to
mean!? What are
you thinking about!?

252
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,802
(Byakuya)
[chuckle]
[frightened shouts]

253
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:45,447
Still refuse
to admit defeat?
...Hm?

254
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,221
You peasants
never learn,
do you?

255
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:51,225
Why don't you
shut your mouth?!

256
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:53,430
Pathetic.
[blasted away grunts]

257
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:58,374
Hold on, Nozomi's
powers can absorb the
Spirit Energy of a
Zanpakto...

258
00:17:58,407 --> 00:18:04,119
...but they can
also absorb Kido and
my Ginreikojaku as well,
isn't that right?

259
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:08,427
Correct. I
can absorb
anything made of
Spirit Energy.

260
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:18,782
[fighting grunts]

261
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:21,921
What? You can't
be serious! It's
too dangerous!

262
00:18:22,156 --> 00:18:23,792
(Nozomi)
No, let's
do it.

263
00:18:24,393 --> 00:18:25,429
What!?

264
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,237
I'll do this
if it means
saving everyone.

265
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,543
I'm not concerned
about my safety,
and don't worry...

266
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:35,550
...I am now
in full
control of
Arazomeshigure.

267
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,153
I'll be fine.

268
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,790
But still...

269
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:41,595
(Uryu)
Ichigo... it's the
only way we can
win this fight.

270
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:43,866
We have to
rely on Nozomi.

271
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:50,313
All right then.

272
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:55,390
Has everybody got
that? Direct your
Spirit Energy at
Nozomi.

273
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:56,593
Excuse me?

274
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:57,795
Hm?

275
00:18:57,829 --> 00:18:59,632
What is that
going to
accomplish?

276
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,770
Just take our
word for it.

277
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:04,642
I'm not entirely
on board with
this decision-

278
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:09,519
Unlike you guys, we
don't know the young
lady well enough to fully
place our trust in her.

279
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:12,258
I think she's
trustworthy.
Izuru!?

280
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,797
We've seen her
in action! We
know she has
the will!

281
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:19,340
Izuru's right.
Nozomi Kujo has what
it takes to be a
Soul Reaper.

282
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,477
[gasp]

283
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:26,754
Well if you two
vouch for her, I'm
good. I'm willing
to take a chance.

284
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:28,625
What do you
say, Tetsuzaemon?

285
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:33,534
All right, I hear
what you're saying.
I guess I have no
choice. I'll do it.

286
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,681

[low growling chuckle]

288
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,837
Now do it!

Where are they?
Did we get them?
[all panting]

304
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:55,804
Looks like
you did it.
[gasp]

305
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,843
Way to go,
Nozomi! That
was awesome!

306
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:01,982
(Kon)
Nozomi! Nozomi!
Nozomi!
I guess.

307
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:06,024
Nozo-!
Stand back!

Brother!

311
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:25,831
Did you think that
I'd be defeated
so easily by a
technique like that!?

314
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:41,998
[gasp]

315
00:21:47,476 --> 00:21:52,019
Time to finish
you off.

316
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:53,588
[gasp]

317
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:55,993
What? Damn
you!

318
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:58,565
[shout in agony]

319
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:04,009
[gasp]

320
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:09,588
(Ichigo)
Head Captain!

321
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,122
(Nozomi)
Ichigo, who is
that old man?

322
00:23:48,156 --> 00:23:50,661
(Ichigo)
He's the Head Captain
of the Thirteen
Court Guard squads!

323
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:52,729
(Nozomi)
I see. I'll go
grab a chair.

324
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:55,566
(Nozomi)
I saw on T.V. that
the young should give
seats to the elderly--

325
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,000
(Nozomi)
So I'll get a
chair so he
cam sit down.

326
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:59,770
(Ichigo)
He looks like an old
man but he doesn't
fight like an old man--

327
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:00,737
(Ichigo)
--even thought he
IS an old man!

328
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:01,505
(Ichigo)
Wait, what?
