-I knew it.

00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,593
You're not even able to ask
your Zanpakuto its name.

4
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:55,726
And you really think you
can fight me as an equal?

5
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,460
Come back in 2000 years.

6
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:02,060
Roar, Zabimaru!

7
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:03,293
Now open your eyes.

8
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:05,760
See what lies before you.

9
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:06,693
Hunh!

10
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,560
And fall upon your prey.

-It's all over, you little runt.

14
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:27,593
You've lost to Renji Abarai
and will die where you stand!

[gasp]

16
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:46,126
-Sorry it's ending
this way, kid.

17
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,093
But that's what's known as
a difference in strength.

18
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:53,626
That's because the Zanpakuto
can change its size and shape

19
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,260
in response to the
wielder's spirit energy.

20
00:02:56,293 --> 00:03:00,393
How do you like
my spirit energy?

21
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:02,460
Well, that's it kid.

22
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:05,226
It's time for me to head out.

23
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,660
I don't like the way
the air smells here.

24
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:12,660
-Now Ichigo knows that there is
a difference in their strength.

25
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,493
It's made him realize he
has no chance of winning,

26
00:03:15,526 --> 00:03:18,426
and so he's backing down.

27
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,893
That was my hope.

28
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:22,826
But Ichigo will never give up.

29
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,760
I know that.

30
00:03:24,793 --> 00:03:26,693
-Ready?

31
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:27,393
-Ichigo.

32
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:29,160
If you can still move.

33
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:30,493
Then save yourself.

34
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:31,293
Run.

35
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,860
Please.

36
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:34,960
-No answer, eh?

37
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,593
-Argh!

38
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:39,793
-Run, Ichigo, move!

39
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:45,993
-What are you doing, Rukia?

40
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,893
Let go of me!

41
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:50,626
Are you trying to make
things worse for yourself?

42
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,560
Urrgh.

43
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:52,326
Fool!

44
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,693
-Ichigo, get out of here!

45
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:55,660
Hurry!

46
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,626
You've got to.

47
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,593
Go!

48
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:58,560
Get moving!

49
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,060
-But this can't be!

50
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:10,526
You shouldn't have the
strength left to move.

51
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,060
-Aah!

52
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:13,660
-This will work out just fine.

53
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:15,560
I've been thinking
it'd be a shame

54
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:17,760
to finish off someone who
couldn't move anymore.

55
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,193
I guess the only thing
left for you to do

56
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,293
is fight hard and die.

57
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:27,126
-Run.

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,793
You must save yourself.

59
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:29,826
I'm begging you, run!

60
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,393
Oh.

61
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:41,093
-What's wrong?

62
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:45,460
If you won't
attack, then I will!

00:04:58,193 --> 00:04:59,060
Impossible!

66
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:01,026
-Yeah.

67
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,026
-H-aah, aah!

68
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:11,560
What the hell?

[gasp]

74
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,793
He was ready to die
just a minute ago.

75
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:30,226
So then how'd he get
this newfound power?

76
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,226
-Hah!

77
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,093
I'll tell you
exactly what's wrong.

78
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,560
It's just your
moves have somehow

79
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:36,160
suddenly become a lot slower.

80
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:37,026
-Idiot.

81
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,193
Actually, you've gotten faster.

82
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:42,060
-I don't understand what's
happening to me, but I like it.

83
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,926
I feel no pain from my wounds.

84
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,893
In fact I feel
totally invincible!

85
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:49,993
-Why, you!

86
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:52,126
Zabimaru, time for you to roar!

87
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:57,128
[grunting]

88
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,326
-Renji's being overpowered.

89
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:13,826
Incredible.

90
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:19,860
-Grr-aah!

91
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:20,360
-Uggh.

92
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:25,893
-You're awfully good
at dodging my sword.

93
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:27,293
-What's happening?

94
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:30,093
How much higher can
his spirit energy go?

95
00:06:30,126 --> 00:06:34,160
-But all that's about to end.

96
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,593
-Can't-- move--

00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:40,060
-Heeeyaaahh!

00:06:40,093 --> 00:06:41,493

[gasp]

102
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:52,460
-My Zanpakuto.

103
00:06:56,026 --> 00:06:58,093
But-- he didn't do anything.

104
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:02,860
Was it him?

105
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:04,426
Impossible.

106
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,393
He couldn't have,
from that distance.

107
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,360
Is he coming?

108
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:37,193
What just happened?

109
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:39,660
Did he cut me?

110
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,026
What's more, if he
did, I can't tell

111
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,260
if I was hit from the
back or the front.

112
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:49,326
It hurts.

113
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,226
-You're slow.

114
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,926
Even when you are falling.

115
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,426
-Brother, don't do it!

116
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,126
-It's been awhile
since I've seen it.

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,726
But he's truly awesome.

118
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,326
Better pay more attention.

119
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,493
I barely even saw his
second attack coming.

120
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:16,793
But his first one--
I couldn't even

121
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:21,793
tell when he drew his sword,
let alone when he put it back.

122
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:26,126
But one thing's for sure--
if I couldn't see it coming,

123
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,660
I'm absolutely sure this kid
doesn't have the slightest

124
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:30,926
idea what just happened to him.

125
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,860
Regardless of
that, there's still

126
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:36,126
the matter of that
extraordinary spiritual pressure

127
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,826
that he demonstrated earlier.

128
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,293
-What's the matter, Renji?

129
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:41,760
-Huh?

130
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:44,593
-Uh, I really didn't
need your help

131
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:46,593
defeating this kid, Captain.

132
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,626
There was no reason
for you to interfere.

133
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,326
I could've handled this myself.

134
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,860
-Come now, Renji.

135
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:55,226
Even I will get rusty if
all I ever do is watch.

136
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,860
Do you agree?

137
00:08:56,893 --> 00:08:57,793
-No.

138
00:08:57,826 --> 00:08:59,560
This kid's different.

139
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:00,293
He must be--

140
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:00,793
-Ichigo!

141
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:07,260
No!

142
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:07,993
-No, don't!

143
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:13,693
-Renji.

144
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:14,926
Let go.

145
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,126
Let me go!

146
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,560
-What does it matter
now, you fool?

147
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:19,993
The kid's already dead!

148
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:25,693
Listen, if you so
much as touch him,

149
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:28,860
they'll add 20 years
to your sentence.

150
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:30,793
Besides, Rukia,
you'd only end up

151
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:32,593
increasing your sins
for someone who's died.

152
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:37,893
-I got you involved in all this.

153
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:40,060
It's my fault that
Ichigo's dead!

154
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:42,226
So what the hell's wrong
with me going to him?

155
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:49,793
-So even if it would make
your sentence harsher,

156
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:52,360
you truly feel that
you must help him.

157
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:54,793
Is that what you're
saying to me?

158
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:57,993
-I am, brother.

159
00:09:58,026 --> 00:10:00,726
-I understand, Rukia.

160
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,693
This young man does indeed bear
a striking resemblance to him.

161
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:27,581
I understand, Rukia.

162
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:31,447
This young man does indeed bear
a striking resemblance to him.

163
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:38,581
-He's dead, you say?

164
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:41,281
Bears a striking
resemblance to him?

165
00:10:41,314 --> 00:10:43,347
I'd rather that you
quit talking about me

166
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:46,047
like I'm not even here, got it?

167
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:46,547
-Ichi--

168
00:10:49,614 --> 00:10:50,514
-Let go.

169
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:52,881
-Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

170
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:56,614
Try looking at me when you talk.

171
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:59,081
-This kid is still able to move?

172
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:00,881
But that's impossible!

173
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:02,947
-I see.

174
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:07,181
It looks like you won't
be needing that arm.

175
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:07,681
-Ungh!

176
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:14,447
-Rukia, what are you doing?

177
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:15,781
-You are just a human.

178
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,847
You are just a lowly human.

179
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:26,514
How dare you grab my
brother like that?

180
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:28,381
You better learn your place!

181
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:33,547
We should leave
here now, brother.

182
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:36,681
The actions Ichigo just
took have opened my eyes

183
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:38,681
to the truth.

184
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:39,847
I am ready now.

185
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:43,314
Take me back to
the Soul Society.

186
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:46,081
It is time that I
atone for my sins.

187
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:47,914
-You can't leave here now.

188
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:50,314
I mean, our work isn't finished.

189
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:52,681
Rukia!

190
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:55,214
-You don't know when
to give up, do ya?

191
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,681
Listen, the more
you move around,

192
00:11:56,714 --> 00:12:00,214
the quicker you're going
to find yourself dead.

193
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:04,781
-I see no need to inflict
a final blow upon him now.

194
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:05,714
Leave him be.

195
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:09,414
Soon enough, he'll
die on his own.

196
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:10,681
We should go now, brother.

197
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:14,181
-Wait!

198
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:15,014
Rukia!

199
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:15,714
Stop.

200
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:16,847
Look at me.

201
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:20,114
Is this some kind of a joke?

202
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:21,547
Hey!

203
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:22,047
Rrgh!

204
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:22,614
-Don't move!

205
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:29,414
Take even one step, or
try to come after me,

206
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:37,647
and I'll-- I'll-- I will
never, ever, forgive you!

207
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:39,581
You're going to die.

208
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:43,014
So why not stay put and
live a few seconds longer?

209
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:51,847
-All right.

210
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:55,814
I will not inflict
the finishing blow.

211
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:57,914
With my two attacks
against him, I

212
00:12:57,947 --> 00:13:01,314
have shattered both his
soul chain and soul sleep.

213
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,314
There's no point in
finishing him off.

214
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:07,514
He should die in
less than an hour.

215
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:09,614
Even if he does
survive this attack,

216
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:12,314
all his powers will be lost.

217
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:15,214
Both his special soul
reaper power as well as

218
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:18,281
his spirit energy.

219
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:19,681
Renji?

220
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:20,147
-Yes.

221
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:40,081
Now, open!

222
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:19,147
-I can't speak.

223
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,581
I can't move.

224
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:39,847
I was protected again.

225
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:40,347
Rukia.

226
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,547
It hurts.

227
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:11,647
My body feels heavy.

228
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:12,647
It's cold.

229
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:31,947
It doesn't hurt.

230
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,847
Oh no.

231
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:37,247
Am I about to die?

232
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:39,314
I probably don't
feel pain because I'm

233
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:41,781
on the verge of death.

234
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:44,181
But is that right?

235
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:46,714
At first, my body was so cold.

236
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:48,614
But now I feel warmth.

237
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,547
It's warm.

238
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:56,747
[screams]

239
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:57,447
-Oh.

240
00:15:57,481 --> 00:15:59,381
What a good reaction.

241
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:00,214
Quite excellent.

242
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:02,581
-What the hell are you doing?

243
00:16:02,614 --> 00:16:06,147
-Boss, you wanted me to let you
know the moment Ichigo woke up!

244
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:07,847
Well, he's awake!

245
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:08,947
-Wait a minute.

246
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:11,447
You work for Mr.
Hat-and-Clogs, don't you?

247
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:13,614
Why are you under
the covers with me?

248
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:14,514
Get off!

249
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:20,214
Hey.

250
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,081
I'm not dead.

251
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,747
Why not?

252
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:26,914
And what's more,
this isn't my house.

253
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:30,014
Where am I?

254
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:33,447
-Ichigo, you need to just relax.

255
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:35,281
We were barely able
to patch you up.

256
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:40,514
if you move around
too much, you'll die.

257
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:42,481
-Is that right?

258
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:46,747
So, Mr. Hat-and-Clogs, I
take it this is your house?

259
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:47,247
-Uh-huh.

260
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:52,047
Are you the one who saved me?

261
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:52,981
Huh?

262
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:54,247
-Huh.

263
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,914
It seems to me, by the
underlying tone of your voice,

264
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:59,047
maybe you didn't want
me to rescue you.

265
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:06,647
-Wait.

266
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:07,881
So what happened to Uryu?

267
00:17:07,914 --> 00:17:10,647
I remember that he was there
with me, helping me out.

268
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,214
So is he alive?

269
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:15,581
-I treated Uryu at the
site, but then he went home.

270
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,347
He actually did lose a
considerable amount of blood,

271
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:21,381
but his wounds weren't
as serious as yours.

272
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:24,114
Even if he had just laid
there for a couple of days,

273
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:26,114
I don't think he
would have died.

274
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:31,181
So after I cleaned and dressed
his wounds, he went home.

275
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:35,347
When he left, he was
worried about you.

276
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:37,347
-Uryu was worried?

277
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:39,847
No way.

278
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:41,881
I asked him to consider
resting here awhile

279
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:43,414
so that he could
regain his strength.

280
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:47,247
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Thanks.

281
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:51,547
I appreciate the offer,
but really, I'm-- I'm fine.

282
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:55,381
Please just take care of Ichigo.

283
00:17:55,414 --> 00:17:57,447
Because it's pretty
apparent that if there's

284
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:01,414
anyone who can defeat those
guys, it certainly is not me.

285
00:18:04,747 --> 00:18:07,514
The only one who
can save Rukia--

286
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:09,047
-Is you.

287
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:09,847
So he said.

288
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:16,514
-Only me?

289
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:22,947
What the hell can I do?

290
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:24,014
Don't you understand?

291
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,981
Rukia has gone back
to the Soul Society.

292
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:27,547
So just how do I go after her?

293
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:31,281
How am I supposed to save her?

294
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:32,681
It can't be done.

295
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:39,747
I can't do it!

296
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:43,081
-Do you really believe that?

297
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:45,814
There's a way into
the Soul Society.

298
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:48,214
-There's a way?

299
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:48,847
How?

300
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:49,714
Tell me!

301
00:18:49,747 --> 00:18:51,714
How do I do get there?

302
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:53,414
-Of course I'll tell you.

303
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:55,914
But on one condition.

304
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:57,047
-What's that?

305
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:59,314
-For the next 10 days,
you will study with me

306
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,781
and let me teach you
how to fight properly.

307
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:03,181
-Study?

308
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:05,514
You want me to waste
time training with you?

309
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:07,614
I don't have that
kind of time, OK?

310
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,047
Rukia is gone and she could
be executed any second.

311
00:19:11,081 --> 00:19:13,681
So we've got to get to the
Soul Society as soon as we can.

312
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:15,647
-Why don't you understand?

313
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:16,147
Huh?

314
00:19:19,947 --> 00:19:21,814
Don't act so dumb.

315
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:23,781
If you try to go
there now, you'll die.

316
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:29,647
You think you can beat them.

317
00:19:29,681 --> 00:19:33,347
You honestly believe
you're ready to fight them.

318
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,814
I went ahead and let
you try fighting them,

319
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,381
in order to prove a point.

320
00:19:37,414 --> 00:19:40,247
I figured you'd understand
results better than words.

321
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:43,281
My hope was that you
would learn your lesson.

322
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:45,414
With the amount of
strength you have now,

323
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,447
you won't be able
to do much once you

324
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:48,681
get into the Soul Society.

325
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:53,181
Right now, you're weak.

326
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:55,481
And any time a weak
person attempts

327
00:19:55,514 --> 00:19:59,247
to enter the enemy's den,
it's basically suicide.

328
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,214
So you want to save Rukia?

329
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:03,914
Don't make me laugh.

330
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:06,447
If you get yourself killed,
there'll be no one to blame.

331
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:14,781
The Soul Society usually has
a one-month waiting period

332
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,514
before an execution.

333
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:19,447
Usually they respect
their own rules.

334
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:22,547
Let's hope that's the case
with Rukia's execution.

335
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:23,881
-Let's hope so?

336
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:28,114
-It's altogether different from
the way humans are executed.

337
00:20:28,147 --> 00:20:32,014
So that gives me about
10 days to torture you.

338
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:35,847
Then seven days to open the
gate to the Soul Society.

339
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:41,214
Then we'll have 13 days after we
get there to get the job done.

340
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:42,814
So we've got lots of time.

341
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:57,614
-Well, I think
I'm strong enough.

342
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:58,881
10 days?

343
00:20:58,914 --> 00:20:59,914
-Yes.

344
00:20:59,947 --> 00:21:01,781
So long as you truly
wish to save Rukia

345
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:03,647
from the bottom of your heart.

346
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:09,714
Your will must be
stronger than steel.

347
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:11,847
You must abandon any
doubts that you have.

348
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:19,081
10 days to prepare for a
game of life and death.

349
00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:28,047
-Do I really have a choice?

350
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:28,547
-Heh.

351
00:21:35,147 --> 00:21:38,047
-I feel as though the
rain has finally stopped.

352
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:48,014

353
00:22:51,182 --> 00:22:55,415
NARRATOR: Renji Abarai on
how to use a Zanpakuto.

354
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:57,548
First, to release its
power, you must call out

355
00:22:57,582 --> 00:22:59,715
the name of your Zanpakuto.

356
00:22:59,748 --> 00:23:01,448
Then you slash and
swing, slash and swing.

357
00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:02,148
Got it?

358
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:02,982
Faster, faste, faster--

359
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:03,815
-What happened to the preview?

360
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:05,082
-What happened to the preview?

361
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:05,915
Slash! Slash! Slash!
