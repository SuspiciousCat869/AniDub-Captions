00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:55,435
-What incredible
spiritual pressure he has.

4
00:01:55,468 --> 00:01:57,902
Is he really a Menos Grande?

5
00:01:57,935 --> 00:01:59,868
Well, it doesn't
matter in the end.

6
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:09,702
His upper body disappeared.

7
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:12,168
It split in two.

8
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:13,168
No.

9
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:16,135
There were two of them.

10
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:17,102
I am not helpless.

11
00:02:20,335 --> 00:02:21,002
Take this.

12
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:31,135
Instant regeneration.

13
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:47,802
-My, my.

14
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,268
How clumsy.

15
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:53,035
Uryu.

16
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:54,102
-So it's you.

17
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:57,835
Ryuken.

18
00:02:57,868 --> 00:03:00,102
-Is that any way to
address your father?

19
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:02,802
You haven't changed
at all, have you, son?

20
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:09,602
You're interrupting me.

21
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:16,902
Instant regeneration isn't
really all that impressive.

22
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,768
It just means you
have to put them away

23
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:21,802
before they can do it.

24
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,168
-Wait, what is going on?

25
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:30,468
I thought you gave
them up before.

26
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:34,068
So why do you have
Quincy powers now?

27
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:36,568
But father.

28
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:39,368
Why do you hate being
a Quincy so much?

29
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:42,935
-Because there is
no profit in it.

30
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:45,735
-You told me they were
worthless and that you

31
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,602
didn't want to be
associated with them.

32
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,335
You rejected your
Quincy powers long ago,

33
00:03:51,368 --> 00:03:54,368
back when I was still a child.

34
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,102
-You're a fool, son.

35
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,568
I chose my words wisely.

36
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:02,568
What I said was that
I had no interest

37
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:05,402
and that you had
no talent for it.

38
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:12,702
Unfortunately, my powers
aren't as disposable as yours.

39
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:14,868
Otherwise I would have
lost them long ago.

40
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:19,768
It was me he chose.

41
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:23,068
Whether we like it or not, we
can't argue with the facts.

42
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:25,268
Our ancestor, Soken
Ishida, needed

43
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:27,168
to choose a man on
whom to bequeath

44
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:30,435
all of his power and skill.

45
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:33,802
Only one man is allowed
to continue his legacy,

46
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:35,802
to call himself the last Quincy.

47
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:43,068
-Look, I did it.

48
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:43,568
Ha!

49
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:47,502
I want to become a Quincy.

50
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:50,002
Then I can be just like you.

51
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:51,902
-I see.

52
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:55,268
Are you certain that
is what you truly want?

53
00:04:55,302 --> 00:04:57,402
Uryu, before making
this decision,

54
00:04:57,435 --> 00:04:59,535
you must search your heart.

55
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:02,968
Becoming a full fledged
Quincy is no easy matter.

56
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,002
-The Quincy cross.

57
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,335
He killed that Hollow
with a single shot.

58
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:25,068
I could barely slow it down.

59
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:30,735
-Uryu, you weren't ready.

60
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:34,402
You went to the Soul Society
before you were strong enough.

61
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:36,802
Now you have lost the
few powers you possessed.

62
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:43,668
What a fool.

63
00:05:43,702 --> 00:05:45,202
You were so blinded
by your pride

64
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:47,602
that you sacrificed
everything you had.

65
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:50,168
And yet in the end you
accomplished nothing.

66
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:57,268
But if you'll trust
me, I have the ability

67
00:05:57,302 --> 00:05:59,602
to restore all your
powers, everything

68
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:03,202
you lost to the Soul Society.

69
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:04,202
-There's no way.

70
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:06,468
It can't be done.

71
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:08,802
-If you really don't
think I can do it,

72
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,335
why not put me to the test?

73
00:06:13,768 --> 00:06:19,702
But first, I do
have one condition.

74
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:21,968
-What is it?

75
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:24,602
-You must swear
to me you'll never

76
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,502
associate with a
soul reaper again.

Time out, OK?

81
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:54,168
You don't want to fight in
the middle of town, right?

82
00:06:54,202 --> 00:07:00,135
-Why do you run away
from me, Ichigo Kurosaki?

83
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:00,935
Fight me.

84
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:03,935
Return to your soul reaper form.

85
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,435
-Why me?

86
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:08,635
Why doesn't this guy pick
on someone his own size?

87
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:09,235
Come on!

88
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,902
-Whoa.

[yelling]

00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:22,035
-It's a Hollow.

93
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,235
-It's huge.

94
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,335
-I sense more spiritual
pressure right next to it.

95
00:07:25,368 --> 00:07:28,235
It appears to be Kon.

96
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:29,702
-Kon?

97
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:32,702
Why's he messing
around with that thing?

00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:37,402
[yelling]

99
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:39,435
-You got the wrong guy!

100
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:41,435
-You can't fool me.

101
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:43,868
I know exactly who you are.

102
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:47,268
-I'm not the one you want.

103
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:54,735
[screaming]

104
00:08:01,702 --> 00:08:02,702
-Oh no.

105
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:04,735
Please don't tell
me I've been eaten.

106
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:05,702
-You're awake.

107
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,568
So stop talking like
you're dreaming.

108
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:16,135
-Kon, what are you doing
running around in Ichigo's body?

109
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:18,535
-I'd say that's pretty
obvious, isn't it?

110
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:21,535
I'm being chased all over
town by a gigantic Hollow!

111
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,568
-You're such a moron.

112
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:25,902
You couldn't come up with
anything better than running

113
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:27,002
away?

114
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:29,402
-Hey, listen, you
pea-brained idiot!

115
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:32,035
That thing that was chasing
me was no ordinary Hollow.

116
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,035
-Yeah, you're right.

117
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:35,402
He's pretty fast, huh?

118
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:37,902
When it comes to running away
there's no one better at it

119
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,268
than you and he was
keeping right up.

120
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,102
-Huh?

121
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:42,035
Why, you little--

122
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:43,168
-The Hollow!

123
00:08:43,202 --> 00:08:45,068
-[screams]

124
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:49,368
-I was just kidding.

125
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:50,602
-You what?

126
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:51,802
-Don't worry.

127
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:53,202
If you're having trouble
dealing with this Hollow,

128
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:56,068
we can help you out, right?

129
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,802
-They say it's fate
that brings us together.

130
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:01,368
They also say that one
who is kind to others

131
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:04,802
is sure to be rewarded.

132
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,068
-Yeah?

133
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:08,702
Well, I wouldn't ask for
your help if you were the l--

134
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:11,435
-Where did you go
Ichigo Kurosaki?

135
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:15,668
There you are.

136
00:09:18,468 --> 00:09:20,068
-If your big plan
is just to run away,

137
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,002
I don't see how that's
any different from what

138
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:23,335
I was doing on my own.

139
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:24,335
-Just keep running.

140
00:09:24,368 --> 00:09:25,302
I've got an idea.

141
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:34,735
Turn left at that corner.

142
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:45,168
-What?

143
00:09:50,635 --> 00:10:00,968
[groans] There you are.

144
00:10:07,335 --> 00:10:08,235
Ichigo Kurosaki.

145
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:16,102
[laughs] So you finally
turned into a soul reaper.

146
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:19,068
That's good.

147
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:22,668
Because now I'm going
to take your life.

148
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:24,135
-We'll have to see about that.

149
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:36,405
-You-- you really
think this will work?

150
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:38,005
-It'll be a piece of cake.

151
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,171
We've handled Hollows before.

152
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:41,405
Come on.

153
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:42,805
Let's do this.

154
00:10:42,838 --> 00:10:43,305
-Right.

155
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:13,338
-He's gone.

156
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,105
-Thanks for lending a hand.

157
00:11:24,938 --> 00:11:28,905
[screams]

158
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:39,205
-An illusion.

159
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,371
You thought you could trick me?

160
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:46,938
Ichigo Kurosaki.

161
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:51,505
You're not going to get
away from me that easily.

162
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,871
-Kon!

163
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:56,071
-Those guys are no help at all.

164
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:57,738
He's even madder now
than he was before.

165
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:03,738
There's no way he's going to
believe that I'm not Ichigo.

166
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:10,705
And there's something weird
going on with that mask of his

167
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:14,738
because I can see half of his
face now when I couldn't--

168
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,705
-Enough games.

169
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:18,271
Do you think I
have nothing better

170
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,405
to do than chase you around this
city waiting for you to change

171
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:22,738
into a soul reaper?

172
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:24,338
Play time's over.

173
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:32,005
If you'd rather die like
a coward than return

174
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:34,505
to your soul reaper form
and fight me like a man,

175
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,505
then so be it.

176
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:40,771
[coughing]

177
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:43,238
-I will take your
weak human body

178
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:45,971
and grind all your
bones into dust.

179
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:47,738
-Damn it.

180
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,071
I can't move.

181
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:08,538
Wha-- what is that?

182
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:11,838
-Well, well.

183
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:16,505
I told you to always
keep it with you

184
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:20,338
when you came back
from your trip.

185
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:24,171
-That looks like-- it can't be!

186
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:27,571
-I hate to spoil all
your fun, Mr. Hollow.

187
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:31,905
But Ichigo's a little
busy right now.

188
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:34,738
I realize I'm not
much of substitute,

189
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:39,338
but this guy's not cutting
it, so why not play with me?

190
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:40,238
-Really?

191
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:41,738
And who are you?

192
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:49,571
-Oh, I'm sorry.

193
00:13:49,605 --> 00:13:51,338
I always forget to do that.

194
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:54,971
Allow me to introduce myself.

195
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:56,071
I am Isshin Kurosaki.

196
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:17,338
-That spiritual pressure.

197
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:18,671
It's huge.

198
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:21,605
But there's something
different about it.

199
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:23,571
Is it a Hollow?

200
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:25,038
-Oh, come on.

201
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:26,938
You've got to be kidding me.

202
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:28,938
Is this guy for real?

203
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:32,038
Did he just sense that Hollow?

204
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,671
Amazing.

205
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:35,638
And that other
spiritual pressure,

206
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:38,371
that definitely belongs
to a soul reaper.

207
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:43,138
But I don't recognize it,
so it's no one I know.

208
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:44,605
Hey, wait a minute!

209
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:47,505
Where are you going? you
better get back here right now.

210
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,305
I'm not finished
talking to you yet!

211
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:50,505
-No thanks.

212
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:52,271
-Hey, didn't you
hear what I said?

213
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:54,938
-Yeah, I heard you and I'm
not interested in anything

214
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,105
you have to say.

215
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:57,938
I don't want to join
your stupid club,

216
00:14:57,971 --> 00:14:59,805
and I don't want
to be your friend.

217
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:02,171
So why don't you and
your Visored organization

218
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:03,371
get the hell out of my town?

219
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:12,905
I'm a soul reaper.

220
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:14,371
You got that?

221
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:15,671
I'm not one of you.

222
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:27,571
--[sighs] This guy's not going
to make it easy for me is he?

223
00:15:33,038 --> 00:15:36,438
[phone ringing]

224
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:38,471
-It's Shinji.

225
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,405
Yeah, I'm calling
for Miss Sarugaki

226
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:43,238
to give her a progress report.

227
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:43,805
Oh, it's you.

228
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:45,438
Sorry.

229
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:47,205
He didn't go for it.

230
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,105
[static]

231
00:15:50,138 --> 00:15:52,305
-Quit shouting in
my ear, will you?

232
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:55,105
It wasn't my fault.

233
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:56,171
Look, don't worry.

234
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,438
It's only a matter of time.

235
00:15:58,471 --> 00:15:59,605
Just try to be patient.

236
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:07,005
-Kurosaki.

237
00:16:07,038 --> 00:16:09,371
I see.

238
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:14,271
So tell me, how are
the two of you related?

239
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:15,438
-I'm his father.

240
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:20,771
Here, Kon.

241
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:23,238
Hold onto this.

242
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:25,571
It's a charm that was
created just for you.

243
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:27,538
I meant to give it to you.

244
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,538
-He knows my name.

245
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,838
Wha-- how did you know that?

246
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:36,171
When did you figure out
that I wasn't really Ichigo?

247
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,238
-I've known it all along.

248
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:44,371
Ever since the first time
I saw you in Ichigo's body.

249
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:47,571
We went to the cemetery to
visit Masaki's grave, remember?

250
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:49,971
You didn't fool me.

251
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:51,705
Just think about it.

252
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:54,738
All the times that you've been
inside Ichigo's body, when

253
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:56,438
you think back on
it, do you ever once

254
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:57,871
remember me calling you Ichigo?

255
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:03,638
I'm not as dumb as I look.

256
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:04,471
Right?

257
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:07,371
Just ask those three over there.

258
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:11,238
--[laughs nervously] I guess that
means you know about us too.

259
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:13,171
-Please forgive us.

260
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:15,038
This is rather
awkward, I mean with us

261
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:16,438
hiding behind the
bushes and all.

262
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:24,638
-Now it makes sense.

263
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:29,338
If his father is a soul
reaper, then Ichigo Kurosaki

264
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:31,671
is of true blood.

265
00:17:31,705 --> 00:17:36,171
In that case, I can understand
how that little orange haired

266
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:39,505
little bastard was
able to defeat me.

267
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:42,138
-Out of all the Hollows
that I've ever met,

268
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:45,671
you are by far the
oldest, the filthiest,

269
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:50,405
and the most
infuriating of them all.

270
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:54,138
-Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'm not really interested

271
00:17:54,171 --> 00:17:56,605
in you, Isshin.

272
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:59,005
I came here tonight
for one reason.

273
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,438
To kill Ichigo Kurosaki.

274
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:05,471
Since you're his father,
you should know where he is.

275
00:18:05,505 --> 00:18:08,638
Bring me your son.

276
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,171
-Well, I don't know where is.

277
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:11,671
It's not like he's
a little kid that

278
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:13,471
can't take care of himself.

279
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:15,838
Plus I always trust
my kids and give them

280
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:17,938
as much space as possible.

281
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,371
-Are you kidding me?

282
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:21,905
You cling to your daughters
like you're a mother hen.

283
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:24,105
-That's because Yuzu
and Karin are special.

284
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:26,205
It's a completely
different situation.

285
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,338
They're the exception.

286
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:34,571
Besides, it doesn't matter if
you're interested me or not.

287
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:37,671
Because the reason I'm
here is to kill you.

288
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:39,438
So if you don't
want to fight me,

289
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:41,638
that's going to be a problem.

290
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:50,805
--[laughs] You came
here to kill me?

291
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,538
Those are pretty big words
for a puny little soul reaper.

292
00:18:54,571 --> 00:18:57,505
[laughs]

293
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:00,005
You might want to reconsider.

294
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,271
Before you decide, you
should ask yourself

295
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:04,838
if I look like an
ordinary Hollow.

296
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:05,338
Watch.

297
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,838
Now you see the true
form of my power.

298
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:30,305
-That guy's freaking huge!

299
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:32,505
He's got to be at least
as big or bigger than that

300
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,371
Menos I saw before.

301
00:19:35,405 --> 00:19:38,205
-What do you mean Menos?

302
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:42,071
How can you compare me with
one of those weaklings?

303
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:43,771
No, I am--

304
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:46,771
-An Arrancar.

305
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:48,071
Surprised?

306
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:50,871
You're a group of Hollows
trying to attain soul reaper

307
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:53,871
powers by removing your masks.

308
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:56,005
Isn't that right?

309
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:56,838
-Huh.

310
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:58,671
Well, well.

311
00:19:58,705 --> 00:19:59,771
You're right.

312
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:03,271
You're not as dumb as
you look after all.

313
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:07,905
However, you're a
fool, because you

314
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:11,971
know you can't win
against my sword.

315
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:14,371
-That's a Zanpakuto?

316
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:17,271
That thing is
absolutely ginormous!

317
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:18,938
-That's right.

318
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:24,738
A Zanpakuto size equals the
amount of one's spirit energy.

319
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:29,805
It is obvious that little weapon
hanging limply by your side

320
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:34,105
could never defeat my Zanpakuto.

321
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:35,971
Moron.

322
00:20:36,005 --> 00:20:38,038
-Is that so?

323
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,105
Well then, why don't
we just find out?

324
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:48,505
-You know you can't win
and you still persist.

325
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,271
I thought soul
reapers were supposed

326
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:53,771
to know their own lore,
but I guess I was wrong.

327
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:57,005
In death perhaps you will
gain the enlightenment

328
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,438
you lacked in this life.

329
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:16,305
Impossible!

330
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:22,138
-Let me give you a little
lesson on the basics.

331
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:25,271
Once a soul reaper reaches
the level of Captain,

332
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:26,705
he then has the
ability to control

333
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:29,838
the size of his Zanpakuto.

334
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,971
They have to.

335
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:34,438
Because if they didn't,
they'd all be swinging around

336
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:37,105
swords the size of skyscrapers.

337
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:38,071
Kind of like you.

338
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:43,838
Remember this.

339
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:45,638
You should never
judge your opponent

340
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,905
by the size of his Zanpakuto.

341
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:07,205
Don't talk about soul reaper
lore until you've learned that.

342
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:22,109

344
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:49,940
we came across some
new vocabulary.

345
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:52,540
In our next episode, I
shall explain exactly what

346
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:54,640
the Arrancars and
the Visored are.

347
00:23:54,673 --> 00:23:57,140
If you'd like to attend the
Kisuke Urahara Talk Show,

350
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:01,140
-What a rip off.

351
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,273
-Guide to soul reapers.

352
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:15,540
-Golden.

353
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:17,540
-So how have you been lately?

354
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:19,007
-Not so good.

355
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,773
I changed my sunglasses
and not one person noticed.

356
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:22,540
-Sunglasses?

357
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:24,207
That's so yesterday.

358
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,107
Check it out.

359
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,673
What do you think
of these babies?

360
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:27,307
-Huh?

361
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,240
What do you mean?

362
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:28,907
-I can't believe
you didn't notice.

363
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,573
It's my sideburns.

364
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:32,173
I'm wearing them in
a different style.

365
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:33,073
-Really?

366
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:34,973
They look just the same to me.

367
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:35,940
-Hey!

368
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:39,040
Look, it's the boring
lieutenant trio.

369
00:24:39,073 --> 00:24:41,640
-What do you mean, boring?
