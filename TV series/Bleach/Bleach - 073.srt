before it's too late!

-Well, what am I supposed to do?

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,730
I'm a stupid rag
doll, same as you.

338
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:25,597
We have no power.

-Aah!

340
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,997
This is hopeless!

341
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,164
There's nothing we could do!

342
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:28,797
-Not true.

343
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,530
-What do you mean?

344
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:30,530
-There is one thing.

345
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:31,697
-What are you talking about?

346
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,297
-It won't be long
before they're all dead.

347
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,830
-Then we can take the
Quincy and get out of here.

00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:37,730

-Uh, yeah.

-What could I do, Ichigo?

354
00:16:44,864 --> 00:16:46,797
-Rukia, don't die!

355
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,764
-Ho!

356
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:49,764
Ugh!

00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,564
-It's working.

363

-Keep zapping them!

365
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,897
-They come back too fast!

-Can't you fly them
farther away, Noba?

-I'm doing my best.

I can send them.

-Yeah, you saved us, Noba.

383
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:28,430
It's just like we thought.

384
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,297
The two of them have to
be together and share

385
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,164
their thoughts to
get that resonance.

386
00:17:33,197 --> 00:17:36,030
And that means, if one of
them loses consciousness,

387
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:37,364
they can't resonate.

388
00:17:37,397 --> 00:17:39,064
And then they can't
control their Dolls.

389
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:41,664
Isn't that right, Noba?

Please, you've got to wake up.

matter right now.

What matters is that you said
you needed more firepower.

438
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:27,864
And excessive firepower
is a Shiba clan specialty.

But you'd all better stand
back because this is probably
