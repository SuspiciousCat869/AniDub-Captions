[theme music]

2
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:08,689
-Unbelievable.

3
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,989
How could something
like this happen?

4
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:14,189
To plant a bomb in the
Shishinro Repentance Cell.

5
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:15,623
What's the reason for it?

6
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:18,323
-It's a declaration of war.

7
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:21,423
The Shishinro Repentence Cell
was built from Sekkisekki rock

8
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:23,156
because it's
virtually impenetrable

9
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:24,789
to spiritual attacks.

10
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:27,056
It must have taken
a great deal of time

11
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:29,256
to devise such an
elaborate plan, which

12
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:32,189
means the ones responsible
have a deep seated hatred

13
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:33,989
of the Soul Society.

14
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:36,389
Increase the number of men
assigned to the search force.

15
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,989
We must discover
their whereabouts

16
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:39,623
as quickly as possible.

17
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:40,123
-Yes, sir.

18
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:48,056
-It's the Bounts, isn't it?

19
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:49,823
-I've failed.

20
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:52,856
I should have been
able to stop this.

21
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,189
-Let's stop them now.

22
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:17,156
-Hm?

23
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:17,723
Oh!

24
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,923
-How's Rukia?

25
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:21,123
Didn't you hear me, damn it?

26
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:23,289
I want to know if
she's all right.

27
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:25,589
-I expect she'll
make a full recovery.

28
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:28,023
However, the wound is very deep.

29
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:29,456
I would like for
her to rest here

30
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,823
until she's had a
chance to recuperate.

31
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,523
-Oh, thank goodness.

32
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:36,356
-Well, now, this recovery
never would have been possible

33
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,256
without the strong
will and determination

34
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:39,923
of her big brother.

35
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:41,656
Proof that one should
never underestimate

36
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,556
the power of sibling love.

37
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:44,223
-Yeah!

38
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,056
You did a good job.

39
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:47,889
You deserve a pat on the back.

40
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:49,123
-You saved her life.

41
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,723
I know she'll be safe here.

42
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:55,056
Thank you.

43
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:57,423
But I'm going after them now,
and I could use your help.

44
00:03:57,456 --> 00:03:58,623
-What do you mean?

45
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,389
-They went after Rukia
knowing full well

46
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:02,789
that she hadn't recovered
from her wounds yet.

47
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:04,523
She was an easy
target, and they knew

48
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:06,623
it would distract
us for a while.

49
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:08,923
That kind of crap
makes me sick, and I'm

50
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,123
going to make them pay for it.

51
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:12,656
-I cannot help you.

52
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:13,156
-D'ah!

53
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,956
Why not?

54
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,456
-You're going to just stand
by and let them do this?

55
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,323
-The 13 Court Guard
Squads have already

56
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:21,856
been assigned to deal with this.

57
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:24,556
And I see no need for me
to join forces with you.

58
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:25,789
-How can you--

59
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:27,089
-Ichigo!

60
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:31,689
-Go back to the world of the
living, where you belong.

61
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:32,356
-Heh.

62
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,556
I get it now.

63
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,389
Yesterday's enemy
is today's enemy.

64
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:35,956
Is that it?

65
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:42,623
Let's go, Orihime.

66
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:45,189
-But--

67
00:04:45,223 --> 00:04:48,889
-I'm trusting you to
take care of Rukia.

68
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:52,823
-I'm glad Rukia has
you to watch over her.

69
00:04:52,856 --> 00:04:53,989
Hey Wait a second!

70
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:55,223
Where are you going?

71
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:55,989
Wait for me!

72
00:05:12,823 --> 00:05:18,289
[laughter]

73
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:18,789
-Hm?

74
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:22,223
-Huh?

75
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:30,756
WOMAN: He's cute.

76
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,756
Hi, stranger.

77
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:40,256
-I've never seen him before.

78
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,456
-Nice place you've got here.

79
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:45,689
Mind if I join in
the festivities?

80
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:47,723
-Show me what you've got to bet.

81
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:49,823
-It's my pleasure.

82
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:51,256
You think this will be enough?

83
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,089
-I suppose you bet your life.

84
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:03,989
You're new around
here, aren't you?

85
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:06,389
This isn't the world
of living, friend.

86
00:06:06,423 --> 00:06:08,889
We do things differently
in the Soul Society.

87
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:11,789
-Pain's the same
in either world.

88
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:14,926
-I like how you think
stranger, let's do this.

89
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,426
-Hey.

90
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,261
Uh--

91
00:06:16,295 --> 00:06:18,661
-You come in acting all tough,
you'll leave in a body bag.

92
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:26,061
No way!

93
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,328
-It looks as though I win.

94
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:32,528
-You!

95
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:33,395
You cheated!

96
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:35,228
No one can be that lucky.

97
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,361
-Is something wrong?

98
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,861
You seem frightened.

99
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:40,328
And I had always heard
that the men of Kusajishi

100
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:42,961
were the toughest
in all of Rukongai.

101
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:46,761
-You stinkin'-- wha?

102
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:47,895
What kind of freakin'--

103
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:49,661
-Oh, come, now.

104
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:50,695
Is that it?

105
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:53,761
Surely you've more
strength than that.

106
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:55,195
-Whoa!

107
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:55,695
-Huh?

108
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:02,561
-Perhaps you'd like to
be my next opponent.

109
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:05,028
-Why, you-- What the
hell did you do to him?

110
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,561
-That's enough.

111
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:10,495
He's not someone you
could ever hope to defeat.

112
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:11,895
-That's too bad.

113
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:14,461
I was hoping to have some
fun before you arrived.

114
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:15,661
-Ichinose.

115
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:19,295
I could use your help
dealing with Kariya.

116
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:20,961
[gasps]

117
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:22,495
-A Soul Reaper?

118
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:25,428
What's someone from the
Seireitei doin' around here?

119
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,761
You are mistaken.

120
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:28,561
I'm not from there.

121
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:30,828
In fact, I'm no
longer a Soul Reaper.

122
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:32,495
-I don't know what
you're talking about,

123
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:33,661
and I don't care.

124
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:35,195
-There's only three of them.

125
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:36,128
Let's get 'em!

126
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:40,161
-Yah!

127
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:56,495
-Perhaps we should consider
being a little more subtle

128
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:57,861
next time.

129
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,061
-That's true.

130
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:01,561
I'll try to control my
urges in the future.

131
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:04,161
-The Rukon District is
large, but if you continue

132
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:05,761
to draw attention
like this, it won't

133
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:08,395
be long at all before
we're discovered.

134
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,928
-Not a bad idea.

135
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:11,595
-That's crazy.

136
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:12,428
-Huh?

137
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:14,161
Who the hell are you, anyway?

138
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,295
And what do you want here?

139
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,028
-Why does anyone come here?

140
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:19,928
We came to have a little fun.

141
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:21,261
So how about it?

142
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:23,028
You want to play with us?

143
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:24,261
-What do you mean?

144
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,761
-We intend to turn the
Soul Society upside down.

145
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:31,795
-Wait a minute.

146
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:32,795
You're not those--

147
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,361
-We searched the
entire south side.

148
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:39,361
There's no sign of them.

149
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:40,495
-All right, then.

150
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:42,561
Move on to the east side
and continue the search.

151
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:43,861
-Yes, sir.

152
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:45,661
-We know they're
hiding somewhere.

153
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:47,461
Don't let them slip though.

154
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:48,361
-I can't find 'em!

155
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,428
-Nobody's here.

156
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:51,328
-Over here.

157
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:51,895
-Over there!

158
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:52,595
-Come on, men!

159
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:53,795
Hurry!

160
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:55,361
Don't let the other squads
get there ahead of us.

161
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:56,261
-Wow.

162
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:58,561
This is so exciting, isn't it?

163
00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:00,661
Just look at everyone
running around down there.

164
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:01,228
Oops.

165
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,628
He fell down.

166
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:05,595
Hey, I wonder if
baldy and Yumian

167
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,561
are out there searching, too?

168
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:10,028
It's like a race to see who
can find the Bounts first,

169
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:10,528
isn't it?

170
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:16,095
Are you gonna join the race?

171
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:17,828
-Why bother.

172
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,161
There's no sport in it.

173
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:21,828
-Aw.

174
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,661
-You starting to get bored?

175
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:24,495
Nuh-uh.

176
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:27,261
In fact, I'm a little relieved.

177
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,595
-What do you mean?

178
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:30,728
-Well, it's just that Maki's
out there with the Bounts right

179
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:33,961
now, so I thought you probably
wouldn't have any fun,

180
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:35,495
so why bother fighting him?

181
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:37,228
Am I right?

182
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:39,861
-That doesn't make
any difference at all.

183
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:41,995
He's shown how weak
he is by allowing

184
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:44,728
himself to be used by them.

185
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:46,095
-Huh.

186
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,961
If you don't care, I
don't care, either.

187
00:09:59,328 --> 00:10:00,295
-I'm exhausted.

188
00:10:00,328 --> 00:10:01,328
-Dammit.

189
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:02,428
We've been walking
around all this time

190
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,595
and haven't come up
with a single clue.

191
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:06,761
-I've been trying to figure
out why the Bounts would

192
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:09,461
go to all the trouble of
breaking into the Seireitei,

193
00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:11,528
and then blow up Senzaikyu.

194
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:14,161
-Well, it definitely wasn't
subtle, so all I can think

195
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:16,228
is that they wanted
everybody in the Soul Society

196
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:17,661
to know they were here.

197
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:18,928
-That's crazy.

198
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:20,861
It's like announcing that
you're committing a crime.

199
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:23,128
Why would the Bounts want
to draw everyone's attention

200
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:24,161
like that?

201
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:25,428
-Why?

202
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:27,928
Because the only reason
they're here is to get revenge.

203
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,928
They want to make sure everybody
knows who's doing this.

204
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:32,595
-Well I, for one,
have never been

205
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:34,895
able to make heads or tails
out of the way they think.

206
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:37,528
Sneaking into the Soul Society,
then wanting to be noticed.

207
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:39,961
It seems like one
big game to them.

208
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:41,195
-Chad.

209
00:10:41,228 --> 00:10:42,595
-Sorry.

210
00:10:42,628 --> 00:10:45,495
I wanted to protect Rukia, but
I couldn't get there in time.

211
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:46,928
-Me, either.

212
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:49,095
Byakuya was the
one who saved her.

213
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:50,128
-Really?

214
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:51,161
-Yeah.

215
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:53,661
She's at his house
right now recuperating.

216
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:54,995
-I see.

217
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:57,328
-The three of us didn't do
what we were supposed to do.

218
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:59,361
If we had, none of this
would have ever happened.

219
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,228
-What's wrong, Master Ichigo?

220
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,628
You look worn out.

221
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:06,895
-What's wrong, Master Ichigo?

222
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:08,961
You look worn out.

223
00:11:08,995 --> 00:11:10,028
-What the hell?

224
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:11,428
-Just wait and see.

225
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:14,828
We've got something
interesting to show you.

226
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:15,595
-OK.

227
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:17,128
So what's so interesting?

228
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:18,328
Let's do it!

229
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,561
Shiroganehiko!

230
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,328
-Ready, Koganehiko!

231
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:24,861
-Heave!

232
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:25,295
-Ho!

233
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:25,695
-Heave!

234
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:26,128
-Ho!

235
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:26,528
-Heave!

236
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:26,961
-Ho!

237
00:11:26,995 --> 00:11:27,361
-Heave!

238
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:27,795
-Ho!

239
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:28,195
-Heave!

240
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:28,628
-Ho!

241
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:29,028
-Heave!

242
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:29,461
-Ho!

243
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:29,861
-Heave!

244
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:30,295
-Ho!

245
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:30,728
-Heave!

246
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:31,161
Heave!

247
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:31,595
Heave!

248
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:32,100
Heave!

249
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,695
-Definitely impressive.

250
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:39,028
-Most definitely, brother.

251
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:39,961
-That's incredible.

252
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:42,795
The hands opened.

253
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:45,061
-What do you think of
that, Master Ichigo?

254
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:46,028
-Well, yeah.

255
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:48,295
I mean, to be honest, it's--

256
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:49,695
-What is it?

257
00:11:49,728 --> 00:11:51,228
-What do you mean, what is it?

258
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:52,528
How can you possibly ask that?

259
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,161
-Yeah, what do you
mean, what is it?

260
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:55,628
How can you possibly ask that?

261
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:01,428
-What's that?

262
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:02,395
-Ganju!

263
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:02,895
-Ganju!

264
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,380
-I think I recognize those guys.

265
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:09,346
Aren't they--

266
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,813
-Gah!

267
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:12,780
-Gah!

268
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:15,680
The great Kukkau
arms are broken!

269
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:19,213
GANJU: You're sure?

270
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:19,713
-Yeah.

271
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:20,913
Yeah!

272
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:22,680
-These guys came in and
started acting all tough.

273
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:25,046
You don't pull that kind
of crap in Kusajishi.

274
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,380
It's a pretty mean
town, but I've never

275
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,846
seen anything like these guys.

276
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,246
-Kusajishi, huh?

277
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,046
You think it's Kariya?

278
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,346
-Who knows?

279
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,313
But Kusajishi is just the
kind of place he'd look for.

280
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:37,746
-What do you mean?

281
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,080
-It's a tough town.

282
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:40,013
Real tough.

283
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:41,680
-That's putting it mildly.

284
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:44,780
It's one of the most dangerous
places in the Rukon District.

285
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:47,080
You've got to be tough
to survive in that place.

286
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:48,546
If they had a strong
enough leader,

287
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,913
they could be dangerous.

288
00:12:49,946 --> 00:12:52,880
-Aw, sis, I was just
about to say that myself.

289
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:54,280
-Give it a rest, Ganju.

290
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:56,380
Any moron could have
figured that out.

291
00:12:56,413 --> 00:13:00,013
Speaking of morons--
tell me, now.

292
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:03,613
What exactly were you two
doing in Kusajishi, anyway?

293
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:05,946
-Well, uh, you see, the
truth is we actually

294
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,880
went there to do
a little research.

295
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:08,946
-Oh, really?

296
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,446
-Yeah.

297
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,146
That was it.

298
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,480
You know what I mean?

299
00:13:11,513 --> 00:13:12,913
Kind of a fact finding mission.

300
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:14,080
-Tell me more.

301
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:18,346
-We were just studying
their society.

302
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,846
-If you've got to lie about
something you've done,

303
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,246
then you shouldn't
have been doing it!

304
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,046
[screaming]

305
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,046
-I-- I apologize.

306
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,646
-So, what are you gonna do?

307
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,646
-I'm going.

308
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,280
It may turn out to
be nothing, but it's

309
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:34,080
the only lead we've got.

310
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,280
-I thought you'd say that.

311
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:37,846
URYU: I'm coming with you.

312
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,480
-Hm?

313
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:39,446
-What the--

314
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,346
-Uryu.

315
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,413
-You decided to come back?

316
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:43,980
-Yeah.

317
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:45,046
What do you say?

318
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,513
You got room for
one more, Ganju?

319
00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:48,480
I'm ready.

320
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:49,413
Kariya is mine.

321
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:53,613
-Hmph.

322
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:54,713
Fine.

323
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:57,146
We leave bright and
early tomorrow morning.

324
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,380
-You'll never catch him
with that lazy attitude.

325
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:01,680
That's out there right and
strike while the iron's hot.

326
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:04,713
We'll give those Bounts an ass
whoopin' they won't forget.

327
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,446
-Uh-- yeah.

328
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,046
-Are you kidding, sis?

329
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,613
You could get lost
wandering around

330
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:11,546
that place in the
middle of the night.

331
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,580
-Does it look like I'm kidding?

332
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:14,080
-Ah!

333
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:14,580
No!

334
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:15,146
No!

335
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,046
All right, then.

336
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,846
Let's move out, everyone.

337
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,346
-Right!

338
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:28,180
-Pigs, huh?

339
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:30,280
-Don't ever call
them pigs, got it?

340
00:14:30,313 --> 00:14:32,113
Now listen, they've
all got names.

341
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:37,680
There's Bonnie, Connie, Cindy,
Mindy, Sunny, Hunny, Manny,

342
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:39,813
Nanny, and Kanbe.

343
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:40,946
-All right, what's up?

344
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,280
Why'd you give the last
one such a goofy name?

345
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:44,213
-Ah!

346
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:46,080
Kanbe's so cute.

347
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:49,246
You're a little
sweetie, aren't you?

348
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,946
-Hey!

349
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,846
Don't just stand there.

350
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,146
Let's get a move on.

351
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,713
-All right.

352
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:55,313
Saddle up.

353
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:55,913
-What?

354
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:56,480
Hey.

355
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:57,780
Are you insane?

356
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,713
You're not getting me on the
back of one of those pigs.

357
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:01,080
I'm outta here.

358
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:02,546
-I told you, they're not pigs!

359
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,646
-I'll see you there.

360
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,213
-Hold on, Ichigo.

361
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:06,180
No way.

362
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:07,380
If I had to ride
one of those things,

363
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:09,013
I don't know if
I'd ever get there.

364
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:14,713
-Son of a-- thinks he's too
good to ride on one of my boars.

365
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:15,380
-Ichigo's lucky.

366
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,646
He escaped.

367
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,813
-Mm.

368
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:19,713
-Wah!

369
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,780
Don't ever
underestimate my body.

370
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:23,280
Is everybody ready?

371
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:26,980
All right, light's
move 'em out, Bonnie!

372
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:27,946
Yeah!

373
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,913
-Whoa!

374
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:31,413
[giggle]

375
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,137
-The Kuchiki home.

376
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,437
I see.

377
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,269
They must have rescued me.

378
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:11,137
It's still warm.

379
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:11,637
Byakua.

380
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,403
-I'm so tired.

381
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:33,103
Who am I?

382
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:34,070
Where did I come from?

383
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:37,937
I can't go on.

384
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,770
No.

385
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:40,137
I can't let it end like this.

386
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,370
Not as a stranger
in a strange place.

387
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,437
-Thank you so much for waiting.

388
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,670
-Ah!

389
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:49,170
-This should warm you up.

390
00:16:49,203 --> 00:16:50,037
-How kind of you.

391
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,403
-Here you are.

392
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:53,670
-Wah!

393
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:55,837
Even when I've forgotten
who I am and where I'm from,

394
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,037
there are two things that
I'll always remember.

395
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,403
Those sweet himilayas
of happiness.

396
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,837
So bouncy and alive!

397
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,770
I think I'm in love!

398
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:05,737
Oh, lady?

399
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:11,103
-How am I supposed to-- whoa!

400
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:12,270
-Beginners shouldn't talk.

401
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:14,503
You'll bite your tongue off.

402
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:16,470
-Look at me!

403
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,370
-Considering this is
the first time I've

404
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:19,970
ridden on the back
of a wild boar,

405
00:17:20,003 --> 00:17:22,237
this is actually
quite exhilarating.

406
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,203
-It's so much fun!

407
00:17:25,237 --> 00:17:26,337
-All right.

408
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,603
We're about to head into
the forest, everyone.

409
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:30,937
So hang on tight, and
look out for branches.

410
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:42,770
-Please feel free to relax
and make yourselves at home.

411
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:45,170
-Can you gather
some capable men?

412
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:46,537
-It shouldn't be a problem.

413
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,970
There's no one around here who
will go against what I say.

414
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:53,603
Give me until tomorrow, and I'll
gather as many men as you want.

415
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,237
-I'm glad to hear it.

416
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,503
-Now, if you'll excuse me.

417
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:02,937
-I apologize.

418
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,270
I never should have
brought you to this town.

419
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:06,903
-Why apologize?

420
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:10,837
I'm enjoying myself immensely.

421
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,403
Tell me, Ichinose,
what do you think?

422
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:15,903
-Hm?

423
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:16,870
Ichinnose.

424
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:19,470
-Sorry, Master Kariya.

425
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:22,803
-Ichinose's been acting
strange ever since we arrived.

426
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:26,003
I think perhaps
something's bothering him.

427
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:29,037
-I've sensed the
same thing with you.

428
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,437
-Hm?

429
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,070
-I've been getting this
almost imperceptible feeling

430
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:37,637
that-- well, not that you
haven't been in high spirits.

431
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,737
-I have been in high spirits.

432
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,270
I find this place exhilarating.

433
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:47,303
In fact, I haven't had
this much fun in years.

434
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:49,370
It's like something's
been holding me back,

435
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:53,170
but I'm free now for
the very first time.

436
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:53,803
-Master Kariya.

437
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:59,970
-I'm going out.

438
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:01,837
-Master Kariya

439
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,637
-I sense someone interesting
is about to arrive.

440
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,803
-I'll come with you, then.

441
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:07,937
-No.

442
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,103
I prefer you stay here
and organize the locals.

443
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:12,470
That way I can have
this one all to myself.

444
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:20,237
-Ganju's comin' through!

445
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,037
-Hey.

446
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,003
Ganju.

447
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:23,270
I gotta ask you something.

448
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:23,770
-Yeah?

449
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:28,170
So what is it?

450
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:29,903
-I'm not sure exactly
how to say this,

451
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:33,770
but unless you've been
meaning to take us in circles,

452
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:35,837
we're lost.

453
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,970
-Oh, no.

454
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:37,670
-Not again.

455
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,437
-Did you enjoy it?

456
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,037
-Oh, yeah!

457
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,137
-Just let me know if
you want anything.

458
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,170
Anything at all.

459
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:51,103
-Yeah!

460
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:52,003
That's it.

461
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:53,737
I wanna live here forever.

462
00:19:59,137 --> 00:19:59,737
-All right.

463
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,903
Where are they?

464
00:20:00,937 --> 00:20:03,103
Uh-- there's nothing here.

465
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:05,003
I can't sense anything yet.

466
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,337
-Well, that's that.

467
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,737
I think we can all agree that
this is this and that is that,

468
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,370
right?

469
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:21,337
Ha ha ha ha ha!

470
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,303
[grumbling]

471
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:23,370
MAN: What the hell
are we doing out

472
00:20:23,403 --> 00:20:24,670
here in the middle
of the night, anyway?

473
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,770
-Hey.

474
00:20:25,803 --> 00:20:27,270
You think it's OK just
to leave him there?

475
00:20:27,303 --> 00:20:28,337
-Why ya askin' me?

476
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,137
You always think
you're so smart.

477
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,103
What do you think?

478
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:32,203
-I don't know.

479
00:20:32,237 --> 00:20:33,470
It all stinks.

480
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:36,070
But that guy's got some
weird power, that's for sure.

481
00:20:36,103 --> 00:20:38,070
-You are such a kiss
ass, you know that?

482
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,203
-Shut the hell up.

483
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,970
I just think we should
keep an eye on the guy.

484
00:20:41,003 --> 00:20:43,670
Huh?

485
00:20:43,703 --> 00:20:45,570
Who the hell are you?

486
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:47,770
-I'll ask the questions
here, if you don't mind.

487
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:49,237
-What are you talking about?

488
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,903
-Listen, numbnuts,
we're from Kusajishi.

489
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:52,937
-I see.

490
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,537
That'll make this easier, then.

491
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,070
-Huh?

492
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:56,403
-What the--

493
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:58,237
-Uh, is everything all right?

494
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,770
-I got the situation
under control.

495
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:03,103
After all, I'm Ganju
Shiba, the self

496
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:05,103
proclaimed former

of the West Rukon district.

00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:09,237
The self proclaimed fastest
cashier in Karakura.

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,070
Yeah!

-There's no doubt about it.

501
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:15,503
Ganju's definitely a
legend in his own mind.

502
00:21:15,537 --> 00:21:16,503
-Hm.

-So, then.

506
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,103
You're Jin Kariya.

507
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:47,903
-I am.

508
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:51,470
-You seem to think that you
can do whatever you like.

509
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:52,437
-Huh.

510

This Rukia Kuhchiki,
the Soul Reaper

511
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,637
that Yoshi cut up so badly.

512
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,870
I understand she happens
to be your younger sister.

513
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,203
Do you seek revenge?

514
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:08,203
-That's not why I'm here.

515
00:22:08,237 --> 00:22:10,303
I must protect this land.

516
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,837
And I will kill the enemies
of the Soul Society,

517
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,070
no matter who they are.

The fight of the century

Byakuya Kuchiki
versus Jin Kariya.

How about a Byakuya towel,
or a Senbon Zakura keychain?

some kind of circus!

-Yeah.

533
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:40,840
Just once I'd like to
get her under my thumb

534
00:24:40,873 --> 00:24:41,873
and show her who's boss.

you want, Ganju.

-Huh?

539

-Go ahead.

540
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,940
Now's your chance to tell
her what you really think.

541
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:56,040
-I get it.
