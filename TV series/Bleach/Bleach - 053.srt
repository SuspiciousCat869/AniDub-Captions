[theme music]

2
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:45,714
-[gasp] Renji.

3
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:50,014
Renji!

4
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:51,947
Why, why'd you do it?

5
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:52,447
Renji!

6
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:58,247
Huh?

7
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:04,355
[gasp]

8
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,288
-Good morning.

9
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:09,388
How are you today, Rukia dear?

10
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:10,855
-Ichimaru.

11
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:11,355
Gin.

12
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:19,388
ICHIMARU: Such bad
manners, Rukia.

13
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,655
But I see you are just the
same as you always were-- still

14
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:23,855
rude.

15
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:26,388
You know, you must
always address me only

16
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:28,455
as Captain Ichimaru.

17
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:31,455
If you're not careful, you
may get a serious scolding

18
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:34,822
from your brother, Byakuyu.

19
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:38,322
-I apologize, Captain Ichimaru.

20
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:40,488
-[laughs] Oh, no.

21
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:42,488
Did you think I was serious?

22
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:43,388
Don't worry.

23
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:45,355
I'm about to turn you in.

24
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:47,455
I really don't even
mind, since you and I

25
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:49,122
have known each
other for so long.

26
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:52,622
-I know that you didn't come
by to make small talk, Captain.

27
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,755
Tell me, why are you here?

28
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:59,422
-Well, I suppose no
particular reason, Rukia.

29
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:01,122
I was out taking
a walk and thought

30
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:04,455
I'd visit, just to
tease you a little bit.

31
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,355
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): I
never liked this man.

32
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:14,488
The first time we met was before
I joined the 13 Court Guard

33
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:19,722
Squads, just after my brother
was made captain of Squad Six.

34
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:23,088
Gin became captain of Squad
Three about the same time.

35
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:25,255
And I remember him
chatting with Byakuyu

36
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,355
whenever they happened to meet.

37
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:30,855
It didn't look like anything
other than two captains

38
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:32,922
exchanging pleasantries.

39
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:35,822
There was never anything
of any substance said.

40
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:37,688
So to an outsider,
they would have

41
00:03:37,722 --> 00:03:40,222
seemed like normal
conversations.

42
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:43,988
But they never seemed
that way to me.

43
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:46,388
From the first time I
laid eyes on this man,

44
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:50,655
I broke out in a cold
sweat all over my body.

45
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,955
His fingertips, his
lips, the way his eyes

46
00:03:53,988 --> 00:03:57,688
narrowed and shifted-- he
reminded me of a snake.

47
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:59,622
And though he was
speaking to my brother,

48
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:02,588
I felt as if he had his
hands around my neck.

49
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:07,288
I was frozen, afraid
even to blink my eyes.

50
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:09,988
I've always hated this man.

51
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:12,522
It seemed like he could find
the smallest crack in those

52
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:16,822
around him and seep deep
down into you, like venom.

53
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:20,755
That's the kind of
fear he arouses.

54
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:24,455
I've never had any rational
reason for feeling this way.

55
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:25,988
But something
inside me has always

56
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:28,388
rejected everything about him.

57
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:31,455
Despite the many times
we've spoken over the years,

58
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,955
those feelings
have never changed.

59
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:37,922
Even now, I still feel
that way about him.

60
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:40,222
ICHIMARU: What's the matter?

61
00:04:40,255 --> 00:04:43,722
It seems you fell
into a trance there.

62
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:46,622
-Sort of.

63
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:50,022
-By the way, seems he
isn't actually dead yet--

64
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:51,822
Renji, that is.

65
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:55,088
-[gasp]

66
00:04:55,122 --> 00:04:56,455
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): It's true.

67
00:04:56,488 --> 00:04:58,055
I have to concentrate
and search,

68
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:01,888
but I can still sense
Renji's spiritual pressure.

69
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:04,055
But it's so weak.

70
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:07,888
-But he will die soon.

71
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:09,822
It's kind of the pathetic.

72
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:12,488
He tried to save your life,
but he just got cut to pieces.

73
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,722
-Don't you dare
make light of him!

74
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:19,155
-Are you afraid?

75
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:19,622
-Afraid?

76
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:21,422
Of what?

77
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,055
-You don't want
Renji and the others

78
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:25,688
to die trying to
rescue you, do you?

79
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:27,088
Knowing they're
trying to save you

80
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:28,722
must make this all
the more painful.

81
00:05:33,255 --> 00:05:36,355
Want me to save you?

82
00:05:36,388 --> 00:05:37,322
-Ca-- Captain Ichimaru.

83
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:38,655
-You don't mean it.

84
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:39,922
-What are you saying, sir?

85
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:42,622
-I could rescue you
from this execution

86
00:05:42,655 --> 00:05:46,755
and save your life right
now-- you and Renji,

87
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:47,955
and the others, too.

88
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:52,022
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
Is he serious?

89
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:55,388
What could he possibly
have to gain by saving me?

90
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,055
There's even less
reason for him to want

91
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:59,122
to save Ichigo and Renji.

92
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:01,588
Why would he say such a thing?

93
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:05,822
-You think I'm kidding?

94
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:06,455
I am.

95
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:11,422
Bye bye, Rukia.

96
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,122
I'll see once more
at the Sokyoku.

97
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:16,522
RUKIA (VOICEOVER):
I can't believe

98
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:18,355
I let him do that to me.

99
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:22,488
After I had abandoned all
hope, accepted my fate

100
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:26,888
and my impending death, he
was able to shake my resolve.

101
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:29,188
By holding out that
small sliver of hope,

102
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,822
he managed to make
me yearn just a bit.

103
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:35,288
He made me want to live again.

104
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:39,255
How could he have shattered
my strength so easily?

105
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:43,655
-[screams]

106
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:50,522
-Hm?

107
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:51,522
-Huh?

108
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:53,355
KENPACHI: Don't let
your guard down.

109
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:54,888
You make it too easy for me.

110
00:06:58,122 --> 00:06:59,155
-Kaname!

111
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,688
-What are you looking
around for, idiot?

112
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:07,622
This is ridiculous.

113
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:09,655
How did the two of you
ever become captains

114
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:10,922
in the first place?

115
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:12,722
Come on and stand up.

116
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:15,222
You don't look to me
like you're dead yet.

117
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:18,555
At least die like a captain
and release your Bankai first.

118
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:21,655
-What would you know of a
captain's honor, traitor?

119
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:24,055
You're not even
worthy of Bankai.

120
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:26,355
TOSEN: Hold it, Sajin.

121
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:30,822
Leave this to me.

122
00:07:30,855 --> 00:07:34,288
There are three ways to become
a captain in the 13 Court Guard

123
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:35,355
Squads.

124
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,455
The first is to pass
the captain's exam,

125
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:41,455
presided over by three other
captains, including the head

126
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,022
captain himself.

127
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:46,422
The second is to receive the
recommendation of six or more

128
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:49,122
captains and be acknowledged
by at least three

129
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:51,288
of the remaining seven captains.

130
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:53,922
The only other way is to
defeat the previous captain

131
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:56,455
in a one-on-one
battle, which must

132
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:59,588
be witnessed by 200
or squad members.

133
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:01,388
-[laughs] So what's your point?

134
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:04,022
-Ever since the moment you
killed the former captain

135
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:07,688
of Squad 11 and replaced
him Kenpachi Zaraki,

136
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:11,088
I felt a deep unease
about you, unease

137
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,455
that has become a certainty.

138
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:16,522
A certainty that you're a demon,
that you thrive on violence

139
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:19,588
and blood, that you're
different from the rest of us.

140
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:22,288
And a certainty that
you are bound someday

141
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:24,522
to destroy the peace.

142
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:27,688
And sure enough, now you
have saved the Ryoka.

143
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:30,455
And here you fight
against us, threatening

144
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:33,855
to bring even more
chaos to the Seiretei.

145
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,055
And it's all because of
your insatiable bloodlust

146
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:39,255
and your love of fighting
for its own sake.

147
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:41,055
Am I wrong?

148
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,588
-I don't know about
right or wrong.

149
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,455
But I can see you sure
have a problem when

150
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:46,322
it comes to getting
to the point.

151
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:48,222
Enough babbling.

152
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:51,022
If you hate me so much, then
there's no need for speeches.

153
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:53,188
Just shut up and
attack me already.

154
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:54,388
-No hatred.

155
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:57,888
I never actually said that
I hated you, Kenpachi.

156
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:00,455
I simply find you unforgivable!

157
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:02,522
Everything you do
threatens the peace

158
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:05,055
we have worked so hard
to establish here.

159
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:07,655
So in the name of
justice, I now have

160
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:09,688
no choice but to erase you.

161
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:10,188
-Kaname.

162
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:20,088
-Bankai.

163
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:39,722
Suzumushi Tsushiki, Emma Korogi.

164
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:45,555
So you wanted to see my Bankai?

165
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:47,022
This is it.

166
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:50,722
This entire space
is now my Bankai.

167
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:59,055
So, tell me, Kenpachi
Zaraki, what do you think?

168
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:02,488
You can see nothing
and hear nothing.

169
00:10:02,522 --> 00:10:04,255
KENPACHI: What is this?

170
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:05,188
I can't see.

171
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:06,755
And I can't hear a sound.

172
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:11,388
-Do you find it a
little frightening,

173
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:14,422
a world without sight or sound?

174
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:17,588
The Emma Korogi steals
all spiritual pressure,

175
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:20,488
all perceptions and
sense of those within it,

176
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:24,988
and creates in their
place a dark, silent hell.

177
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:28,022
There is only one man
who can escape this cell,

178
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:30,088
and that is he who
wields Suzumushi.

179
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:35,455
It's useless.

180
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:38,088
You are far too
slow to counter me.

181
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:39,988
No matter how
skilled one may be,

182
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:42,822
when deprived of light so
suddenly, it is the end.

183
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:45,788
With the sudden darkness,
a tiny fear is born.

184
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:49,355
Total darkness always causes
at least a twinge of fear.

185
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:51,622
But I, who have known
only darkness since birth

186
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:52,488
have no [inaudible].

187
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:53,955
-[grunt]

188
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:55,922
-[gasp]

189
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,355
-[laughs]

190
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:01,788
-I was right.

191
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:04,555
You are some kind
of demon after all,

192
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:08,122
with no fear of the
dark to begin with.

193
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:10,555
Then I shall attack
first and not

194
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,022
give you a chance to feel fear.

195
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:18,455
-It's not over!

196
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:20,622
[shouts]

197
00:11:32,788 --> 00:11:34,522
[shouts]

198
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:36,522
[fighting noises]

199
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,688
YORUICHI (VOICEOVER):
Ichigo, we're out of time.

200
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:55,055
-After all that, I can't believe
that my resolve was so weak.

201
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:55,688
How depressing.

202
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:04,229
SHUHEI: Whoa.

203
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:07,863
That's Captain
Tosen's Emma Korogi.

204
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:11,396
He must've been in trouble
if he had to use his Bankai.

205
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:14,429
Whatever it is, I had better get
up there in case he needs help.

206
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,996
YUMICHIKA: Not so fast.

207
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:18,763
You haven't finished
me off yet, you know.

208
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:20,863
SHUHEI: Who do you
think you're kidding?

209
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:22,129
You're beaten.

210
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:25,029
YUMICHIKA: Sorry to disappoint
you, but in Squad 11,

211
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:27,429
you're not beaten
until you're dead.

212
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:29,463
SHUHEI: That's different
from Squad Nine.

213
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:31,629
YUMICHIKA: As different
as black and white.

214
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:34,063
And that's why we never
give up on a fight.

215
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:35,763
-Maybe.

216
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,363
But you ought to
give up on this one,

217
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:39,696
because there's no way a
lowly Fifth Seat is ever

218
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:42,229
going to beat a lieutenant.

219
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:45,429
YUMICHIKA: Shall I tell
you a little secret?

220
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:47,796
The only reason I'm
still a Fifth Seat

221
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:50,929
is because I really don't like
the look of the number four.

222
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:52,496
-What do you mean?

223
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:55,529
YUMICHIKA: I think the number
three is the most attractive.

224
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:59,129
But of course, Ikkaku
already has the Third Seat.

225
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:01,196
So I chose the Fifth
Seat, five being

226
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:04,363
the closest in resemblance
to the number three.

227
00:13:04,396 --> 00:13:06,829
And there's more to my secret.

228
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:11,429
You see, in Squad 11 we
have an unspoken agreement.

229
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:13,596
We live to fight.

230
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,196
And in keeping with
that, we believe

231
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:18,529
that Zanpakuto should be used
strictly for direct attacks,

232
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:23,129
and that all those Kido attacks
are for idiots and cowards.

233
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:27,129
Let me show you what I mean.

234
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:28,563
I would imagine
that by now, you're

235
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:32,229
curious about the true
power of my Zanpakuto.

236
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:35,363
What I'm about to show you
is confidential, of course.

237
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:38,729
My captain and Ikkaku will be
mad at me if they find out.

238
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:39,463
-Why, you--

239
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,996
-How can I still be alive?

240
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:59,196
-Oh, hello there.

241
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:01,663
-What are you doing
caring for me?

242
00:14:01,696 --> 00:14:03,629
RIKICHI: I brought him here.

243
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:04,629
RENJI: Rikichi?

244
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:05,896
I don't understand.

245
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,129
-They threw Hanataro in jail
for trying to help Rukia.

246
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:11,563
So I thought since you
both have the same goal,

247
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:13,896
he'd be willing to help you.

248
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:16,096
-Rikichi waited until
no one was around,

249
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,929
and then he unlocked my cell.

250
00:14:17,963 --> 00:14:19,929
-Thank you for helping me.

251
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:22,229
HANATARO: Actually
I didn't do much.

252
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:24,396
I don't know who did it,
but your wounds had already

253
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,829
been very well treated and
bound by someone else when

254
00:14:26,863 --> 00:14:27,996
I got here.

255
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,063
There's only one
could have done it.

256
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:35,229
But don't worry about that now.

257
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,163
You just get
stronger, Lieutenant.

258
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:39,296
You can count on
Ichigo to save Rukia.

259
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:40,829
I just know he can do it.

260
00:14:40,863 --> 00:14:43,229
RIKICHI: Yes,
Lieutenant, get well.

261
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:46,029
I was shocked that you
actually lost to the Ryoka.

262
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:47,596
And then to make
matters worse, we

263
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:49,929
learned you had broken out
of jail and disappeared.

264
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:51,963
And I couldn't believe
you would raise your sword

265
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:54,729
against members
of your own squad.

266
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:58,029
But then I remembered
the only reason

267
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,796
I joined Squad Six
in the first place

268
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,129
was because you were my hero.

269
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:03,296
And so no matter
what happens, I want

270
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:07,229
you to live, Lieutenant,
and keep on battling.

271
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,629
I want you to be the Lieutenant
I know, who's always cool

272
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:12,229
and always fighting for
what he believes in.

273
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:12,729
-Rikichi.

274
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:20,396
TOSEN (VOICEOVER):
How can this be?

275
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:23,729
He has no sense of
sight or sound or smell.

276
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:27,063
He cannot sense
spiritual pressure.

277
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:30,629
-So then how is he
able to counter me?

278
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:34,996
KENPACHI: [laughs]

279
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:36,363
TOSEN (VOICEOVER):
Once again, he

280
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:40,229
dodges a fatal blow
at the last second.

281
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:42,063
-[grunts]

282
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:43,763
TOSEN (VOICEOVER):
Every time he parries,

283
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:46,529
his counterattacks get
more accurate, too.

284
00:15:46,563 --> 00:15:48,463
Is he really a demon after all?

285
00:15:51,096 --> 00:15:52,896
KENPACHI (VOICEOVER):
I got a hit this time.

286
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:55,596
Just a graze, but still.

287
00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:00,096
This Bankai that destroys
senses is a nuisance.

288
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:03,429
But at least I still
have my sense of touch.

289
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,063
And as long as I
have that, I can

290
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:09,429
feel the moment his
blade makes contact,

291
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:12,663
then dodge and counterattack.

292
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:15,663
So I know he's not going
to be able to kill me.

293
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:19,063
And I'm starting to
inflict some damage on him.

294
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:21,196
But this is a
boring way to fight.

295
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:23,696
It's so much more
fun to cut and slash.

296
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:27,529
I have to concentrate since
I can't see or hear him.

297
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:31,263
And I never felt much spiritual
pressure to begin with.

298
00:16:31,296 --> 00:16:32,396
Damn it.

299
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:34,263
Why do I have to waste
time thinking instead

300
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:36,896
of just fighting him head on?

301
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,763
-Use your instincts, Kenny!

302
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:41,529
KENPACHI (VOICEOVER): What
do you think I've been doing?

303
00:16:41,563 --> 00:16:43,929
-Maybe you should be
using that mind-eye thing

304
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:45,629
to try and visualize
your enemy, you know?

305
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:47,363
KENPACHI (VOICEOVER):
If I could do that,

306
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:49,096
I wouldn't be
having this problem.

307
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:49,996
-Let's me think.

308
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,529
What would I do?

309
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:54,129
I would give up in
a beautiful way.

310
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:56,129
KENPACHI (VOICEOVER): You'd die.

311
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:56,996
Huh?

312
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,096
That's it.

313
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,596
That's what I'll do.

314
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:02,129
Then I'll know
exactly where he is.

315
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:06,929
TOSEN (VOICEOVER):
He's smiling again.

316
00:17:06,963 --> 00:17:10,296
Even though, he's losing,
he's still enjoying the fight.

317
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,896
You're dangerous,
Kenpachi Zaraki, far too

318
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:14,229
dangerous to be allowed to live!

319
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:19,429
What?

320
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:20,296
No.

321
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,629
He didn't even dodge.

322
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:25,696
-Well, hello.

323
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:26,929
So we meet again.

324
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:27,429
-Impossible.

325
00:17:32,796 --> 00:17:36,396
-Now I can see you
again, and hear you.

326
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:40,296
Is that just because I
have a direct hold on you?

327
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:42,529
Or is it because my
body and your sword

328
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,463
are in direct contact?

329
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:47,563
Either way, it doesn't matter.

330
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:49,229
Come over here and attack me.

331
00:17:49,263 --> 00:17:51,529
I know your trick now.

332
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:53,929
Next time, before you
even penetrate my body,

333
00:17:53,963 --> 00:17:55,363
I'll be able to grab your arm.

334
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:02,463
TOSEN (VOICEOVER): Damn you.

335
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:04,263
I must not lose.

336
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:06,196
I must destroy you.

337
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:09,096
I can never lose to
the likes of you.

338
00:18:13,496 --> 00:18:16,363
-I wish I could gather all
the clouds so they would never

339
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,896
again obscure the light
that shines from the stars.

340
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,396
-That's beautiful.

341
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:25,929
-I'm going to be a Soul Reaper,
Kaname, and let justice shine.

342
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:29,229
TOSEN: But she
died much too soon.

343
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:32,363
If it's not enough to believe
in justice, then for her,

344
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:34,563
I swear I will become
justice and seek out

345
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:37,263
all the evil in this world
so that I may wipe it out,

346
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,929
like the wind casts away
the clouds in the sky.

347
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,163
[shouting]

348
00:18:58,196 --> 00:18:59,329
-Kaname.

349
00:18:59,363 --> 00:19:03,596
TOSEN: [gasping]

350
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:06,296
This isn't finished.

351
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:08,096
Not yet.

352
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:09,196
-Yes it is.

353
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:10,429
I quit.

354
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,163
I have no interest in
fighting a man with one foot

355
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:14,429
already in the grave.

356
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:16,196
I'm out of here.

357
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:17,363
Dying is futile.

358
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:19,063
What can a dead man do?

359
00:19:19,096 --> 00:19:23,663
He can't fight anymore,
that's for sure.

360
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:28,129
-I swear it, if it takes my
very life I will stop you.

361
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:31,196
I will use every ounce
of justice in my being.

362
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:33,329
-What an idiot you are.

363
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:38,463
If you want to die so
badly, I'll help you.

364
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:40,296
Hm?

365
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,029
-No, Sajin.

366
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:44,563
-Don't sacrifice
yourself Kaname.

367
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:50,896
This man will never understand
your quest for justice.

368
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:52,563
-Sajin, I-- I.

369
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:53,063
-I know.

370
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,863
-So that's what's
under that basket.

371
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:00,196
I always wondered.

372
00:20:00,229 --> 00:20:02,296
But I have to admit that it
wasn't what I was expecting.

373
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:08,963
-You don't seem shocked
by what you see.

374
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:10,696
-Outward appearances
have nothing

375
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:12,596
to do with fighting abilities.

376
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,329
The only question is if
you're beastly appearance also

377
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:18,296
means you fight with a
beast's strength and tenacity.

378
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:21,296
That's what matters.

379
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,663
KOMAMURA: You see only
what's on the surface.

380
00:20:23,696 --> 00:20:27,263
You have no respect for an
opponent's inner strength.

381
00:20:27,296 --> 00:20:29,363
That is your weakness.

382
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,163
I am not like Kaname.

383
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,829
I will not show
the same kindness.

384
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:34,329
Bankai!

385
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:45,396
Kokujo Tengen Myo'o!

386
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:49,029
Now it begins in earnest,
Kenpachi Zaraki, our fight

387
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:51,529
to the death-- just
the kind you love!

388
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:57,729
KENPACHI: [laughs] A
fight to the death, huh?

389
00:20:57,763 --> 00:21:00,063
That means I can come at
you with everything I got.

390
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:02,963
And then after you're dead,
go reincarnate yourself

391
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,796
so I can kill you all again!

392
00:21:10,963 --> 00:21:12,963
-Now the time has arrived.

393
00:21:12,996 --> 00:21:14,596
Let us begin the execution.

394
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:29,296
SUI-FENG (VOICEOVER):
It seems odd

395
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,329
that so few people showed up.

396
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:33,896
Captains and lieutenants from
Squad One and our Squad Two

397
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:36,396
are here, plus
Kuriko's Squad Eight.

398
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:39,096
It's no surprise Squads
5, 11, and 12 are missing,

399
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:40,429
given their casualties.

400
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:42,296
And I think Zaraki's lost it.

401
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:45,229
But what about all the
rest of the officers?

402
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:48,129
I thought that at least Unohana
would have wanted to be here.

403
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:49,596
[gasp]

404
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:55,963
-[gasp]

405
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:03,329
My brother.

406
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:18,263
-Rukia Kuchiki, it is time.

407
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:19,896
Any last words before
your execution?

408
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:26,429
RUKIA: Yes.

409
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:28,163
Just one.

410
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:38,236
