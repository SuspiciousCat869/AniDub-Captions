00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:49,696
SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Good morning, Ichigo!

4
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:51,581
Ya!

5
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:53,081
Ha!

6
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,781
Aw!

7
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,048
-You nuts?

8
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:58,281
What kind of sick, twisted
freak attacks his own son

9
00:01:58,314 --> 00:02:00,114
while he's just
lying there sleeping?

10
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:01,348
-You are getting good!

11
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:02,781
It looks like
there's nothing left

12
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:04,481
for me to teach you, my son.

13
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:06,414
-[grunt] Huh?

14
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:07,393
Wait a minute!

15
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:10,060
What about Kagine and Yuzu's
injuries from last night?

16
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:10,827
-Huh?

17
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,593
Injuries?

18
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:12,827
What are you talking about?

19
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,327
-What?

20
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:18,227
-It's a miracle!

21
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,693
A truck plows right into
our house and none of us

22
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:22,893
even get so much as
a single scratch!

23
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:25,193
-What's more miraculous is
the fact that none of us

24
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:27,160
even woke up when it happened.

25
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:28,393
-I don't get it.

26
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:31,293
Their wounds are
completely gone.

27
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:33,893
They think that a
truck did all this?

28
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:37,527
Could this have been the
work of that soul reaper?

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
-Ichigo!

30
00:02:38,593 --> 00:02:40,227
You better hurry up
and eat breakfast,

31
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,427
or you're going to be late!

32
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:41,927
-Yeah.

33
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,760
I wonder if she went
back to that place

34
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,393
she was talking about.

35
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:51,560
The Soul Society.

36
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:02,827
-Orihime!

37
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,327
Did you bring lunch today?

38
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,527
Mm-hm!

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,327
Leftover Taiyaki-style
Ramen with Wasabi and honey.

40
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,827
Would you like some, Tatsuki?

41
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,093
-That's OK.

42
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:16,460
-But it's really good!

43
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:18,993
Ah!

44
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:19,993
-Oh, it's you.

45
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:20,693
Hey, Orihime.

46
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:22,560
-Oh no, I'm sorry!

47
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:23,693
-Ichigo!

48
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:25,193
You knock her down, and
that's all you can say?

49
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:26,893
What the heck's the
matter with you?

50
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,327
-Sorry about that.

51
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,427
You going to be all right?

52
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,727
-Uh-huh.

53
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,860
-Here.

54
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:33,593
-Huh?

55
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:35,360
Ah!

56
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:36,127
Oh no!

57
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,093
That's all right, really!

58
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:40,060
I-- I-- have v--
v-- v-- volleyball!

59
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:40,993
That's right!

60
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:41,493
Volleyball!

61
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:43,693
-Orihime!

62
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:45,093
-What's the matter with her?

63
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:46,260
-What could it be?

64
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,360
Maybe it was your ugly mug!

65
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,227
By the way, why are you so late?

66
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,060
I mean, it's time
for much already.

67
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:54,660
-Yeah, don't worry about it.

68
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,527
I'll tell you later.

69
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:00,127
SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Hey, Ichigo!

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,160
I heard a truck crashed into
your house last night, dude!

71
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:04,093
-Pretty much.

72
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:05,827
-So, did you clean
it all up yet?

73
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,960
-What are you, kidding?

74
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:08,593
It's going to take forever.

75
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:09,227
-Need any help?

76
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,993
-Uh?

77
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:10,493
Huh?

78
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:15,327
That's OK.

79
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,593
-Yeah, Chad.

80
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:18,393
I mean, you could end up
bringing the whole house down,

81
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:19,193
you know?

82
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:20,260
-Hey, what have we got next?

83
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,227
SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Language lab.

84
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,027
-Hello.

85
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,527
You're Ichigo, aren't you?

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,493
-Uh?

87
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:24,993
Wha?

88
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:30,860
-I'll be sitting next
to you from now on.

89
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:32,293
My name is Rukia.

90
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:34,627
-[scream] It's-- it's you!

91
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,493
-Hey, Ichigo!

92
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:36,660
What's wrong with you?

93
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,360
-You two know each-other?

94
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:39,127
-Course not!

95
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,327
We've never met before!

96
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,393
Isn't that right, Ichigo?

97
00:04:41,427 --> 00:04:42,860
-[sigh]

98
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:45,260
-Rukia's a brand new
transfer student.

99
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,993
-Nice to meet you!

100
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:47,727
-It's a pleasure!

101
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,327
-Uh?

102
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,327
[shock] All right, you
freaky little nut job.

103
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,993
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

104
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:59,460
-How scary, you big brute.

105
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:01,993
Jeepers, you're not going
to hurt me, are you?

106
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:04,893
-First of all, you can knock it
off with that goody two shoes

107
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:05,993
act, OK?

108
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:07,860
-Well, I think it's
pretty good, considering

109
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,127
I learned it overnight.

110
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
-All right, forget it.

111
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:12,860
So tell me just what you're
doing here now, anyway.

112
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:14,627
Weren't you supposed
to be heading back to

113
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,227
your Soul Society
or whatever it was?

114
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,427
-I can't.

115
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,193
Only soul reapers can go
back to the Soul Society.

116
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,727
I haven't the power
to return anymore.

117
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,127
-What you mean?

118
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,160
-Last night, I lost almost all
of my powers as a soul reaper.

119
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:30,727
I'm afraid they were all
absorbed into you, Ichigo.

120
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,693
-Huh?

121
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:33,227
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

122
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,893
Thanks to you, for
the time being,

123
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:37,427
I'm stuck in this
ridiculous gigai form.

124
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,127
-What do you mean by gigai?

125
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,993
-It's a temporary
body that serves

126
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:43,893
as a vessel in an emergency.

127
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,193
If the soul reaper is
drastically weakened,

128
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:49,227
they reside inside of a gigai
until their powers come back.

129
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,760
-Oh, now I get it.

130
00:05:50,793 --> 00:05:53,427
So that's why the others were
able to see you before, right?

131
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,493
-Precisely.

132
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:58,160
And so, until all of
my powers come back,

133
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,393
it's up to you,
Ichigo, to perform

134
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,827
the duties of a soul reaper.

135
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,827
-Huh?

136
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,127
RUKIA (OFFSCREEN):
It's only natural.

137
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,593
You now possess the
strength of a soul reaper.

138
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:09,160
You do not have the right
to refuse your calling.

139
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:10,360
-No way!

140
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:11,327
-What?

141
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,293
-My monster fighting
days are over.

142
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:14,693
That was a one-time deal.

143
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:16,327
-Don't be ridiculous Ichigo.

144
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,827
You did just fine yesterday.

145
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,560
-That was only because
my family was in danger.

146
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:23,360
But it's not like I'm
ready to go and fight

147
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:25,560
for complete
strangers or anything.

148
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,860
Sorry to disappoint you.

149
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:31,760
-I see.

150
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:34,127
Guess there's no
other choice, then.

151
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,760
Hey.

152
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:35,760
-Huh?

153
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:36,660
Huh?

154
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:39,194
-[grunt]

155
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:44,193
-Ah, crap!

156
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:45,860
What happened to my body?

157
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:48,393
What in the world
did you do to me?

158
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:49,127
-Follow me.

159
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:54,893
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Hey, you going

160
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:57,627
to tell me where
we're going, here?

161
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,893
-We're getting close.

162
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:00,160
-Close to what?

163
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:03,960
-Our latest orders
from the soul society.

164
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:06,860
It looks like a spirit of a boy
that dwells here in this park

165
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,893
is likely to come
under attack soon.

166
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:11,668
-[boy screaming]

167
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:18,127
-[grunt]

168
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,127
-[boy screaming] Help me!

169
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,627
-Wait!

170
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,793
Hold on!

171
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:23,560
-What is it?

172
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:24,960
-Just where are you going?

173
00:07:24,993 --> 00:07:28,260
-That boy's a complete
stranger, isn't he?

174
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:29,360
-So what?

175
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:30,960
I can't just stand by
and let this happen.

176
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:32,893
You expect me to watch him die?

177
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:35,927
-Don't be such a fool.

178
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,127
-In the eyes of a soul reaper,
all the spirits of this world

179
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,327
are equal.

180
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,760
Getting involved simply
because spirits are nearby

181
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:45,093
or they need help
isn't how it works.

182
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:45,927
-Huh?

183
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,560
RUKIO (OFFSCREEN): Leave him be.

184
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,227
If you intend to
help this child,

185
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,227
then commit yourself
to saving every spirit.

186
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,327
You must be willing
to go to any length,

187
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,660
even to sacrifice your life.

188
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:23,895
[gasp]

189
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:34,460
-Have you made your
decision, Ichigo?

190
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:35,727
-Like hell, I have.

191
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,560
-Huh?

192
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:38,693
-I haven't decided to do squat.

193
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,427
I saved this kid
because I wanted to.

194
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,027
You hear me?

195
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,327
What about you?

196
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,593
-Me?

197
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,260
-I seem to remember you
putting your life on the line

198
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:52,693
to save me last night.

199
00:08:52,727 --> 00:08:53,693
Tell me.

200
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:55,127
Were you really
thinking about your duty

201
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,560
when you rushed to help me?

202
00:08:58,593 --> 00:08:59,927
Of course not.

203
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,893
That's the last thing on your
mind when you save someone.

204
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:02,393
-Huh?

205
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:11,993
-At the very least, I
choose to be different!

206
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:31,927
You OK?

207
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,760
Hey, kid.

208
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,560
If you don't want to
go through that again,

209
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:40,493
you better hurry up
and pass on already.

210
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,762
[gasp]

211
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,255
[gasp]

212
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,160
-You did that quite beautifully.

213
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:14,860
-I'm gone.

214
00:10:38,727 --> 00:10:40,727
[sigh]

215
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,493
[gasp]

216
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:43,227
[gasp]

217
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:49,860
[scream]

218
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:51,427
-What are you doing?

219
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,993
Stop!

220
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,727
[scream]

221
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,127
[slow footsteps]

222
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,060
[growl]

223
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:06,527
[roar]

224
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,427
-What's happening?

225
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,760
Where am I?

226
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:10,860
I don't understand.

227
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:15,127
What are you going to
do to me? [moaning]

228
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,427
SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You
are a lost little spirit.

229
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,160
Now, let's devour this soul.

230
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:27,355
[crying]

231
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,960
-Get him!

232
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:34,460
[panting]

233
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,893
[maniacal laughter]

234
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:51,793
[muffled cry]

235
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:58,028
[roar]

236
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:18,631
-Hear my voice, oh Lord. Help
your humble child understand

237
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:20,297
why she was born.

238
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:22,064
And if your divine
will wishes it,

239
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:24,231
summon her back to your side.

240
00:12:24,264 --> 00:12:25,431
I await your-- G

241
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,197
-Jeeze, would you
shut up already?

242
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:28,631
-What is your problem?

243
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,897
I am studying
contemporary language.

244
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:32,797
-You're off by a
couple centuries.

245
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:33,897
So tell me.

246
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:35,231
How long do you plan
on following me around?

247
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:37,931
-Until you answer your
calling as a soul reaper.

248
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:38,531
-Yeah, right.

249
00:12:38,564 --> 00:12:39,031
Whatever.

250
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:47,397
-Hey!

251
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:50,964
Orihime!

252
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:53,297
-Uh, Ichigo!

253
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:55,264
-Did you just get
hit by that car?

254
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:55,997
-Oh!

255
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:57,164
Maybe.

256
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,531
-What you mean, maybe?

257
00:12:58,564 --> 00:12:59,964
Are you going to be OK?

258
00:12:59,997 --> 00:13:00,931
-Mm-hm!

259
00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:02,364
It was just a little
bump on my head.

260
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:02,897
Don't worry!

261
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:03,664
I'm fine.

262
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:04,464
I swear!

263
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:05,964
-You sure you're OK?

264
00:13:05,997 --> 00:13:07,431
Where did that car
go that hit you?

265
00:13:07,464 --> 00:13:08,964
-Hm?

266
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,331
It drove away.

267
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:12,697
-Orihime!

268
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,997
-Oh, sorry.

269
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:17,864
[grunt]

270
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,197
-Well, all right.

271
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,797
I guess as long as
you're OK, then.

272
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:23,797
-Rukia?

273
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:25,431
-That's right, and
just who are you?

274
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:26,264
-Hello!

275
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:27,831
She's in the same class as you!

276
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:29,031
Her name is Orihime!

277
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:30,331
Get your head out of your butt!

278
00:13:30,364 --> 00:13:31,164
-Huh?

279
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:32,131
Oh, of course!

280
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:32,831
Orihime!

281
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:34,031
How are you?

282
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,297
-Oh, I'm great, thank you!

283
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:37,897
-Well now, it appears
that you've been shopping.

284
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:38,731
-Huh?

285
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:39,564
Oh, that's right!

286
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:40,997
Dinner!

287
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:43,664
My leeks, bananas, butter, and
bean germ seem to have made it,

288
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,997
too!

289
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:46,331
-Ugh.

290
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:48,031
I don't want to know what
she's going to make with that.

291
00:13:48,064 --> 00:13:48,897
[gasp]

292
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,231
-How did you get that
bruise on your leg?

293
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:54,797
-What bruise?

294
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:58,431
Oh, I guess that happened just
now when that car ran into me.

295
00:13:58,464 --> 00:13:59,131
-Jeeze!

296
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:00,131
Does it hurt?

297
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:00,897
-A little bit!

298
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:02,531
But I'm OK.

299
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:03,097
-You sure?

300
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:08,164
-Um, what's the matter, Rukio?

301
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:08,831
-Huh?

302
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:10,964
-Is Anything wrong?

303
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:13,497
-Right, well, you take care!

304
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:14,831
-Thanks!

305
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:16,197
-So you want me
to walk you home?

306
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:16,864
-Oh!

307
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,597
Uh, I'm OK, really.

308
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:20,564
See ya!

309
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:28,997
-Man, she needs to
be more careful.

310
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:29,497
-Hm.

311
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:44,697
-So then, that girl.

312
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:45,397
-Huh?

313
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:46,931
Oh, do you mean Orihime?

314
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:48,664
-Are you close to her?

315
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:49,864
-Naw, I'm not really.

316
00:14:49,897 --> 00:14:52,097
I barely know her, and we
don't really talk much.

317
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:54,631
But she's friends with a buddy
of mine from the neighborhood,

318
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:56,964
so I see her around.

319
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:57,564
Although--

320
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,197
-Yes?

321
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,731
-Around three years back or
so, her older brother Sora

322
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:05,764
was in this terrible accent
and died at our clinic.

323
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:06,264
-What?

324
00:15:10,464 --> 00:15:12,631
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
He was in a car wreck.

325
00:15:12,664 --> 00:15:16,597
He was the only family she had.

326
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:17,597
-Big brother!

327
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:19,064
Big brother!

328
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:20,531
You can't die!

329
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:21,531
Please!

330
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:24,997
Don't leave me all alone!

331
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:28,431
-I'd never realized that she was
the girl I saw crying that day.

332
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:30,664
I only found that
out just recently.

333
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,231
-How in tune to the
spirit realm were you?

334
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:34,064
-Huh?

335
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:35,731
Not as much as I am now.

336
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:37,464
I mean, it's really
only recently

337
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:39,331
I've been able to fully
see and communicate

338
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:42,031
with the spirit realm.

339
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:43,064
-Just as I thought.

340
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:43,564
-Why?

341
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:44,264
What's up?

342
00:15:44,297 --> 00:15:45,531
What are you thinking?

343
00:15:45,564 --> 00:15:47,764
-Nothing.

344
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:48,797
See you later.

345
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:49,931
-Huh?

346
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:51,397
Hey!

347
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:54,231
Where are you going?

348
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:55,297
-Back home.

349
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:56,864
-Where's that?

350
00:15:56,897 --> 00:15:58,731
-You really want to know?

351
00:15:58,764 --> 00:15:59,697
-I guess not.

352
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:01,731
-Then don't ask me.

353
00:16:01,764 --> 00:16:03,897
-Huh?

354
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:04,464
Yeah, right.

355
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:08,697

356
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,597
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): Coming!

357
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:12,097
Oh, hi, Tatsuke!

358
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:14,397
-My mom thought that I should
bring this over for you.

359
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,697
It's stewed beef and potatoes.

360
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:17,997
-Wow!

361
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:18,797
Great!

362
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,897
Home-made beef and potatoes!

363
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:22,197
Oh boy!

364
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,364
This is delicious!

365
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:25,997
-I swear, if I bring
meals over for you to eat,

366
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:28,197
you always end up cooking
the weirdest stuff.

367
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:30,097
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): I
never thought about it.

368
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:30,997
You really think so?

369
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,231
TATSUKE (OFFSCREEN): Um, Yeah.

370
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:35,797
I mean, what is this stuff?

371
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:37,364
-Hey, Ichigo?

372
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,831
You haven't seen my
pajamas, have you?

373
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:41,197
-Yuzu, come on!

374
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:42,664
Knock before you come in here!

375
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,131
-Well, I'm sorry I asked.

376
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:47,664
You've been so mean since
you started high school!

377
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:50,564
-Have not, and I don't know
where your pajamas are.

378
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:52,464
-That is just so odd.

379
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:54,597
One of my dresses
has gone missing too.

380
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:57,131
-Why do you feel the need to
ask me about every little thing?

381
00:16:57,164 --> 00:16:58,497
Do I look like I care?

382
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:00,997
-OK, goodnight.

-Hm.

385
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:06,964
An order?

386
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:07,897
-What the?

387
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:08,397
Huh?

388
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:09,364
Huh?

-What the heck?

394
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:15,664
What are you doing in there?

395
00:17:15,697 --> 00:17:17,331
Are those my sister's
PJs you've got on?

396
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:18,497
-I'll explain later.

397
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:19,431
We got orders.

398
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:20,497
-Orders?

399
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:21,297
-We're not alone.

400
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,397
-Wait, what are you saying?

401
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,364
-Get down!

402
00:17:24,397 --> 00:17:25,331
[grunt]

403
00:17:34,697 --> 00:17:36,431
-Why are you standing there?

404
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:36,964
Do something!

405
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:42,397
You have to aim for its head!

406
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:45,331
-Huh?

407
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:50,731

-Ugh.

412
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:58,564
[scream]

413
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:02,731
-You need to focus!

414
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:04,297
Don't just swing
your sword around!

415
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:05,131
-Shut up!

416
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:07,431
Who cares, as long as I kill it?

You're mine!

00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:13,864
Ya!

421
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:15,297
-Too shallow.

00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:17,264

-What?

00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:37,964
[roar]

428
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:42,864
-It's getting away.

429
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:43,364
Let's go.

430
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:48,931
Ichigo, what's the matter?

431
00:18:48,964 --> 00:18:50,764
-Something's not right.

432
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,631
-What?

433
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,697
-I got a look at
that thing's face.

434
00:18:57,531 --> 00:18:59,897
And it was Orihime's
dead brother!

435
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,931
-Are you certain?

436
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:06,386
[groan]

437
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:15,479

[roar]

439
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:34,297
-Here's a word of advice.

440
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:35,297
-Uh?

441
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:37,931
-When attacking hollows,
come from behind

442
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:39,964
and cleave their
heads with one blow.

443
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:40,997
Don't forget.

444
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:43,231
It's basic theory
for any soul reaper.

445
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:43,864
-Why?

446
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:45,364
What do you mean?

447
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:48,864
-It will keep your
injuries to a minimum.

448
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,164
Also, with any luck,
it will keep you

449
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:53,364
from learning the
hollow's identity.

450
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:54,231
-Wait a minute.

451
00:19:54,264 --> 00:19:57,064
What do you mean, the identity?

452
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:59,231
-You just saw for yourself.

453
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,097
-Hm.

454
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:01,764
-Do you understand?

455
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:03,964
The hollows were once
souls of human beings

456
00:20:03,997 --> 00:20:07,764
no different from anyone else.

457
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:10,831
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): You--
you've never told me that!

458
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:13,731
So that thing I saw was
just a monster, wasn't it?

459
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:15,264
it was some beast
from the underworld

460
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,864
that needed to be wiped out.

461
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:17,931
-That is correct.

462
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:19,997
He is just a monster now.

463
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:21,331
And he must be destroyed.

464
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:26,764
-But it was human once.

465
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:28,297
-It can't be helped.

466
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:31,631
Souls that hold onto feelings
of resentment or regret

467
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:35,597
will sometimes resist konso and
linger on alone in this world.

468
00:20:35,631 --> 00:20:39,197
Should that happen, they either
become hollows on their own,

469
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:41,231
or they're devoured
by other hollows

470
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:43,464
and become one of the fold.

471
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:44,431
-But that's--

472
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:50,631
-What?

473
00:20:50,664 --> 00:20:52,064
They were together?

474
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:53,264
-Mm-hm.

475
00:20:53,297 --> 00:20:56,231
But they were just walking
home together, Tatsuke.

476
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:57,397
What's the matter?

477
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:58,597
-Oh man.

478
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,564
I never knew Ichigo was
such a smooth operator.

479
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:03,297
I mean, honestly.

480
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:05,964
He didn't even walk you
home when you were hurt!

481
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:07,264
-Well, no.

482
00:21:07,297 --> 00:21:10,931
I mean, he did ask me if I
wanted him to walk me home.

483
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:16,164
But I-- I'm warning, you!

484
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:17,597
You better watch out, champ.

485
00:21:17,631 --> 00:21:19,031
Because I'm winning this match!

486
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:19,864
-Yeah, hey, wake up!

487
00:21:19,897 --> 00:21:21,331
You're daydreaming again!

488
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,697
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): I'll
give you a right, and another!

Bam!

490
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:24,031
Ah!

491
00:21:24,064 --> 00:21:24,597
Look out!

492
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:25,464
He's got a gun!

00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:27,597
-Huh?

495
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:29,064
Hey, what was that?

THEME SONG: Nobody
knows who I really am.

503
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:07,046
I never felt this empty before.

504
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:11,766
And if I ever need
someone I'd come along

505
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:16,545
Who's going to comfort
