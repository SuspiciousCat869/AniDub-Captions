00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:49,748
NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

3
00:01:49,782 --> 00:01:52,782
who has been kidnapped
by the Arrancars,

4
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:56,082
Ichigo, Uryu, and
Chad have snuck

5
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:59,515
into the Hollow
world, Hueco Mundo.

6
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:02,448
Before they could
reach Las Noches,

7
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:05,015
Runuganga, the Guardian
of the White Sand,

8
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:08,148
appeared before them,
and they were pulled down

9
00:02:08,182 --> 00:02:12,915
into the depths of Hueco Mundo's
underground realm, the Menos

10
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:13,415
Forest.

11
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:19,348
Rukia was separated from
Ichigo and the others

12
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:20,715
when they entered the forest.

13
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:24,915
She then met a mysterious
Soul Reaper named Ashido.

14
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:27,748
Long ago, Ashido ended
up in the Menos Forest

15
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:30,215
after his pursuit of a
Hollow led him there.

16
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:33,615
Since then he has remained,
to try to kill as many Hollows

17
00:02:33,648 --> 00:02:35,182
as he can.

18
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:38,348
-Ashido, why did
you bring me here?

19
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:46,015
-Whenever I talked, you'd
respond, ask questions,

20
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:48,248
and interact with me.

21
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:51,848
I wanted to let my friends hear
another voice besides mine.

22
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:57,415
NARRATOR: Rukia
and Ashido started

23
00:02:57,448 --> 00:03:00,182
searching for Ichigo
and the others together,

24
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:03,448
but the Adjuchas, caretakers
of the forest who lived deep

25
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:08,382
within its depths, had set a
trap, and were laying in wait.

26
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:11,782
-If we defeat the leader,
the rest will scatter.

27
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:13,448
-OK.

28
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:13,948
-Fire!

29
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:25,382
-Ah!

30
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:31,615
-Aim for the girl, Gillians!

31
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:35,448
-Rukia!

32
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:48,615
-Ashido!

33
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:03,282
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:03,982
-It's all right.

35
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:05,015
Don't worry.

36
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:06,482
[laughter]

37
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:09,482
-I see you brought along
a friend today, Ashido.

38
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:12,215
Are you sure she
won't slow you down?

39
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:14,482
You should worry
more about yourself.

40
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:18,282
[laughter]

41
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:20,782
-Ashido, it's all my
fault that you even

42
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:22,848
got hurt in the first place.

43
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:25,248
So I'm going to defeat
that Adjuchas myself.

44
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:27,382
-What are you two
chatting about?

45
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:28,848
I'll give you
something to discuss.

46
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:32,015
Yah!

47
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:40,348
Yah, ha ha ha ha!

48
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:50,648
Dance, Sode no Shirayuki.

49
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:57,148
Some no mai, Tsukishiro!

50
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:06,915
Do you still think I'm
going to slow him down?

51
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:11,582
This slow enough for you?

52
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:44,182
-Ashido, I'm sorry.

53
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:46,115
I know how much
this meant to you.

54
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:53,315
Ashido.

55
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:55,248
It may not be my
place to say this,

56
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:58,715
especially at a time
like this, but maybe it's

57
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:02,815
time for you to once again
return to the Soul Society.

58
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:05,648
I understand your feelings
towards your friends,

59
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:08,882
but the situation has changed.

60
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:11,282
Things aren't like
they were before.

61
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:14,748
More importantly, you're alive.

62
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,315
The friends that
you lost down here

63
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:20,382
won't blame you if you return
to the life that you had.

64
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,715
-Thanks for the advice, but
I'll choose my own path.

65
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:28,382
Come on.

66
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:29,382
We better get going.

67
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:29,882
-Yeah.

68
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:38,848
-Nel's spiritual pressure.

69
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:40,382
You're sure that
they're here, right?

70
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:42,215
[mumbling]

71
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:43,915
-What should we do know?

72
00:06:43,948 --> 00:06:45,248
-Isn't it obvious?

73
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:47,215
All we have to do is
barge in and swipe them

74
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,315
like the Hollows did.

75
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:49,648
What else are we supposed to do?

76
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:52,015
We can't just stand
around and waste time.

77
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:54,715
We have to find Rukia
as soon as possible.

78
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,815
-Hold on.

79
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,648
It's too dangerous to
just barge in there

80
00:06:57,682 --> 00:06:59,615
without knowing the
situation inside.

81
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:00,882
Huh?

82
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:02,348
Hey, wait a minute!

83
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,348
-Can you see 'em?

84
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:11,282
-Uh, no.

85
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:12,582
-They're not here.

86
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,615
-Come on, seriously, you guys.

87
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,182
I just felt a trace
of spiritual pressure.

88
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:18,648
But it must be too late.

89
00:07:18,682 --> 00:07:20,648
It looks like
they've already left.

90
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:23,482
[mumbling]

91
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:27,215
-Yeah?

92
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:28,715
Do you think you
know where they are?

93
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,782
[mumble]

94
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:30,448
-Let's go.

95
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,682
Over here?

96
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,215
-Where are they?

97
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:48,548
[mumbling]

98
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:49,048
-Look!

99
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:57,548
[whimpering]

100
00:07:57,582 --> 00:07:58,582
-It's Nel!

101
00:07:58,615 --> 00:07:59,815
It looks like she's all right.

102
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:01,148
-What are they doing up there?

103
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:04,882
-Ichigo!

104
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:07,382
Run away!

105
00:08:07,415 --> 00:08:07,882
-Whoa!

106
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:14,848
[roaring]

107
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:22,315
[laughter]

108
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:23,848
-Hang on, Nel!

109
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:27,448
-I was going to get you
with one shot, but I missed.

110
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:27,948
Oh, well.

111
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:34,882
Don't move, Soul Reaper.

112
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,515
Don't move a single hair.

113
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:39,848
If you do, the Hollows
are going to eat them.

114
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:41,215
-They're really gonna eat us.

115
00:08:41,248 --> 00:08:43,815
-Hurry up and save us!

116
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:44,982
-Damn it!

117
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,248
-It seems like were
planning to draw us out

118
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:49,648
by using them as bait
from the beginning.

119
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:52,482
-And that's not all.

120
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:55,815
The guy who Lord Aizen placed
in charge of this forest

121
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:58,815
says that he wants to
fight Ashido one on one.

122
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:01,082
So we drew you out.

123
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:02,448
-Ashido?

124
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:06,682
-That's why we made you come
to this amusing little place.

125
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,282
-You call this place amusing?

126
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,148
-That's right.

127
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:17,582
-This spiritual pressure--

128
00:09:17,615 --> 00:09:19,115
-Let's hurry.

129
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:19,748
-Where to?

130
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:20,815
-The exit.

131
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:21,682
Up ahead of us.

132
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,215
-Slow down.

133
00:09:27,248 --> 00:09:29,682
Where do you think
you're going, Ashido?

134
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:38,882
-Ichigo!

135
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:39,848
Ichigo!

136
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:40,815
-Did they get 'em?

137
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:44,915
What?

138
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:45,682
Where did they go?

139
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:56,482
-Whoa!

140
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:57,982
-Ichigo!

141
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,848
-Those bastards!

142
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:03,315
-Nicely done, Uryu.

143
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:04,582
-Thanks, Chad.

144
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:06,982
[laughter]

145
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:08,082
-We did it.

146
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:09,682
-You didn't do anything.

147
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:10,782
-Aw.

148
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,682
-Now we can finally
get out of this forest.

149
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:13,348
Let's go.

150
00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:23,648
-Some Soul Reapers are
fighting over there.

151
00:10:23,682 --> 00:10:27,082
It's easy to get a sense of
their spiritual pressures

152
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:30,382
from here, isn't it?

153
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:35,982
I know you want to save them,
but I won't allow you to pass.

154
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:39,515
You're going to sense
the pain of your friends,

155
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:45,015
and you're going to die, unable
to do anything to help them.

156
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:46,682
-You're sick.

157
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:50,015
-Let's finish this once
and for all, Ashido.

158
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,515
-Just stand back.

159
00:10:51,548 --> 00:10:54,682
I've already fought him
countless times before.

160
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:57,715
Las Noches gave him the position
of guardian of the forest,

161
00:10:57,748 --> 00:11:01,315
so unlike the others, this
one can't be underestimated.

162
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:04,182
-But I-- I will
settle this myself.

163
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:08,748
It shall be my
final job down here.

164
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:11,048
-But Ashido, you mean that--

165
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:13,915
-Afterwards, I want to
know the truth, Rukia.

166
00:11:13,948 --> 00:11:16,215
I want to know what's going
on in the outside world.

167
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:21,048
-Ashido!

168
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:34,348
-What?

169
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:35,315
Urgh.

170
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:39,215
-You're in our way!

171
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:39,715
-Damn!

172
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:51,915
-Roar, Zabimaru!

173
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:52,715
Hmph.

174
00:11:52,748 --> 00:11:53,682
That was too easy.

175
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:05,348
-Hmph.

176
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:09,415
-Damn you!

177
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:23,726
Damn you!

178
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:28,692
-Getsuga Tensho!

179
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:44,559
[roaring]

180
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:47,926
-What's this?

181
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:52,892
-Ichigo!

182
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:55,292
I'm scared!

183
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:58,292
-They suddenly began
to move more slowly.

184
00:12:58,326 --> 00:12:58,792
-Yah!

185
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,226
-Yah!

186
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,759
So, did you notice?

187
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:51,426
Your friend's
spiritual pressure has

188
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:53,392
been completely extinguished.

189
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:53,892
-Damn.

190
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,292
-It's all over now.

191
00:14:00,326 --> 00:14:01,259
-Ha ha ha.

192
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:08,126
-Hurry!

193
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,426
Run away, Rukia!

194
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:16,526
-Tsugi no mai.

195
00:14:21,792 --> 00:14:22,259
Hakuren!

196
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,692
-What?

197
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:30,192
Ah--

198
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:35,659
-Yah!

199
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,659
[scream]

200
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:46,059
-Hey, are you all right?

201
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:46,859
-Yeah.

202
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:47,959
Let's hurry.

203
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:48,459
-Hold on.

204
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,192
-Thank you, Rukia.

205
00:14:57,226 --> 00:14:58,859
-Don't mention it.

206
00:14:58,892 --> 00:15:00,826
-Let's go!

207
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:01,326
Bankai!

208
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:08,292
[roar]

209
00:15:08,326 --> 00:15:09,626
-Hihio Zabimaru.

210
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:20,492
-Getsuga Tensho!

211
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:36,726
-Looks like we got 'em.

212
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,859
-Think so.

213
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:39,792
Hey, is everyone all
right over there?

214
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:40,726
-Yeah.

215
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,026
-Huh?

216
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,359
[sigh]

217
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:45,292
-We're saved.

218
00:15:45,326 --> 00:15:48,092
-It's a miracle.

219
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:49,959
If I remember
incorrectly, the Hollows

220
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:53,059
told us the exit is right
over here, so let's hit it.

221
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,326
-Really?

222
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,092
-Yes.

223
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,192
It's true.

224
00:15:56,226 --> 00:15:57,159
-Hold on.

225
00:15:57,192 --> 00:15:58,892
We can't leave without Rukia.

226
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:00,092
-That's right.

227
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,692
And now that we've figured
out where the exit is,

228
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:04,192
we should go look for her.

229
00:16:04,226 --> 00:16:05,259
-Don't bother.

230
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:06,959
I'm right here.

231
00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:07,959
-Rukia.

232
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:08,759
-Ichigo.

233
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:09,792
Hey, Renji.

234
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:10,592
-Rukia.

235
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:11,392
You--

236
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:12,759
-Rukia, it's good to see you.

237
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:14,226
I'm so glad that you're safe.

238
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:14,959
-Thanks.

239
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:16,859
Sorry for worrying you.

240
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,759
-Who's that?

241
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,359
-His name is Ashido.

242
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:21,492
He's actually a Soul
Reaper, like us.

243
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:23,059
-A Soul Reaper?

244
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:24,359
-Yes.

245
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:26,392
He saved me, and he helped
me get up here to the exit.

246
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:27,826
-So they weren't
kidding when they

247
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:29,659
said the exit was around here.

248
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:30,826
-You thought we lied?

249
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:31,792
What'sa matter with you?

250
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,026
-Man, are they persistent?

251
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:41,992
[shouting]

252
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:43,359
-Quit freaking out.

253
00:16:43,392 --> 00:16:45,159
We should be able to handle
anything that comes our way--

254
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:45,859
-Just hold on.

255
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:47,226
They're still far away.

256
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:49,859
-Ichigo, our goal
is to save Orihime,

257
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:51,859
and we can't lose focus of that.

258
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:53,959
Come on, let's get out of here.

259
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:55,826
Ashido knows where the exit is.

260
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:56,459
Let's hurry.

261
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:58,159
-All right, then.

262
00:16:58,192 --> 00:16:59,926
[mumbling]

263
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,292
-It's up ahead.

264
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:11,459
ICHIGO: That's it, huh?

265
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:13,126
Is this the same
place we came in from?

266
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:13,959
-No.

267
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,692
You entered from somewhere else.

268
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:18,659
Once you pass through here,
follow the flow of the sand.

269
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:20,326
Then you'll reach the surface.

270
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:20,959
-All right.

271
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:21,726
Come on, let's go.

272
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,026
-Damn, they're back again.

273
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:41,226
-You won't get
away, Soul Reaper.

274
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:43,759
-So, it looks like we didn't
finish you off after all.

275
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:51,159
[shouting]

276
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,259
-Get back!

277
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:56,826
Go on.

278
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:57,426
Now!

279
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:57,926
-What?

280
00:18:02,926 --> 00:18:03,859
-Ashido!

281
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:04,859
-It's coming!

282
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:09,826
Dammit!

283
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:11,459
It's collapsing!

284
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:12,159
-Hurry!

285
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,426
Let's get out of here!

286
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:13,992
-Ashido!

287
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:14,859
Come with us!

288
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,292
-I'll catch up to you later!

289
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:21,226
Go on ahead without me.

290
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:22,292
-Stop interfering!

291
00:18:26,326 --> 00:18:27,559
-Ashido!

292
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:28,159
-Rukia!

293
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:28,726
Look out!

294
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:37,826
-Damn you!

295
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,126
Argh!

296
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:39,626
Lord Aizen!

297
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:44,059
-Ashido!

298
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:52,926
-Go.

299
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,026
Save your friend.

[shout]

301
00:18:59,392 --> 00:18:59,959
RUKIA: Ashido!

302
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:26,810
-Ah, Nel can hardly believe we
got back to the surface alive!

303
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:29,610
-I never thought that I'd
live to see the gleaming

304
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:31,076
moonlight ever again!

305
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,310
-Yeah.

306
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:34,743
And we're almost to Las
Noches, so let's celebrate.

307
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:35,743
-Yeah!

308
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:36,710
-Yeah!

309
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,210
-Nel's so happy!

310
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,176
Yay!

311
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,010
-Wah-ha!

312
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:46,443
-Ashido had said
that the Adjuchas'

313
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:50,110
powers have changed recently.

314
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:54,610
I couldn't tell him that some
Soul Reapers have joined forces

315
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:57,143
with the Hollows, and
are trying to change

316
00:19:57,176 --> 00:20:00,143
the world with the Hogyoku.

317
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:02,210
Ashido had been
fighting Hollows alone

318
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:06,443
for centuries in that forest,
because he was a Soul Reaper.

319
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:09,910
I couldn't tell him.

320
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,910
-Rukia.

321
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:15,543
After we save Orihime, we
need to steal the Hogyoku back

322
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:17,643
from that bastard, Aizen.

323
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,010
NEL: Hey!

324
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:19,843
-Hm?

325
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:21,876
-You want a lift to Las Noches?

326
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,110
-Let's hit it.

327
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:24,576
-Rukia.

328
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,276
-Yeah.

329
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,276
Let's go.

330
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:39,243
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Ashido.

331
00:20:39,276 --> 00:20:42,210
I promise I'll
come back for you.

332
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:43,243
Until then.

333
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:03,776
ULQUIORRA: That outfit
unexpectedly suits you.

334
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,676
-You scared me.

335
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,010
When did you come in?

336
00:21:06,043 --> 00:21:07,310
-Just this second.

337
00:21:07,343 --> 00:21:09,043
Don't fuss over everything.

338
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:11,243
It's quite annoying.

339
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:13,576
I have some news.

340
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,010
Your friends have
entered Hueco Mundo.

341
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:22,710
-Why would they come here?

342
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,410
-This wall.

343
00:21:27,443 --> 00:21:29,843
I wonder what it is?

344
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:33,110
It doesn't seem to be
made out of Sekkisekki.

345
00:21:33,143 --> 00:21:35,810
-Well hell, if it's
not Sekkisekki,

346
00:21:35,843 --> 00:21:39,443
then we should be able
to break through easily.

347
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:40,376
All right.

348
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,443
Let's go, Renji.

349
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:43,376
-Hey, you're not the boss here.

350
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,176
Smart ass.

351
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,043
-Why, you ask?

352
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:53,476
They have come to save you.

353
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,510
Why else would they
choose to come here?

354
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:58,010
They have no other reasons.

355
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:02,843

357
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:44,828
ORIHIME: Uh--

358
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:45,895
ULQUIORRA: What is it?

359
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:47,195
ORIHIME: These clothes
fit me perfectly.

360
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:49,228
I was wondering how
you knew my size?

361
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,961
ULQUIORRA: Everything is as Lord
Aizen has intended it to be.

362
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:52,795
ORIHIME: What?

363
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:54,528
He knew just by looking at me?

364
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:55,495
That's amazing!

365
00:23:55,528 --> 00:23:56,628
ICHIGO: Orihime!

366
00:23:56,661 --> 00:24:00,161
You're not supposed to
be excited about that!
