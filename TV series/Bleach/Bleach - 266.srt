1
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:55,561
<i>Welcome back.</i>

2
00:01:55,594 --> 00:01:56,261
[gasping]

3
00:01:58,261 --> 00:01:59,394
Orihime.

4
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:05,494
What's the matter?

5
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:09,727
I thought you'd be happy
to see us now that you're
back again, but you look
so troubled.

6
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:15,961
You should try
to smile...

7
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:19,761
Everyone gets so
depressed when the
sun doesn't shine.

8
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,127
[trembling]

9
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:26,861
Smile and wait here a
while. That's all you
need to do. Just until...

10
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:38,561
...Just until my men
and I finish destroying
Karakura Town.

11
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:41,694
You're going to
destroy...

12
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,461
...Karakura Town?

13
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:45,194
That's right.

14
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:48,761
[gasping]

15
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:55,994
I need to destroy
Karakura Town, to create
the Ouken.

16
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:06,194
Sosuke Aizen and his forces
set out to invade Karakura
Town to create the Ouken.

17
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,861
A key to unlocking the
Soul King's dimension.

18
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:12,427
Leaving Las Noches
under the care of
Espada Ulquiorra.

19
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:16,094
Meanwhile, Ichigo, Uryu,
Chad, Rukia and Renji

20
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:20,861
had entered Hueco Mundo
to rescue Orihime, who was
being held captive by Aizen.

21
00:03:20,894 --> 00:03:24,527
But the group soon found
themselves imprisoned
within Hueco Mundo

22
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:29,827
alongside Captains Byakuya
Kuchiki, Kenpachi Zaraki,
Mayuri Kurotsuchi

23
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,794
and Retsu Unohana,
while Karakura Town
was left defenseless.

24
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:37,561
By then, however, the Soul
Society, using Tenkaiecchu,

25
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:40,461
had switched Karakura
Town with an exact
replica,

26
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:44,494
evacuated the populace,
and turned the area into
a battlefield.

27
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:47,561
Now, under the command
of Head Captain Yamamoto,

28
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,761
the captains and lieutenants
of the Thirteen Court Guard
Squads

29
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:53,394
stand ready to confront
Aizen and his army.

30
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:14,294
Excellent...

31
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:17,561
It seems we made
it here in time.

32
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:19,727
Made it in time?

33
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,861
Now why would you think
to say something like
that?

34
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:29,327
I'm well aware that what
lies beneath you is not
Karakura Town.

35
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:33,294
This may come as a
surprise, but that means
nothing to me.

36
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:40,394
Stark, Barragan, Halibel.
Come here.

37
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:06,361
If Karakura Town is now
inside the Soul Society...

38
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:09,327
...we'll just kill you
right here...

39
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:12,627
...and create the Ouken
within the Soul Society.

40
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:14,427
It is that simple.

41
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:33,827
Mm!

42
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:41,694
All things in the
universe turn to ashes.

43
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:45,727
Ryujinjakka!

44
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:08,661
Jokakuenjo.

45
00:06:08,694 --> 00:06:14,927
We are safe. This wall of
flames ought to keep
Sosuke and his cohorts at
bay for quite some time.

46
00:06:15,794 --> 00:06:16,727
Now then...

47
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:19,894
We shall show them no
mercy. End them at once!

48
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:26,094
Woo, sure is
toasty in here!

49
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:29,227
The Head Captain went a
little overboard, don't
you think?

50
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:33,194
Well, Captain Aizen?
What's gonna be our
next move?

51
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,094
We wait.

52
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:45,994
This battle... will come
to an end... without us
having to lift a finger.

53
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:50,227
You'll see.

54
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:59,394
I implore you! You must
put all your spirit into
this to defeat them here!

55
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:05,161
Even if your flesh is
torn from your body, use
your bones to form an
impenetrable wall!

56
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:10,194
No matter what the cost,
we must never let them
step even one foot into
the Soul Society!

57
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:12,527
Attack now!!

58
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:30,694
[grunting]

59
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:32,627
[grunting]

60
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:36,927
[grunting]

61
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:38,294
Take that! And that!

62
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:40,661
[grunting]

63
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,127
Heh.

64
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,527
[grunting]

65
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,127
Nice try!

66
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:58,694
You don't have what it
takes to handle me, let
alone the three of us!!

67
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:11,494
Uh! What?

68
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:14,294
[gasping]
It's you!

69
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,827
Momo!

70
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:21,227
Mmm...

71
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:24,127
Thrust! Cierva!!

72
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:26,594
Eat your fill! Leona!!

73
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:28,994
Strangle to Death!
Anaconda.

74
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:34,494
Quimera Parca.

75
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:42,994
Haliebel's Fracciones,
Apache, SunSun and Mila
Rose,

76
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:45,894
used Quimera Parca to
create the monster Ayon,

77
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:49,394
who defeated Ragiku
Matsumoto and Momo
Hinamori with ease.

78
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:52,594
Shuhei Hisagi, who had
come to help, was quickly
incapacitated,

79
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:55,494
as he fell prey to Ayon's
massive strength and power.

80
00:08:55,527 --> 00:09:00,261
Continuing his rampage,
Tetsuzaemon Iba was soon
leveled by Ayon as well.

81
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:03,494
Izuru Kira, who was
administering first-aid
to the others,

82
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:07,194
then found himself with
the demonic destroyer
closing in on him.

83
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:08,527
[gasping]

84
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:15,294
Inexcusable...

85
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:18,827
...making your Head
Captain come out here
to the front lines...

86
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:23,027
You squad members are
quite a disappointment.

87
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:25,994
It's Head Captain
Yamamoto.

88
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,361
[grunting]

89
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:36,661
Captain, what
was that?

90
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:39,761
Calm down, you fool.
It's just the Head
Captain.

91
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:41,461
What?!

92
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:44,161
The Head Captain himself
came out and took part in
the fight?

93
00:09:44,194 --> 00:09:45,794
<i>Omaeda...</i>

94
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:46,561
Come here, please.

95
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:47,827
Huh...?

96
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:49,661
What is it?
[grunting]

97
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:53,394
Nice try, Captain, but I
won't fall for the same
trick twice---

98
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,494
[grunting]

99
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:58,894
We've all come
here to fight.

100
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:02,027
And that means even the
Head Captain is no
exception.

101
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:04,594
Now, quit acting
like such an idiot.

102
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:06,361
That's mean of you!

103
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:11,561
[roaring]

104
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:17,761
Hmm, well, it appears
you have not learned
your lesson.

105
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:21,994
[roaring]

106
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:45,994
[roaring]

107
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:51,927
[roaring]

108
00:11:05,261 --> 00:11:07,027
[growling]

109
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:16,527
When you are ready, I
will be right here.

110
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:17,494
What!

111
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:24,261
It is obvious to me that
you are a simple beast that
only lives for killing...

112
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:27,494
How pitiful.

113
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:31,361
Ryujinjakka,
Hitotsume...!

114
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:33,294
Nadegiri...!

115
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:02,961
No way!

116
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:03,761
[grunting]

117
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:09,327
[screaming]

118
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,794
I admire your bravery in
challenging me with only
one arm.

119
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:15,261
[screaming]

120
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:23,594
[struggling]

121
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:28,627
As a show of respect,
I'll let you off with
just burns.

122
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:38,361
[gasping]

123
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:42,761
What!?

124
00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:47,727
What's that?

125
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:58,394
Apache... Sun-Sun... Mila
Rose... You have all
fought well.

126
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:13,327
As powerful as you are,
you're still just the
third strongest?

127
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,094
As powerful as
I am, you say...

128
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:20,727
I don't recall showing
you the full extent of
my power just yet.

129
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:30,961
Uh!

130
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:32,527
Bankai!

131
00:13:33,494 --> 00:13:35,727
Daiguren Hyorimaru!

132
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:53,561
You're strong...
you Soul Reapers.

133
00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:56,027
Thank you for the
compliment.

134
00:13:56,061 --> 00:14:01,527
I wanted to dodge any
confrontations and wait
until the battle had
ended...

135
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:04,661
... but I see now,
that's not going to
be possible.

136
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:07,094
I'm happy to hear it...

137
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:11,061
At this point in the
battle, there's only
three of you left to
challenge us.

138
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:13,827
I'm guessing that
girl is number three.

139
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:15,127
Am I right?

140
00:14:18,494 --> 00:14:22,761
On a personal note, I'm
hoping that old man is
Number One.

141
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:26,427
I'd be much more
comfortable if you
were number two...

142
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:29,961
Hmm... I see.

143
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,561
Sorry, but
I'm number one.

144
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:45,961
[sighing]
I was afraid of that.

145
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:52,827
Too bad for me. If you're
the strongest, it makes
my battle more difficult.

146
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:55,994
...especially because we
are so much alike.

147
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:13,761
[screaming]

148
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:15,317
Are you afraid?

149
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,117
You are useless to Lord
Aizen now.

150
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,850
There is no one here
to protect you. You
are alone.

151
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:32,050
It's over.

152
00:16:33,517 --> 00:16:38,817
You will die here. You
will die, all by yourself
with no one to witness it.

153
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:46,917
So I want to know, how
frightened are you?

154
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:55,784
I am not. At all.

155
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:05,717
You see, now I know that
my friends came to rescue
me. So right now, my
heart...

156
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,950
My heart is with them.

157
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:22,817
Ridiculous.

158
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,617
No matter what you think,
the fate of you and your
friends is already
decided.

159
00:17:29,784 --> 00:17:34,850
Even if they do manage
to find you, it will not
change the fact that you
are going to die.

160
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:38,184
There's no turning back
from that now.

161
00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:44,784
Sharing your feelings
with someone, when
you're on the verge of
death, brings some sort

162
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:50,984
of comfort to you humans.
It's an instinct to help
minimize your fear and
sorrow.

163
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,384
But in reality, it is
impossible to know
another's emotions.

164
00:17:56,417 --> 00:18:00,650
Empathy is simply a
meaningless human
delusion.

165
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:21,984
<i>That may be true...</i>

166
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:28,084
It might be impossible to
feel exactly what someone
else is feeling.

167
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,650
But when people truly
care about each other...

168
00:18:57,684 --> 00:19:03,117
their hearts grow so
close, you can't tell the
difference between them.

169
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:05,384
Please don't die!

170
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:07,217
Uh!

171
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,617
Don't die, Ichigo!!

172
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,850
You don't have to win,
and you don't have to
fight for me.

173
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:20,650
Just don't get hurt.
I couldn't bear it.

174
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:30,717
That's what it must
mean when they say...
two people are of one
heart.

175
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,817
Tell me, what
is a heart?

176
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:47,850
If I tore a hole in your
chest... would I see it?

177
00:19:48,784 --> 00:19:52,750
If I split open your
skull... would it
be there?

178
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:53,917
[trembling]

179
00:19:58,217 --> 00:19:59,384
Uh!

180
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:29,817
Ichigo.

181
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,384
Step away from her.

182
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:44,350
I was just about to.

183
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:46,750
My responsibilities
are clear.

184
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:51,750
My duty is to protect Las
Noches until Lord Aizen
returns.

185
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,984
I haven't received
orders to take the
life of this woman.

186
00:20:56,117 --> 00:21:01,150
Until those orders come,
I will allow her to live.
However...

187
00:21:01,717 --> 00:21:03,884
You are a different
matter.

188
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:10,217
Killing you would be
absolutely within my
duties of protecting
Las Noches.

189
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:17,117
You shall die...
by my sword.

190
00:21:21,317 --> 00:21:27,050
What a surprise... it's
funny.. I never figured
you would be the first
one to draw your sword.

191
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,050
On the way here, I was
thinking that you wouldn't
take me seriously enough

192
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:32,484
to draw right away.

193
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:41,084
So tell me. Is it
reasonable to say you
consider me an opponent
that's equal to you?

194
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:44,117
You might say that.

195
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,950
I consider you an enemy
worth destroying.

196
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,317
That's good enough.

197
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,150
Ichigo.

198
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:48,119
Now I remember what
happened in the story
up 'til now.

199
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:49,853
<i>So you're saying</i>
<i>you'd forgotten?</i>

200
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,719
Huh? Oh, you're the guy
I was fighting against!

201
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:53,819
<i>Ichigo Kurosaki.</i>

202
00:23:53,853 --> 00:23:55,819
What is it, guy I
was fighting against?

203
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:56,986
<i>Don't you know my name?</i>

204
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,819
Aw, come on now, I
know you, guy I was
fighting against!
