2
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:51,334
Sosuke Aizen had
kidnapped Orihime Inoue

3
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:53,101
and taken her to Hueco Mundo.

4
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:57,001
The Soul Society assumed Sosuke
was using her for her ability

5
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,601
to reject phenomena, in
order to restore the Hogyoku.

6
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:03,567
So they sent the captains
of the 13 Court Guard squads

7
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,234
to rescue her.

8
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:08,301
However, in truth,
Orihime was merely

9
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:11,401
bait to lure them closer.

10
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:14,334
Sosuke's actual plan was to
wipe out the enriched spirit

11
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,234
zone of Karkura Town.

12
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:18,234
This would allow him
to create the Oken

13
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:21,534
and eventually take over
the entire Soul Society.

14
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:24,501
Sosuke sealed off the
gateway to Hueco Mundo,

15
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:26,501
trapping Ichigo and the others.

16
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:29,534
Then, along with Gin
Ichimaru and Kaname Tosen,

17
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,201
he set out to
invade Karkura Town.

18
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:35,701
But Head Captain Yamamoto
saw right through the plan.

19
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:38,234
He ordered Kisuke Urahara
to ready the remaining

20
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:39,367
captains for the showdown.

21
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:45,067
Kisuke created a device
called the Tenkai Kecchu.

22
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:48,834
It acted as a huge Senkaimon,
surrounding Karkura Town.

23
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,501
And with it, the
Soul Society was

24
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:52,767
able to build a replica
of the entire town

25
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,867
and switch places
with the real thing.

26
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,467
YAMAMOTO: Excellent.

27
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:13,067
It seems we made
it here in time.

28
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:20,001
-Made it in time?

29
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:24,601
Now, why would you think
to say something like that?

30
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:26,734
I'm well aware that
what lies beneath you

31
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,634
is not Karkura Town.

32
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,634
This may come as a surprise,
but that means nothing to me.

33
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:37,434
If Karkura Town is now
inside the Soul Society,

34
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,434
we'll just kill you right
here and create the Oken

35
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,667
within the Soul Society.

36
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:47,067
It is that simple.

37
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,934
Until then, I shall
leave Las Noches

38

under your care, Ulquiorra.

Looks like that spiritual

Man, I'm telling you, the
spiritual pressure around here

57
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,401
is all kinds of crazy.

In fact, if you and me don't
get that heck out of here,

we could wind up bugging out,

--[sigh] Well, the
name's Eikichiro Saido.

Reaper who recently got put

in charge of this district.

00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:33,334
-So you're small time, then?

00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:34,534
-Oh, ouch.

73
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:35,767
Never mind.

74
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:37,934
Listen, missy, if you stick
around here much longer,

75
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,401
you're going to end up
deader than those monsters.

76
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,934
So do me a favor and
get lost, will ya?

Mm.

Looks like some pretty rough
business is about to go down.

80

Well, good or bad, it'll
be interesting to see

how this thing turns out.

-His spiritual
pressure is monstrous,

83
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:46,501
just like I remember it.

84
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:49,034
-If you're so scared, then
why don't you run away?

85
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:49,534
Coward.

86
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:56,301
-So I assume our first priority
is going after the leader.

87
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:57,234
-Not quite.

88
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,501
Sosuke's powers
are very special.

89
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,501
If we have any chance
of attacking him,

90
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:03,134
we have to beat those
around him first.

91
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:08,467
-Jushiro, among
those three Espadas,

92
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:11,067
which one do you figure
is the strongest?

93
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:12,601
-Hard to say.

94
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:16,501
Sosuke is the one who knows.

95
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:20,101
-The problem is, while
we're fighting the Espadas,

96
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:23,101
there's no guarantee whatsoever
that Sosuke and his men

97
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:24,467
won't get in the way.

98
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,167
-You're right.

99
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,767
-All right.

100
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:35,067
You should stand back.

101
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:47,643
All things in the
universe turn to ashes.

00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:52,876
This wall of flames are to
keep Sosuke and his cohorts

110
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,709
at bay for quite some time.

111
00:09:55,743 --> 00:09:59,043
Now then, we shall
show them no mercy.

112

End them at once!

overboard, don't you think?

Well, Captain, Aizen?

What's going to
be our next move?

we're stuck in this furnace.

You're useless to
Lord Aizen now.

There is no one
here to protect you.

You are alone.

You will die here.

You will die all by yourself,
with no one to witness it.

frightened are you?

You see, now I know that my
friends came to rescue me.

You're not scared because your
friends have come for you?

142
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:27,343
You can't be serious.

143
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:32,009
You really think
they can save you?

144
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,909

they were coming here

147
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:51,809
to get me, at
first, I was happy.

148
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:54,776
But it also made me sad.

149
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:04,409
After all, the
reason I came here

150
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,609
was so I could protect them.

151
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:14,476
I thought, why did
they have to come?

152
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:17,176
Didn't they realize
what I was trying to do?

153
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:25,743
But then, when I
felt Rukia's pain,

154
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:32,943
and when I saw Ichigo
fighting with all his might,

155
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:35,443
I finally realized
none of that mattered.

156
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:42,443
But still, I couldn't bear
to see Ichigo get hurt.

157
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,709
I desperately wanted
everyone to be safe.

158
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:53,309
And that's when it hit me.

159
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:56,043
They must have felt the
same way that I did.

160
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:04,943
I mean, if one of them suddenly
went missing like I did,

161
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:10,176
there's no question I would do
the exact same thing for them.

00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:58,198
-You must be the
intruder, Ichigo Kurosaki.

165
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:05,465
-[groaning]

166
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:09,165
-I am Rudborrn, the
captain of the Exequias.

167
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:11,165
And I am here to
claim your life.

168
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:21,198
Your life now belongs to me.

169
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,398
You will go no further.

170
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:24,798
-Sorry, pal.

171
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,198
But I really don't have the time
to waste on some horned freak,

172
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:27,865
OK?

173
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,831
-That is fine.

174
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:35,265
I do not have any time
to waste on you either.

175
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:38,498
[fighting noises]

176
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:48,131
-Damn it.

177
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:49,265
How many of them are there?

178
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:57,065
[shouting]

179
00:16:57,098 --> 00:17:00,165
-[laughs] Yeah!

180
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:01,131
Want some more?

181
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:07,298
-What?

182
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:09,398
Renji!

183
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:09,898
-Heh.

184
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,865
-El Directo!

185
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:26,231
[shouting]

186
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:40,031
-Hey, Chad!

187
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:51,531
-You fools, letting a minor
obstacle ruin our mission.

188
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:01,531
RUKIA: Tsugi no mai, Hakuren!

189
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:14,398
-Rukia!

190
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:15,465
-Idiot!

191
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:17,765
Save the heartwarming
reunion for later.

192
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:18,698
Now get going, Ichigo.

193
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:23,265
-I'm on it.

194
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,665
-Oh, that guy.

195
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:29,798
He still needs a babysitter.

196
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:36,598
RUDBORNN: You honestly
thought you could best me

197
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:38,165
with those feeble powers?

198
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:44,498
You are nothing more
than a small nuisance.

199
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,065
-Ridiculous.

200
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:57,365
No matter what you think, the
fate of you and your friends

201
00:18:57,398 --> 00:18:59,865
is already decided.

202
00:18:59,898 --> 00:19:01,731
Even if they do
manage to find you,

203
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,831
it will not change the fact
that you are going to die.

204
00:19:05,865 --> 00:19:09,331
There's no turning
back from that now.

205
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,631
Sharing your
feelings with someone

206
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:14,098
when you're on
the verge of death

207
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:17,631
brings some sort of
comfort to you humans.

208
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:22,065
It's an instinct to help
minimize your fear and sorrow.

209
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:26,798
But in reality, it is impossible
to know another's emotions.

210
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:30,331
Empathy is simply a
meaningless human delusion.

211
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:52,765
ORIHIME: That may be true.

212
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,098
It might be impossible to feel
exactly what someone else is

213
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:56,598
feeling.

214
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:27,965
But when people truly
care about each other,

215
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:30,265
their hearts grow
so close, you can't

216
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:34,231
tell the difference
between them.

217
00:20:34,265 --> 00:20:37,165
Please don't die!

218
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:40,098
Don't die, Ichigo!

219
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:46,431
You don't have to win, but you
don't have to fight for me.

220
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:48,498
Just don't get hurt.

221
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:50,398
I couldn't bear it.

222
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:57,665
That's what it
must mean when they

223
00:20:57,698 --> 00:20:59,998
say two people are of one heart.

224
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:10,731
-Your heart, you say.

225
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:13,165
You humans always
toss around that word

226
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:16,198
so casually, as
if it's something

227
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:19,698
you can hold in the
palm of your hand.

228
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:23,531
But my eyes can see everything.

229
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:27,898
Nothing exists that I can't see.

230
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:31,365
So if I can't see
it, it's not real.

231
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:34,798
That is what I believe.

232
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:36,931
Tell me, what is a heart?

233
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:45,531
If I tore a whole in your
chest, would I see it?

234
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:50,731
If I split open your
skull, would it be there?

235
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:55,731
[gasp]

236
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:58,665
[rumbling]

237
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:21,560
[theme music]

238
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:49,308
RENJI: Roar, Zabimaru!

239
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:50,574
CHAD: El Directo!

240
00:23:50,608 --> 00:23:51,408
RUKIA: Hakuren!

241
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:52,241
ICHIGO: Whoa, guys!

242
00:23:52,274 --> 00:23:53,374
Want to take it down a notch?

243
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:54,941
RENJI: We haven't been
on the show in forever!

244
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:56,774
We got to make our mark.

245
00:23:56,808 --> 00:23:58,774
[laughter]

246
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:02,308
ICHIGO: I kind of feel
sorry for the Exequias now.
