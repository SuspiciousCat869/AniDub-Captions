1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,833
The Zanpakuto... Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,500
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,733
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:27,200
The Zanpakuto is born with
its Soul Reaper and dies
with its Soul Reaper...

5
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:30,333
That is the existence
of a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:27,298
[crying]
Why...?

7
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:33,265
Why have I been
abandoned?!

8
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:48,765
Orihimeeee!

9
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:53,298
I was worried! I'm so
glad you're all right!

10
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:55,031
Huh?

11
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:59,431
I've been freaked out
since I heard that
someone attacked a high
school girl last night!

12
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:02,465
I was beside myself!

13
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:05,531
I was afraid it might
have been my precious
Orihime!

14
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,865
It's really scary, isn't
it?

15
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:10,298
Are people getting
assaulted at random?

16
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,798
There was nothing random
about this!

17
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:24,231
All right, take your
seats, everyone. I want
to introduce a new
transfer student.

18
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:45,798
[snoring]

19
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:49,698
[singing]

20
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,498
This is Kyoko Haida.

21
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:58,031
She's your classmate now,
and I want you all to
make her feel welcome.

22
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,431
I am very
pleased to meet you.

23
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:02,765
I've never
seen her before.

24
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:04,331
... I know...

25
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:10,598
<i>What?</i>

26
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,998
So someone targeted a
high-school girl?

27
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:16,631
That's how it appears.
And about the victim...

28
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:19,498
She carried a phone
with a pink bear charm.

29
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:23,631
That's a weird detail.
How did you find out
about it?

30
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:25,465
That's a secret.

31
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,831
Let's just put it this
way, it'd take all day
to explain.

32
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:34,165
Really? So what do you
think?

33
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:39,798
The Sword Beasts are
extremely unstable, so it's
very difficult to track their
Spiritual Pressure.

34
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:43,898
We're not certain yet,
but a Sword Beast may be
involved in this
incident.

35
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:49,731
A Zanpakuto attacking
humans? I'll tell you this
much. That's not good...

36
00:04:58,831 --> 00:04:59,731
Hello.

37
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:03,265
Oh, hello!

38
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:06,431
Excuse me, but could you
tell me your name?

39
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:09,665
Sure, I'm Orihime
Inoue! Nice to meet you!

40
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:13,098
Hm?

41
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:15,098
<i>Orihime!</i>

42
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:16,398
Huh?

43
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:19,531
Come on, slow-poke,
we're gonna miss our
entire lunch break!

44
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:21,998
I'm sorry about that!
I'll be there in a minute!

45
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,565
Do you wanna
sit with us?

46
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:24,865
Oh, uh...

47
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,598
Where did she go?

48
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:36,165
I know something you
girls don't!

49
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:40,531
I just heard from Ms.
Ochi that the new student,
Kyoko, is incredibly smart.

50
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:44,265
And not only that,
apparently she's great
at sports as well...

51
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:46,731
Wow! That's really
amazing!

52
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:52,265
Now that I think about
it, she got up and solved
that problem in math class
really easily this afternoon.

53
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:55,898
So... Does Ms. Ochi know
why she transferred?

54
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:58,131
Mmmm...

55
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:00,498
I don't know... I didn't
ask her about that.

56
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:23,498
Victim is a female, 16
sixteen years of age. She's
in a state of shock, but
otherwise seems unharmed.

57
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:30,998
Are you picking up
a Sword Beast?

58
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:35,265
No. It seems different
from a Sword Beast in
many ways.

59
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:37,831
What do you suppose is
happening?

60
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,498
I'm not sure, but we need
to go down there and
check it out.

61
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:41,565
<i>Okay.</i>

62
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:42,831
<i>Huh?</i>

63
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,965
Isn't that the kind of
charm Kisuke mentioned?

64
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:49,565
[whistle blowing]

65
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,931
Get around to the
side! Oh, nice!

66
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:55,431
There you go! Oh!

67
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:59,865
Wow! She plays like
a professional!

68
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:02,665
I guess she really
is a serious athlete!

69
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,431
You gotta pass!

70
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:06,931
Cover her!

71
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:10,365
[gasping]

72
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:13,098
I'm so sorry,
are you all right?

73
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:15,598
Huh? Hey, time out!

74
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:18,265
I didn't mean to trip
her. Our feet just got
tangled up!

75
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:19,798
Do you think
you can walk?

76
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:23,765
We need some help here,
can someone take her to
the nurse?!

77
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:28,565
It's just a little
further. You're doing
great.

78
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:31,498
Our nurse is one of the
best ones in the this
school district!

79
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:33,398
She'll make you feel
better right away!

80
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:36,365
She's so gentle, you
hardly know she's
working on you!

81
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:44,298
OMG and we all had
such a great time!

82
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,531
[gasping]

83
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:48,565
[screaming]

84
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:57,998
Oh, dear. Are you
all right, Kyoko?

85
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,398
I knew it.

86
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:02,831
Huh?

87
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:05,631
From the moment we met, I
knew you were special.

88
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:08,698
What do you mean,
"special"?

89
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:14,198
Your power, of course.
You're a special human
who possesses special
powers.

90
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:18,065
I've decided you're
worthy of me.

91
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,231
What are you
talking about?

92
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:25,865
I have certain special
powers, as well. And
since we both have
special powers...

93
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:30,465
...I'm saying that we
should be friends.

94
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:33,198
Uh-uh. You have it all
wrong. I'm not a special
person.

95
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:34,631
Huh?

96
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:38,265
Like you said, I do have
a few strange powers I've
accumulated over the

97
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:41,165
years, but it definitely
doesn't make me special.

98
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:44,031
Where I come from, that's
the definition of special!

99
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:48,065
Hmm... it's secret.

100
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:51,865
Now why in the world
would you want to keep
something like that a secret?

101
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,365
Maybe I should tell
all your friends about it.

102
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:58,665
That way, they can stare
at you suspiciously,
every time you come into
a room.

103
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:01,265
They'll be terrified of
you! Won't that be fun?

104
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:06,331
<i>Why?</i>

105
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:07,931
[gasping]

106
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,698
Why on earth would
you would you want to
do something so mean?

107
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:16,031
<i>Kyoko!</i>

108
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:20,965
Back at my last school,
there was a girl named Mai
that I used to hang out with.

109
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:25,631
We were always together.
She was the only person I
could call a friend.

110
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,765
Kyoko!

111
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:32,631
After awhile, we came to
completely trust and respect
each other.

112
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:38,131
No matter what was going
on in my life, she was the
one person I could go to and
talk openly about it.

113
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:43,398
...Things about school,
things about home, things
about the people we
liked...

114
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:47,865
I thought she would
accept me, even if I
were different from
other people.

115
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:54,931
That probably won't
be on the test.

116
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:58,531
Huh? What are you
talking about? The
teacher said it would!

117
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,665
Right. He just
made a mistake.

118
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:04,131
He's going to
use the next one.

119
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:05,665
How would you know that?

120
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:24,298
I got this for you. You
said that you wanted it,
right?

121
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:27,398
Wow, you did that for me?
Thanks a lot!

122
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:29,198
You're welcome! I'll see
you later.

123
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,298
Mai...

124
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:36,998
Kyoko?

125
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:39,898
Are you going out
with that boy?

126
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:45,231
I've gotta tell you,
he's bad news.

127
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:48,231
No-one else knows about
this, but he has lots of
other girlfriends,

128
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:51,265
and when he needs it,
he steals money from
his parents.

129
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:54,698
I'm sorry, Mai. I
didn't wanna have
to tell you.

130
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:59,631
But I don't want you to
get hurt, and I can't
stand to see him playing
you for a fool.

131
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:03,165
If I were you, I'd stay
away from him. He's not
worth your time.

132
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:04,298
Mai...?

133
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:07,898
You creep.

134
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:13,965
You scare me, Kyoko.
You're not normal.

135
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:15,898
But... Mai...

136
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:17,798
Just stay away!

137
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:20,231
Mai, don't--

138
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:22,365
No!

139
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:26,165
Don't come near me,
anymore! There's something
wrong with you!

140
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,012
Kyoko? Kyoko?

141
00:11:59,412 --> 00:12:03,779
Hey, about what you said,
can't you and I still be
friends regardless.

142
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:07,012
of whether or not we
have any kind of special
powers?

143
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:08,379
Huh?

144
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:10,779
I'd like to be your
friend, if you'd let me.

145
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:21,046
[groaning]

146
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,612
What's wrong,
Kyoko?!

147
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:31,479
What is that?!

148
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,946
Kyoko!

149
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:00,646
Was she holding...
a Zanpakuto?

150
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:08,846
Did you just
pick that up?

151
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,912
Yeah, it was only there for
a moment, but it was the same
Spiritual Pressure we sensed
last night.

152
00:13:13,946 --> 00:13:15,212
Come on, Ichigo.

153
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:18,712
It's near Karakura High
School.

154
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:21,112
Hm? You sure about that?!

155
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:31,079
[heavy breathing]

156
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:33,079
<i>I hope...</i>

157
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:38,412
<i>...after all you've</i>
<i>experienced, you weren't</i>
<i>taking that girl seriously.</i>

158
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:45,412
<i>If I hadn't shown up at</i>
<i>that moment, you would have</i>
<i>made the same mistake you</i>
<i>made with that other girl.</i>

159
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:49,946
Those who are always
surrounded by friends
have it so easy...

160
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:54,179
<i>They will never understand</i>
<i>what we have gone through.</i>

161
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:58,246
<i>Loss, hate, abandoned</i>
<i>by everyone!</i>

162
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,412
Yes, but...

163
00:13:59,446 --> 00:14:01,446
What is it?

164
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:05,512
She only said she
wanted to... be my
friend.

165
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:08,112
Believe me, she didn't
really mean it.

166
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:09,779
You think so?

167
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:12,546
Of course. You have a
short memory.

168
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:17,212
The lesson to be learned
from our abandonment is not
to trust what people say.

169
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:19,012
They're likely to
lie to you.

170
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:22,046
That's why you and I
were drawn to each other.

171
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,346
I understand your anger.

172
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,512
Go ahead and unleash
your feelings!

173
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:46,479
Let it all out. If you
hold it in, the emotions will
turn back on you and your
heart will be crushed.

174
00:15:07,312 --> 00:15:12,446
Quit denying your
true feelings. You want
to kill that girl, Mai
Suzuki, don't you?

175
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,612
Stop it,
you're wrong!

176
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:18,779
Let me be the instrument
of your revenge!

177
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:22,146
Stop it. Don't do
this! Leave me alone!

178
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:29,146
Can you take over my
cleanup duty today?

179
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,312
What?

180
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,679
You wouldn't believe what
she did then...

181
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:34,446
What was that?

182
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,879
It can't be good.

183
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:56,712
[heavy breathing]

184
00:15:56,746 --> 00:16:00,779
[screaming]

185
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:11,279
[shaking]
What do you want?
Please, don't hurt me!

186
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:14,746
[chuckling]

187
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,279
[gasping]

188
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:30,812
Stop it!

189
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:34,512
Stop it? I was simply
trying to grant your
wish, Kyoko.

190
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:37,246
Why would I ever stop?!
Isn't this what you wanted?

191
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:39,879
It's not! You're
mistaken!!

192
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,546
[sobbing]
Please forgive me! I
didn't mean to make
you so angry!

193
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:51,546
It's all right, Mai. I'm
not going to hurt you.

194
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:54,446
I don't believe you!
You're gonna kill me!

195
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,712
You're wrong! Listen to
what I have to say!

196
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:57,646
No!

197
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,512
I'm not the one who
chased you up here!

198
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:02,212
[screaming and sobbing]

199
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:03,246
Mai!

200
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:04,712
[growling]

201
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:06,979
[screaming]

202
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:23,346
It's hopeless. No one will
ever accept me. How could
they?

203
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:29,779
So long, Mai.

204
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:34,679
[screaming]

205
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:39,112
This is perfect! Your
heart is completely
synchronized with
mine, now!

206
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:41,579
I've been waiting
patiently for this
moment!

207
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:44,512
Your body and soul belong
to me, now!

208
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:51,546
[laughing]
[struggling]

209
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,012
Kyoko! I'm here!

210
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,179
What's happened to you?!

211
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,079
You are too
late, girl.

212
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:14,679
What have you done to
Kyoko?! Bring her back
right now!

213
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:17,479
Silence!!

214
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:23,246
Ichigo!

215
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:27,179
Rukia!

216
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:31,712
I thought this Spiritual
Pressure felt odd. It was
because it was fused to a
human!

217
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,612
Who are you
supposed to be?

218
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:39,546
Ichigo Kurosaki! And I'm
the Substitute Soul Reaper!

219
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:47,846
Substitute Soul Reaper.
Yes, I've heard things
about you.

220
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,012
What should we do?

221
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:55,246
We need to be very
careful. However...

222
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,646
...If she's been
completely absorbed
by the Sword Beast...

223
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:03,746
... We'll be left with no
choice but to kill her.

224
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:04,879
No, wait a minute!

225
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:05,812
Hm?

226
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,312
Make it quick.

227
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,779
Kyoko is still fighting
inside of her body!

228
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:12,312
You're sure of that?

229
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:16,312
She's suffering.

230
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:19,879
Enough of this
nonsense!

231
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:27,679
Yeah, it's faint,
but I can feel it.

232
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:29,546
So what do you think we
should do?

233
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:33,512
I'm begging you, don't
draw this out any further,
just let go of her!

234
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:39,079
That's out of the
question. But let me pose
another possibility. Are
you willing to trade

235
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:46,046
places with her? I might
let her go, if you don't
mind becoming my host and
giving me complete control.

236
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:52,012
It's impossible, and you
should already know that.

237
00:19:52,046 --> 00:19:53,546
What?

238
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:58,346
No one can belong to you
in the end. Neither myself,
nor Kyoko nor anyone else!

239
00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:03,079
It's an illusion you've
created in your own mind!
And it's a completely false
presumption!

240
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:07,179
What do you
know? You're an
ignorant child!

241
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:13,546
My master despised me
and discarded me, and
perished without me by
his side! I lost my honor

242
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:18,246
as a Zanpakuto! And I was
left to die without hope
of anyone finding me!

243
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:24,746
I won't listen to your
ideals! I can operate on
my own, without a master! I
will absorb everything I can!

244
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:31,279
I will gain power on my
own! And when I'm done, I
will show everyone what I
can do!

245
00:20:31,312 --> 00:20:33,546
This is crazy,
you're out of
control!

246
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:34,779
Kyoko!

247
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:38,546
Kyoko, can you
hear me?!

248
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:47,312
[struggling]

249
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,746
She's suffering horribly!

250
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:50,579
Orihime!

251
00:20:50,612 --> 00:20:51,112
Huh?

252
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:53,046
Use your Sotenkishun!

253
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:56,679
I think you can separate
the Sword Beast from its
host!

254
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:00,779
Sotenkishun!

255
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:02,379
I reject you!

256
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:13,079
She's vulnerable now!

257
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:15,446
Getsugatensho!

258
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,012
[giggling]

259
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:28,946
I wiped Mai Suzuki's
memory.

260
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:44,179
Kyoko?

261
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:47,346
Orihime!

262
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:50,079
[giggling]
Let's walk home together.

263
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:53,412
Is something wrong?

264
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:57,312
Mmm-mmm.

265
00:21:57,346 --> 00:22:00,112
[giggling]

266
00:22:00,146 --> 00:22:03,612
You want to stop by a
sweet shop, don't you,
Orihime?

267
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:06,312
That's right, but how did
you know that?

268
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:07,979
<i>By the look on your face.</i>

269
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:09,379
<i>[giggling]</i>

270
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:44,772
Where's Uryu
and Chad??

271
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:49,647
<i>Chad found a stray cat</i>
<i>and took it over to the</i>
<i>animal hospital. And Uryu</i>
<i>has the stomach flu.</i>

272
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,647
But, I was with him all
day yesterday! I need to
gargle and wash my hands!

273
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,314
<i>I think it's too late for</i>
<i>that.</i>

274
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:58,614
Why am I so hot? Am I
getting a fever? My
stomach hurts!
