[theme music]

2
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,707
VOICEOVER: Soul Reapers.

3
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:52,507
The spiritual guardians to
the world of the living.

4
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,241
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

5
00:01:55,274 --> 00:02:00,141
of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

6
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:02,741
Sosuke Aizen who
betrayed the Soul Society

7
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:08,274
and let the [inaudible] chaos,
has set his plan into motion.

8
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:11,074
Arrancars have arrived
in Karakura town.

9
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:14,241
Using the Hogyoku, Aizen
has created these Arrancar

10
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:16,474
by shattering the boundary
between Soul Reapers

11
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:17,941
and Hollows.

12
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:19,774
-That's a zanpakuto.

13
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,574
Who are these guys?

14
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:24,307
Are they Vizards
like Shinji an me?

15
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:25,707
VOICEOVER: Ichigo
and his friends

16
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:29,541
were able to fend off the
Arrancars Ulquiorra and Yammy,

17
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:33,807
but were injured more seriously
than any of them realized.

18
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:36,041
Terrified of the
hollow within him,

19
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:38,307
Ichigo lost his will to fight.

20
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:41,507
Amidst all these confrontations,
Toshiro Hitsugaya

21
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,874
and a group from the Soul
Society were sent to this world

22
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:45,974
to help.

23
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:47,941
-If you're afraid of
losing, then you just

24
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:49,141
have to get stronger.

25
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:55,241
But if you're afraid
of the hollow within,

26
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,241
then you must not only
become strong enough

27
00:02:57,274 --> 00:03:00,774
to destroy it, for that is
the kind of man you are.

28
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,974
VOICEOVER: Rukia was able
to talk sense into Ichigo

29
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:05,207
and snapped him out
of his depression.

30
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:08,874
However, at the same time,
other events began to unfold.

31
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:11,774
The Arrancar Grimmjow was
displeased with the way

32
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:14,374
Ulquiorra had handled things
in the fight against Ichigo.

33
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:17,807
He left Aizen's stronghold
with a small force

34
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:20,007
and entered the
world of the living.

35
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,907
-You will show them no mercy.

36
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:27,207
If they show even a glimmer of
spiritual pressure, kill them.

37
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,307
Don't let a single one escape.

38
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:30,241
Let's go.

39
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:40,807
-The spiritual pressure.

40
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:43,474
It's them.

41
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:44,174
-Rukia.

42
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,574
-I'm way ahead of you.

43
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:49,207
One, two, three-- six of them.

44
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,374
There are so many.

45
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:53,207
-Do you think they're
coming here for us?

46
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:56,307
-No, they're targeting
spiritual pressure,

47
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:58,707
but they don't seem
to be coming this way.

48
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:00,441
-So what the hell
does that mean?

49
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,074
-They're not interested
in the strength

50
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:03,474
of the spiritual pressure.

51
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:05,174
They're making a hit list.

52
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:07,341
It means humans
with the slightest

53
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:09,274
amount of spiritual
pressure will be killed.

54
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:14,207
-Uryu should have no
spiritual pressure right now.

55
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:16,174
But what about Chad and Orihime?

56
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:18,507
-Captain Hitsugaya and
Lieutenant Matsumoto

57
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,441
are pretty close to Orihime.

58
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:22,874
She should be safe
with them nearby.

59
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:25,941
But Chad's alone.

60
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,841
And there's one who's
headed right toward him.

61
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:38,641
-So finally showed up.

62
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:40,574
No surprise there.

63
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:41,641
Let's get them, Yumichika.

64
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,841
-Go find a place where
you won't get hurt.

65
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:51,341
-Right.

66
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:51,841
-Captain.

67
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:57,574
-Where's Orihime Inoue?

68
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:59,307
-I'm having my
Gigai watch over her

69
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,541
so that she doesn't
participate in the battle.

70
00:05:01,574 --> 00:05:03,074
-All right.

71
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:04,307
You better get ready, Rangiku.

72
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:13,241
They've arrived.

73
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:14,374
-They're so fast.

74
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:24,707
-Pleasure to meet you.

75
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:28,674
-Captain.

76
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:37,741
-Nice try, pal.

77
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:44,574
-I am the 11th Arrancar.

78
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:46,707
I have been named Shawlong.

79
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:49,774
-I'm th captain of Squad
10, Toshiro Hitsugaya.

80
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:03,307
-Well, the captain
of Squad 10, you say?

81
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:05,274
Impressive.

82
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:08,307
That must mean I
hit the jackpot.

83
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:10,741
-No.

84
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:17,207
In fact, you've already lost,
as you're about to discover.

85
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:17,707
-Oh?

86
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:36,074
-You mustn't move yet, Chad.

87
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:38,041
I haven't finished
healing you yet.

88
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:45,574
-I'm fine now.

89
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:47,241
Go back to Orihime and heal her.

90
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:53,841
-What's this?

91
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:55,874
You're not a Soul Reaper.

92
00:06:58,574 --> 00:06:59,474
No good.

93
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:06,041
-You shouldn't
evaluate your attack

94
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:08,241
until after you've
won the fight.

95
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:11,807
Do you get what I'm saying?

96
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:13,707
-I suppose that's fair enough.

97
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:17,741
After I kill you, there
won't be any confusion.

98
00:07:17,774 --> 00:07:20,407
I'll tell the others
that none of you

99
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:25,107
Soul Reapers knew how to fight.

100
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:26,607
Mwa ha ha.

101
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:32,607
-He would have
killed me if Ichigo

102
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:35,074
hadn't shown up when he did.

103
00:07:35,107 --> 00:07:38,074
I'd be dead for sure.

104
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:40,474
-Chad, step back, OK?

105
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:47,707
-Wait, Ichigo, if you're
worried about my injuries--

106
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:49,674
-Chad.

107
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:53,907
Please, let me handle this.

108
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:54,907
-I see.

109
00:07:57,907 --> 00:08:00,707
Fine, I get it.

110
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:03,141
I'll leave him to you, Ichigo.

111
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:07,307
-Hold up, Chad.

112
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:09,774
Are you all right?

113
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:10,274
Huh?

114
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:16,607
-Ichigo, what happened?

115
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:20,841
Don't you trust me to
get your back anymore?

116
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:26,907
I wonder if we'll ever be
able to fight as a team again.

117
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:27,407
Ichigo.

118
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:37,074
-So now that we can fight, how
shall I go about killing you?

119
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:42,807
-Rukia.

120
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:46,674
-Yeah, I saw Chad
on the way here.

121
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:47,974
He looked upset.

122
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,874
What did you say that
might have set him off?

123
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:51,274
-I have no idea.

124
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:54,241
I simply told him to stay back
and let me handle this fight.

125
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:00,541
-Step back, Ichigo.

126
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:01,541
-Huh?

127
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,607
You want me to what?

128
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:07,007
Wait, that's--

129
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,307
-Right.

130
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:11,907
I'm telling you to step back
and leave this guy to me.

131
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:14,574
Trust me, you're way too
eager for this battle.

132
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,474
You're too tense.

133
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:22,607
You could get yourself
killed fighting like this.

134
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:27,307
-Rukia.

135
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:36,107
I didn't know that
your powers returned.

136
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:39,174
-Yeah, quite a surprise, huh?

137
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:42,541
After a while, I concluded
that the Gigai Urahara

138
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:45,107
had me using wasn't
going to work.

139
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:48,374
I thought about it and realize
that if I wanted my spirit

140
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:51,441
energy to come back, I
needed to return to the Soul

141
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:54,341
Society which is
overflowing with Reishi.

142
00:09:57,507 --> 00:09:59,874
-You were able to absorb them?

143
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:02,041
-Yes, that's right.

144
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:03,174
Did you forget?

145
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:05,374
We've seen evidence
of this before.

146
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:07,941
The Bounts absorbed
Reishi in the Soul Society

147
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,174
to enhance their powers.

148
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:13,374
Even though Soul Reapers
can't absorb them as rapidly,

149
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,641
we have the same ability.

150
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:17,507
-But wait a minute,
I'm still confused.

151
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,507
I thought that your powers
still hadn't returned

152
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,207
during our fight
with the Bounts.

153
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:22,407
-Not completely.

154
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:24,374
After Captain
Aizen's rebellion, I

155
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:25,907
was supposed to
recuperate and let

156
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:28,507
my powers restore
themselves for a while.

157
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,774
However, the sudden
appearance of the Bounts

158
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,607
threw a monkey
wrench into my plans.

159
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:36,107
The Soul Society
was in total chaos.

160
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:38,241
After all, it was an
emergency situation

161
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:41,741
and we were working without
guidance from Central 46.

162
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,974
Then the Bounts made their way
to Karakura Town and you were

163
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:47,374
all forced to take them on. .

164
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:49,874
The Seireitei had no
choice but to send

165
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:52,041
people to help who
were familiar with you

166
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:53,241
in the world of the living.

167
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:58,741
-Someone familiar with
us in Karakura Town?

168
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:05,041
So they sent you,
Hanataro, Ganju, and Renji?

169
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:06,907
Don't you think they
could have done a better

170
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:08,674
job picking people?

171
00:11:08,707 --> 00:11:10,441
You didn't really do anything.

172
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:12,241
[laughing]

173
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:13,507
[panicking]

174
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,541
-Whoa!

175
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,541
What the hell are
you supposed to be?

176
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:18,807
-Please step back, Ichigo.

177
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:19,874
-What are you?

178
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:21,507
-She's the most
popular Soul Candy

179
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,107
amongst female Soul Reapers.

180
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,607
She's called Chappy.

181
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:27,107
To be perfectly honest,
this is the Soul Candy

182
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:28,174
I wanted to purchase.

183
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:29,774
But there weren't any
left on the shelves,

184
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:31,207
and I was given Kon instead.

185
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,174
-Oh really?

186
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:33,641
You mean to say
you were actually

187
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:36,307
going to put this
thing in my body?

188
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:39,807
I'm glad we ended
up with Kon instead.

189
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:41,707
If you don't let go
of my hair, you're

190
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:43,507
going to find out how
rude I can really be.

191
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,474
-Nice to see you two
getting along so well.

192
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:48,741
Before coming back here, I
had Orihime treat my wounds.

193
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,841
And after that, my spirit energy
was almost completely restored.

194
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:57,841
I must say it was quite a--

195
00:11:57,874 --> 00:11:58,307
-Rukia!

196
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:09,374
-Nice to meet you.

197
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:11,041
I'm Arrancar 16.

198
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:13,707
I am called Di Roy.

199
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:14,907
-I'm in the 13th Squad.

200
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:17,307
-Never mind, you don't
have to bother telling me.

201
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:20,341
If I had to listen to the
names and titles of everyone

202
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:23,574
I was about to kill, I'd
never get anything done.

203
00:12:23,607 --> 00:12:24,374
-I see.

204
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:29,607
Then listen to this, Di Roy.

205
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:32,141
At the very least, you should
learn the name of my zanpakuto.

206
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:38,874
Dance, Sode no Shirayuki.

207
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,974
-Some no mai tsukishiro.

208
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,007
-What the hell is this?

209
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:10,541
-Oh well, tough luck
for you, Soul Reaper.

210
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:12,374
The sky is my domain.

211
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:15,241
It's where my true
strengths lie.

212
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:17,474
A sword that can
freeze the ground

213
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:19,674
isn't worth much up here.

214
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:22,074
Die!

215
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:23,474
-Well actually, my friend.

216
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:34,774
-I never said my zanpakuto
could only freeze the ground.

217
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:43,007
Everything inside this
circle, both earth and sky

218
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,241
is within Sode no
Shirayuki's frozen domain.

219
00:13:55,678 --> 00:13:58,078
[whimpering]

220
00:13:58,111 --> 00:13:59,378
-Shut up.

221
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:02,078
If you don't shutsy upsy,
I'll force you to be quiet.

222
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,944
-Stop with the cutesy
talk already, will you?

223
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:06,311
I'm in so much pain,
I can't be quiet.

224
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:07,511
Let go of me now.

225
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:08,078
-No.

226
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:08,644
[bone cracking]

227
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:09,978
-Gah!

228
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:11,111
You're breaking my arm.

229
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:12,744
I'm gonna kick
your butt, I swear.

230
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:15,078
-Well, I certainly don't
want to have my butt kicked,

231
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:17,411
so to protect myself,
I'd better kill you.

232
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:18,811
-Whoa, wait a second.

233
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:20,144
Don't get crazy.

234
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:22,044
I mean you're just supposed
to be holding me down, right?

235
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,344
-But this is so much fun.

236
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:25,711
Now your arm goes breaky wakey.

237
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:28,078
[bone crunching]

238
00:14:28,111 --> 00:14:30,811
-Excuse me, what are
you two fools doing?

239
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:36,478
-Rukia.

240
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:38,011
So is everything OK?

241
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,644
What happened to the Arrancar.

242
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,344
Did you defeat him?

243
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:43,911
-Of course.

244
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:45,278
That's a silly question.

245
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:48,344
Otherwise I wouldn't
be back here, would I?

246
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,444
-Yeah, true.

247
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:51,844
That zanpakuto.

248
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:54,311
-Sode no Shirayuki.

249
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:55,844
I know what you're thinking.

250
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:57,278
Impressive, isn't it?

251
00:14:57,311 --> 00:14:59,178
The snow and ice zanpakuto.

252
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:02,844
It's the most beautiful one
in all of the Soul Society.

253
00:15:02,878 --> 00:15:07,678
The blade, the guard,
even the hilt--

254
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:11,911
it's a zanpakuto like pure snow.

255
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,178
So pwetty.

256
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,344
-Way to kill the mood.

257
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:18,844
[bone cracking]

258
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:21,278
-You may not realize
this, but right now, Rukia

259
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:24,478
is strong enough to
become a ranked officer.

260
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:28,044
But if she was assigned a seat,
the risk level of her missions

261
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,744
would be much more
dangerous than those

262
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:31,144
of a regular guardsman.

263
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:33,211
And because a certain
someone didn't

264
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:35,411
want her to be exposed
to those dangers,

265
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:37,778
he pulled some strings,
approached the captains,

266
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,311
and asked that her
name be removed

267
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,378
from the list of
officer candidates.

268
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:44,178
-A certain someone?

269
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:47,244
-You didn't hear it from me,
but it was Byakuya Kuchiki.

270
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:53,678
It's love.

271
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:56,144
-Great, you just ruined
the moment again.

272
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:58,711
So if you don't mind, would you
get the hell off me already.

273
00:15:58,744 --> 00:16:00,578
[cries of pain]

274
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:02,144
-I know what Mr. Smarty-pants.

275
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:03,811
-How long are you
going to keep that up?

276
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:07,578
It's not getting you anywhere
and we have quite a bit of--

277
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:17,844
-What the hell happened here?

278
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:20,044
Di Roy's been killed?

279
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:22,678
Heh.

280
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:25,278
Oh well.

281
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:28,378
In that case, It
looks like I'll just

282
00:16:28,411 --> 00:16:30,744
have to kill the both of you.

283
00:16:30,778 --> 00:16:33,578
let me introduce myself.

284
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:36,411
I'm Arrancar Six.

285
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:38,811
You can call me Grimmjow.

286
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:40,744
-Hm.

287
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:41,244
-Hm.

288
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:51,044
-Apparently someone
took out Di Roy.

289
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,611
-What an ignoramus.

290
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,111
He pesters us to
bring them along.

291
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,878
And when we do this,
this is what happens.

292
00:16:57,911 --> 00:17:01,211
-Let me give you some of
the same treatment he got.

293
00:17:01,244 --> 00:17:02,511
Roar!

294
00:17:02,544 --> 00:17:03,011
Zabimaru!

295
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,678
[gasp]

296
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:12,144
-Even though lord Aizen
took him under his wing,

297
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:15,978
that Di Roy was never
really much of a warrior.

298
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,678
[growl]

299
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:20,644
-Whoever for Di Roy
was very fortunate.

300
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:23,778
Truth is, for an Arrancar,
he was incompetent.

301
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:27,344
A failure of
unbelievable proportions.

302
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:29,211
You won't be that lucky.

303
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:33,378
You're up against me, and I'm
always victorious in battle.

304
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:36,678
I'll play around until
you're exhausted.

305
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,978
And then I'll destroy you!

306
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:44,944
[maniacal laughter]

307
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:46,578
[panicked moaning]

308
00:17:50,244 --> 00:17:51,978
-What's happening?

309
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:53,478
This is so scary.

310
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:55,111
I hope it's not nearby.

311
00:17:55,144 --> 00:17:56,611
Must be gangs or something.

312
00:17:56,644 --> 00:18:01,778
These guys have no respect,
making such a racket at night.

313
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:05,011
[groan] My stupid sister.

314
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:06,311
Seriously.

315
00:18:06,344 --> 00:18:09,111
She should go out and buy
her own damn juice, Oh man.

316
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,278
I hate this area.

317
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:11,278
It's so dark.

318
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:12,778
Who knows what's out here?

319
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:14,111
On top of which,
I've been seeing

320
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:16,578
a lot of ghost-like figures
running around lately.

321
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:18,178
I don't know why
they should scare me.

322
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:19,644
I don't believe in ghosts.

323
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:26,611
But still-- All that stuff
gives me the creeps anyway.

324
00:18:30,144 --> 00:18:31,444
[making siren sounds]

325
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:32,378
-Huh?

326
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,011
Here comes that
dude who's always

327
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:35,811
fighting monsters on the street.

328
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:38,044
[making siren sounds]

329
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:40,311
-How you doing Fro-man?

330
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:41,144
-Huh?

331
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:42,478
-You filming a scene tonight?

332
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:45,478
[laughter] I think I just
gave you a new nickname, bro.

333
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:47,011
-Shut up, you idiot.

334
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,044
there's no time for
your stupid jokes.

335
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:50,978
You better listen to
me, was listen good.

336
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:54,244
If you stay here, your life
expectancy is going to be zero.

337
00:18:54,278 --> 00:18:57,744
[making siren sounds]

338
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:58,411
-Wow.

339
00:18:58,444 --> 00:18:59,744
What's up with him?

340
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:01,111
What a jerk!

341
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:04,711
All I was trying to
do was say hello.

342
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,378
Now that I stop
to think about it,

343
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,244
I've never seen
this guy's TV show.

344
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:10,444
Maybe it's on cable.

345
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:14,344
I wonder if it's any good.

346
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:14,811
Huh?

347
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:24,478
[panicked gasping]

348
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:26,211
-No way!

349
00:19:26,244 --> 00:19:27,278
I don't believe in ghosts.

350
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:28,378
I don't believe in ghosts.

351
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:32,211
I don't believe in ghosts!

352
00:19:32,244 --> 00:19:34,544
[screaming]

353
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:36,544
[stuttering] Wait a minute.

354
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:39,178
You're that guys I saw in
our school earlier today.

355
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,511
What are you doing here?

356
00:19:40,544 --> 00:19:43,011
And even more importantly,
why are you covered in blood?

357
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:45,311
And what's with the sword?

358
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:46,278
-Hm?

359
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:49,244
You're that boy
from this afternoon.

360
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:52,311
[grunt]

361
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:53,978
[laughter]

362
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:55,511
-What's the matter Soul Reaper?

363
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:58,911
If that's the best you've
got, you'd better give up now.

364
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:00,044
Hah!

365
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:01,911
-I knew shouldn't have
come out here tonight.

366
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:03,778
I just wanted to get some juice.

367
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:06,444
Now guys are talking
about Soul Reapers.

368
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:08,478
Wait-- maybe they want mine!

369
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:09,978
-Hey, kid.

370
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:12,944
[panicked moaning]

371
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,744
-I've got a proposition
I want to talk about.

372
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:17,411
You want to hear it?

373
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:20,944
-Well, now that all depends
on what you have to say.

374
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:22,044
Is there blood involved?

375
00:20:22,078 --> 00:20:23,978
-We're looking for a
place to stay tonight,

376
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:25,978
and we don't have
much cash on us.

377
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,644
You have a place I imagine.

378
00:20:27,678 --> 00:20:29,011
But you've stumbled
into a battle

379
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,911
and you're about to get killed.

380
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:33,211
-Actually, it
appears that you may

381
00:20:33,244 --> 00:20:34,811
be the one who's
about to get killed.

382
00:20:34,844 --> 00:20:36,678
-I haven't finished yet!

383
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:39,844
Here's the deal-- you put us
up at your place for a while.

384
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:43,911
And in return for that, I'll
protect you from these bozos.

385
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:45,278
-Huh?

386
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,211
-Are you brain-damaged
or something?!

387
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:48,378
It's a simple question!

388
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:50,078
Give me a yes or no!

389
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:50,644
-Yes!

390
00:20:50,678 --> 00:20:51,511
You can stay!

391
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:55,311
-All right.

392
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:57,511
Thanks for the invite.

393
00:20:57,544 --> 00:20:58,444
Hey, you.

394
00:20:58,478 --> 00:20:59,811
-Hm?

395
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:03,211
-You were so busy trying to kill
me I didn't catch your name.

396
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:03,911
-Oh.

397
00:21:03,944 --> 00:21:05,478
I guess you're right.

398
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:07,044
I'm Arrancar 13.

399
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:10,244
Also known-- Hm.

400
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:11,844
-Hm?

401
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:12,911
-Never mind.

402
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:14,278
Waste of time.

403
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:16,511
I just realized there's
no point in giving out

404
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:19,178
my name to somebody
I'm about to kill.

405
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,044
Heh.

406
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:22,944
-Is that right.

407
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:26,278
It seems that you and I operate
with very different rules

408
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:28,244
of etiquette.

409
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:29,711
-Huh?

410
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:32,278
-Maybe it's in fact
that you're part Hollow.

411
00:21:32,311 --> 00:21:35,478
But we let our opponents know
the name of their killers.

412
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:38,411
It's something I teach
every pupil I train.

413
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:40,378
If you're prepared
to die in battle,

414
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:42,111
you should want to
die knowing name

415
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:44,511
of the person who defeated you.

416
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:46,978
So allow me to introduce myself.

417
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:55,344
I'm Ikkaku Madarame, third
seat of the Zaraki squad.

418
00:21:55,378 --> 00:21:57,178
I won't bother
spelling it for you.

419
00:21:57,211 --> 00:22:01,744
I doubt your brain can
absorb that much information.

420
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:05,211
Just know that I'm the one
who's about to kill you!

421
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,353
Did you know an
Arrancar's tough skin

422
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,053
is written as "steel
hide" in kanji,

423
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:52,786
but is actually
pronounced as "iron"?

424
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,520
HITSUGAYA: Sometimes
I wonder if your skin

425
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:55,886
is even tougher than theirs.

426
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,086
Oh please, don't compare my
soft complexion to those beasts.

427
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,420
HITSUGAYA: Tough skin isn't
always found on the surface.

428
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,086
-The Soul Reapers.

429
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,486
-That's the latest
information we

430
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,820
have from the world
of the living, ma'am.

431
00:24:19,853 --> 00:24:22,586
-Continue to keep watch over
them and report back to me.

432
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,553
-Yes, ma'am.

433
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:25,553
Here are the
surveillance photos.

434
00:24:25,586 --> 00:24:26,053
-Very well.

435
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,353
-Oh wow, Lady Yoroichi, you're
such an impressive woman.

436
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:40,353
What style.

437
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:43,320
You even look
amazing when you eat.
