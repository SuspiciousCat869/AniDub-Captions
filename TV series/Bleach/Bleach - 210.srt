00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:53,608
NARRATOR: 101 years in the past,
just nine years after Kisuke

3
00:01:53,642 --> 00:01:57,375
Urahara had been promoted to the
position of Captain Squad 12,

4
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,508
a string of mysterious deaths
plagued the Rukon District.

5
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:03,242
The victims vanished, leaving
their close behind, which

6
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:05,742
caused quite a commotion
in the Soul Society.

7
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:08,308
Normally when a person
dies and becomes Reishi,

8
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:09,842
their clothing goes with them.

9
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,775
But since there clothes
were left behind,

10
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:14,242
these deaths were
thought to be unnatural.

11
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:18,042
The 13 Court Guard Squads saw
this as an abnormal situation

12
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:21,675
and dispatched Squad Nine, led
by Captain Kensei Muguruma,

13
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,842
to investigate.

14
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,742
Upon reaching the
Rukon District,

15
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:27,342
they encountered
what they expected.

16
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,275
-Now blast away.

-Mashiro.

25
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:13,208
Where the hell did you
go during the battle?

26
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:14,975
-Listen, while I was
hiding in the bushes,

27
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:16,942
look what I found on the ground.

28
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:19,542
See, a squad uniform.

29
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,908
-Hmm.

30
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:23,808
Ten uniforms?

31
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:31,075
Ten was the number of
men in the advance party.

32
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,775
NARRATOR: Kensei determined
from the number of uniforms

33
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:36,108
left behind that they must
have belonged to the advance

34
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:37,675
party that had been
sent ahead of them

35
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,842
to investigate these
strange deaths.

36
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,675
He then ordered a
member of his squad

37
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,542
to report these
casualties to Central 46.

38
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:47,042
Kensei formally
requested that Squad 12

39
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:49,508
have laboratory personnel
dispatched in order

40
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,408
to determine if these
deaths were possibly

41
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:53,742
the result of some
unknown pathogen.

42
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,575
In response to this
request, Kisuke Urahara

43
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:58,575
sent Hiyori to Kensei.

44
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:01,275
Unbelievably, that same night--

45
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,442
MALE SPEAKER: Aaaugh!

00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:05,375
-What happened?

00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:11,042

All squad captains

There is an emergency

for Squad Nine Captain Kensei

Muguruma and Lieutenant
Mashiro Kuna have vanished.

62
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:09,142
An emergency meeting
of all squad captains

63
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:09,942
will soon commence.

-Sir?

00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,908
Well, actually she
left a while ago.

(GASPING) Captain!

MALE SPEAKER (ON LOUDSPEAKER):
Repeat, emergency assembly!

71
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:27,108
Attention, all squad captains.

72
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:29,508
Assemble immediately at
the Squad One barracks!

73
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,975
-I knew I should have gone.

74
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:34,775
I'm sorry, Hiyori, but
you're the only person

75
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:38,008
I can confidently entrust with
a task as important as this one.

76
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,975
I'm counting on you, Hiyori.

77
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:44,608
Don't let me down.

78
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:47,042
-Mmph.

79
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:49,475
-I never thought
this would happen.

80
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:49,975
Never!

[footsteps]

00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,308
-How the hell did
that idiot Kisuke

83
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:57,775
trick me into doing this?

84
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:59,708
I can't believe I fell for it.

85
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:02,842
I mean, why should I
be the one to be doing

86
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,775
the work for the Department
of Research and Development?

87
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:08,175
That's something Kisuke and
that idiot Mayuri should

88
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,608
be taking care of themselves,
but instead those jerks

89
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:12,342
are forcing our
entire Squad to study

90
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,308
how to develop new technologies.

91
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:14,808

[footsteps]

00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:17,242
-Huh?

94
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:24,508
Hmm.

95
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:25,675
What is that?

96
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:32,575
-We have an urgent situation.

97
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:34,708
We received a rather
disturbing report

98
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,308
from Squad Nine,
who have arrived

99
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:38,408
on the scene in
the Rukon District.

100
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:41,475
They stated that the spiritual
pressures of both Squad Nine

101
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:44,875
captain Kensei Muguruma and
Lieutenant Mashiro Kuna,

102
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:47,908
last seen in the field,
have vanished completely.

103
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:50,575
What it is unknown is how.

104
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:53,042
At this point, we must
view this unsettling news

105
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:55,008
as a worst-case scenario.

106
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:58,108
Until yesterday, we were
classifying similar cases

107
00:06:58,142 --> 00:07:00,742
in the Rukon District
as unusual occurrences.

108
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:03,575
But now this has escalated
into a personal affront

109
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:08,175
to the 13 Court Guard
Squads and must be resolved!

I will now select
five of you and you

113
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:18,575
will be dispatched

-(LABORED BREATHING)

117
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,608
Please, sir, let me go there.

118
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:38,508
-No.

119
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,942
-I have to go!

120
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:41,842
My second in command is
already heading there.

121
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,316
I should--

122
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:42,816
-Kisuke!

123
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,383
Just control yourself.

124
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,849
You're making a scene.

125
00:07:48,883 --> 00:07:51,749
You were the one who made the
choice to send her out there.

126
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:53,416
Can't you see that
you begging to go

127
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:55,449
save her is an insult
to her abilities?

128
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,216
-Come on, don't
just stand there.

129

Let's get this done.

00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:03,516
That's it.

132
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:09,949
-Now for my choices.

Captain of Squad Three,
Rojuro Otoribashi.

Five, Shinji Hirako.

Captain of Squad
Seven, Love Aikawa.

136
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:24,216
The three named will head to
the site in the Rukon District

137
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:25,683
as soon as possible.

138

Captain of Squad Two,
Yoruichi Shihoin,

139
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:30,916
will stay here and stand
by for further orders.

140

As for the captain of Squad
Six, Ginrei Kuchiki, the captain

of Squad Eight, Shunsui Kyoraku,
and the captain of Squad 13,

you will guard the Seireitei.

As for the captain of
Squad Four, Retsu Unohana,

144
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:51,483
you will stand by at the ready
in the Medical Treatment Room

145
00:08:51,516 --> 00:08:53,983
to await possible casualties.

-Permission to
speak, Head Captain.

If your main concern is
treatment of the wounded,

148
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:01,016
shouldn't I be dispatched
with the others

to the Rukon District?

150

-As long as the situation
remains unclear,

151
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:10,749
I would not put you, the head of
medical treatment at such risk.

152
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:15,483
I have someone else in mind
to send into the site instead.

153

Enter.

heard what I said.

00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:49,583
I expect the two of you to
head to the scene immediately.

-Will do.

00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:03,883
-Hey, Old Man Yama.

165
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,883
Sorry to interrupt,
but you know,

166
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,083
sending both the Kido
commander and his lieutenant

167
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:11,583
out to the front without
knowing the situation doesn't

168
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:13,183
sound too smart.

169
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:15,583
Wouldn't you tend to agree?

170
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:19,383
-Well then, what
would you have me do?

171
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,583
-My lieutenant could go
instead of one of those guys.

172
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:24,483
-You mean to summon her?

173
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:26,083
-That's right.

174
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:28,783
Hey, Lisa!

175
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:31,883
-What do you want?

176
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,216
-Surprise.

177
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:35,716
Didn't I tell you
that you shouldn't

178
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:37,849
eavesdrop on a
captain's meeting.

179
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:39,116
-I couldn't help myself.

180
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:40,883
It's human nature to
want to hear something

181
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,249
you're told you're
not supposed to hear.

182
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:44,749
-The details?

183
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:47,716
-Yeah, I heard them.

184
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:48,983
-Will ya do it?

185
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,049
-Of course I will.

186
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,749
-Good, you handle it.

187
00:10:57,883 --> 00:11:00,583
-You want to send her
on a mission like this?

188
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,449
-Hey, how many
chances will she have

189
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:04,149
to be in the middle
of an incident that's

190
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:05,616
as big as this one?

191
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,016
I'm like a parent who wants
his child to learn something.

192
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:12,016
And you know, experience
is the best teacher.

193
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:13,016
She'll be fine.

194
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:14,783
My Lisa might not
look it, but she's

195
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:17,783
strong and pretty capable.

196
00:11:17,816 --> 00:11:21,516
So if you don't mind, I'm
asking you to let her do it.

197
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:22,449
Kido Commander?

198
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:25,216
-That sounds perfectly fine.

199
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,249
If that's truly
what you want to do,

200

then I will take you up on
your most generous offer

00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,138
-Enngh.

332
00:20:19,172 --> 00:20:20,572
[blast]

333
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:25,572
[footsteps]

334
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:36,872
-You know, that's quite
an unusual garment

335
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:37,905
that you've created.

336
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:39,272
[footsteps]

337
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:46,272
-Creating a coat that has the
capacity to completely shut out

338
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:51,338
spiritual pressure is far beyond
an ordinary accomplishment.

339
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:52,805
-Heh.

340
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:54,605
Well, that's a shame.

341
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:55,872
I guess you saw me anyway.

342
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:58,805
[piano music]

343
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:06,305
-You're going to try to
rescue her, aren't you?

344
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:06,972
Your lieutenant.

345
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:12,838
I saw how you were at
the captains' meeting.

346
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,405
From that moment
on, I had a hunch

347
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:17,672
you would be
leaving to help her.

348
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:21,205
-Well, you do know me.

349
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,272
-We share some history,
with all the time

350
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:25,905
we spent together at
Lady Yoruichi's mansion.

351
00:21:25,938 --> 00:21:27,838
How could you think
that I wouldn't

352
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:31,605
catch on to what
you had in mind?

353
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:33,672
-So then, will you let me go?

354
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:40,138
-I find that question
unreasonable.

355
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:42,138
[wind whistling]

356
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:46,405
-I will not let you go.

357
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:49,105
That is, you will
not be going alone.

358
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:51,905
-Huh?

359
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:54,972
-Like you, tonight my
mind kept gnawing at me,

360
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:58,205
feeling a fear beyond all words.

361
00:21:58,238 --> 00:21:59,472
Come along.

362
00:21:59,505 --> 00:22:02,405
Let us rush there together
under the cover of darkness.

363
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:07,905
We must go to where they are.

364
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:18,220
[music in japanese]

365
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:47,676
-Captain Urahara!

366
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:49,509
I have no way to conceal
my spiritual pressure

367
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:50,842
as we travel.

368
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:52,776
-Then perhaps we should share
this special coat of mine.

369
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:54,342
-What an ingenious idea.

370
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:56,176
Well, if you really don't mind.

371
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:57,376
There.

372
00:23:57,409 --> 00:23:58,909
Now let us head out.

373
00:23:58,942 --> 00:24:02,442
-And we'll join them!
