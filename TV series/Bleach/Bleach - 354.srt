[roaring]

00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:57,909
[grunting]

4
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:07,551
Not bad...

5
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,655
The power you just displayed...
It's a lot

6
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:13,858
closer to the power that
you once possessed.

7
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:14,692
[gasping]

8
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,428
Uh!

9
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:21,832
Invaders must die.

10
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,369
What the hell's this?!

11
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,412
I get it.

12
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,914
You don't want me coming
in contact with Ichigo

13
00:02:36,914 --> 00:02:39,550
Kurosaki when his powers
are still incomplete.

14
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,988
Especially since he is so very
close to perfecting them...

15
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,025
That right... Yukio?

16
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:57,902
Hey!...What just
happened?!

17
00:03:00,538 --> 00:03:03,407
Where the hell am I?! Let
me out! Now!!

18
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,790
[gasping]

19
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:28,265
No-Not this time!

20
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:32,436
[grunting]

21
00:03:36,273 --> 00:03:37,942
[grunting]

22
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,924
Mm.

23
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:03,401
Looks like I'm
too late.

24
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:07,671
With Ichigo's powers so close
to being fully formed,

25
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:11,509
you saved him from coming
in contact with me.

26
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,344
But you made a mistake...

27
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:16,680
Why wouldn't you have confined
me in your console instead?

28
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:21,519
I thought of that, but I didn't have
enough battery life to hold you as well.

29
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:25,556
And besides, the truth is, that
wasn't why I saved Kurosaki anyway.

30
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,559
Hey. You hear that down
there?

31
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:29,593
Huh?

32
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,334
Looks like we've attracted a crowd,
the police, fire department...

33
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:40,337
Those explosions we made
do attract attention.

34
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:43,941
TV news choppers might
even be here soon.

35
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:46,777
This is turning into big
pain for us, but isn't

36
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,413
all of this posing a
problem for you, too?

37
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:56,821
The Love Gun?

38
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:01,258
That's right! And you know
exactly what it can do!

39
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:03,594
'Cause you're the one
who made it!

40
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,297
Hurry up and get lost,
will you?

41
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,668
As you know, I'm not so
calm in these situations.

42
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:16,874
It's time to get going, Mr.
Tsukishima.

43
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:19,777
But if you're thinking
you want to make a scene

44
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,013
instead, then I'd suggest you
stay here and go for it.

45
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:27,852
Hm.

46
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:38,329
Uh--

47
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:40,331
All right, you win.

48
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,534
I'll see you again,
Riruka.

49
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:48,639
Hmm.

50
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:57,915
We should get going as well.
We'll take Ichigo and Jackie.

51
00:05:57,948 --> 00:05:58,849
[groaning in pain]

52
00:05:58,883 --> 00:05:59,817
Huh?!

53
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,318
[groaning]

54
00:06:01,352 --> 00:06:04,288
Chad! What's wrong?!
What is it?!

55
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:19,270
[knocking]

56
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:20,004
Come in.

57
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,744
Hi Uryu.

58
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:30,581
Thank you for coming on short notice.
I appreciate you making the time.

59
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:34,552
Oh, don't mention
it. How are you feeling?

60
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:35,819
A lot better,
thanks.

61
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:39,523
That's good. So
then, what's up?

62
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:41,392
Well...

63
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:45,629
I need your help with my wounds I
want you to heal them right now.

64
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:46,997
Oh?

65
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,568
Sure, that's not a
problem, but why now?

66
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:56,674
Things have changed. Ichigo has made
contact with the guy who did this to me.

67
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,741
[gasping]

68
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:02,279
His Spiritual Pressure's a lot different
than it was before, but it was

69
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:06,350
definitely Ichigo's. I'm not sure
what suddenly caused it to change,

70
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:10,654
but I do know that I can't spend
anymore time sitting here.

71
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:13,591
You felt it too, right
Orihime?

72
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:16,026
Um, yes, I have.

73
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,964
But Ichigo hasn't exactly
said anything to me about

74
00:07:19,964 --> 00:07:23,634
it, so I've just been
trying to give him space.

75
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:27,805
But I--

76
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:30,741
I've got this feeling that
the person who attacked

77
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:33,711
you, was the same presence
I sensed around Ichigo.

78
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:42,419
And I think... that's the same
person who attacked me as well.

79
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:45,289
What did you say?!

80
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,407
There. He's done
loading.

81
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:06,377
Where am I?

82
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,414
Our other hideout. But compared
to where we were-it's a rathole.

83
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:14,585
Hey, now. Make statements like that
and I'll stop buying you nice things.

84
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:18,789
You don't even help out, but you
sure do complain a lot. Don't ya?

85
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:21,058
You know it's gonna be
my money that'll end

86
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:23,560
up paying to repair our
last hideout, right?

87
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:24,828
Sorry.

88
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:27,665
You had a lot to do with
those two explosions.

89
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:31,702
So now should I rebuild it all from
scratch? Or go ahead and fix it up

90
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:34,938
the way it was, I sure wish
someone would chip in.

91
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,374
Maybe you should take
that up with Chad.

92
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:40,544
When he wakes up, I will.

93
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:46,684
Hey Chad!

94
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:52,289
Hold it!! Isn't anybody gonna
thank me for looking after them?!

95
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,058
Uh!

96
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:57,528
Actually, Chad and Jackie's
injuries were nothing.

97
00:08:57,528 --> 00:09:00,431
You don't have to get
all theatrical on us.

98
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:04,468
Know what? I bet if we just wait
a sec they'll wake right up.

99
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:07,671
[lightly grunting]

100
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:09,406
Chad!

101
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,682
How you feelin', Chad?
You all right?

102
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:19,950
Uh--

103
00:09:24,288 --> 00:09:25,322
Chad?

104
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:29,326
Wha--uh, yeah.
I'm okay.

105
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,795
It's nothing serious.

106
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,599
That's good.

107
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:38,469
So what about that guy,
Tsukishima?

108
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:42,840
Looks like he's retreated...
for now, anyway.

109
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:46,543
Is something bothering
you?

110
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:48,545
Kind of.

111
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,748
If he had really wanted
to put it to us in that

112
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:53,350
situation, all he'd of had
to do was keep fighting.

113
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,821
Especially with the kind
of power he possesses.

114
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:01,658
Riruka was well inside of
Tsushima's attack radius, and

115
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:05,429
he could've cut down Yukio
easily, if he had meant to.

116
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:08,031
Was the reason he didn't
attack them because he

117
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:10,834
was actually only interested
in you as a target?

118
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:16,874
Or... Did he have some other
reason for acting the way he did?

119
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,942
You're overthinking
this.

120
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:22,679
Tsushima already knows full
well the nature of my powers.

121
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,948
He's quite aware that
he couldn't attack me

122
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:27,518
while I was holding that
terminal in my hand.

123
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:31,555
Or he wouldn't have another
chance of fighting Ichigo again.

124
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:36,260
That makes sense... Hm?

125
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:41,665
Kutsuzawa, how'd it go?

126
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:44,268
Everything has been
smoothed over.

127
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,371
The police, fire department,
reporters and neighbors have been

128
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:50,808
reassured and calmed down and
they've all gone back home.

129
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:52,342
Excellent work.

130
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,447
All right, then. I'll
start working on an

131
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,949
estimate. Man, what a
headache this is gonna be.

132
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,617
Wait a sec Yukio.

133
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:01,685
Huh?

134
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:05,689
You stay here and help
Ichigo work on his training.

135
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:08,058
What?! Why would I do
that?!

136
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:10,928
There's nothing I can
do to help him!

137
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:13,530
Besides-this thing's
almost dead!

138
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,001
I asked you because I know you can assist
him. Just use it with the cord plugged in.

139
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:22,506
After what I just went through-I
don't wanna help out!

140
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:24,541
Stop whining and
listen to me!

141
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,845
I don't know exactly how Tsukishima
found our hideout, but it's

142
00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:31,014
reasonable to assume that he
traced our Spiritual Pressure.

143
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:33,484
And if that's what made
it easy for him...

144
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:37,688
Your Fullbring, which we know has the power
to completely block Spiritual Pressure

145
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:40,824
is essential to Ichigo's
training and survival.

146
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:44,695
Do you understand?

147
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:46,964
Fine. I'll do it.

148
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,967
We are talking about
fighting, right?

149
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,937
Yeah, we are. After all, that's what
seems to work the best for you.

150
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:57,407
All right. But I already
defeated Jackie.

151
00:11:57,441 --> 00:12:00,410
So who will I up against
this time around?

152
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,047
Hm. That
would be me.

153
00:12:16,384 --> 00:12:17,318
Mm.

154
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,922
That's strange.

155
00:12:22,824 --> 00:12:25,126
You and I were attacked by
the same person but based

156
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:27,195
on the extent of your
injuries versus mine...

157
00:12:27,228 --> 00:12:30,898
I'd say, that suggests an enemy
with different capabilities...

158
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:35,069
Maybe. Oh, did you
notice a sweet smell?

159
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:36,471
A sweet smell?

160
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:41,509
Let me try to remember... was it honey?
Could that have been it?

161
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:43,177
Oh! And another thing!

162
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:48,182
His weapon looked a lot like a Zanpakuto,
but he said it was called a Fullbring.

163
00:12:48,216 --> 00:12:52,353
Did the person who attacked you
mention something like that as well?

164
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:57,291
Sorry. Unfortunately, I didn't have
the time to ask him any questions.

165
00:12:57,325 --> 00:13:01,095
But until I just heard you mention
it, I had been assuming that the

166
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:03,464
sword he used was some
type of Zanpakuto.

167
00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:04,999
Uh--

168
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:10,905
Hnh?

169
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:12,407
Hi, Chad!

170
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:14,275
Orihime.

171
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:16,044
Hey, were you at the
hospital?

172
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:18,813
Yeah, I was just there
healing Uryu's wounds.

173
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:21,749
I see. How'd it go?

174
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:26,721
He seems to be doing much better, but I'd
say he still needs more time to rest.

175
00:13:26,754 --> 00:13:30,191
It's weird. They don't seem
to be the kind of injuries

176
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:33,261
sustained by an ordinary
Spirit Energy attack.

177
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:38,499
Interesting. Glad we met up. I've been
wanting to ask you how Uryu was doing.

178
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,301
You can tell me more as
we walk.

179
00:13:40,334 --> 00:13:44,305
Huh?!! Whoa-Wait-Hold on
Chad! Where are we going?

180
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:46,307
To go help Ichigo.

181
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,878
From here on, Ichigo's training
will require your powers!

182
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,146
Oh!

183
00:13:57,718 --> 00:13:59,887
Okay, let's get
started...

184
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:24,245
So, uh, this is the exact same place
as I was being held in earlier.

185
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:25,980
That's right.

186
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:31,452
This is Yukio's Fullbring.
It's called Invaders Must Die.

187
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:36,424
He can capture a target
in another dimension

188
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:40,962
and then control it
on his game screen.

189
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:44,966
But no worries, I've already
told him not to interfere.

190
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:50,738
So have you ever fantasized
about being inside a game?

191
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:52,340
What? No.

192
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:58,412
Come on, admit it. Every kid's thought of
it, it's nothing to be embarrassed about...

193
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:03,117
I've never obsessed about it
but I have had the thought.

194
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:07,822
Really? Well I've never had
that thought, not even once.

195
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:09,957
Then why'd you make me
say it?

196
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:11,859
Well, whether you had
that thought or not

197
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,961
doesn't really make much
of a difference, here.

198
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:16,197
So then why didja make me
say it?!

199
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,801
You know, this could be quite a bit
different than what you imagined it to be.

200
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:23,504
I'm guessing you're kind
of surprised that this

201
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:26,174
is what being inside
of a game feels like.

202
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,945
Well yeah. It's definitely a lot emptier
than I expected it to be in here.

203
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:33,447
Emptier? Fine, then.

204
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:37,852
Huh?!

205
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:40,755
You want livelier,
huh? So, how's that?

206
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:43,090
It's like a game from
the early 90's.

207
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:46,861
Yukio, there's no need
to dress things up here.

208
00:15:46,894 --> 00:15:47,795
Hmph.

209
00:15:49,363 --> 00:15:50,164
Uh--

210
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:55,169
So now that you've entered this
game space for your training,

211
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:58,839
we'll be using rules
that work for a game.

212
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:00,474
And so, what does
that mean?

213
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:05,279
Don't worry, we won't make it too
complicated. It's all pretty simple.

214
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:08,849
Yukio! Can you give us a
life gauge?

215
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:12,386
Um-hm! Do you want it matched
to your current health?

216
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:15,256
No, make it an even six
for each of us.

217
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:16,290
Okay.

218
00:16:20,394 --> 00:16:22,763
Nice. There we go.

219
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:30,037
So it's game over when those
6 life signs are gone, huh?

220
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:32,173
Exactly.

221
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:35,743
So do you need an
explanation of game over?

222
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:39,747
Are you kidding me?
I think I've got it.

223
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,516
When it's game over for
you, I'll have a "You

224
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:45,253
Die" icon appear for
you to let you know.

225
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:47,088
That's very clever.

226
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:51,392
Ready?

227
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:53,394
Sure.

228
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,232
Cross of Scaffold!

229
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:18,452
Three... two... one.

230
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:24,258
[screaming]

231
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,203
Hm?

232
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:41,275
What is this?

233
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:42,143
Hm?

234
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:45,146
Chad! Who's that girl?!

235
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:46,747
This is Orihime.

236
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:50,251
Oh, her! You're
the one.

237
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:51,352
Uh!

238
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:56,724
Oh! Well, hi there!

239
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:57,491
Mm.

240
00:17:58,492 --> 00:18:00,394
Orihime,
this is Riruka.

241
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:02,997
Pleased to meet you.

242
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:07,735
Chad told me about you. He says that
you can heal people's wounds quickly.

243
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:11,272
So why'd you come here? To help
Ichigo after he takes a beating?!

244
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:12,173
[grunting]

245
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:14,208
[roaring]

246
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:16,077
Come on, Riruka...

247
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:18,813
That's right.

248
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:22,717
You realize what you'll be doing-right?
If you go healing his injuries,

249
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,252
that just means he's going
to get injured even more.

250
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:31,058
He'll keep fighting, keep getting
hurt, and suffer over and over again.

251
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:34,795
I know.

252
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:38,899
So you're worried for
Ichigo, too, aren't you?

253
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:39,900
[gasping]

254
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:43,003
Huh?! Uh-- no,
I'm not!

255
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:44,972
Hey!

256
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:47,942
He can't help it, you
know?

257
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:49,410
Uh--

258
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,148
But, I had to face up to his stubborn-ness
and get past it a long time ago.

259
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:55,883
Uh!

260
00:18:55,916 --> 00:19:00,421
If Ichigo ever needs my help to
do what he's decided to do...

261
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:05,493
Regardless of what it is, I would
use all of my power to help him.

262
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:09,130
Oh?

263
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:11,499
And what would happen if
Ichigo were to suffer a really

264
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:13,901
terrible injury that he
could never recover from?

265
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:18,873
Nothing. Because I won't
ever let that happen.

266
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:25,379
It doesn't matter how
bad the injury is...

267
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:28,082
I will heal all his
wounds completely!

268
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:29,450
[groaning]

269
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:32,386
[gasping]

270
00:19:32,753 --> 00:19:34,955
[grunting]

271
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:38,259
He swings that huge sword as
though it weighs nothing!

272
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,796
[grunting]

273
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:43,931
[gasping]

274
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:47,368
Hnh!-I see you!

275
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:49,737
[grunting]

276
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:55,009
You certainly have improved quite
a bit at managing your Fullbring.

277
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,012
And yet...

278
00:19:58,012 --> 00:19:58,946
[gasping]

279
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:06,120
You still have a
long way to go!

280
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,399
Um!

281
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:21,802
I say! Hello there.

282
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:28,042
Kugo. We have a visitor.
I'm letting her in.

283
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:38,118
Huh?!

284
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:40,855
Ah! So the healer is
finally here!

285
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:44,758
Oh! Hi there-How do you do, sir?
It's such a pleasure!

286
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:50,831
Skip the greetings. You're just in time to
do a job. Now, hurry up and go heal him.

287
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:51,799
[gasping]

288
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,001
Ichigo!

289
00:20:54,134 --> 00:21:01,509
[struggling]

290
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:02,943
Come on.

291
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:05,412
How stupid.

292
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:14,355
So the next'll be the
last of it-right?

293
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:17,725
Now, Isshin... you're
sure about this?

294
00:21:17,758 --> 00:21:21,028
Well, sure I'm sure! How many
times are you gonna ask me?!

295
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:24,231
A father can rob his son
of his future. It's

296
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:27,401
only right that I verify
numerous times that

297
00:21:27,434 --> 00:21:31,438
you're really
certain.

298
00:21:31,472 --> 00:21:36,844
I know that. So I'm telling you to stop
asking me before I change my mind.

299
00:21:36,877 --> 00:21:41,482
Hm. Well, I suppose
you're right.

300
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:45,252
Let's move on to our final step, then.
Shall we?

301
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:54,995
Okay, just place your Spirit
Energy in here and it's all done.

302
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:58,265
Whenever
you're ready.

303
00:21:58,265 --> 00:21:59,900
Right.

304
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:43,078
Our next episode will be
a New Years special.

305
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:45,547
Wow, looks like a cavalcade
of Soul Reapers.

306
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:46,715
Who knows?

307
00:23:46,748 --> 00:23:48,183
I can pretty much tell
from what we're seeing.

308
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:51,620
You don't really believe what's being
shown is going to be in the show, do you?

309
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:53,188
What?! It's not?!

310
00:23:53,222 --> 00:23:54,656
That, is a secret.

311
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,557
Wait!-It is?!?
