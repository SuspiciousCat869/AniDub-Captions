00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:40,624
-Damn.

4
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:42,124
The pain's getting worse.

5
00:01:42,158 --> 00:01:47,458
And I can hardly lift
my arms and legs.

6
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,958
The reiatsu is fading away.

7
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:58,624
I guess my time as a Quincy
has about reached it's end.

8
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:04,558
Wouldn't it be funny,
if after all this,

9
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,924
I somehow got to
the Senzaikyu first.

10
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,991
What if I was the one
who rescued Rukia?

11
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:13,924
Oh, I bet that would
really piss off Ichigo.

12
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,124
Everyone knows he wants
to be the big hero,

13
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:17,591
and rescue her all by himself.

14
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:45,891
-I'm sorry.

15
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:49,091
But for the sake of peace,
I must terminate you.

16
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:53,224
Cry, Suzumushi.

17
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:05,124
[gasp]

18
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:07,391
-Forgive me, Ryoka.

19
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:11,891
But these senseless battles
have to come to an end.

20
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:18,124
Rest now, for your
struggle will soon be over.

21
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,724
-Advancing from Shikai
to Bankai typically

22
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:23,691
requires well over 10
years of training, even

23
00:03:23,724 --> 00:03:25,758
for those with
exceptional talent.

24
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,591
However, you must
achieve the Bankai

25
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:30,358
in a time span of
only three days.

26
00:03:36,058 --> 00:03:39,424
-What's with the
weird looking cut out?

27
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,158
-It's tenchintei, an
important spiritual tool,

28
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:45,458
used by the Stealth Force.

29
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,791
It's specifically designed
to draw out the Zanpakuto,

30
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:51,058
and manifest its true form.

31
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:51,891
-Huh?

32
00:03:51,924 --> 00:03:53,258
I don't get what you're saying.

33
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:56,329
How is that supposed to help
me complete my Bankai training?

34
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:59,229
-The Shikai must establish
a dialogue and a harmony

35
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:01,329
with the Zanpakuto.

36
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:04,262
The manifestation and
submission of the Zanpakuto

37
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:06,129
is necessary for Bankai.

38
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,829
In other words, instead
of us physically

39
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:11,996
entering the world
of the Zanpakuto,

40
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:15,229
manifestation refers to
summoning the Zanpakuto

41
00:04:15,262 --> 00:04:17,062
into our world.

42
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:21,196
Normally, it requires several
years of training to do this.

43
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:24,196
But you, even though
it ended in a draw,

44
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,329
you founght on equal footing
with Kenpachi Zaraki.

45
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:31,662
So as unlikely as
it might seem, it

46
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:34,229
appears that you've actually
reached manifestation,

47
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:37,629
or a comparable level, already.

48
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:38,562
-Do you want to fight?

49
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:47,229
-It's coming back
to you, isn't it?

50
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,362
If you stab this
with Zangetsu, it

51
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:53,162
can forcibly bring it
into the manifested state.

52
00:04:53,196 --> 00:04:57,262
In other words, we can bring
the Zanpakuto into this world.

53
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:00,896
However, with this
method, the manifestation

54
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:03,096
is a limited to three days.

55
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:06,629
During that time, you must
defeat the manifested Zangetsu

56
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:08,862
and force him into submission.

57
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:10,429
If you're unable to do that--

58
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:15,496
-You don't have to
go into the details.

59
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:22,162
If you're saying there's no
other way it can be done,

60
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,762
then I've got to do it.

61

[thunder]

62
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:37,729
-It seems to be recovered
quite nicely, Ichigo.

63
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:39,996
-So it's you.

64
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:43,062
-I take it you heard
our conversation.

65
00:05:43,096 --> 00:05:44,429
-Of course.

66
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:47,229
-Then I'll leave the method
of fighting up to you.

67
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:49,362
I assume that you
can start right away.

68
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:49,962
-Of course.

69
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,296
-What, what the
heck did he just do?

70
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,162
-Somewhere amongst
these swords, there

71
00:06:08,196 --> 00:06:10,996
is one that is the true me.

72
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:13,562
That is the only
that can defeat me.

73
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:16,096
The others are useless.

74
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:19,129
If you wish to force
me into submission,

75
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,062
you'll have to find
a way to locate it

76
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:22,962
before I can kill you.

77
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:26,262
And then, try to defeat me.

78
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:27,662
If you can.

79

We're walking wounded here.

84
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,529
Now let me give you a hand.

85
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:55,996
-Greetings, everyone.

86
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,196
And welcome.

87
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:01,196
It's I, Squad 4, third>
Seat, Yasochika Iemura.

88
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:02,862
I'm so glad you could make it.

89
00:07:02,896 --> 00:07:03,496
What?

90
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,029
You don't know me?

91
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:06,696
You may have seen
me here or there.

92
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:07,629
I get around.

93
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:13,729
Since it appears some of you
are not familiar with me,

94
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:15,329
perhaps a fitting
introduction would

95
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:18,396
be to acquaint you with me
medical journal, in which I

96
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:21,396
have chronicled our Squad
Force strenuous activities.

97
00:07:24,796 --> 00:07:26,829
Lately, due to the recent
reopen disturbance,

98
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:30,329
our Squad Four stations
is in daily chaos.

99
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:32,862
Especially considering
the recent plethora of men

100
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:35,329
from Squad 11, who
have been hospitalized.

101
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:38,796
Seriously, they have
kept us very busy.

102
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:41,429
As if it that wasn't bad
enough, yesterday evening

103
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:44,129
the Captains from Squad
8 and 13 requested

104
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:45,729
to have a Ryoka admitted.

105
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:47,829
As a result, the
entire squad has

106
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:50,096
been forced to implement
the triple shift emergency

107
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:51,929
protocol.

108
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:53,462
Things have gotten out of hand.

109
00:07:53,496 --> 00:07:54,929
The squad's already
stretched thin,

110
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:57,696
and on top of that, being
asked to admit a Ryoka?

111
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:59,396
It's just incomprehensible.

112
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:01,262
Really, enough is enough.

113
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:04,562
Why anyone would want some Ryoka
to be hospitalized and treated

114
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:09,262
in the first place, it's
completely beyond me.

115
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:12,529
It's not as if dealing with
Squad 13's Captain Ukitake

116
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:16,029
wasn't enough of a challenge, we
got Captain Kyoraku of Squad 8

117
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,129
running around, chasing
women all over the place.

118
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:20,129
Not to mention the
trashy way he dresses,

119
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:22,362
and how he's always asleep
when you need something.

120
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:25,929
I'll never get how someone like
that became a captain while I--

121
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:28,396
-Uh, sir?

122
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:30,196
-What is it, nurse?

123
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:33,762
-We just received a request
from Captain Tosen of Squad 9.

124
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:37,796
He would like us to admit
a Ryoka for treatment.

125
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:40,529
-I see.

126
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,729
-And, uh-

127
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:42,862
-Hm?

128
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:46,996
-Sorry, but you were
thinking out loud again.

129
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:47,496
-Ah!

130
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:54,429
Well, of course it
goes without saying

131
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:56,896
that I have nothing but the
utmost respect for Captain

132
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:58,162
Kyoraku.

133
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:01,862
-In light, of all this evidence,
that they had no choice

134
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:04,462
and was held against
his will by the Ryoka,

135
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:06,396
that he was so
physically and mentally

136
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:09,329
brutalized by those
Ryoka, so brainwashed

137
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:12,529
that he had no choice but
to obey, it's a tragedy.

138
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:16,396
And as such, I wish that you,
Captain Unohana of Squad 4,

139
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,262
will judge this with
kindness and compassion.

140
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:21,062
This concludes the arrest
and investigation report

141
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:25,529
of this matter, delivered by
Captain Ukitake of Squad 13.

142
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:27,629
-I understand.

143
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:30,062
However, nothing in the
report changes the fact

144
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:32,562
that you aided the Ryoka, and
that the damage they caused

145
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:35,029
was substantial.

146
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:37,596
One must always be
accountable for one's actions,

147
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:39,996
and from the standpoint of
your tank and responsibilities,

148
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:44,329
I cannot condone your actions.

149
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:46,562
Do you understand?

150
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:50,029
14th Advanced Relief
Group Leader and Squad 4,

151
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:51,429
Seventh Seat, Hanataro Yamada.

152
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:06,396
-Hm?

153
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:15,696
-Hanataro, what is it?

154
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:17,762
-I'm beginning to wonder
if everything that I did

155
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:18,696
was a mistake.

156
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:20,496
If after all this,
I just ended up

157
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,396
creating more trouble
for Rukia instead.

158
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:24,562
-I don't know.

159
00:10:24,596 --> 00:10:25,729
No one does.

160
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,396
But I believe you
listened to your heart,

161
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:29,896
and acted on what your
true feelings told you.

162
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,862
I wish I could be that strong.

163
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:32,862
-Lieutenant.

164
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:34,862
-We'll have to trust
Captain Unohana.

165
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:37,829
It's in her hands, now.

166
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:38,829
-Mhm.

167

[music playing]

168
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:25,529
-Time to go, Zabimaru.

[crying]

170
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:53,381
-I drew my sword against Momo.

171
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:55,648
How could I?

172
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,281
I'm wretched and disgusting.

173
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:00,848
I hate myself.

174
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:01,848
[screaming]

175
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:11,715
Snap to me.

176
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:13,181
Deflect!

177
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:14,681
-Raise your head
and prepare to die.

178

[crying]

179
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,148
-Who, who's there?

180
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:33,381
-My, this is just awful.

181
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:35,448
I almost can't bear to look.

182
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:41,415
-Captain Ichimaru?

183
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:49,915
-You look so haggard,
you poor thing.

184
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,381
Would you like me to help you?

185
00:12:57,948 --> 00:12:59,415
Would you, Izuru?

186
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:18,181
-Stand up, Ichigo.

187
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:23,815
Three days.

188
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:26,181
You don't have time to
lie around feeling sorry

189
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:26,715
for yourself.

190
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:33,581
I'll tell you one more time,
up on your feet, Ichigo.

191
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,615
Stop stalling.

192
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:43,881
How much time do
you plan on wasting?

193
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:45,781
-Never mind.

194
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:48,381
If he hasn't the strength
to stand on his own,

195
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:53,281
then I'll just grab his scrawny
neck and drag him to his feet.

196
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:54,048
-Surprised?

197
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:58,115
I'll say I was surprised!

198
00:13:58,148 --> 00:14:00,015
I never would have
guessed in a million years

199
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,181
that Lieutenant Kusajishi
would pick me up like that.

200
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:05,181
You may not believe this,
but I, Makizo Aramaki,

201
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:07,081
couldn't be happier.

202
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:09,681
-I hate to break it to you, but
I didn't really care about you.

203
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:15,048
-Can't you see that I'm
trying to rescue you here?

204
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:15,815
Ouch!

205
00:14:15,848 --> 00:14:16,581
No, cut it out, will you?

206
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:21,981
Why you!

207
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:23,881
Take this, there!

208
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:24,915
Sorry about that.

209
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:30,881
Oh well, guess I'll owe you
an apology when you wake up.

210
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:31,381
Huh?

211
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:34,948
Oh.

212
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:40,715
-Hey Maki Maki.

213
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:43,348
What's that you
got under your arm?

214
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:44,415
That's spiritual pressure.

215
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,281
A Ryoka?

216
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:47,115
-No.

217
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:48,881
Well, you see, it's like this.

218
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:51,281
I was just, well--

219
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:52,548
-It's a Ryoka.

220
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:54,715
-I, I, you see, it was
kind of like, what you see,

221
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:56,815
what happened was, there
was this situation.

222
00:14:56,848 --> 00:14:57,315
-Situation?

223
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:58,948
Really?

224
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,948
Tell me about it.

225
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:02,781
-Well it was, it
was kind of like--

226
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:04,348
-Hm.

227
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:07,515
-Well, you see, I was just kind
of minding my own business.

228
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,815
When all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, this girl

229
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:10,548
just squirted out!

230
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:11,881
-She squirted out?

231
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:12,915
-Yeah.

232
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:14,315
She did this weird
bubbly-bubbly thing.

233
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,481
-Bubbly bubbly thing?

234
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,515
-That's right, bubbly.

235
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,348
So I said to myself,
I said, I'd better

236
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:20,615
snatch her up and bring
her to you, right away.

237
00:15:20,648 --> 00:15:21,848
-Really?

238
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,781
We should take her back
with us, to show the others.

239
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:24,581
-Huh?

240
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:25,915
Oh, yeah.

241
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:28,081
-I can't wait to see her
do the bubbly-bubbly thing.

242
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:29,081
I'm so excited!

243
00:15:29,115 --> 00:15:30,448
-Yeah, about that.

244
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:33,548
-I wonder if Ichi does
the bubbly-bubbly thing.

245
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:35,148
What do you think, Ara, Ara, hm.

246
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:35,781
I forget.

247
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:40,481
Would you mind telling me
what your name is again?

248
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:41,915
-Oh, I don't expect
you to you remember.

249
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:44,048
After all, it's only been 10
years since you took me on.

250
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:44,748
Just call me Maki Maki.

251
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:45,615
Maki Maki's fine.

252
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:48,015
Plain old Maki Maki.

253
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,681
-Maki Maki.

254
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,181
That name's really weird.

255
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:53,448
-What do you mean, it's weird?

256
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:56,581
You're the one who came
up with the nickname!

257
00:15:56,615 --> 00:16:00,348
-So Orihime, why don't you
tell us what's going on.

258
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,915
-She is so gorgeous.

259
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:05,681
-You think Ichigo's
still alive, or what?

260
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,315
-I hope he's still alive.

261
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:08,981
He must be.

262
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,348
I'm sure that he is.

263
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:10,848
-Orihime.

264
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:18,748
-He's alive, all right.

265
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:20,948
In fact, I'm certain of it.

266
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:24,048
He's alive, and he's getting
stronger, even as we speak.

267
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:27,915
As a matter of fact, I'm
going to help you out.

268
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:30,915
I get the feeling that
if I stick with you,

269
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,481
I'll see Ichigo again soon.

270
00:16:33,515 --> 00:16:35,948
-Aye, aye, sir!

[music playing]

272
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,948
-Where am I?

273
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:59,281
Am I still alive?

274
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:01,215
How did--

275
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:04,115
[laughter]

276
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,548
-So you're awake.

00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:12,249

Who are you?

00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:13,915
Where'd you come from?

281
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,082
Are you a burglar?

282
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:16,482
-Yeah, right.

283
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:20,115
Why would anyone try to steal
from an injured man in prison?

284
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:22,982
It's me, you idiot.

285
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:24,449
-Ganju, is that really?

286
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:26,515
I don't believe it,
you're still alive!

287
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,015
You didn't look so strong,
so I thought maybe you had--

288
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,382
-I hear what you're saying.

289
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:34,149
I was thinking the exact
same thing about you.

290
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:36,215
-I don't get it.

291
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:38,215
Why would they want to
keep us alive, much less

292
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:41,115
take time to treat our injuries?

293
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:43,615
I mean, we're intruders here.

294
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,515
Not to mention their enemies.

295
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:47,249
I must be missing
something, because I

296
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,882
can't think of a
single reason why

297
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:50,415
the Soul Society would want to--

298
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:53,249
-The situation has changed.

299
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:54,615
-Sado!

300
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:57,482
-I overheard a couple of the
guards talking outside the cell

301
00:17:57,515 --> 00:17:58,849
today.

302
00:17:58,882 --> 00:18:01,382
Apparently a Captain
was assassinated

303
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,115
within the Seireitei.

304
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,715
They don't know who did it.

305
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:05,915
-Really?

306
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:07,615
-Since we're intruders
here, that would obviously

307
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,715
make us prime
suspects in the case.

308
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:12,715
-They're keeping us alive so
they can question us later.

309
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:14,682
-That sounds about right.

310
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:18,582
If only these things didn't
seal off my spiritual pressure.

311
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,749
I could use my seppa
and we could bust out

312
00:18:20,782 --> 00:18:24,515
of this place with
no problem at all.

313
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:25,882
-I see.

314
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:28,782
These seal in the
spiritual pressure.

315
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:32,082
-Exposure to such a strong
flame will burn thee.

316
00:18:32,115 --> 00:18:33,449
And even though
removing the glove

317
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:37,349
will allow you to temporarily
gain enormous power, when that

318
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,115
fades away, you will lose
your Quincy powers completely.

319
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:48,749
-No.

320
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:51,249
Even without this, my spiritual
pressure has already--

321
00:18:51,282 --> 00:18:54,349
-It sucks.

322
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:56,482
Even though we survived,
we're stuck in this prison

323
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,115
with our spiritual
pressure sealed.

324
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:02,449
The situation couldn't
be much worse.

325
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:05,049
But there's still one
thing we can count on.

326
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:09,449
If they kept us alive, then
the others are probably alive.

327
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,349
So there's a chance they might
still be out there somewhere.

328
00:19:12,382 --> 00:19:13,382
-Huh?

329
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:14,749
-However, considering
the fact that they

330
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:19,749
were able to capture us, they've
probably got Orihime as well.

331
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:21,915
She's not much of a fighter.

332
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:23,849
So the only ones left
are Yoruichi and Ichigo.

333
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:28,782
I'm content to wait here.

334
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:32,482
Ichigo will come for
us, I'm certain of it.

335
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:35,382
The best thing for
us to do until then

336
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:39,382
is to heal our wounds, and
prepare for the next battle.

337
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:40,615
I say we wait for Ichigo.

338
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,015
[grunting]

339
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,015
-Sword number 18.

340
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:56,782
[panting]

341
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:05,549
-That's it!

342
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:08,482
After all I've been through.

343
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:11,082
This time, I know this has
got to be the real one.

344
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,015
-Too weak.

345
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:23,282
[gasping]

346
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:26,849
-As I told you before, you
must look beyond the metal.

347
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:29,982
Each of these swords represents
a piece of your heart.

348
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:33,282
The purpose of this trial is to
find the one piece among them

349
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,749
that was forged for the
solitary purpose of combat.

350
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:39,415
That one there was
your heart's frailty.

351
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:43,182
You exposed it by
trying to depend on me.

352
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:45,082
-I depended on him?

353
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:48,349
The frailty of my heart?

354
00:20:48,382 --> 00:20:50,749
-If you're incapable
of recognizing that,

355
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,882
then you can forget
about the Bankai forever.

356
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:02,749
-So all of these are
really my weaknesses.

357
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:03,249
Dammit.

358
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,415
-Come now, move on
to the next one.

359
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:12,082
You haven't the time
to be crawling around.

360
00:21:12,115 --> 00:21:14,949
-You're right.

361
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,582
You're absolutely right.

362
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:19,049
[music playing]

363
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:40,147
[theme song]

364
00:22:43,218 --> 00:22:44,918
-The Squad 6 jail
has lousy food.

365
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:47,751
-The Squad 3 jail
doesn't get any sunlight.

366
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:49,585
-The Squad 5 jail
has cockroaches.

367
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,351
-We prisoners deserve better.

368
00:22:51,385 --> 00:22:53,318
-You nimrods don't
seem to have a clue why

369
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:55,451
you were put in jail
in the first place.

370
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:56,751
-Why don't you try it, Toshiro?

371
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:58,018
-I will not!
