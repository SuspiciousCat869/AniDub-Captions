167
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:00,634
Diabolical, aren't they?

168
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:03,034
They latch on, and when I
produce a certain frequency

169
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,567
with my tongue, they respond
by detonating themselves.

170
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:19,334
[hollow laughs]

171
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,534
-Oh, you want some
more, eh hot shot?

172
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:26,067
Well first, I have someone
here you might want to see.

173
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:28,234
-The cockatiel.

174
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,634
So that's where the Hollow
was before-- granting

175
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,601
the cockatiel as a hostage.

176
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,801
-I'm so sorry, mister.

177
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,867
I was trying to call for you.

178
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:38,234
-That's OK.

179
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,334
-Ha ha ha.

180
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,134
And with three leech
bombs on the bird cage,

181
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,234
you'll both do what I say.

182
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:44,901
Because if they
explode, there won't

183
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,501
be enough of your
little friend left

184
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,334
to spread out on a cracker.

185
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:50,434
Now let's play a new game.

186
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:54,001
Musclehead stays put while I
play tag with the Soul Reaper.

187
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:57,867
-Do as he says.

188
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,701
Don't think for a second
he won't blow up the bird.

189
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,301
At least the chase will
take him away from here

190
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:04,901
so you'll be safe.

191
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:07,701
-But what about you, new girl?

192
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:08,634
-Don't be concerned.

193
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:11,001
I can take care of myself.

194
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:13,267
I made a promise.

195
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:15,501
I'll be just fine.

196
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:16,367
-Good luck.

197
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:16,867
-Thanks.

198
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,467
-I'm going to enjoy
every second of this.

199
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,734
-This might sting a little.

200
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:49,401
[sonic hissing]

201
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:51,334
[rukia gasps]

202
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:56,701
[hollow laughs]

203
00:10:56,734 --> 00:10:58,634
-My, my.

204
00:10:58,667 --> 00:10:59,867
Don't you look pretty?

205
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:02,401
All covered in your own blood.

206
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:04,534
I think red becomes
you, soul reaper.

207
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:07,901
Let's see some more of it!

208
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,401
-Faster, faster, faster!

209
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:15,401
Run, little reaper, run.

210
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:18,334
How long before you get
tired and get blown up?

211
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,067
[cackling]

212
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:22,767
Of course, you could turn
around and actually fight me.

213
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:26,001
Done already?

214
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:30,867
How boring.

215
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:33,034
I didn't think you
would give up so easily.

216
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,867
Come on, run some more.

217
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,267
It's not every day I get
to chase soul reapers.

218
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:39,434
I was having fun.

219
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,501
-I haven't given up.

220
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,801
-Huh?

221
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:45,534
-There's just no need for
me to run from you anymore.

222
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:47,234
-What are you blabbering about?

223
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:50,101
-You challenged me to
fight you, didnt you?

224
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:53,167
Or was that just
an idiotic bluff?

225
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,567
Either way, you're
going to meet your doom.

226
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:14,295
-You challenged
me to attack you.

227
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:18,695
So then attack you I will.

228
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:19,495
-Hold on.

229
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:24,828
-Perfect timing, Ichigo.

230
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:27,262
-You act like you
planned it this way.

231
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,828
I thought you promised
me you weren't

232
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:30,462
going to screw
this thing all up.

233
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:32,728
-Well now, if I didn't
know any better,

234
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:36,028
I'd say you actually care
about what happens to me.

235
00:12:36,062 --> 00:12:36,795
-Heh.

236
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:38,595
I guess I do.

237
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:39,928
-How touching.

238
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:43,928
Do you plan to keep
standing on my head all day?

239
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:46,328
Who are you anyway?

240
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:50,928
-Ichigo Kurosaki, age 15,
substitute Soul Reaper.

241
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:54,462
And if you really want
to play some serious tag,

242
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:57,395
I think it's me
you ought to chase.

243
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,128
-Hmm.

244
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:02,062
Substitute Soul Reaper, eh?

245
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,428
Crap.

246
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:05,195
I screwed up.

247
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:07,128
When the two of you
split up back there,

248
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,362
I should have gone after you.

249
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:13,662
-Ichigo!

250
00:13:20,962 --> 00:13:22,228
-Where'd you go?

251
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:27,295
Heh heh heh.

252
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:28,428
You're too slow.

253
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:32,862
But I can tell your soul
is going to be tasty.

254
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,662
Say hello to my little friends.

255
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:37,628
-Now I got it.

256
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:39,995
You used these leech
bombs to tie up

257
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,195
Chad, then attacked
a defenseless girl.

258
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:44,962
What a coward.

259
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:46,395
Time to pay.

260
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:49,395
-The only price I'm going
to pay is indigestion,

261
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:53,295
after I finish eating
two more Soul Reapers.

262
00:13:53,328 --> 00:13:55,262
-Huh?

263
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:57,095
Ichigo?

264
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,795
Ichigo, what's wrong?

265
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:00,162
-There you are.

266
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:01,295
Don't worry about him.

267
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:03,128
Just get out here
with that cockatiel.

268
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:05,328
Take it somewhere safe.

269
00:14:05,362 --> 00:14:06,762
-What's going on?

270
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:08,928
What's with Ichigo?

271
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:10,328
-Don't worry about him.

272
00:14:10,362 --> 00:14:12,228
Ichigo is fine.

273
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:14,362
He's fighting to protect us all.

274
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:30,262
[hollow chuckles]

275
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,195
-Pretty good move
for a substitute.

276
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:33,862
But aren't you
forgetting something?

277
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:37,428
The leeches spilling from their
guts are still live ammunition.

278
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:45,495
[hollow cackles]

279
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:47,262
-Take that, you rookie reaper.

280
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:53,628
-Tell me.

281
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:57,895
Before I slice and dice
you, you killed the mother

282
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:00,528
of that boy inside the
cockatiel, didn't you?

283
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:03,862
You might as well admit
it, because either way,

284
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:05,995
you're going down.

285
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:07,895
-Is that true?

286
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:10,495
-I'm afraid it's all my fault.

287
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:15,162
I just wanted to bring
my mother back to life.

288
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:16,262
-Yuichi.

289
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:18,595
-I didn't mean for those
people to get hurt.

290
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:22,262
If I'd known about that, I
never would have done it.

291
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:27,895
All I wanted was just
to see my mother again.

292
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:28,928
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,495
-Wait.

294
00:15:30,528 --> 00:15:32,862
So you really
accepted such a lie,

295
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:35,262
that if you did what
he said, that he

296
00:15:35,295 --> 00:15:37,195
could bring your
mother back to life?

297
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,095
How could you believe that?

298
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:41,262
-Because he wanted
to believe it.

299
00:15:41,295 --> 00:15:42,062
-Bastard!

300
00:15:42,095 --> 00:15:43,362
-Yes.

301
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:46,362
I killed the brat's mother
back when I was still alive.

302
00:15:46,395 --> 00:15:48,095
You might have heard about me.

303
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:50,928
I was all over the TV,
the radio, everywhere.

304
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:53,528
I was a famous serial killer.

305
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:55,228
They never would have
caught me either.

306
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:56,595
I was too smart.

307
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:58,895
I'd still be out there hunting
today, but as it turned out,

308
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:01,495
the kid's mother
was my last score.

309
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,128
She was a sweet one.

310
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,462
I stabbed her eight times.

311
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:05,928
And she ran and ran, bleeding.

312
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:07,728
And when she
couldn't run anymore,

313
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:09,928
she still tried to
protect the kid.

314
00:16:09,962 --> 00:16:11,762
I really got off on it.

315
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:14,295
But that's when
everything went sour.

316
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:17,195
I chased her onto the
balcony and finished her off.

317
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:20,262
Then that stupid kid
grabbed my shoelaces.

318
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:22,628
I lost my balance and
went over the railing

319
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,295
twenty stories down.

320
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:25,862
Who'd have thought
I'd get knocked off

321
00:16:25,895 --> 00:16:28,095
by a snot-nosed kid?

322
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:29,262
Suddenly I was dead.

323
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:29,962
I was pissed.

324
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:31,695
And I wanted pay back.

325
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:34,895
The punk kid was still alive,
so I sucked out his soul

326
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,762
and stuck it in the
stupid cockatiel.

327
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,928
Then I made him a deal.

328
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:41,495
I told him if he could run
from me in that bird body

329
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:46,462
for three months, I'd bring his
precious mommy back to life.

330
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:47,962
-How could you do that?

331
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:49,862
-I couldn't do that, you moron.

332
00:16:49,895 --> 00:16:51,762
Bring a dead person
back to life?

333
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:53,728
Nothing, nobody could
have brought her back

334
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,862
after what I did to her.

335
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:57,762
I just said it to get
the brat to play along.

336
00:16:57,795 --> 00:17:00,495
And it worked like a charm, too.

337
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:02,928
He runs from me, and I get
the thrill of the chase.

338
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:05,028
Not only that, there's
the added pleasure

339
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:08,128
of slaughtering everyone
who tries to help him.

340
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:11,862
And every time, he squeals
and begs me, don't hurt them.

341
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:13,828
And he wants to quit
our little game.

342
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:15,595
That's when I use my clincher.

343
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:18,362
Mommy's waiting for
you to save her.

344
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:19,495
What a laugh.

345
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:23,328
But it always works, and
he's off running again.

346
00:17:23,362 --> 00:17:25,295
Mama, mama!

347

[hollow cackles]

348
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:30,695
-But enough about me.

349
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:34,595
Now it's time to kill you.

350
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:36,562
Your defense is
weak, soul reaper!

351
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:46,428
-Here, take your bomb back.

352
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:50,228
What's wrong?

353
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:52,562
Aren't you going
to detonate it now?

354
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:53,662
Go ahead.

355
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:57,428
Just do that thing you
do with your tongue.

356
00:17:57,462 --> 00:17:59,928
Well, if you aren't
going to use it,

357
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:04,828
then I might as well
take it from you.

358
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:07,295
-[raspy] Oh, my tongue!

359
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:09,262

-Don't worry.

364
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:37,295
They're the gates
of the Underworld.

365
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:40,728
But they're opening
only for him.

366
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:43,462
The Zanpakuto can
only wash away sins

367
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:45,695
a soul has committed
as a Hollow.

368
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:47,795
Those who commit terrible
crimes while alive

369
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:51,595
go to the Underworld.

-What's wrong?

00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:42,628
-I'm afraid there's
nothing I can do.

376
00:19:42,662 --> 00:19:44,762
His chain of fate
has been severed.

377
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:46,062
There's no sign of it.

378
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:49,028
Without it, there's no way I
can return him to his body.

379
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,328
-Oh, no.

380
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:53,862
-Yuichi.

381
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:55,228
-Don't be sad.

382
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:59,662
The Soul Society is a wonderful
place that's very peaceful.

383
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:01,395
You'll be happy there.

384
00:20:01,428 --> 00:20:04,262
You'll never be hungry,
and you'll never grow old.

385
00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:07,162
In fact, it's a much better
place to live than this world.

386
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:10,495
-So now you're suddenly an
expert on life in this world.

387
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:12,762
-Wha?

388
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,695
-Anyway, you're
missing the point here.

389
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:17,228
When you pass over,
you'll finally

390
00:20:17,262 --> 00:20:20,162
be reunited with your mother.

391
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:21,995
Maybe we can't bring
her back to life,

392
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:25,062
but she is on the other
side waiting for you.

393
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:28,028
And this time, it's really true.

394
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:28,528
-Ichigo.

395
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:35,262
-Mister Sado?

396
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:37,562
Thank you for everything
you did for me.

397
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:40,528
You carried me everywhere in
your arms and kept me safe.

398
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:43,428
And you were even brave enough
to face a terrible monster

399
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:45,095
and protect me from it.

400
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:48,928
-Hey, don't even mention it.

401
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:51,628
-I guess it's time
for me to go now.

402
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:53,595
I don't know what else
to say except thank you.

403
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,028
All of you.

404
00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:55,528
-Yuichi?

405
00:20:59,162 --> 00:21:01,995
Some day, when I die
and pass over too,

406
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,628
would it be OK with
you if sometimes

407
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,895
I carried you around again?

408
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:09,728
-Mmhm.

409
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:20,862
-Well then.

410
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:22,762
If you're ready,
let's begin the konso.

411
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:42,628
-Oh, Ichigo.

412
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:43,095
Thank you.

Sorry for interrupting.

I'm Kisuke Urahara,
owner of Urahara Store.

best to actually give you

the preview for the next show.

419
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:06,763
You see, the Urahara

420
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:07,863

point, would you?

Oh never mind, we're
out of time again.
