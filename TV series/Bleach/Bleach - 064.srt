00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,433
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Ever since
the powers of the Soul Reaper

2
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,666
were thrust upon me, my
whole world has changed.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,666
Now I'm Ichigo Kurosaki,
substitute Soul Reaper,

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,100
and I'm combining my
powerful spirit energy

5
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:20,266
with this blade in order
to protect my friends!

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,266

00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,973
[alarm ringing]

8
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,040
-Right.

9
00:02:09,073 --> 00:02:10,406
I came back home.

10
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,140
ISSHIN: Good morning, Ichigo!

11
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,206
Well, you've certainly
improved, Ichigo.

12
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,906
I'm impressed you
were able to ward off

13
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,473
my wonderful welcome home kick.

14
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:27,640
-Shut up.

15
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:31,806
-But, don't think you
can avoid my crazy-- it

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,173
ICHIGO: Too much noise
this early in the morning!

17
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:35,373
ISSHIN: That's the sound of--

18
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:35,840
YUZU: Ichigo.

19
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:36,506
Dad.

20
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,173
Breakfast is ready.

21
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:38,006
ICHIGO: Oh no.

22
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,140
KARIN: What are they doing now?

23
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:45,340
-Dad?

24
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,206
What happened to your face?

25
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,373
-Nevermind.

26
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:50,273
-I see.

27
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:52,073
-Oh, by the way, Ichigo.

28
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,906
Have you been
working out lately?

29
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,073
I noticed yesterday
you got a few muscles.

30
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:57,573
-Wow, what do you now?

31
00:02:57,606 --> 00:02:58,706
So, how about you guys?

32
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,573
I know they piled the
homework on this summer.

33
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:01,973
Have you finished it yet?

34
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:03,006
-Mhmm.

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,873
We got it done in
hardly any time at all.

36
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:07,640
We didn't have anything else to
do while you were on your trip,

37
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:08,606
so--

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,340
-Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you.

39
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:13,140
That Kanonji guy came
by a couple of times.

40
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,140
He said he'd made you a
disciple or something.

41
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:16,173
YUZU: That's right.

42
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:17,540
-I don't know what
he's talking about.

43
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,973
ISSHIN: Think fast!

44
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:22,673
You're gonna have to move a
whole lot faster than that.

45
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:24,440
What do you think you're doing?

46
00:03:24,473 --> 00:03:25,873
-Hey, knock it off!

47
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,340
Not at the table, you two.

48
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,973
-Ichigo!

49
00:03:32,006 --> 00:03:32,606
-Hey, Keigo.

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,273
What's up?

51
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,873
-Good morning, Ichigo.

52
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:36,673
What's happening?

53
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:38,206
-What's going on, Mizuiro?

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,673
-Long time no see.

55
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,140
How's it going?

56
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:43,406
You have a good summer?

57
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,340
-Hm.

58
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:45,273
-Morning, Ichigo.

59
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:47,173
How are you today?

60
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:48,106
-Good.

61
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,140
Hey, Tatsuki.

62
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:49,940
How you been doin'?

63
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:50,973
-Hi.

64
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:53,040
I guess you had a pretty
busy summer, didn't?

65
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:55,006
You're never home
when I stop by.

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,806
-Hey, everyone.

67
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,440
Good morning.

68
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:57,306
Check it out.

69
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,640
Chad and Ichigo got tans

70
00:03:58,673 --> 00:03:59,373
-Awesome.

71
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,706
-I did?

72
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,540
-Hey Don't tell me you guys
went off together somewhere?

73
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:04,540
-Ah--

74
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:06,040
-Hm?

75
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,006
-Ah!

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,673
You two are checking
each other out!

77
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,940
Well, now, are we talking about
a little summer camp romance

78
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:12,506
here?

79
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,573
Ah!

80
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:15,206
-Try to keep your
imagination in check.

81
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,140
-Wah!

82
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:19,506
-How about you, Orihime?

83
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,740
Did you have a good visit
with your relatives?

84
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:22,273
-Huh?

85
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:22,773
Oh, yeah.

86
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:23,706
Sure.

87
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,606
It was wonderful
to see them all.

88
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,006
Gosh, we did so
many things together

89
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,740
-Yeah?

90
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:30,273
Like what kind of things?

91
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:31,506
-Huh?

92
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,206
Well, for one, we all went
somewhere really strange

93
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,473
-What do you mean by that?

94
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:39,506
-Well, it kind of looked
like an Edo period town,

95
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,506
and all the people
there were in costume,

96
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,340
and carrying swords and stuff.

97
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:46,040
There was a cat there
who could actually talk.

98
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:47,806
But you see, he was a
boy cat, and then he

99
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,373
turned into a human girl

100
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:50,373
-Right, right.

101
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:51,606
Of course he did.

102
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,440
Now, why don't we concentrate
on second semester?

103
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,373
-Good morning, everyone.

104
00:04:55,406 --> 00:04:56,540
Take your seats.

105
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:59,573
-I wonder what his problem is?

106
00:04:59,606 --> 00:05:00,406
-All right.

107
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,173
It looks like everyone's here.

108
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:01,873
That's excellent.

109
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:02,873
Great.

110
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:04,740
But I don't see
Oshima and Sorimachi.

111
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:06,773
Those two are a
couple of delinquents,

112
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,040
so that's no big loss.

113
00:05:09,073 --> 00:05:12,406
Now then, I want you all to get
out your summer assignments.

114
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,040
I hope you remembered
to bring them in.

115
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,940
-Thank you, Rukia.

116
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,273
-Yeah.

117
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:20,906
Thank you.

118
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,406
MAN: Where are you hiding?

119
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,673
Come on out here!

120
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:27,940
-Huh?

121
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:28,806
-Huh?

122
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,406
-I know that voice.

123
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,506
-Ichigo Kurosaki!

124
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,873
You're up there!

125
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:34,340
Don't pretend you're not!

126
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:35,140
-What?

127
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:36,973
-Ichigo, you know that guy?

128
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:39,806
He's all hippied out.

129
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,606
-Hey!

130
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,306
Ichigo!

131
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,173
-Oh, that's very retro.

132
00:05:42,206 --> 00:05:43,240
RENJI: Don't keep me waiting!

133
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:44,673
-Kurosaki, is he any--

134
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:45,540
-A relative!

135
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:46,706
RENJI: Not gonna be pretty!

136
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,840
-How groovy.

137
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:50,140
[chatter]

138
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:51,240
-How strange.

139
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:51,873
-Hurry up!

140
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:52,973
Come on!

141
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:55,206
ICHIGO: What are you doing?

142
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,140
-Yo.

143
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,140
-Are you totally
out of your mind?

144
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,640
-What are you so excited about?

145
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:07,006
-Excited?

146
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,406
You think you might explain what
the hell you're doing there?

147
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,506
-Yeah?

148
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,740
Well, what do you care
what I'm doing Here?

149
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,340
No reason for you
to get all upset--

150
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,006
-Oh, yes there is,
you yelling like that

151
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,073
in front of everybody.

152
00:06:17,106 --> 00:06:20,106
-Oh, man this Gigai's
not comfortable at all.

153
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,440
I can't imagine why Rukia stayed
in hers as long as she did.

154
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:26,106
-What are you doing here?

155
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,140
-Uh, well, it's like this.

156
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:31,273
It seems I've been put in
charge of this Karakura Town.

157
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:34,306
Mr. Urahara told me where
you were, I came to see you,

158
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,806
and that's the story.

159
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,240
Now I'm in charge.

160
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:38,540
-You are, are ya?

161
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:39,306
-Yeah.

162
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,540
-You're just a Lieutenant.

163
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:42,540
You got demoted.

164
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:43,773
-I did not!

165
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,740
I had to come over
here because of idiots

166
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,573
like you leaking spirit energy.

167
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:49,306
-What are you talking about?

168
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,840
[beeping]

169
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:54,106
-That's what I was telling you.

170
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,640
Huh?

171
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:55,140
-Huh?

172
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:58,073
[roar]

173
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:03,540
-That's a Hollow.

174
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:06,873
[roar]

175
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:08,873
-All right, pass all of
your assignments forward

176
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:09,773
and I'll collect them

177
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:11,440
-(VOICEOVER) What should I do?

178
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,473
-(VOICEOVER) This is bad.

179
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:14,506
It's getting closer.

180
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,906
-(VOICEOVER) Ichigo,
what are you doing?

181
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,473
TEACHER: Does anyone
know what page that was?

182
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:22,706
-Damn this Gigai!

183
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,040
-What's the matter?

184
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:26,773
-I can't get out!

185
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:28,073
You're going to have the do it.

186
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:28,640
-What?

187
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:31,073
Are you serious?

188
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:32,273
Dammit

189
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:34,240
TEACHER: Compare these
with last semester's work,

190
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:35,973
you'll see some differences.

191
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:36,473
-Huh?

192
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:38,406
[roar]

193
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,873
TEACHER: And so we
get the same result--

194
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:44,073
[shout]

195
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:45,773
TEACHER: --using entirely
different approaches.

196
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:50,773
-Yes!

197
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:52,773
Way to go!

198
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,840
TEACHER: What are
you doing, Orihime?

199
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:55,773
-Huh?

200
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,140
Ah--

201
00:07:57,173 --> 00:08:00,640
[laughter]

202
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:01,906
-Good job.

203
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,506
-Cut the crap.

204
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,606
Don't just leave your body
lying around like that.

205
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,973
Hurry up and put it on.

206
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:10,373
-I don't want to go back in.

207
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,006
I just got out of it.

208
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,073
-Now, listen up.

209
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:15,706
I don't want you comin'
around my school.

210
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,506
You got that?

211
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,640
-Yeah, but--

212
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:18,840
-You got that?

213
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,340
TEACHER: And I'm
sure you'll all be

214
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:21,840
pleased to know
that's the solution.

215
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:33,806
-It's still hot like summer.

216
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,340
-Brainfreeze!

217
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:35,140
Ow!

218
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:36,240
But then it's so refreshing!

219
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:38,106
And then it's so painful!

220
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,606
-Maybe you should
eat it more slowly.

221
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,440
-Yeah, Tatsuki.

222
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:43,606
You're absolutely right.

223
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,673
How's your hand doing, anyway?

224
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:48,206
-100% no problems at all.

225
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,306
And the championships
are next month.

226
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,406
I'm doing great.

227
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,340
-You know, Tatsuki,
you're really amazing.

228
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:56,240
Compared to you, I'm just--

229
00:08:56,273 --> 00:08:56,740
-Orihime?

230
00:08:59,406 --> 00:08:59,873
-Aw.

231
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,140
Not again!

232
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:07,573
-At your relatives' house, was
there some kind of problem?

233
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:13,340
-It felt like-- I didn't feel
like I was of much use there.

234
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:15,873
To tell you the
truth, I really wanted

235
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:19,073
to contribute, and be helpful.

236
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:21,906
But I think that it's possible
I might have just gotten

237
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,240
in the way.

238
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:24,873
-Oh, Orihime--

239
00:09:24,906 --> 00:09:27,573
-But then I-- I
could hear your voice

240
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:29,240
telling me to hang in there.

241
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:32,540
And that's why--
well-- I decided

242
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:36,473
to keep on doing all I could.

243
00:09:36,506 --> 00:09:38,973
-I think that's good enough.

244
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:41,040
You went because you wanted to.

245
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:43,373
You can't decide whether
to help people or not

246
00:09:43,406 --> 00:09:45,906
the only thing you
can do is be yourself.

247
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,340
The most important thing is
that you came back safely

248
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:51,906
Welcome home, Orihime.

249
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:57,773
-I, Orihime, will always try!

250
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:02,673
TATSUKI: Are you all right?

251
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:03,673
ORIHIME: Oh, yeah.

252
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:04,673
Never better.

253
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:07,173
Ow!

254
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:07,673
ICHIGO: Hey.

255
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:08,706
I'm home.

256
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,540
-Hi.

257
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:10,973
You're just in time for dinner.

258
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:11,506
-You're late!

259
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:16,273
-Finally.

260
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:18,140
Payback for this morning.

261
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:20,706
-In this house,
dinner's at 7:00.

262
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,706
Have you forgotten?

263
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,906
ICHIGO: Shut up!

264
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,240
-Not again.

265
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:25,573
Would you two cut it out?

266
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:26,706
-Leave them alone.

267
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,406
Just try to think of it
as a bonding experience.

268
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,806
ISSHIN: --super kick of
reality you don't like.

269
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,306
Ah!

270
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,673
-So, are you ready
for seconds yet?

271
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:38,940
-Hm?

272
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,406
-I wouldn't want you to think
that just because you're

273
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,106
a moocher, you can't
ask for seconds.

274
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,406
How about it?

275
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,006
Can I dish you up
another serving

276
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,006
of our meager meal, Mr. Mooch?

277
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,906
-Yeah.

278
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,940
Sure.

279
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:51,406
-You're the first
one to get seconds.

280
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,273
But don't worry.

281
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:54,673
You go right ahead, Mr. Mooch.

282
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:55,340
TESSAI: Come on.

283
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:56,873
Don't be shy.

284
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,506
-Well, I guess so, then.

285
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,540
-Why stand on manners?

286
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:02,773
Even a sponger like you
needs seconds Go on.

287
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:03,773
Eat up.

288
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:04,906
-Speaking of manners,
it's not very

289
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,106
polite to call our
guest here a moocher.

290
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,473
How can he feel comfortable
asking for seconds?

291
00:11:09,506 --> 00:11:12,406
Am I right, Mr. Moocher?

292
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,973
-(VOICEOVER) I can't
ask for seconds?

293
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:17,573
JINTA: Oh, by the way, you need
to clean the front of the shop

294
00:11:17,606 --> 00:11:18,740
tomorrow morning, all right?

295
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:19,940
-Hey, what the--

296
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:21,740
-After all, it's the least
you can do as a moocher,

297
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:22,673
don't you think?

298
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:24,073
You're the one
who wants seconds.

299
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:25,773
Ha.

300
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:26,540
-Well?

301
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:27,673
What do you say, moocher?

302
00:11:27,706 --> 00:11:29,406
You going to pass
that bowl over?

303
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,106
-It's OK.

304
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:40,573
-Thanks, but I couldn't
eat another bite.

305
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,106
-Ah, ha ha ha!

306
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,040
-Jinta, I can't believe
how mean you are.

307
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:53,273
-I never imagined he'd be
as sensitive as all that.

308
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:55,606
TESSAI: I got to admit--

309
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,606
-That guy's pitiful.

310
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,506
I've been meaning
to ask you, Kisuke.

311
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,040
-Yeah?

312
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:01,406
What is it?

313
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,473
-I know it's been awhile since
I've been back in this town,

314
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:05,740
but I sense something unnatural.

315
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,473
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

316
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:10,273
[sigh]

317
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:11,673
-There's been a
little disturbance

318
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:13,540
of spirit particles.

319
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:15,206
But I don't really
think it's anything

320
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,973
to get too excited about.

321
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:18,207
-Hm.

322
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:54,022
-Hm.

323
00:12:56,845 --> 00:13:00,045
Orihime, I know this
might sound crazy,

324
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,645
but after spending
some time there,

325
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:04,511
I think I might finally
be able to understand

326
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,011
the reason behind my strength.

327
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:10,678
-It's so confusing.

328
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:12,111
I don't know what to think.

329
00:13:12,145 --> 00:13:14,878
I only went to be
there for Ichigo.

330
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:17,311
I just wanted to
help him in some way.

331
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:20,178
But I couldn't.

332
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:24,578
And now I just don't know
what I should do anymore.

333
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:26,145
-We can only keep fighting.

334
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:27,745
-Huh?

335
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:32,711
-It's only through Ichigo
that our powers were awakened.

336
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,011
So, if we have any intention
of staying with him,

337
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:37,978
then we must do
everything we possibly

338
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:41,745
can to enhance our powers.

-What are you doing?

341
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,945
Chad, don't you remember
what happened the last time

342
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:52,045
you did this?

343
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:53,445
-Hm?

344
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:54,378
-Come on, Chad!

345
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:55,811
Hurry!

346
00:13:55,845 --> 00:13:57,245
I'm sorry.

347
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:58,145
Gotta hurry!

-(VOICEOVER) Those who have
traveled to the Soul Society

349
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:07,445
and learned the real truth
can no longer keep their eyes

350
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:10,045
closed.

351
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,011
They can no longer keep
their ears covered.

But I-- such an ominous moon.

353
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:25,478
-Why are you trying
to act like Mr. Cool?

354
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:27,545
-You think I don't
know what's going on?

355
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:30,078
-Well, no, I mean--
I'm not quite

356
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:31,845
sure what you expect me to say.

357
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:34,411
-Oh, so now you're going to
start acting all obsequious.

358
00:14:34,445 --> 00:14:35,645
Well, forget it.

359
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:38,211
Your sister's tried that
on me, and it didn't work!

360
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:40,311
-Fine, I'll take you
to Uryu tomorrow.

361
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:41,411
-You know what you are?

362
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,478
-You're lazy,
that's what you are.

363
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:45,311
Mr. Big Shot thinks
he's all high and mighty

364
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,845
because he's got a substitute
Soul Reaper combat pass,

365
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:49,778
and can turn into a Soul Reaper!

366
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,945
-I don't think I'm all
high and mighty, all right?

367
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,478
What's gotten into you lately?

368
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:55,145
All you ever do
is piss and moan.

369
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:56,145
-Yeah?

370
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:57,178
Well, maybe I wouldn't
complain if you

371
00:14:57,211 --> 00:14:58,245
had done what you
were supposed to do.

372
00:14:58,278 --> 00:14:59,911
Why didn't you bring Rukia back?

373
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:00,711
-Hey, what--

374
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,078
-Shut up, already.

375
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:05,145
I went so I could stop
Rukia's execution.

376
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:08,211
I never said I was
going to bring her back.

377
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:10,145
You don't have any idea
what happened there, so

378
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:12,078
why don't you give that
mouth of yours a rest?

379
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,011
-Oh, no.

380
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,411
I'm just some dumb
stuffed animal.

381
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:15,411
How could I know?

382
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:17,145
But you're sadly
mistaken if you think

383
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:19,178
you can do everything
by yourself.

384
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,445
-What are you talking about?

385
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:21,745
-I do the best I can.

386
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:25,078
And yet, and yet--
Rukia, I want to see her!

387
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:27,511
I want to see her, I want to
see her, I want to see her.

388
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:28,378
I want to see her.

389
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:29,145
I want to--

390
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:29,711
-Shut up and go to sleep.

391
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:30,211
-Fine.

392
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:42,411
-Just look at you,
my little bunny.

393
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:46,845
Huh?

394
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,811
Oh, you're finally home.

395
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:51,545
-I wish you wouldn't wait
outside for me, Orihime.

396
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:53,045
I couldn't wait to see you.

397
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,478
I made this bunny as
a welcome home gift.

398
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:57,378
See?

399
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,811
-It's looks just like one.

400
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:02,045
Now, we'd better go inside,
or you'll catch a cold.

401
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:03,978
-Aw, please, not yet.

402
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:05,445
This is the Sora Bunny.

403
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:08,378
I still have to make
an Orihime Bunny.

404
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:09,845
-All right, then.

405
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:11,611
Why don't we make it together?

406
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:12,111
-OK.

407
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:16,211
-My brother.

408
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:39,845
-Byakuya!

409
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:43,878
Brother--

410
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,278
-I don't-- why am I crying?

411
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:58,778

412
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:01,245

00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:01,745
-Coming!

[gasp]

415
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:15,678
-I'm home again.

416
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,178
-I can't believe it.

417
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:22,811

00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:25,611
-Huh?

420
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:29,445
A Hollow?

421
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:31,678
What the-- how can that be?

422
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:41,578
-Hm.

423
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:44,078
Looks like he's going out on a
job in the middle of the night.

424
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:44,878
-How strange.

425
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:50,978
-It's good to see you again.

426
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:52,078
You're looking well.

427
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:54,045
-Thanks.

428
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:58,378
I was never sure-- on
that day, did you--

429
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,811
-Yeah.

430
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:04,178
I was able to make it
to the Soul Society.

431
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:06,611
It's all right now,
because I'll never

432
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:08,311
have to become a Hollow again.

433
00:18:08,345 --> 00:18:09,278
-And you weren't hurt?

434
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:11,111
You were able to
get there safely?

435
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:11,778
-Yes.

436
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:12,645
You were there, too.

437
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:13,978
Weren't you, Orihime?

438
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,645
The Soul Society?

439
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,411
-Yeah.

440
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:18,078
How did you know about that?

441
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:21,745
-Hey, older brothers
know everything.

442
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:22,745
-What is it?

443
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:24,045
What's so funny?

444
00:18:24,078 --> 00:18:26,845
-I was just thinking, you
haven't changed at all

445
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:28,811
since you were a little girl.

446
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:32,011
You would worry about
me all the time.

447
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,978
You were so cute.

448
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:35,845
I remember you
waiting outside for me

449
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:38,578
in the freezing cold,
your hands frozen

450
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:40,211
from making snow bunnies.

451
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,111
-Yeah.

452
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:42,778
RENJI: Hey.

453
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:43,878
Ichigo.

454
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:44,945
Wake up.

455
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:46,345
Hey!

456
00:18:46,378 --> 00:18:49,211
-Huh?

457
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:51,145
-It's about time you woke up.

458
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:52,678
You shouldn't let
your guard down.

459
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:53,978
-Shut up.

460
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:56,211
What the hell are you doing
here at this hour, anyway?

461
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:58,211
-I've got a job that
needs to be done.

462
00:18:58,245 --> 00:18:59,578
And you're going
to come with me.

463
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:00,978
-Huh?

464
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:02,745
I don't see why I have to go.

465
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:04,478
That is, unless
you're like Rukia,

466
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,078
and you can't handle
things yourself.

467
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,378
-Why, you-- I oughtta--

468
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:08,578
-Put a sock in it, you two.

469
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:09,778
It's the middle of the night!

470
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:10,578
-Ah!

471
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:11,845
Wha-- wha-- what is that?

472
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:12,811
-Hm?

473
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:14,245
-After arguing with
you about Rukia,

474
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,711
I was so upset I had to
count three herds of sheep

475
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:17,778
to get to sleep.

476
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:19,145
And now I'm awake,
and the sheep are out

477
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:20,311
of the pen because of you!

478
00:19:20,345 --> 00:19:21,178
Idiots!

479
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:22,211
-You've gotta be kidding.

480
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:26,011
Is this one of those--

481
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:27,711
-I don't have any cavities!

482
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:29,278
-Well, what do you know?

483
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:30,778
It's a Soul Candy.

484
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:33,778
So it'll move even when you
put it in something like this?

485
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:35,345
-Why are you so
interested in it?

486
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:36,411
-I don't know.

487
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:37,645
I guess it's just
one of those things I

488
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,178
forgot about when I got here.

489
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,778
-Maybe that's why you couldn't
get out of your Gigai.

490
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:45,111
So, what's this job
you woke me up for?

491
00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:45,845
-Right.

492
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,245
I almost forgot.

493
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:50,245
It has to do with the strange
message I got on my Soul Pager.

494
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,878
I mean, the spiritual pressure
isn't all that strong,

495
00:19:52,911 --> 00:19:56,245
but you can feel it, can't you?

496
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,045
-Orihime!

497
00:19:57,078 --> 00:19:58,178
-Yeah.

498
00:19:58,211 --> 00:20:00,245
Whatever the source is,
it must be close to her.

499
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:01,645
-You should have
said that before!

500
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:05,678
[squeak]

501
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:07,378
-Come on, what are
you waiting for?

502
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:07,911
-Oh.

503
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:08,545
Yeah.

504
00:20:08,578 --> 00:20:10,545
Right.

505
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:11,978
-Hey, what about me?

506
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:16,545
-No.

507
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:19,378
It isn't that I was worried
about you as much as-- well,

508
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:23,778
I just always felt so lonely
inside that big, empty house.

509
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:25,678
I can still remember
how relieved

510
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:28,011
I felt whenever you came home.

511
00:20:28,045 --> 00:20:29,611
-I felt just the same.

512
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,511
Once I was with you, I knew
that everything would be OK.

513
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,578
-Is that true?

514
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:36,145
-Orihime--

515
00:20:36,178 --> 00:20:37,211
-What is it?

516
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:40,245
-Is there something
that's troubling you?

517
00:20:40,278 --> 00:20:42,311
Something that makes
you dream about me?

518
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:48,611
-Hm?

519
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:49,311
What is it?

520
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:50,845
I sense something odd.

521
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:53,878
-Orihime.

522
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:57,611
ORIHIME: I don't understand.

523
00:20:57,645 --> 00:21:00,045
How did you know about my dream?

524
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:01,511
[laughter]

525
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:02,478
-I know.

526
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,378
Isn't that enough?

527
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:07,078
I've got a good idea.

528
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:08,945
Why don't we get some fresh air?

529
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:15,411
-There it is!

530
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:21,845
-Look!

531
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:23,311
RENJI: What the hell is that?

532
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:33,211
-Now, then, come with me.

533
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:35,711
-What are you doing?

534
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:38,211
-There's nothing to worry about.

535
00:21:38,245 --> 00:21:39,178
Join me.

536
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:44,545
[laughter]

537
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:51,211
-Don't let those be the
gates of the underworld.

538
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:52,278
I'm not ready.

00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:13,345
-It disappeared.

545
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,178

URYU: I wonder where
Orihime disappeared to?

549
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:08,289
Hey.

550
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,275
Why don't we follow her scent?

551
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:11,075
You could do that,
couldn't you, Yoruichi?

552
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:11,675
YORUICHI: Sure.

553
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:12,308
No problem.

554
00:24:12,341 --> 00:24:13,075
ICHIGO: What?

555
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,141
You mean cats can do that?

556
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:15,208
YORUICHI: Are you kidding?

557
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:16,708
It's a piece of cake
for someone like me.

558
00:24:16,741 --> 00:24:18,308
ICHIGO: I had no
idea you could that!

559
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:20,341
YORUICHI: Not really.

-What?

565
00:24:37,841 --> 00:24:39,041
You've got a lot of
nerve, dressing me up

566
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:39,975
to look like some pansy!

Just who do you think
you are, anyway?

URYU: I thought you
might like a change.

KON: This is your
idea of change?

570
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:45,775
Look at me.

571
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:48,175
With all this lace, I look more
like a princess than a lion.

572
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,275
Maybe you'd like me to
go dance in the daisies?

That's what I'm talking about.

Thanks, Uryu.
