[theme music]

2
00:01:50,507 --> 00:01:52,007
VOICEOVER: Soul Reapers.

3
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:55,007
The spiritual guardians to
the world of the living.

4
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,907
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

5
00:01:57,941 --> 00:02:00,841
of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

6
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:03,541
Sosuke Aizen, who
betrayed the Soul Society

7
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:07,574
and left the Seireitei in chaos,
has set his plan into motion.

8
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:10,174
Arrancars have arrived
in Karakura town.

9
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:13,207
Using the Hokyoku, Aizen
has created these Arrancars

10
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,707
by shattering the boundary
between Soul Reapers

11
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:16,407
and Hollows.

12
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:17,107
-(IN HEAD) Dammit.

13
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:17,807
I can't move my body.

14
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:25,007
I rejected you, so now you wanna
get in my way and sabotage me?

15
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,007
Damn it.

16
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:32,941
VOICEOVER: Despite
fighting bravely,

17
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:36,141
Ichigo is defeated by
Ulquiorra and Yammy.

18
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:38,474
But in the nick of time,
Kisuke and Yoruichi

19
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:41,341
manage to drive them away.

20
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:44,507
Depressed, Ichigo is shocked
at the appearance of Captain

21
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,407
Hitsugaya's advance guard,
sent by the soul society

22
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:51,907
to confront the Arrancars.

23
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:53,307
-You dummy.

24
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,874
He's talking about those guys
who bear you up the other day.

25
00:02:57,907 --> 00:02:59,941
-Well, actually, to be
more specific about it,

26
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:01,307
there are three
different classes

27
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:03,874
of beings under
the name of Menos.

28
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:05,374
The first is the Gillian.

29
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:08,541
This class is
called the Adjuchas.

30
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:11,941
And finally, there
are the Vasto Lordes,

31
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:15,874
the highest class
within the Menos.

32
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:18,007
They are equal to
humans in size,

33
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,107
and there are very few of
them within Hueco Mundo,

34
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,207
but I have to give
it to you straight.

35
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:25,474
The grim truth is that
these Vasto Lordes

36
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:28,874
are believed to be even more
powerful than the Soul Reaper

37
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:30,741
captains are.

38
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:33,641
If Aizen now has more than
10 of those Vasto Lordes

39
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:38,374
under his controlm then
the Soul Society is doomed.

40
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:50,774
-We have returned, Lord Aizen.

41
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:54,174
-Welcome, Ulquiorra and Yammy.

42
00:03:56,841 --> 00:04:00,174
So, tell me what
you've accomplished.

43
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,341
Here, in front of
your 20 brothers.

44
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:08,841
All right.

45
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,107
Alquiorra.

46
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:13,474
Show us what you
have experienced

47
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:15,474
in the world of the living.

48
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:17,241
All of it.

49
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:18,041
-Yes sir.

50
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,474
Here you are.

51
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:27,407
See for yourselves.

52
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:52,307
-I understand.

53
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:58,441
So, I see that you have decided
he wasn't worth killing.

54
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:00,541
-Yes the orders
were to kill anyone

55
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:04,141
who might be an obstacle, and we
learned that there was no one.

56
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:04,974
-You're soft!

57
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:11,441
If it had been me, I'd
have killed both of them

58
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:12,074
with the first.

59
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:13,774
Strike

60
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:15,707
-Grimmjow.

61
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:17,641
-What the hell
were you thinking?

62
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:20,341
If kill him was part of the
orders, then obviously you

63
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:22,174
and that oaf should
have killed him, right?

64
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:23,574
Right?

65
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:24,941
And I agree.

66
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:26,974
The boy stood up to you.

67
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:31,174
I say you should have killed
him, be he worthy or not.

68
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:32,807
-And look at you, Yammy.

69
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:34,107
You're a mess.

70
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:36,907
Then you come back and tell
us he wasn't worth killing?

71
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:39,741
Looks to me like you
guys couldn't kill him!

72
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:42,174
-Grimmjow, it was clear.

73
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:44,007
I know you saw what happened.

74
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,074
The guy wearing clogs, and
that damn dark skinned girl

75
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:47,941
beat me up.

76
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:49,741
-That is so pathetic.

77
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:53,174
A guy wearing wooden shoes
and a female beat you!

78
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:55,241
-Pathetic, huh?

79
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:57,174
-Enough.

80
00:05:57,207 --> 00:06:00,307
Grimmjow, I don't
think you understand.

81
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:02,574
That boy is no danger to us.

82
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:03,174
Yet.

83
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:04,674
-Huh?

84
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:07,141
ULQUIORRA: Lord
Aizen isn't worried

85
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:11,774
about what his
current abilities are.

86
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:15,407
It is his growth rate
that is the problem.

87
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,874
As we learned, the boy
has tremendous potential.

88
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:22,674
Right now his powers
are extremely unstable,

89
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:24,607
but I sense that if he
doesn't self-destruct,

90
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:27,541
he might prove useful
to us in the future.

91
00:06:27,574 --> 00:06:29,307
That's why I let him live.

92
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,274
-I still maintain
that you're soft!

93
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,174
How can you be sure he
won't become stronger

94
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:35,374
than you predict and
will turn against us?

95
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:37,374
What about your plan then?

96
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:39,941
-Should that occur,
I'll get rid of him.

97
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:41,707
That's all.

98
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:45,574
You can't complain
about that, can you?

99
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:50,341
-Yes, well, then I'll
leave it in your hands.

100
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:53,107
Do whatever you deem
best, Ulquiorra.

101
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:57,374
-Thank you very much, sir.

102
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,741
[shouting]

103
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:13,207
-Huh.

104
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:15,341
And you actually think that's
the best way to remove it?

105
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:19,907
-Mission accomplished.

106
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:20,874
Here it is.

107
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,307
-Ugh, that is
totally disgusting.

108
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:27,207
You got the soul out of him
without too much trouble.

109
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:28,907
It's certainly
constructed simply.

110
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:30,174
Or should I say shoddily?

111
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,441
-Hey.

112
00:07:31,474 --> 00:07:32,674
-That's the Department of
Research and Development.

113
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:33,341
Always unique.

114
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:34,441
-I said hey.

115
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:35,674
-What do you want?

116
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:37,741
-Any idea when you guys
are going to leave?

117
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:39,507
-What do you mean, Ichigo?

118
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,741
We're not going to go home.

119
00:07:40,774 --> 00:07:42,641
We're staying here until
our fight with the Arrancars

120
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:43,341
is done.

121
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,741
No one leaves 'til then.

122
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:47,007
-You'll be staying?

123
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,074
But where the hell are you
all planning on sleeping?

124
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:51,041
Let me make this
perfectly clear.

125
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:53,607
We don't have enough space
for you to stay here.

126
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,574
-Aw.

127
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,507
You don't mean me, do you?

128
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,341
-Yikes!

129
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:58,074
What the hell?

130
00:07:58,107 --> 00:07:58,774
No way!

131
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:00,174
You gotta be kidding me.

132
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:02,241
You're the last person
I'd let stay here.

133
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,941
What makes you think I
would in the fist place?

134
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:06,774
Ah!

135
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:08,241
What do you think you're doing?

136
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:12,174
You can't change my mind
by undoing a button!

137
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:14,641
Not even if you lift
your skirt a little!

138
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:15,641
Dammit!

139
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:17,207
I will not give into temptation!

140
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:19,941
A man like me doesn't
give into temptation!

141
00:08:19,974 --> 00:08:21,074
-Really?

142
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:24,807
Then why are you peeking
through your fingers?

143
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:28,374
-Well, for now, I'll
be Orihime's guest,

144
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,374
and I'll sleep in her bed.

145
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:32,807
-What do you mean?

146
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:34,874
Did you already
get her permission?

147
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:36,307
-There isn't any rush.

148
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:40,374
She's the kind of girl who
doesn't know how to say no.

149
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:43,607
-Orihime and Rangiku will both
be sleeping in the same room?

150
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,707
Oh, let me be the gardener in
your forbidden flower garden!

151
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:53,307
Wouldn't you like a mascot who--

152
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:55,407
-Captain, how'd
you like to come?

153
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:55,907
-No way.

154
00:08:55,941 --> 00:08:57,241
I won't.

155
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:58,941
-You should come.

156
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:00,674
It'll be fun.

157
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,141
-For you, maybe.

158
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,007
-We'd better get going as well.

159
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,007
-You have somewhere to go?

160
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,241
-Of course I don't.

161
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:10,174
There's no need to worry.

162
00:09:10,207 --> 00:09:12,774
Last thing I'd do
is depend on you.

163
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:15,941
I'll find a place
to stay on my own.

164
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:17,141
-All right.

165
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:19,807
And keep that wooden sword
of yours out of sight!

166
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:22,207
-Well then, I guess I'll
be going to Urahara's place

167
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:23,174
for a while.

168
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:25,174
-You're going to
mooch off him again?

169
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:26,174
-I wouldn't dream of it.

170
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,407
Just what are you saying?

171
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:34,374
However-- there is something
I want to ask him about.

172
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,541
-Oh, is that so?

173
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:39,041
-You be careful, now!

174
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:44,274
-So, have you figured out where
you're going to be staying?

175
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:45,407
Wait a minute!

176
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:46,041
Rukia!

177
00:09:46,074 --> 00:09:47,307
-Don't be stupid.

178
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:49,907
This is obviously the only
place that's right for me!

179
00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:51,241
-Are you crazy?

180
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:52,707
My family has seen you.

181
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:55,674
What excuse are you
planning on giving 'em?

182
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:58,207
Listen to me, you!

183
00:09:58,241 --> 00:09:59,141
-Ah.

184
00:09:59,174 --> 00:10:00,474
I smell a Hollow.

185
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:02,207
Do you think we should kill it?

186
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:02,841
-Leave it.

187
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:04,241
Too much trouble.

188
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:08,041
That Soul Reaper Kuromadoni, or
whoever, is in charge, right?

189
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:08,741
-Hm.

190
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,907
I guess so.

191
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:14,241
But this Hollow
scent is strange.

192
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:39,241
-Why do I keep
worrying about it?

193
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:41,507
I feel stupid.

194
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,541
-And you know what?

195
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:45,841
Ichigo has totally
recovered already.

196
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:55,141
And I guess that--
I guess-- Rukia.

197
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:58,841
She's really something special.

198
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:01,707
I think I'm a little jealous.

199
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,307
-So you see, I've
lost everything.

200
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:17,841
I don't have a
place to stay, and I

201
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:19,307
don't have any money for food.

202
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:25,174
-Please let her stay here!

203
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:26,141
Please, Dad!

204
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:27,341
-You got it, Yuzu.

205
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:30,007
In the core of my heart,
I thought the same thing!

206
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,141
You can stay as
long as you like!

207
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:32,674
Poor girl!

208
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:36,474
-What are you doing?

209
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:38,407
You might want to keep
that thumb hidden, Rukia,

210
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:40,507
or they'll catch on to your act.

211
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,474
-Mother!

212
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:42,407
Listen to me, Mother!

213
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:44,607
I'm overwhelmed with joy!

214
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,574
We now have a third daughter!

215
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:48,941
-But of course, from the
way he's acting right now,

216
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,441
it doesn't look like
he has any doubts.

217
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:59,274
-I had this realization
at that exact moment.

218
00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:01,641
A uniform can become
a lethal blade,

219
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:03,541
depending on who's
wearing it, naturally.

220
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:07,307
A mighty blade, able to shatter
the armor of my self control.

221
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:08,307
-Hey, keep it down.

222
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:09,941
Or I'm outta here.

223
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:10,441
-Huh?

224
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:11,007
Come on.

225
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:11,941
-Oh, no, no, no

226
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:13,707
-Do you even hear
what I'm saying?

227
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:14,607
Hey!

228
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:15,974
Wait up for me!

229
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:17,241
Hold on a second!

230
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:17,741
Huh?

231
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,007
Wait a-- what's that?

232
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,941
-Like I said, I'm out
of here, Mr. Asano.

233
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:27,841
-Come on!

234
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:28,907
Wait!

235
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:32,774
I saw this really scary
monster up in the sky!

236
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:33,707
-All right, all right.

237
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:35,674
I've heard enough, Mr. Asano.

238
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:38,174
[shouting]

239
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:58,162
-Hm?

240
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,095
You want to stay over?

241
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:00,995
At my place?

242
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:02,328
Here?

243
00:13:02,362 --> 00:13:03,462
That's fine, but--

244
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:04,362
-Great!

245
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:05,109
Good girl.

246
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:06,709
I knew you wouldn't
turn me away.

247
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:09,409
That's what I love
about you, Orihime.

248
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:09,909
Hey.

249
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:10,776
I know.

250
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:11,876
A bath.

251
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:14,243
The excitement today
sure got me all sweaty.

252
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:15,609
You see?

253
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:16,176
-OK.

254
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,543
Right this way.

255
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:19,209
-Want to join me, Orihime?

256
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:20,043
-Huh?

257
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:21,676
Well, I've already had my-- ah!

258
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:22,376
Ah!

259
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,676
Ow, that hurts, Rangiku!

260
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:25,376
-Oh.

261
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:26,676
Hold on for a moment.

262
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:28,643
-Huh?

263
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:32,443
-If you have nowhere else to go,
then you can come and join us.

264
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:32,943
-Huh?

265
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:36,343
-Yeah.

266
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:36,943
That'll happen.

267
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:49,209
-So how's the tub?

268
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:50,543
Is it OK?

269
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:51,709
RANGIKU: It's fine.

270
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,209
Though it is a bit small.

271
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:55,376
-I'm sorry.

272
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:56,043
RANGIKU: Oh, no.

273
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:56,776
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:57,343
It's great.

275
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,909
So, can I help?

276
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:08,543
Why are you so serious?

277
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:09,209
ORIHIME: What?

278
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:10,809
Am I?

279
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:12,643
I feel fine.

280
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:13,343
-Come on, now.

281
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:14,509
Tell me all about it.

282
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:17,143
I'm a pretty good listener.

283
00:14:17,176 --> 00:14:18,809
ORIHIME: Oh.

284
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:20,743
But-- I'm fine.

285
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,876
Really.

286
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,876
-I'll have to punish you
if you don't tell me.

287
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:33,343
-You're sorry that
you were so weak?

288
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:34,843
Right?

289
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:39,976
-So that next time, I
won't let them hurt you.

290
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,143
-Rukia is really something.

291
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:45,043
Isn't she?

292
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:48,043
With just one kick,
she was able snap

293
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:49,809
Ichigo right out of his funk.

294
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:55,576
He'd been feeling
down for a while,

295
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:57,743
but she got him going again.

296
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:06,276
I-- I guess I'm pretty terrible.

297
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:07,009
Aren't I?

298
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:13,143
I really wanted
Ichigo to cheer up.

299
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:16,709
It's all I wanted.

300
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:19,643
I thought that was all
I wanted at the time.

301
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:24,776
But when Rukia came back,
and she cheered up Ichigo,

302
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:26,109
I should have been happy.

303
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:29,076
And yet, I couldn't do it.

304
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:30,443
But it was great.

305
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:41,009
And yet-- and yet-- and yet--
in truth, I feel jealous.

306
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:42,943
I wish I didn't.

307
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:46,776
Rukia's kind and gentle,
strong and beautiful.

308
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:48,843
She lifted Ichigo's
spirits, and has

309
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:51,009
a special chemistry with him.

310
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:53,276
I like her a lot.

311
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:58,076
Anyway, I shouldn't be this way.

312
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:00,476
I don't feel like
this in school.

313
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:03,476
But when I come home and
I'm alone, I fall apart,

314
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:05,876
and I'm a mess.

315
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:08,076
Just listen to me.

316
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:09,043
How lame.

317
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:10,409
I'm being a total witch.

318
00:16:14,043 --> 00:16:15,443
Huh?

319
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:15,943

You're-- Ah!

00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:26,776

Ow, I hit my head!

331
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:40,043
Oh, that's funny.

332
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:40,609
No, wait!

333
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:41,509
Ah, it hurts!

334

[laughter]

335
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:45,976
-Huh?

336
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:47,943
-You're such a fool.

337
00:16:47,976 --> 00:16:50,176
It's essential to
be who you are.

338
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,976
That means you, and Rukia.

339
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:55,543
-Ichigo is still
a kid who hasn't

340
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:57,676
learned to stand up by himself.

341
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:01,909
That's why he needs
both you and Rukia.

342
00:17:01,943 --> 00:17:05,276
What's wrong with being jealous?

343
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:07,609
You're trying your
best to come to terms

344
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:12,409
with some very serious
emotions, aren't you?

345
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:15,676
We both know that it's easier
to run away from these emotions

346
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,443
and to protect your heart.

347
00:17:17,476 --> 00:17:19,776
But look at you, Orihime.

348
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:22,576
standing firm and trying
to deal with them.

349
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,409
Because you're good.

350
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:28,143
Aw.

351
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:30,143
There's nothing wrong
with crying, poor girl.

352
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:31,876
My bosom's your pillow.

353
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:33,409
Let it all pour out.

354
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:48,009
-Is this everyone?

355
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,976
Did anyone see you?

356
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:00,276
-Of course not.

357
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:01,776
-Grimmjow.

358
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:02,276
-Yeah?

359
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:03,676
What?

360
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:07,543
On the journey to meet with you,
I detected spiritual pressures.

361
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:12,709
They were many and strong,
contrary to Ulquiorra's report.

362
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:13,776
-Open your pescises.

363
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:34,443
Just as I thought.

364
00:18:34,476 --> 00:18:37,143
There are many more.

365
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:40,209
Well, the Soul
Society, at a guess.

366
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:42,076
Must be reinforcements.

367
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:45,343
It's grown complex,
all thanks to you.

368
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:48,443
If you'd have done your job,
this wouldn't have happened.

369
00:18:48,476 --> 00:18:50,743
You're soft, Ulquiorra.

370
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:58,643
Di Roy, Shawlong,
Edrad, Yylfordt, Nakeem.

371
00:18:58,676 --> 00:19:00,876
There's no need to hold back.

372
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:03,809
If they have any
spiritual pressure at all,

373
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:04,776
I want 'em dead!

374
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:16,143
-Look at that.

375
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:18,276
They gave me your sister's room.

376
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:19,076
-Well?

377
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:20,643
What did you expect, Rukia?

378
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,209
-I planned this
out totally, and I

379
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:24,109
was expecting to
stay in your closet!

380
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:24,943
-Yeah, right.

381
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:27,009
Talk to my dad, not me.

382
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:28,909
-But I even brought some
things to brighten up

383
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:31,376
that dirty little
closet of yours.

384
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:33,876
A light, a bell, massager.

385
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:35,576
And a window.

386
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,509
-This is getting
worse every minute.

387
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,309
-And did I just
hear you say dirty?

388
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:47,609
-Here you are.

389
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:56,576
-Wh-- what is it?

390
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:59,009
-Strange face.

391
00:19:59,043 --> 00:19:59,976
-Hey, shut up!

392
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:10,676
-Don't you think it's
strange, Yumichika?

393
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,209
-What's strange?

394
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:13,143
-This.

395
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:15,309
This hand made rice ball.

396
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:17,609
They're made by
hand, but so neat.

397
00:20:17,643 --> 00:20:20,176
They've carefully packed them
in this complicated wrapping,

398
00:20:20,209 --> 00:20:21,743
and they've got
plenty of them stocked

399
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:24,809
on shelves in all the stores.

400
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:27,443
And according to what
the sales girl said,

401
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,509
they're replaced
several times a day.

402
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:33,109
That can't be right.

403
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:35,109
I don't believe that
girl has the skill

404
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:36,576
to do something like this.

405
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,509
There's got to be
something fishy going on

406
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:40,076
behind the scenes.

407
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:41,743
-What a coincidence.

408
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:43,576
I just came to the
same conclusion

409
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,009
about those hand
made rice balls.

410
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:50,576
[sigh]

411
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:53,043
-I can't believe
I at all of that.

412
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:55,343
What an amazing meal, Orihime.

413
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:56,543
-You mean that?

414
00:20:56,576 --> 00:20:57,943
-I sure do.

415
00:20:57,976 --> 00:21:00,876
Of course, it didn't look that
great, but it tasted delicious.

416
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:02,143
-I'm so glad!

417
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:05,009
I always cook so much food,
but then nobody eats any.

418
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:07,076
I figured that I had
to be a real weirdo.

419
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:08,509
Bad tastebuds.

420
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:11,209
Oh, would you like some
ice cream, Rangiku?

421
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:12,176
It's really yummy.

422

-Oh, that sounds good.

423
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:14,709
-Let's see.

424
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:16,643
If you put all kinds
of toppings on it,

425
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,109
then it tastes even better!

426
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:20,576
See what I mean?

427
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:21,143
Here.

428
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:24,376
Help yourself.

429
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,309

ORIHIME: Some of this.

434
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:32,643
Would you like to try it?

RANGIKU: What a weird color.

436
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:35,943
But it might be good.

No rest 'til everyone is caught.

You will show them no mercy.

If they show even a glimmer of
spiritual pressure, kill them.
