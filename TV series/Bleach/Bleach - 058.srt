00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:16,400
[theme music]

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:01:34,966
[theme music]

3
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:04,181
-What is that light that I saw?

4
00:02:04,214 --> 00:02:09,147
Is this the true power of your
zanpakuto, Ichigo Kurosaki?

5
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,347
-That's right.

6
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,481
When I swing my sword, all
of my spiritual pressure

7
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:15,614
is absorbed by my zanpakuto.

8
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:19,581
Then it gets released again
in a super high density beam.

9
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:23,781
That gives it an
incredibly amplified swing.

10
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:27,114
That's Zangetsu's power.

11
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,614
MALE VOICE (OFFSCREEN):
At last, you

12
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:31,747
are able to fire a
shot at will, Ichigo.

13
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:35,547
So I shall tell you, the
destructive power of an attack

14
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,714
is 1,000 times
greater when you know

15
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:40,181
its names than when you do not.

16
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:46,114
Hear this, and
remember well, Ichigo.

17
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:47,847
The name of that attack is--

18
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:52,847
- --is Getsuga Tensho.

19
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:59,447
I'll say it once more.

20
00:02:59,481 --> 00:03:00,447
Byakuya Kuchiki.

21
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:08,681
Attack with your Bankai now.

22
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:11,581
With or without your Bankai,
I plan to defeat you.

23
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:19,881
-Piecer of Heaven, huh.

24
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:23,014
What a pretentious name.

25
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:24,481
All right then.

26
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:27,581
Since you're not willing
to take no for an answer,

27
00:03:27,614 --> 00:03:29,381
then feast your eyes.

28
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:32,714
Behold my Bankai.

29
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:36,047
-(IN HEAD) He let
go of his sword?

30
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:37,047
-Don't worry.

31
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:39,547
This will be over swiftly.

32
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:41,414
You'll turn to
dust and disappear

33
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:43,947
before another thought
passes through your head.

34
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:55,714
Bankai.

35
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:57,114
Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

36
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:28,014
Pathetic.

37
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,914
-I won't make it.

38
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:02,847
-Think of Senbonzakura
like this.

39
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:05,247
A relentless barrage
from every direction

40
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:09,381
by billions of blades,
attacking simultaneously.

41
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:13,414
The abilities of your zanpakuto
are more than I imagined.

42
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:23,114
However-- your attacks are
far too broad and clumsy.

43
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:25,714
You could never evade the
nimble assault of Senbanzakura.

44
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:29,981
-Damn.

45
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:32,114
I thought I could
do better than that.

46
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:34,081
I should have known
I couldn't do it.

47
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:37,747
Just had to try, though.

48
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,981
-Guess it's foolish
to think I could ever

49
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:42,381
beat a bankai while
only using my shikai.

50
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:45,781
-That arrogant mouth of yours
is going to be the death of you.

51
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:49,081
You talk as if you've already
achieved bankai level.

52
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:49,914
-Yeah.

53
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:51,047
-Hm?

54
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:53,081
-You catch on pretty
quickly, Byakuya Kuchiki.

55
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:15,314
[screaming]

56
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:28,147
-How's she doing?

57
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:28,814
-She's sleeping.

58
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:39,681
-You used Kyomon?

59
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:41,847
Is such a powerful
barrier necessary?

60
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:44,347
-I can't predict the
movements of everyone,

61
00:06:44,381 --> 00:06:47,414
but I at least want to
protect her from her enemies.

62
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:49,814
-Her enemies?

63
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:50,814
-Let's go.

64
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,181
-Is that the Ryoka?

65
00:06:56,214 --> 00:06:58,014
-Considering the location
and the intensity

66
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,747
of the spiritual pressure,
who else could it be?

67
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,547
It's gotten to the
point where the only way

68
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:06,281
to gain control of
the situation is

69
00:07:06,314 --> 00:07:08,981
by making a direct
appeal to our superiors.

70
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:10,447
-If that's your
plan, do you mean

71
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:13,247
to tell them about the incident
with Captain Aizen as well?

72
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:14,447
-Yes.

73
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:16,614
Only I intend to tell
them what really happened.

74
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:17,614
Let's hurry.

75
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,447
-What did you say?

76
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,447
-Don't make me repeat myself.

77
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:34,081
I think you heard me.

78
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:35,714
You just don't
want to believe it.

79
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,081
Do you?

80
00:07:38,114 --> 00:07:41,247
Then again, I don't care
whether you believe me or not.

81
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:42,981
I'm not going to say it again.

82
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:45,847
You'll believe once you see
it yourself, Byakuya Kuchiki!

83
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:54,747
-Huah!

84
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:09,947
-Whoa.

85
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:11,981
-That must be Ichigo.

86
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:13,347
Right?

87
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:15,581
-No one else I know
fights like that.

88
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:18,181
No one's that crazy.

89
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:21,247
-I tell ya what, it
kind of makes me glad

90
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:23,347
I never picked a
friendly fight with him.

91
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:24,947
-You got that right.

92
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:28,381
As the old saying goes, even a
cat won't eat a childish fight.

93
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:29,714
-That's not quite right.

94
00:08:29,747 --> 00:08:32,781
A cat won't eat a child's
fight, not a childish fight.

95
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:33,481
-No, Oryu.

96
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,881
I'm afraid you're wrong.

97
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,847
It's not child's or childish,
but a married couple's fight.

98
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:41,381
And it isn't a cat that won't
eat the married couple's fight.

99
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:42,314
It's a dog.

100
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:44,414
-Oh, you know what
I meant, anyway.

101
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:46,481
-It's bad enough that
I'm arguing with Orihime

102
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:48,081
about these stupid
sayings, but now I'm

103
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:49,547
even being corrected by Chad!

104
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:51,514
-You might want to have
this talk with yourself

105
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:52,781
some other time.

106
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:53,581
-Yes, you're right.

107
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:56,447
We had better get going.

108
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,147
-You gotta wonder
about someone who'd

109
00:08:58,181 --> 00:09:01,014
be dumb enough to follow a
person as crazy as he is.

110
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:02,914
Wait, I think I just
insulted myself.

111
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:04,447
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN):
Ganju, hurry up!

112
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:06,614
You're gonna be left behind!

113
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:07,481
-Huh?

114
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:07,981
Oh, right!

115
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:08,481
Wait up!

116
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:16,047
-A bankai?

117
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:19,047
That's impossible.

118
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:21,914
It's the final stage
of the zanpakuto.

119
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:25,814
Only soul reapers of the highest
level are able to attain it.

120
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:28,314
Out of the four
great noble families

121
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:31,281
who are blessed with far greater
spiritual pressure than others,

122
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:33,547
only one child in
several generations

123
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:37,281
has the ability to
reach that level.

124
00:09:37,314 --> 00:09:39,614
And those who have
attained it have all

125
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:42,081
had their names forever
etched into the history

126
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,047
of the Soul Society.

127
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:48,347
That is bankai.

128
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:59,447
So why him?

129
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:03,347
He became a soul reaper by
absorbing Rukia's power.

130
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:05,247
He's not a noble.

131
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:06,947
He wasn't even
born a soul reaper.

132
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:16,181
So how can he reach
bankai so easily,

133
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:19,481
as if it's second nature?

134
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:23,847
And how can he release
such spiritual pressure?

135
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:33,881
It's as if he's-- Yeah.

136
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,514
You're slow.

137
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:51,981
Even when you are falling.

138
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:53,481
-Brother, don't do it!

139
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:57,281
[gasp]

140
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:01,614
-Bankai!

141
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:20,048
Bankai!

142
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:30,682
Tensa Zangetsu.

143
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:36,048
-So then, that's it?

144
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,348
That little weapon?

145
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:41,882
That's your bankai?

146
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:43,715
It looks just like
a regular zanpakuto.

147
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:49,115
Now I can see.

148
00:13:49,148 --> 00:13:52,282
This is no different from
the day of the execution.

149
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:55,082
What it comes down to is the
fact that you enjoy treading

150
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:58,382
on those things we hold sacred.

151
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:02,082
What you need is to
be taught a lesson.

152
00:14:02,115 --> 00:14:03,882
I plan on showing
you what happens

153
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:06,615
to immature brats who
try to insult our honor.

154
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:20,648
-You want to talk about pride?

155
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:24,248
Your so-called honor
demands that you kill Rukia.

156
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:29,515
Takes a lot of honor to kill
your own sister, doesn't it?

157
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:31,815
Well, if that's the kind of
pride you're talking about,

158
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:34,148
you can bet your ass I'm
going to mess with it.

159
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:39,615
That's the reason
I got this power.

160
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:40,515
Your stupid pride!

161
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:24,148
-Captain Aizen.

162
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:28,482
What should I do?

163
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:44,648
I-- I have to find out.

164
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:53,015
-There should be someone
guarding the front gate.

165
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:54,182
But I don't see anyone.

166
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:54,682
-Yeah.

167
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:55,448
It's odd.

168
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:18,048
-The place is deserted.

169
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,415
-Well, someone's here, because
it's locked from inside.

170
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:31,048
You must open this
door immediately!

171
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:33,082
It's a matter of
utmost importance!

172
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:35,582
My name is Captain
Hitsugaya of squad 10!

173
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,748
-Someone's activated the
emergency defense lock.

174
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:43,915
-Yes.

175
00:16:43,948 --> 00:16:45,782
It gets stranger every minute.

176
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:46,915
I wonder what's going on?

177
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,782
-Looks like we finally found it.

178
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:01,248
The entrance to the
execution grounds.

179
00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:02,682
-It's so high!

180
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:04,782
-We gotta climb all those steps?

181
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,448
-We'll find Rukia
up there somewhere.

182
00:17:08,482 --> 00:17:08,948
-Ichigo.

183
00:17:11,548 --> 00:17:12,348
Let's go.

184
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:13,282
-Hold on!

185
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,182
What are you in
such a hurry for?

186
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:16,382
Slow down.

187
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:19,082
Didn't you feel that
spiritual pressure earlier?

188
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:20,615
You'd be completely
out of your mind

189
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:23,315
to walk into the middle
of a fight like that!

190
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:25,615
That stuff is dangerous.

191
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:27,382
You don't have to do this.

192
00:17:27,415 --> 00:17:28,915
It's not worth it.

193
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,215
-We appreciate the fact that
you're worried about us.

194
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:32,015
Really.

195
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:33,615
But we've come all this way.

196
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:36,282
It's not like we're just
going to turn back now.

197
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:37,215
-Yeah.

198
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:38,748
We're his friends,
no matter what.

199
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:40,048
-That's right.

200
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:42,482
-Mm.

201
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:45,748
Thank you very much for
helping us get this far.

202
00:17:45,782 --> 00:17:47,548
We can handle it
from here on out.

203
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:48,682
-Huh?

204
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:50,082
-Well, I guess this is
where we say goodbye,

205
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:53,282
then, uh-- Mr. Mini Mustache?

206
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:54,582
-You take care.

207
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,182
Catch you later, Mini Mustache.

208
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:58,148
-Thank you again, Mini Mustache.

209
00:17:58,182 --> 00:18:01,348
-But-- hey!

210
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:03,148
What's with these guys?

211
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,482
Are they nuts, or what?

212
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:08,915
And the name's
not Mini Mustache!

213
00:18:08,948 --> 00:18:09,582
You hear?

214
00:18:09,615 --> 00:18:11,448
It's Makizo Aramaki!

215
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:14,115
Of squad 11!

216
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:16,482
And we members of
squad 11 don't know

217
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:19,982
the meeting of the word fear!

218
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,248
Oh, yeah!

219
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:23,782
And try to remember my
name, would you, guys?

220
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,082
It's not that hard!

221
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,715
-For an instant, I
completely lost sight of him.

222
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:45,482
I couldn't react.

223
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:45,982
Impossible!

224
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:53,782
Tell me why.

225
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:56,848
Why did you take the point of
your sword away from my throat?

226
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:01,148
Well?

227
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,548
Answer me.

228
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:05,948
Arrogance destroys the
footholds of victory.

229
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:13,482
That move of yours
is not bankai.

230
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:20,548
There could never be a bankai
as small and fragile as that.

231
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:23,648
And a lowly Ryoka could
never attain bankai.

232
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:24,415
It's inconceivable.

233
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:32,615
With this attack, you will
regret not slitting my throat

234
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:34,048
when you had the chance.

235
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:36,848
A miracle only happens once.

236
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:38,748
Your luck has run out, boy.

237
00:19:57,648 --> 00:19:59,615
How does he move so quickly?

238
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:03,115
My Senbonzakura,
it can't keep up.

239
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:14,615
-What's the matter?

240
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,748
Am I moving too slow for you?

241
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:17,848
Just say so.

242
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:20,015
I can move a little
faster if you'd like.

243
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:21,548
-Don't get too cocky.

244
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:22,515
Such arrogance!

245
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:39,815
-He got faster.

246
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:43,248
-Using the palms of my
hands, I'm twice as fast.

247
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:57,582
There's nothing I can't capture.

248
00:20:57,615 --> 00:20:58,082
Nothing.

249
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:03,082
I've got him.

250
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:12,048
Impossible!

251
00:21:12,082 --> 00:21:14,115
He sliced through all of them.

252
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:20,682
-A miracle only
happens once, huh?

253
00:21:20,715 --> 00:21:22,482
So, what do you call this?

254
00:21:37,648 --> 00:21:39,615
-I see.

255
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:41,615
By focusing all
the fighting power

256
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,848
of the bankai in
that small blade.

257
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:46,482
That bankai gives
you incredible power.

258
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,482
Its size combined
with its intensity

259
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:52,248
allow you to fight at
unimaginable speeds.

260
00:21:52,282 --> 00:21:55,182
Even I have to admit that
the true power of your bankai

261
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:56,015
is impressive.

262
00:22:02,115 --> 00:22:04,515
Very well, then.

263
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:08,315
There's nothing left for
me to do, but to completely

264
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:09,615
crush that power!

265
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:23,870
[theme music]

266

ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Did
you see that, Byakuya?

267
00:22:57,017 --> 00:22:57,750
This is my--

268
00:22:57,783 --> 00:22:58,883
GANJU (OFFSCREEN): Banzai!

269
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:00,217
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): No,
Ganju, it's his mankai.

270
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,050
-Oh, sorry.

271
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,150
You sure it's not his genkai?

272
00:23:02,183 --> 00:23:02,983
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): It's Bankai!

273
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:03,917
-Yeah, right.

274
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,617
Don't get your
genkai in a twist.

275
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,550
ORIHIME (OFFSCREEN): You
can't twist a genkai.

276
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,983
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, is that so?

277
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:10,683
GANJU (OFFSCREEN):
It's manzai now.
