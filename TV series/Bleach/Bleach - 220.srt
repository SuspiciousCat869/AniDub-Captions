1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,300
-I'm Ichigo Kurosaki.

2
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,633
And other than having the
ability to see spirits,

3
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,566
I used to be an ordinary
high school student.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,500
But the day I met
Rukia Kuchiki, I

5
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,200
was given the powers
of the soul reaper

6
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:16,266
in order to protect the
world of the living.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,666
As I began my work as a
substitute soul reaper,

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,133
I found myself thrown into
a never ending battle.

9
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,833
In the midst of everything,
my best friend Odi Hemayinoui

10
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:27,000
was abducted by ex-soul
reaper Captain Sosuke Aizen.

11
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,733
My friends Chad and
Udi are joining me

12
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:30,566
as I race to rescue Odi Hemay.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,966
Once we arrived in Waco
Mundo, we entered a fight

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
with powerful enemies
known as Arankars.

15
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,833
We were too late to
keep Aizen from entering

16
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,166
the world of the living.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,800
But luckily the 13 Court Guard
squads were already there

18
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:44,566
to stop it, and all that
war was about to begin.

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,433
[theme music]

20
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:30,958
-In order to prevent Sosuke
Aizen from wiping out

21
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:33,758
Karakura Town, the soul
reapers evacuated the residents

22
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,625
using tenkaicatch, and
relocated the entire town

23
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:37,858
to the Rukon District.

24
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:41,191
Ikkaku Madarame, Izuru
Kira, Yumichika Ayasegawa

25
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:44,258
and Shuhei Hisagi were assigned
to defend the four sinkaymon

26
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,458
pillars that masked the
appearance of the town.

27
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:48,025
They found themselves
facing a force

28
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:50,458
of Fraccions sent by Baraggan.

29
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:53,025
The battle between Charlotte
Coolhorn and Yumichika

30
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:55,425
escalated into a
confrontation over beauty.

31
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,558
Yumichika won by
unveiling ruidiro kujako,

32
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:00,591
his Zanpakuto's true form.

33
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,591
Izuru also emerged victorious
by entrusting his Zanpakuto,

34
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:08,225
wabiske, with the squad's
philosophy of despair.

35
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:10,491
Shuhei Hisagi fought
against Findorr Calius

36
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,258
who boasted that
he could control

37
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,658
the level of his strength.

38
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:16,691
Shuhei used his
Zanpakuto, kazashini,

39
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:19,558
and proved to Findorr that a
man who did not fear his sword

40
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,191
had no right to hold one.

41
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:23,525
The last battle was
between Ikkaku Madarame

42
00:03:23,558 --> 00:03:27,025
and the Fraccion named Poww--
this fight didn't go as well.

How are you going to be able
to win against an opponent who

56
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,958
defeated Ikkaku?

Uh, let me go!

I'll have to go through you!

Calm yourself down.

for a 5th seat.

still has to control himself.

Ah!

174
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,258
What the hell is that?

00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:27,758
-Uh!

177
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,758
Is that even the same creature?

[groan]

179
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:38,525
-I should smash
you all to pieces,

180
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:41,491
but at the moment
it's too much trouble.

shown your true form.

183
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:50,858
Well, the bigger they
are, the harder they fall.

184
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:51,658
Wha?

185
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,691
Ugh, hey!

186
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,391
What did you grab me for?

187
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:55,891
I was about to take him down!

188
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:57,025
-Shut your mouth.

189
00:09:57,058 --> 00:09:58,858
You are no match
for an adversary who

190
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,625
was able to send the captain
flying with a single punch.

191
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:03,125
-Huh?

192
00:10:03,158 --> 00:10:05,825
Wait a minute, when did you
turn into such a little coward?

193
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:09,725
-I'm not even going to
dignify that with an answer.

194
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:14,225
-I feel heavy, and so weary.

195
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:18,825
But it doesn't matter.

196
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:21,325
It can't be helped.

197
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:23,658
It's Lord Baraggan's orders.

00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,625
He's worse now than before.

203
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:41,725
-No kidding.

204
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:44,025
If he'd hit us, we would
have been done for.

-Uh?

209
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,258
-No way.

210
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,158
I want to fight this guy.

211
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:55,391
If you're going to run
away, do it on your own.

00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:56,525
I'm not leaving here!

-Have you lost your mind?

214
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:00,325
How are you going to fight a
guy you couldn't handle when you

215
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:02,258
went up against
him the first time?

216
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,791
Or has he been right?

217
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:05,658
Did he have you
pegged all along?

218
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:10,091
Do you have some secret
power you've been hiding?

219
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,725
-Course not.

220
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,125
There's nothing hidden.

221
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:15,658
-Then shut up and
let's get out of here!

222
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:16,358

Those little insects.

-Let go of me!

231
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,658
We'll never outrun
him like this!

00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:37,625

Stand behind me while
we end this fight.

for you, pesky insect.

That had no effect.

251
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,787
But I will say this
much, I was surprised

252
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,120
at the extent of your strength.

253
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:03,387
I never imagined
a maggot like you

254
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,887
could throw me, a

-What?

00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:16,954
-Watch very closely, Ikkaku.

261
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:18,987
You're going to bear
personal witness

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,620
to what our captain
is all about.

263
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:28,354
-You lowly maggots have the
audacity to stand right there

264
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,287
and defy Lord Barragon?

265
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,387
It's so unbelievable, it
just makes me want to yawn.

00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:45,487

00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:49,520
-Yaaaa!

341
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:52,254
No mercy!

342
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:53,954
-It's for the best.

343
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:55,454
-I don't think it
matters whether it

344
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:58,287
was the real or the replica
town that was destroyed.

345
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,920
Squad 7's going to be
in the red for the rest

346
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,654
of the fiscal year.

347
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:05,087
-The captain won't let the
squad shoulder the bill.

348
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,354
He'll pay out of his own
pocket for any damages that

349
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,787
may have been caused
during the operation.

350
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,220
That's the kind of leader
Captain Komamura is.

351
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:13,954
-Is that for real?

352
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:14,954
All right!

353
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:16,820
Then I'm not going
to worry anymore.

354
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:17,620
Yeah!

355
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:19,354
-That doesn't apply to you.

356
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:21,454
Anything you break will
be immediately deducted

357
00:18:21,487 --> 00:18:23,187
from your salary, no arguments.

358
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,187
-Oh, you tightwad.

359
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,654
Oh, and there were
so many things

360
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:29,620
I was hoping to buy this month.

361
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:31,036
-Just get over it.

362
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:35,738
-Ah, ah, boy.

363
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:38,005
I'm thinking it's a good
thing we didn't get over there

364
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:40,157
in time.

365
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:40,623
-Yeah.

366
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,957
[whoosh]

367
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,923
[boom]

368
00:18:53,423 --> 00:19:02,723
[whoosh]

369
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:07,657
-Amazing.

370
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,457
-See what I meant?

371
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,690
His Bankai and yours are as
different as night and day,

372
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:13,657
Ikkaku.

373
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,023
[gasps]

374
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:17,023
-But--

375
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:18,457
-You didn't think
we knew about it?

376
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,323
You're an idiot.

377
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,623
Relax, I'm not going to
tell your captain anything.

378
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:31,690
But I want you to give it
some hard thought, Ikkaku.

379
00:19:31,723 --> 00:19:33,157
You were the only
one of the four

380
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,923
who allowed his pillar
to be destroyed.

381
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,857
Your job was simply
to protect it.

382
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,457
Do you know why you failed?

383
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,123
Because you attempted to keep
your strength camouflaged!

384
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:47,390
It's your prerogative
to die while keeping

385
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:50,823
your strength hidden,
but never, never

386
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,323
at the cost of
failing your mission.

387
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,323
You can't put your
selfish pride ahead

388
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:57,557
of achieving your
squad's objectives.

389
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,990
As long as you're a member
of the 13 Court Guard Squads,

390
00:20:01,023 --> 00:20:03,557
your orders will
take priority-- even

391
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,390
if it means suppressing
your individual vanity!

392
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:08,290
You will never be
an effective leader

393
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:09,890
unless you're willing
to accept that.

394
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:17,023
-Tetsuzaemon, I do understand
that, but there's one--

395
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:17,523
[bam]

396
00:20:17,557 --> 00:20:19,390
Gah!

397
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:22,457
-What do you
understand, you moron?

398
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,590
You're acting like some
kind of spoiled brat.

399
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:28,557
You're convinced that
if you were to die,

400
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,190
someone would automatically
take your place.

401
00:20:31,223 --> 00:20:33,357
So you fight as if the
consequences don't really

402
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:33,990
matter.

403
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,390
-Hold on a minute.

404
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:37,023
You can't get away
with that statement.

405
00:20:37,057 --> 00:20:39,957
Who says I fight like the
consequences don't matter?

406
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,257
-You mean you deny it?

407
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,390
You think I'm wrong?

408
00:20:42,423 --> 00:20:45,357
-Damn you.

409
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,957
You bastard!

410
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,723
[whack]

411
00:20:49,757 --> 00:20:52,390
-Why did you charge him
head-on when you were injured?

412
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:53,990
Can you explain that?

413
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:54,457
[grunts]

414
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:54,957
[boom]

415
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,790
-Ugh.

416
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:59,857
-Charging him head-on would
have meant nothing, especially

417
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,623
if you ended up getting crushed.

418
00:21:01,657 --> 00:21:03,223
Do whatever it
takes to win, even

419
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:05,923
if it means running away
from or outfoxing the enemy.

420
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:07,623
-I can't do that.

421
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,523
I can't carry out
such a cowardly fight.

422
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:11,423
-Then you'd better find
a way to get stronger!

423
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,757
If you insist on having
things on your terms,

424
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,890
you'd better put
on some strength.

425
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:21,157
When you fight an
enemy you have to win,

426
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,123
even if you die in the process.

427
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,290
That's what it means to
stay true to yourself.

428
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:32,623
-Hm.

429
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:36,423
-Uh, uh, captain.

430
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:38,723
-Calm down, both of you.

431
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:41,790
Unfortunately, I seem to be a
little hard of hearing today.

432
00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:07,423
-Coolhorn, Aberama, Findorr,
Poww-- useless fools!

433
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:09,923
[crunch]

434
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:18,890
[theme music]

435
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,892
-How'd I look back there when
I was pricking my ears up,

436
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,192
Tetsuzaemon?

437
00:23:49,225 --> 00:23:50,992
-I think you made a great
impression on the audience.

438
00:23:51,025 --> 00:23:52,992
Fans from all over the
country sent in gifts.

439
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:57,192
But I got to tell you, they were
mostly doggy toys and biscuits.

440
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:58,959
-That's perfect.

441
00:23:58,992 --> 00:24:00,459
-Captain?
