3
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:53,103
NARRATOR: Ichigo's mission
to Hueco Mundo continues.

4
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:55,936
He has now defeated Grimmjow,
and successfully rescued

5
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:57,169
Orihime.

6
00:01:57,203 --> 00:02:00,169
The fight against Sosuke
Aizen and the Espada goes on.

7
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,836
But we will pick up that
narrative at another time.

8
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,969
For now, let us
turn our attention

9
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:09,069
to the Soul Society, where a
totally new storyline unfolds.

10
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:12,336
The curtain is about to rise
on a battle unlike anything

11
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:14,336
our heroes have
ever seen before.

12
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:18,503
-Wow!

13
00:02:18,536 --> 00:02:19,936
Have you heard the latest news?

14
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:21,303
They're bringing
in a new captain

15
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:23,803
to take over command
of Squad Three.

16
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:25,836
-Yes, of course
I've heard about it.

17
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:27,903
As a captain, I've
been notified.

18
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:31,336
It will be made official
at the meeting tomorrow.

19
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:33,236
-It must be Izuru Kira.

20
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:34,703
That's very strange though.

21
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:37,636
I wonder when he found
the time to master Bankai.

22
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:40,069
-Izuru received
no such promotion.

23
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:41,569
-No.

24
00:02:41,603 --> 00:02:43,003
You've got to be kidding.

25
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:44,936
-Stop making such a mess.

26
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,603
I'm not kidding, and
frankly, I haven't

27
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:48,569
been briefed on
any of the details.

28
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,536
-Is that right?

29
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:53,003
The truth is, I never
thought Kira was good captain

30
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:54,136
material anyway.

31
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:55,436
Squad Three's pretty tough.

32
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:57,669
You think the new captain
will be able to take charge?

33
00:02:57,703 --> 00:02:59,336
-We'll find out
tomorrow, Rangiku.

34
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:01,769
Now forget about this
and get back to work.

35
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:03,036
-You don't have to be so rude.

36
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:03,869
I'm just curious.

37
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:10,936
-Yesterday an expedition
returned safely

38
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:12,503
to the Soul Society.

39
00:03:12,536 --> 00:03:14,669
Their long-term
assignment has been

40
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:18,736
completed without suffering
a single casualty.

41
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:21,469
This is a truly
great accomplishment.

42
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:24,203
As you all know, Squads
Three, Five, and Nine

43
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:27,836
of the 13 Court Guard Squads
are presently without captains.

44
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:30,603
Therefore two other
captains and myself

45
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:32,836
summon the expedition
units leader,

46
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:35,003
and tested his qualifications.

47
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:37,403
The purpose of our
examination was

48
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:40,903
to determine his ability to
fill one of the three posts

49
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:41,903
currently available.

50
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:47,969
I am pleased to say our
decision was unanimous.

51
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:50,269
And so, at this
time, I would like

52
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:51,936
to introduce you
to the man who will

53
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:55,636
be taking over the position
formally held by Gin Ichimaru.

54
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:00,136
The new captain of Squad
Three, Shusuke Amagai.

55
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:10,503
-So this character,
Shusuke Amagai,

56
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:11,769
know anything about him?

57
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:14,369
-Nope.

58
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:16,936
-I don't like the idea of some
newbiw coming along and being

59
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:18,703
put in charge of the squad.

60
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:21,336
-I hear that he's been away
on a long assignment, working

61
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:22,903
on suppressing Hollows.

62
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:24,836
-That doesn't mean
anything to me.

63
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:27,169
The problem is, some guy
I've never even heard of

64
00:04:27,203 --> 00:04:28,836
has just become my captain.

65
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,903
How am I supposed to
follow his orders?

66
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:32,669
-Yeah, I know what you mean.

67
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:35,003
But lieutenant Kira
isn't much better.

68
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:36,136
-Right.

69
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:37,203
-Good morning, everybody.

70
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:42,569
A new captain, huh?

71
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:45,436
I sure hope he turns
out to be nice.

72
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:46,869
-It's looking so good.

73
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:56,069
-Huh?

74
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:00,203
Interesting.

75
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:02,803
He carries two Zanpakuto.

76
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:03,903
-Hm.

77
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,403
He's got some style,
I'll give him that.

78
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:27,069
-I'm Shusuke Amagai.

79
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:29,703
As you're probably aware,
I'm new to this position.

80
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:31,236
I look forward to
working with you,

81
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:34,803
and I'll do the best I can.

82
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,636
-First of all,
welcome to the team.

83
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,136
There's a lot of protocol
involved with being a captain,

84
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,669
and it's hard to get used to.

85
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:43,803
So feel free to ask
my advice at any time.

86
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:44,769
-Thanks.

87
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:48,336
I just hope I don't
become a bother.

88
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:50,136
-Who else oversaw
his examination

89
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:52,803
with Head Captain Yamamoto?

90
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:53,503
-Beats me.

91
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:54,769
Does it really matter?

92
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:57,269
The bottom line is, we
have one less open position

93
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:58,103
in the squad.

94
00:05:58,136 --> 00:05:59,803
We should count our blessings.

95
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:01,869
-Well, I suppose you're
right about that.

96
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,669
-So there's a body in place.

97
00:06:03,703 --> 00:06:05,536
But it doesn't mean
he can do the job.

98
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:07,903
Now he has to prove to
us that he's any good.

99
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:18,403
-We finally filled
one of the openings.

100
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:22,103
-It's progress, but we still
have two spots remaining.

101
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:24,669
And that represents
quite a problem.

102
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:28,536
In any world, including our
own, an empty leader's seat

103
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:31,903
only invites discord and
negative opportunities.

104
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:34,803
When evil tries to
expand its influence,

105
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:38,603
such squads are most vulnerable,
and provide the easiest entry

106
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:40,003
point to mount an attack.

107
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:47,369
-That must be him.

108
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:48,436
Not too impressive.

109
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:56,269
-Good morning.

110
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:59,069
Which one of you
is the Lieutenant.

111
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:00,203
-That would be me, sir.

112
00:07:00,236 --> 00:07:02,603
I'm Lieutenant Izuru Kira.

113
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,803
-My name is Shusuke Amagai.

114
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:06,203
I'm here from headquarters.

115
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:08,469
I'm the newly appointed
Captain of Squad Three.

116
00:07:08,503 --> 00:07:09,869
Pleased to meet you.

117
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:11,303
-Pleased to meet
you as well, sir.

118
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:12,203
Welcome to the squad.

119
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,569
-Allow me to introduce you.

120
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,136
This is my associate,
Makoto Kibune.

121
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:22,969
Along with me, he'll also
be joining the squad today.

122
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:25,403
He was part of my
expeditionary patrol unit,

123
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:26,769
and is very skilled.

124
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:29,136
That's why I wanted
to bring him along.

125
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,803
He will be our new third seat.

126
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:32,803
-Thank you, sir.

127
00:07:32,836 --> 00:07:34,503
I do appreciate your confidence.

128
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:36,369
-That guy doesn't
look like much.

129
00:07:36,403 --> 00:07:37,803
Are you sure he's
the new captain?

130
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:40,403
-Well, if not, he's
in big trouble.

131
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:42,436
He's wearing a captain's coat.

132
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:43,769
-Oh yeah.

133
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:45,036
-Is there a problem?

134
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,936
-Well, to be frank, I mean--

135
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,103
-He's trying to say,
that up until yesterday,

136
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,936
we were doing fine
without a captain.

137
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:53,469
-Quiet.

138
00:07:53,503 --> 00:07:56,769
-Hey, believe me, I
understand how you feel.

139
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:57,936
-What?

140
00:07:57,969 --> 00:07:59,603
-After all, you've
just had some guy

141
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:02,469
you've never seen before
suddenly show up out of nowhere

142
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:05,436
and say, hi, I'm
your new Captain.

143
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:06,736
I don't blame you in the least.

144
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,369
I'd be annoyed if I
were in your shoes.

145
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:13,669
But let me tell you something,
and I really mean this.

146
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:18,136
My primary duty as Captain is to
protect my men, no matter what.

147
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,069
That's what being a
captain's all about.

148
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:30,869
-What's the problem?

149
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:32,336
For all you know, this
guy might turn out

150
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:34,169
to be really good Captain.

151
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:35,969
-Well, that's true.

152
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:40,669
In theory, but, the
Squad's got a bad attitude.

153
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,503
And no one trusts the
guy enough to give him

154
00:08:42,536 --> 00:08:45,003
a chance to prove himself.

155
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:45,936
It's miserable.

156
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:47,303
When I think about
going in there

157
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:48,869
and having to face
that resistance,

158
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,469
day after day, I get sick.

159
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:52,236
-Geez.

160
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:53,569
What kind of wimp are you.

161
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:56,036
It's no different than having
a transfer student arrive

162
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,403
at school.

163
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,969
You just have to let the class
show the new guy the ropes.

164
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:00,736
-Yeah, but what if
that doesn't work?

165
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:01,703
Do you see the problem?

166
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:04,503
Then I'm the one
stuck in the middle.

167
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:05,636
-OK, OK.

168
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:07,803
I can see this is making
you nervous and uptight.

169
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:13,036
Well I know just what
will do the trick.

170
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:15,069
Voila!

171
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:17,436
Good old sake.

172
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:20,869
Drink up and forget all
about your troubles.

173
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:22,003
-No way.

174
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:23,836
I can't be drinking in
the middle of the day.

175
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:25,136
-Oh come on.

176
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,769
It's tastier because
you're drinking it

177
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:28,303
in the middle of the day.

178
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:29,236
Hey, that's it!

179
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,603
Throw a party for
the whole squad,

180
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,336
and have the Captain
as the guest honor.

181
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:33,769
Once they've got
some sake in them,

182
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:36,069
they'll be buddies in no time.

183
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:38,836
-Oh, it's as simple
as that, huh?

184
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,636
-Come on, give it a shot.

185
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,136
I mean, what have
you got to lose?

186
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:42,736
-Well, well.

187
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:48,169
So you've been hiding sake
in my quarters, have you?

188
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:49,136
-Captain.

189
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:51,636
I can explain.

190
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:54,636
It's Izuru's fault!

191
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,003
-Rangiku!

192
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:56,503
-Ah!

193
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:08,836
-What's happening?

194
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:11,036
-We decided to throw a
welcome party for you

195
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,003
and Third Seat Kibune, sir.

196
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:13,703
-Huh?

197
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:15,303
You did all this for us?

198
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:16,469
What a nice surprise!

199
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:17,369
Thank you, everybody.

200
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,136
-I've been told this is
one of the very best ways

201
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:27,969
to establish an
atmosphere of camaraderie.

202
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,903
Here you go, Captain.

203
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:32,203
I'll pour for you.

204
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:34,836
-Well, you don't have to.

205
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:36,403
-Sorry, is something the matter?

206
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,736
-No.

207
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:45,236
Thanks.

208
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,736
Oh, that seems like a lot.

209
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:47,569
-What?

210
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:48,803
-Uh, don't worry, it's nothing.

211
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:52,669
-Good.

212
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:53,969
Listen up, men.

213
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:56,036
We're now going to
begin the welcome party

214
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,336
for Captain Amagai
and Third Seat Kibune.

215
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:05,103
-Mm.

216
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:10,203
-This is bad.

217
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,103
I've never been to such an
uncomfortable party before.

218
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:15,736
This is the exact opposite of
what was supposed to happen.

219
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:24,603
I know what we need!

220
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:27,203
Let's have a toast to
get everything rolling!

221
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:30,136
Sir, out of respect,
how about you begin!

222
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:31,803
-Well, fine.

223
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:33,469
It's a pleasure to
have met you all.

224
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:37,103
-Wow, Captain.

225
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:38,869
You're quite an
experienced drinker.

226
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:47,336
-To be perfectly
honest, not so much.

227
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:48,803
-Sir, tell me.

228
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:50,336
Are you all right?

229
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,003
-I'm fine!

230
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:54,469
I mean, for you guys to
throw me a party like this,

231
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:55,803
makes me happy.

232
00:11:55,836 --> 00:11:58,769
Really, really, happy.

233
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:02,036
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

234
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,036
-Captain, you sure
you're all right?

235
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:11,169
-Uh huh.

236
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:12,469
-Whoa.

237
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:13,436
-Captain Amagai!

238
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:14,736
-Somebody go check on him.

239
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:15,236
-Captain!

240
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:16,269
Captain!

241
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,036
Say something.

242
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,969
-What's going on?

243
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:21,003
-Actually, the Captain's
kind of a lightweight.

244
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:22,036
He can't hold his liquor.

245
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,869
-Huh?

246
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:24,503
-But it was just one little cup.

247
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,603
-He gets drunk from
sake-flavored pickles.

248
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:28,903
-If he's so sensitive, why
didn't he just turn me down

249
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:31,269
when I offered it?

250
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:33,969
-He probably thought it
would have been bad form.

251
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,469
Under the circumstances,
he must've

252
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:39,236
been worried that it would
be seen as a rude gesture.

253
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:40,369
-Oh.

254
00:12:40,403 --> 00:12:42,703
Someone go get a bucket
of water and a towel.

255
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:45,503
-Yes, sir.

256
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:47,203
-He's passed out cold.

257
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:48,303
What now, Lieutenant?

258
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:49,903
-I guess there's no
point in continuing

259
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,303
to have the party, when the
guest of honor's unconscious.

260
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,969
-Should we start
cleaning up, then?

261
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:55,036
-Hold on a minute.

262
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:56,703
-Since we're set up
anyway, why don't we

263
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:59,536
use this as an opportunity
to get to know everybody?

264
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:02,103
I want to meet the whole
squad, and put names and faces

265
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:03,569
together as quickly as I can.

269
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:25,662
I heard Squad Three
is having a party.

270
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:27,929
-Yes, in the middle of the day.

271
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:31,129
It's a welcome party
for Captain Amagai.

272
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:33,029
-Very smart.

273
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,762
-What makes you think so?

274
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:35,995
-Why wait for the evening?

275
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:37,795
If you start drinking
sake during the day,

276
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:39,295
it's more effective.

277
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:42,329
That's when you can
get really plastered.

278
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:45,562
I wonder if Captain Amagai
is a two-fisted drinker?

279
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:47,462
-Don't ask me.

280
00:13:47,495 --> 00:13:50,029
-Maybe we'll end up being
really good friends.

281
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,195
He seems nice.

282
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:53,929
-Too nice for you.

283
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,829
-You're so mean, Nanao.

284
00:13:55,862 --> 00:13:57,495
Now you've gone and
hurt my feelings.

-Hm.

-Well now what?

289
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:23,929
-We ignore him.

290
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,395
I don't know what's
the big deal.

291
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:28,029
We managed fine until now
with just Lieutenant Kira.

292

Who needs a big
wuss for a captain?

00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:41,862
I was a fool to
listen to Rangiku.

-Ah, Lieutenant Kira.

Everyone in Squad
Three is very close.

-They've been through a lot.

of credit for being

the one who kept the
Squad together and focused

00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,895
-That cannot be helped.

326
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:01,562
I'll ask them to shut down
the restrictive current.

327
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:03,429
You must take command.

328
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,662
-I see your point.

329
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:05,995
Squad Three!

330
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:07,729
We're going to the Precipice
World to destroy the Menos.

331
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:15,829
-It looks like Squad Three
is going into action.

332
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:16,929
-I know.

333
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:20,095
The Seireitei may be
moving toward change.

334
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,962
-What?

335
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:23,829
-Someone from one of
the expedition units

336
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:25,862
has suddenly become a captain.

337
00:16:25,895 --> 00:16:29,095
That has never
happened up til now.

338
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,029
-Yes, you're right.

339
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:31,762
It's very curious.

340
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:33,362
That's why I'm
interested to find out

341
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:34,829
the names of the
other two Captains

342
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:36,862
who examined Shusuke
Amagai, and gave

343
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,329
their blessing to
his appointment.

344
00:16:39,362 --> 00:16:40,395
-I don't who they are.

345
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:42,529
But I can say, with
absolute certainty,

346
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:44,029
there's something
new in the wind.

347
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:45,629
Something we've
never seen before.

348
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:51,495
-We'll enter the
Precipice World as one,

349
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:54,162
then split off into groups of
four to confront the enemy.

350
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,329
These are Menos, so be careful.

351
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:57,662
-Charge!

352
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:58,662
[music playing]

353
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:09,562
-They're coming!

354
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,562
[music playing]

355
00:17:15,562 --> 00:17:17,495
-All troops spread out,
and move into position!

356
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:23,962
Raise your head, Wabisuke!

357
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:24,962
[yelling and fighting]

358
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:48,795
-Five of the thirteen
Menos have been destroyed.

359
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:50,762
There are only eight remaining.

360
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:55,429
-Good.

361
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:56,129
Hang in there, men.

362
00:17:56,162 --> 00:17:57,562
Just a few more to go.

363
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:58,062
-Yes sir!

364
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:02,662
-Now what?

365
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:12,962
-Oh no, the restrictive
current's released!

366
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:14,062
But why?

367
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:15,195
It was supposed to
have been quarantined.

368
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:20,329
-The restrictive current.

369
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:21,062
-What do you mean?

370
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:23,362
That's impossible!

371
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,329
[rumbling]

372
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:31,195
-The restrictive current
cleaners are bearing down.

373
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:32,562
The distance between
them and Squad Three

374
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,129
is 200 yards and closing fast.

375
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,529
-Third Seat Kibune,
what's going on?

376
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:44,895
-I don't know.

377
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:47,329
I'm certain my request to shut
down the restrictive current

378
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:48,729
was received.

379
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:49,229
-Fall back!

380
00:19:04,829 --> 00:19:06,929
-I'll bring up the rear,
and try to distract them.

381
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:09,795
Get everyone out of here.

382
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:11,362
-Thank you, Third Seat Kibune.

383
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:11,895
Let's go.

384
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:21,329
Don't look back!

385
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:21,962
-It's too late!

386
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,729
We won't make it.

387
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:25,395
-Coming through.

388
00:19:33,229 --> 00:19:35,695
[gasps]

389
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,562
-Captain Amagai, no!

390
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:38,462
-Stay back, everyone.

391
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:49,529
-Is he nuts?

392
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:53,129
-I thought I made it clear when
I spoke to you earlier today.

393
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:58,062
As long as I'm your
Captain, I will protect you.

394
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:01,562
-Please pay close
attention, everyone.

395
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:03,695
You're seeing Captain
Amagai's true strength.

396
00:20:09,895 --> 00:20:10,862
[yelling]

397

[gasps]

398
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:37,729
-Makoto.

399
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:39,462
Are you certain you
requested a shut down

400
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:40,762
of the restrictive current?

401
00:20:40,795 --> 00:20:42,395
-Yes, sir.

402
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:44,262
-I can't believe the
Department of Research

403
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:47,295
and Development would
make such a grave error.

404
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,829
Something's strange about this.

405
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:53,562
Once we're home,
we'll investigate.

406
00:20:53,595 --> 00:20:57,129
Was anybody badly hurt
during the battle?

407
00:20:57,162 --> 00:20:58,795
-No, Captain.

408
00:20:58,829 --> 00:20:59,762
-Good.

409
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:00,262
Lieutenant.

410
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:02,329
-Sir.

411
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,095
-You did very good work, today.

412
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,562
Just what I'd
expect from someone

413
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:07,429
who's been able to
keep his squad together

414
00:21:07,462 --> 00:21:08,362
without a Captain.

415
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:10,462
-Just doing my job.

416
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:13,829
-Well I'm glad
everyone's all right.

417
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:14,629
Let's go back.

418
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:21,229
-That guy's something
else, isn't he?

419
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:22,695
-Yeah, no kidding.

420
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:28,995
[murmurs]

421
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:30,462
-Captain Amagai!

422
00:21:30,495 --> 00:21:33,395
-Somebody do something.

423
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:34,295
-It's amazing.

424
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:41,862
He saved us all, but he
was drunk the entire time.

425
00:21:48,162 --> 00:21:50,529
-I could use some
assistance here.

426
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:51,562
-Oh, of course.

427
00:21:57,062 --> 00:22:01,162
We should get back to the base,
before the captain wakes up.

428
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,662
-Right.

429
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:03,662
[music playing]

[theme music]

431
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:49,414
-Why did you order the
Third Squad to take action?

432
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:51,647
-It was a good
opportunity for the men

433
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,014
to see the new
Captain's abilities.

434
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:55,847
-According to my
report, Squad Three

435
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,080
was in the middle of a party.

436
00:23:57,114 --> 00:23:58,814
You sent him out
while he was drunk.

437
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:02,347
-But he took care of
business, didn't he?
