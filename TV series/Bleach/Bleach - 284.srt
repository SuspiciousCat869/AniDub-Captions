Not yet.

I'm done with you.

Based on your performance..
It appears you're not strong
enough to fight for me.

18

I...
don't understand...

19
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:42,158
Isn't it obvious? Even if
I forced more of you to
sacrifice yourselves,

20
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:44,358
in the end it would
achieve nothing.

21
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,958
...So I'm cutting my losses.

Don't worry,
though...

32
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:56,331
I'll absorb your consciousness
as well.

33
00:04:56,431 --> 00:05:01,871
And in doing so, I'll become
an even greater Adjuchas.

34
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:04,471
Huh?

35
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,705
Hm?

Who's there?!

37
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,905
Who are you?

38
00:05:17,805 --> 00:05:22,105
I don't know what you're doing,
but you have no business here.

39
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:24,271
I think I'll
devour you first!

A female Hollow!
Her Spirit Energy
is so different!

43
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:49,271
[Apache]
It easily surpasses an Adjucha!
Could she be a Vasto Lorde?

44
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:54,171
<i>I can't even move.</i>

45
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:59,305
I suppose getting devoured by
her will be better than by
some disgusting male Adjucha.

46
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:01,911
Come with me.

47
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:04,678
Excuse me?
What did you
just say?

48
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:07,211
I'm telling you
to come with me.

49

Welcome back,

Right.

00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:27,811
Well, now.
Who's this?

52
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:32,045
A new comrade.

53
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:35,111
What? Me? A comrade?

54
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:37,078
That's right.

55
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,178
What's the
meaning of this?!

56
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:41,978
You may have saved
me, but I never
asked for your help!

57
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:46,145
And I'm not some eager slave
who's going to just join up
with you out of gratitude!

58
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:50,178
Wow, you sure have an
attitude, for someone
who just got rescued.

59
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:51,345
What did you
just say?

60
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,178
All right.
Enough
already!

61
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:59,145
Listening to you two carrying
on, I can see you're both about
as cocky as you are insolent.

62
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:00,945
WHAT?!

63
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,018
And just where do
you get off, looking
down on us, Missy?

64
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:05,651
I can't help it if you're
vertically challenged.

65
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,985
Bitch!

[in unison]
Yes, ma'am.

68
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:16,651
Sorry about that. And what
is your name, if I may ask?

69
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:20,018
Apache.

70
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:23,618
I have no ulterior motive
for bringing you here.

71
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:27,185
We females are easy
prey for the males.

72
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:32,085
<i>I brought you here because</i>
<i>I thought it would be safer</i>
<i>for all of us if we watched</i>
<i>out for one another,</i>

73
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,051
rather than facing this
world's dangers alone.

74

There's no need to
chase after him.

Uh?

00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:53,985
Yes, ma'am.

As you wish.

78
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,185
I'll tell you this,
though. If he comes
back and tries to
attack us again,

79
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:01,858
I'm gonna bite
off that thing
between his legs!

Listen to you!
Your mouth is even
dirtier than your face!

Oh, really?!
As a matter of
fact, I have a
very clean face!

Can't sleep?

Oh! No, it's just that...
Tell me something.

87
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:29,991
Why don't you ever
kill or devour the
guys who attack you?

So why don't you do it, as well?

91
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:53,758
I don't want to become stronger
through the power I would gain
by sacrificing another being.

92
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:59,925
If I can't win by myself..
..then I'll have to rely

Why do you keep making
me repeat myself?

It is annoying to
have you operating
so independently

And the other?

116

You would have to vanish to a
place that is clear of my view.

117
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:53,971
The problem for you,
unfortunately, is that no
corner of Las Nochas exists,

Halibel, do you
understand?

You have no choice but
to become subservient

Don't touch me.

[chuckle] How bold of you.
You will regret that
decision, I assure you.

127
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:39,545
My goodness.. There
are a lot of powerful
looking Hollows

Hm?

129
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:48,378
You seem distracted, sir.
Did you discover something
interesting, something we
should all be aware of?

130
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:51,611
Not really. It's nothing
of much importance.

You've been doing
pretty well lately.

138

That's true. Although, back
when we had to face Barragan,

Rumors?

Yes. Something about his
legions of incredibly
powerful soldiers, many of
them having cracked masks.

00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:55,662
Really? I wonder
what that means?

Who cares? We and Master Halibel

00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:38,769
So there you are!
It's been a long
time hasn't it?

154
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:40,535
You...!

155
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:47,769
That's right,
you remember me
now, don't you?

156
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,435
You made me look
like quite the fool.

157
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,302
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>what I'm seeing!</i>

158
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:02,335
<i>That guy's Spirit Energy</i>
<i>is more powerful than any</i>
<i>Adjucha I've encountered!</i>

159
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:05,909
<i>In fact, it may be</i>
<i>stronger than a Vasto</i>
<i>Lorde like Master Halibel!</i>

160
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,542
Damn it!

161
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:09,742
I thought you'd be surprised!

162
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:12,575
It's taken a while
to get my revenge!

163
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:18,742
[Unison]
Master Halibel!

164
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:26,842
You don't have to worry. I don't
plan to devour you three...

165
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,842
Instead, I think I'll
just destroy you!

166
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,609
You still want to fight? You're
not very smart, are you?

167
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:42,409
Master Halibel!

168
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:45,275
Get out of
here quickly.

169
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,275
But--

170
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,542
Do it, now!

171
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:48,475
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:53,242
<i>You've figured out</i>
<i>how much stronger I</i>
<i>am, haven't you?</i>

173
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,309
It doesn't
matter...

174
00:14:57,142 --> 00:15:00,809
<i>I'm only interested in</i>
<i>killing you! I don't care</i>
<i>about those small-fries.</i>

175
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:06,682
I can't believe
we're just leaving
her like that!

176
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:10,715
We have no choice!
She gave strict
orders, or didn't
you hear?

177
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:13,849
She knows what she's
doing. We're not strong
enough to defeat him.

178
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,649
[gasping]

179
00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:36,482
Lord Barragan said
you'd regret it!

180
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,149
Big changes are coming
to Hueco Mundo!

181
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:42,582
I'll prove myself
by eliminating
nuisances like you!

182
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:46,349
Once Lord Barragan sees
how effective I've
become as a warrior..

183
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:48,815
He'll be happy to make
me part of his inner circle!

184
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:52,682
Now die!

185
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:54,249
Yeargh!

186
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,315
Sun-Sun! Apache! Mila Rose!

187
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:04,855
How dare you interfere!

188
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:09,822
We would do anything, even
sacrifice ourselves to
protect Master Halibel!

189
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:14,155
You want her?
You'll have to get
through us, first!

190
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:16,489
Look at the rookie
taking charge.

191
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:18,622
She may be a
little cocky...

192
00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:19,655
...But I'm
with her.

193
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:21,489
Same here.

194
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:23,655
No, don't do this.

195
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:27,589
[battle cries]
Yeeaahh!

196
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:50,322
(Ominous growl as he stands up)

197
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:55,389
I don't want to become stronger
through the power I would gain
by sacrificing another being.

198
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:59,855
It's my fault this has happened.

199
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:13,462
I promise you, your sacrifices
will not go to waste!

200
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:16,629
So, you think you
still have a chance?

201
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:18,595
Huh?

202
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:19,629
Huahh!

203
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:22,695
What the hell...?!

204
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,362
This ends here!

205
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,295
Heh! You'll have to
do better than that!

206
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:53,162
I've got a surprise for
you; your sword cannot
penetrate my Hierro!

207
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:00,462
Aaahhh...

208
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:01,462
Grrh!

209
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:15,369
Now get up. I'm not
done with you yet.

210
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:19,369
I was gonna be quick,
But now I think I'll
stretch this out!

211
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:43,535
Now die!

212
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:48,735
[gasp]

213
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:54,169
[stunned grunts]

214
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:58,169
My mistake. I should have
considered what you might do
with all this extra power.

215
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:05,675
Why.. are you doing..
this.. Aizen...?

216
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:08,975
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>That was quite remarkable...</i>

217
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,209
Through sacrifice, you have now
made the impossible, possible...

218
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,375
I'm sorry about this.

219
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:24,575
I was the one who
gave this Hollow,
Arrancar powers...

220
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:29,042
But it appears
I didn't give
him the brain
to control them.

221
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,675
Who... who are you?

222
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:36,242
<i>If you're desperate to avoid</i>
<i>casualties, then gain power.</i>

223
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:41,175
That control is the
answer to your dilemma,
and if power is what
you want...

224
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:44,009
I'm the person who
can provide it for you.

225
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:46,442
How do you know
that's what I desire?

226
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:51,275
You want to be able to protect
your comrades, don't you?

227
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:55,342
<i>You can only</i>
<i>accomplish that by</i>
<i>becoming stronger</i>
<i>than your enemies.</i>

228
00:19:56,009 --> 00:20:00,075
<i>And the more powerful you</i>
<i>are, the less casualties</i>
<i>you're likely to produce.</i>

229
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:02,009
<i>Doesn't that</i>
<i>sound ideal to you?</i>

230
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:05,849
Care to see what
it looks like?

231
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:11,215
<i>Heh heh.</i>

232
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:17,182
I would really like you
to come with me. I know
where you want to go, and
I shall take you there.

233
00:20:19,282 --> 00:20:20,549
<i>Rest assured...</i>

234
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:25,115
I'll never make you
sacrifice anyone, the
way you did just now.

235
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:38,315
Even if I forced more of you to
sacrifice yourselves, in the end
it would achieve nothing.

236
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:41,282
<i>So I'm cutting my losses.</i>

237
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,982
<i>This isn't what I expected.</i>

238
00:20:45,282 --> 00:20:49,249
I went through a considerable
amount of effort to gather
all of you Espadas.

239
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:53,382
I never expected your
strengths to be
inferior to my own.

240
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:56,315
Aizen...!

241
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:03,015
Your attack is futile.

242
00:21:09,522 --> 00:21:11,222
<i>You can't win this fight.</i>

243
00:21:12,422 --> 00:21:14,555
I am through wasting my time.

244
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:20,955
No world is without sacrifices.
Doesn't he realize this?

245
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:28,089
<i>This sea of blood</i>
<i>covered in ashes.</i>

246
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:32,022
<i>We refer to this</i>
<i>hell as the world.</i>

247
00:21:42,855 --> 00:21:45,355
Now then, are you all ready?

248
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:49,155
Members of the Thirteen
Court Guard Squads,

249
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:51,189
and you failed mock Arrancars,

250
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:49,079
Hmpf! I finally get the
chance to show everyone
what I'm made of!

251
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,413
Don't get too excited, Hiyori!

252
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:54,479
<i>Ichigo hasn't been in a lot of</i>
<i>episodes lately, so he might</i>
<i>take over from here!</i>

253
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:56,713
Good point Shinji!
Don't call him, 'kay?

254
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:00,413
Why would I do that?!
Let's get this plot moving
before he gets here!
