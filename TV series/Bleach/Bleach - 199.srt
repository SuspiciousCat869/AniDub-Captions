00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:51,302
NARRATOR: One by one,
Ichigo and his friends

3
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:53,935
were defeated by Espadas.

4
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:56,802
Genryusai Yamamoto
dispatched several captains

5
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:58,968
of the 13 Guard
Guard Squads to aid

6
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:01,868
in the fight against the
Espadas in Hueco Mundo.

7
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:09,735
Byakuya Kuchiki faced Espada
number seven, Zommari Rureaux.

8
00:02:09,768 --> 00:02:12,202
He arrived just as Zommari
was about to finish off

9
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:14,902
Rukia, who had been knocked
unconscious by Aaroniero.

10
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:19,935
-The reason I'm
killing you is simple.

11
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:24,602
It's because you aimed your
blade at my only pride.

12
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:26,235
Now, this is your fate.

13
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:31,535
-Lord Aizen!

14
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,468
I'm sorry--

15
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:43,902
NARRATOR: Meanwhile,
Mayuri Kurotsuchi

16
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,168
had a tough fight with
Szayelaporro Granz

17
00:02:46,202 --> 00:02:47,368
and his doll.

18
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:50,268
The doll could control
Mayuri's senses.

19
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:51,335
-It's all over.

20
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:58,768
-It can't be.

21
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:01,235
[laughter]

22
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:04,168
-This is so easy,
it's become boring.

23
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:08,335
I thought there would
be more to it than this.

24
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:09,402
-I got you.

25
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,835
-Ah!

26
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:16,102
What's going on?

27
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:18,735
NARRATOR: Mayuri had studied
Szayelaporro's strategy.

28
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:20,435
To protect himself
against the doll,

29
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:23,035
he created replicas of
his internal organs.

30
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:28,702
Furious, Szayelaparro
quickly changed tactics.

31
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:31,902
Using his tentacles, he grabbed
Nemu Kurotsuchi and tell

32
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:32,968
held her as his hostage.

33
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:39,635
-My goodness.

34
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:42,202
Everyone keeps chattering.

35
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:45,668
It's so noisy.

36
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:46,168
Bankai.

37
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:53,668
Now, claw out.

38
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:56,468
[crying]

39
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,502
MAYURI: Konjiki Ashisogi Jizo!

40
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:10,868
-This gas-- some
kind of bacteria?

41
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:21,002
[scream]

42
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,602
-Oh, thank goodness.

43
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:32,002
You're awake.

44
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:33,835
RUKIA: Lieutenant Kotetsu?

45
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:35,368
Hanataro?

46
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:37,468
Why are you here?

47
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,135
-Wait, your treatment
isn't finished.

48
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:41,102
Please lie still.

49
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:42,535
-I'm sorry, but she's right.

50
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:43,568
You can't get up yet.

51
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:53,168
-Byakuya.

52
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:55,135
My brother.

53
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:56,235
-Silence.

54
00:04:56,268 --> 00:04:58,168
Didn't you hear what
Lieutenant Kotetsu said?

55
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,968
Lie still until they're done.

56
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:08,135
-But brother-- your uniform.

57
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:09,202
-It is not important.

58
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:17,235
-You're hurt.

59
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:20,502
-I said it doesn't matter.

60
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:23,568
Right now you must rest until
you are healed completely.

61
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:30,968
You have to prepare yourself for
the real battle the awaits us.

62
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:32,935
[shout]

63
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:47,735
-You're not too bad, you know?

64
00:05:47,768 --> 00:05:49,402
-Heh, heh, heh.

65
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:52,302
-For a pathetic Soul Reaer.

66
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:53,735
-You're pissin' me off.

67
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:56,735
I've about had it with
your trash talking.

68
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:59,902
Stop messing around and fight.

69
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,835
[shouting]

70
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:12,002
-Most people I attack would
try to avoid my blade.

71
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:14,435
-Yeah, but my way
is much more fun.

72
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:17,768
Besides, when I fight, I
expect to get a real battle.

73
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:20,802
And this cut's nothing
but a little scratch.

74
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:21,935
-Heh!

75
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:23,235
We'll see about that.

76
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:35,702
-I'm impressed.

77
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:39,535
That attack was
pretty damn good.

78
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:40,035
Argh!

79
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:08,202
-Guess your brute
strength wasn't enough.

80
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:12,568
-Nothing to do with it.

81
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:14,002
I had you dead to rights.

82
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:16,402
The sand got in the way
of my sword's trajectory.

83
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,468
-Is that so?

84
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:20,835
[shout]

85
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:32,768
-Ichigo!

86
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:36,002
-Orihime-- you gotta help.

87
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:36,502
-Right.

88
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:37,068
Hang on.

89
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:37,968
I'll heal you.

90
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:39,935
-No.

91
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:41,135
Not for me.

92
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,368
Not yet.

93
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:44,435
Heal Nel first.

94
00:07:58,868 --> 00:07:59,635
-All right, Ichigo.

95
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:00,868
I'll heal her right away.

96
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:28,868
-Hm.

97
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:32,768
Ah, yes.

98
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:36,002
I can hear them.

99
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:38,635
It's those two barbarians.

100
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:43,435
They're still tearing
each other apart.

101
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:43,935
Hm?

102
00:08:52,468 --> 00:08:55,768
-Uh-- are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

103
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,502
-As much as I wish I wasn't
seeing it, yeah, I am.

104
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:04,635
It ate him.

105
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,368
-I'm watching it, too.

106
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:08,435
You don't need to gross me out.

107
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:09,268
-RENJI: What?

108
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:10,635
You asked me if I saw it.

109
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:14,068
I was just answering
your dumb question.

110
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:18,668
-Yes, but you don't need
to describe it to me.

111
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:21,568
Hey, Renji, you've been
infected by the poison, too.

112
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,935
-I have?

113
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,002
Wait.

114
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:28,402
Why isn't this stuff
affecting you, too?

115
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,435
-Well, I've been infected
by that poison before.

116
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:34,502
I probably developed antibodies.

117
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:35,502
-No fair.

118
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:36,702
You get a free pass?

119
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,435
Why's it gotta be me?

120
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:39,835
-What's not fair about it?

121
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:42,202
I almost died last time.

122
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:44,302
Well, whatever.

123
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,068
You're going to need
that antidote fast.

124
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:46,568
Hey, Mayuri?

125
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:50,835
-Uryu, no!

126
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:54,968
-You know, you really shouldn't
make assumptions like that.

127
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:58,268
It's only common sense to
alter the formula of a poison

128
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:00,802
after every use.

129
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,635
-You bastard.

130
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,035
-Don't get worked up.

131
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:06,135
It'll only spread the poison.

132
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:07,835
MAYURI: Developed antibodies?

133
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,068
Hmph.

134
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:11,668
Don't you think a professional
would prevent that?

135
00:10:11,702 --> 00:10:12,802
URYU: Forget that.

136
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:15,202
Just give us the
antidote, or we'll--

137
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:16,568
RENJI: What did I just say?

138
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:18,202
You've got to calm down.

139
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:22,135
-Master Mayuri?

140
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:24,335
I beg your pardon, sir?

141
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:26,668
Could you come
over here, please?

142
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:29,402
I just need some help
getting untied from this.

143
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:32,902
-Hey.

144
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:34,468
You heard her, didn't you?

145
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:38,068
Why don't you go help her out?

146
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:40,268
-Talk about irritating.

147
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:40,935
Fine, then.

148
00:10:40,968 --> 00:10:43,368
Here's the antidote.

149
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:44,502
-Hang on.

150
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:45,802
Don't throw it!

151
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:46,568
Hey!

152
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:47,202
No!

153
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:48,168
The bottle broke!

Something strange is occurring.

160
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,317
Hey.

161
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,284
Mayuri.

162
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:22,684
What are you waiting for?

163
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:23,850
Hurry up and untie her!

you killed me?

00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:55,017
-Behold, La Lujuriosa's
most brilliant technique.

171
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,317
Gabriel.

172
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,917
It gives me the
ability to regenerate

173
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,984
using my enemy's own life force.

174
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:07,417
Gabriel invades
my opponent's body

175
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,384
and absorbs her
reishi from within.

176
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:12,884
Or more precisely,
replaces it altogether.

177
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:15,850
You see, I use those cells
to fuel my regeneration.

178
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,417
The reconstruction
process requires every bit

179
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,850
of reishi in my opponent's
body to be overtaken.

180
00:12:27,884 --> 00:12:30,384
Obviously, the
target is killed off.

181
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:36,084
And finally, I am reborn.

182
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:47,684
Now, then, what do you say
we all reintroduce ourselves,

183
00:12:47,717 --> 00:12:48,417
Mayuri Kurotsuchi?

184
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,950
-That guy's an animal!

185
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,117
-Did you get all that,
Mayuri Kurotsuchi?

186
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,617
By constantly
renewing my body, I

187
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,684
will continue to
exist for eternity.

188
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:11,884
It is said that the
Phoenix is immortal.

189
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,350
When it grows too old, it
hurls itself into the fire,

190
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:19,384
and from the flames
it rises again, anew.

191
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,284
Understand now?

192
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,517
That is immortality.

193
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,050
That is perfection.

194
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:28,384
It's not about
transcending death.

195
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:32,550
It's about incorporating
death into the cycle of life.

196
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:36,517
And a being whose existence
cannot be interrupted by death,

197
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,584
someone such as myself, who
thrives in the endless cycle

198
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:45,817
of demise and rebirth, that is
what you would call a perfect

199
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,317
being!

200
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,984
The concept of mortality
does not exist for me.

201
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:56,450
Even if you did
manage to smite me,

202
00:13:56,484 --> 00:14:00,517
I would simply rise again
without a definitive end.

203
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,117
Understand this.

204
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,184
I cannot be killed.

205
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:06,550
Even if you tried
for all eternity,

206
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:09,684
you could not defeat
me, Mayuri Kurotsuchi.

207
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:18,850
-Huh?

208
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:19,684
-Captain Kurotsuchi?

209
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:43,117
[gasping]

210
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:53,184
-M-- Master Mayuri--
I-- I'm so-- sorry.

211
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:59,017
-M-- Master Mayuri--
I-- I'm so-- sorry.

212
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,384
-What's the matter?

213
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,950
Can't stand watching your
dear second in command

214
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:05,184
on the precipice of death?

215
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:08,017
You're a sensitive little
fellow, aren't you?

216
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,317
But no matter.

217
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,817
She doesn't have long now.

218
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,084
This girl, oh, how
can I describe it?

219
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,884
It's as if she's
the empty cocoon

220
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,450
a butterfly has left behind.

221
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,584
-How delightful.

222
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:28,884
Really.

223
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:30,784
Such an amusing little power.

224
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:33,417
It tickles my fancy.

225
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,484
And-- is that all you've got?

226
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:37,984
-What?

227
00:15:40,717 --> 00:15:41,517
-Come on.

228
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,017
You must have something else.

229
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,884
I mean, you called
yourself a perfect being.

230
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,950
Surely you must have
some other power

231
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:49,384
you just forgot to mention.

232
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,517
Yeah?

233
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,650
-What is he doing now?

234
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,484
MAYURI: Oh, don't be so serious.

235
00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:02,550
Telling me won't make
me think less of you.

236
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:03,450
Don't be coy.

237
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:05,684
Go on, show me.

238
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:06,950
Let's see it.

239
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:08,917
[crying]

240
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,784
[laughter]

241
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:24,050
-Did you really think that
behemoth could eat me,

242
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,584
and nothing would happen to it?

243
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,650
When it consumed me, my
cells dissolved into it

244
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:31,217
and took over its
nervous system.

245
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,917
I may not know exactly
how your Zanpakuto works,

246
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,617
but by taking over the
nucleus of its motor controls,

247
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,317
I don't really have to.

248
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,450
Even this Bankai thing
is mine to play with.

249
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:45,084
What rotten luck.

250
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:48,117
Too bad your Bankai takes the
shape of a living creature

251
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,484
that I can control.

252
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:54,850
-Ah!

253
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:01,017
-My, my.

254
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,784
This is a tools that I created.

255
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:07,250
You think it can
defy its master?

256
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:10,017
In the event that it
is used against me,

257
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,084
I designed it to
simply self destruct.

258
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:21,217
Well, I suppose this means you
have no other hidden power.

259
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,750
In that case, why
don't we move along?

260
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:26,750
I'd like to use you as a
test subject for a new drug

261
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:29,150
I've developed.

262
00:17:29,184 --> 00:17:30,917
There's no need to
put up your defenses.

263
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,350
-What's he doing?

264
00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:36,850
-No idea.

265
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:39,284
-The drug I'm testing
is (IN SLOW MOTION)

266
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:43,750
already inside you.

267
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:44,950
-What?

268
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:48,017
His voice-- what the--

269
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,117
MAYURI: Yes.

270
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,584
I placed several drugs
inside Nemu's body,

271
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:54,150
knowing that if
Nemu were devoured,

272
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:56,417
or her body somehow
compromised, they

273
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,284
would be released
into her opponent.

274
00:17:58,317 --> 00:17:59,750
-What drug?

275
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:01,750
What the hell did you give me?

276
00:18:01,784 --> 00:18:03,917
-Well, judging by
the area of her body

277
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,384
through which you just passed,
it looks like this is it.

278
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,084
Relax.

279
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:12,650
This one isn't a poison.

280
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:14,150
Let me see.

281
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:17,350
I suppose you could call
it a superhuman potion.

282
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:21,950
-Superhuman?

283
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:24,550
MAYURI: When two
swordmasters fight,

284
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:27,417
they often describe a sensation
where their blades seem

285
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,784
to freeze in midair, as if
their sense of time slows down.

286
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:34,950
Such phenomena
are known to occur

287
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:38,084
when one's senses are
pushed to their limits.

288
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,417
Well, my drug forces
your consciousness

289
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,017
into that state of
heightened awareness.

290
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,917
In other words, it's a
drug that will allow anyone

291
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,650
to experience the
superhuman limits of ability

292
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:51,350
and sensation.

293
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:52,984
SZAYELAPORRO (VOICEOVER):
What is this?

294
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:55,084
He's speaking so slowly.

295
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:56,650
I can't understand him.

296
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:05,050
-Are you still
following me, Espada?

297
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:08,684
With this drug, a bullet would
look completely motionless,

298
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:10,117
even to a child.

299
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,917
So now in your superhuman
state, a normal person like me

300
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,717
must look bizarre, my movements
exceedingly slow and tedious.

301
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,450
(IN SLOW MOTION)
Slow and tedious.

302
00:19:32,817 --> 00:19:37,050
Now, then, this sword-- does
it appear to have stopped?

303
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:42,717
Voila.

304
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,650
And the amazing thing
about this potion?

305
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,784
The master swordsman's senses
are only heightened the brief

306
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:51,384
instant his blade
crosses his enemy's.

307
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:54,284
But my superhuman potion
amplifies your senses

308
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,784
by a factor of thousands.

309
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:58,617
No, trillions.

310
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,484
The drug's normal dosage is
one drop diluted 250,000 times.

311
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:06,017
But I made your batch special.

312
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,784
Pure and undiluted.

313
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:11,184
With what's coursing
through your veins,

314
00:20:11,217 --> 00:20:15,150
one second will feel
a hundred years.

315
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:17,184
Take this sword, for instance.

316
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,650
As I move it closer to you,
your superhuman alertness

317
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:23,984
makes the movement
appear agonizingly slow.

318
00:20:24,017 --> 00:20:28,084
As if it will take several
centuries to reach you.

319
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:29,850
It's delightful.

320
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:34,417
But, while your senses are
sped up to superhuman levels,

321
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,350
your non-superhuman body
will fall painfully behind.

322
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:43,750
Your body cannot possibly keep
up with the incredible amount

323
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,317
of data your sharpened
senses are sending it.

324
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,617
Even if you manage to
block it with your hand,

325
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,850
it'll be hundreds
of years before you

326
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,417
feel the pain of the
blade piercing your flesh.

327
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,350
In fact, I'm talking to
you in the president,

328
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:05,384
but who knows when my words
will actually reach your mind?

00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:10,350
Well, we're in no
hurry, I suppose.

330
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:12,950
Yes, take your time.

331
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:15,917
Enjoy the everlasting
agony of my sword

332
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,384
slicing through your heart.

333
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:22,517
Savor it, 'til your
blood turns to dust.

334
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,150
For now, I bid you adieu.

335
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,917
You'll be seeing my again,
in about a hundred years.

337
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:19,255
URYU: How did you get
inside her body, anyway?

338
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:20,589
SZAYELAPORRO: Through her pores.

339
00:23:20,622 --> 00:23:22,555
Really, those pores
were way too open.

340
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:25,322
She needs to take
better care of her skin.

341
00:23:25,355 --> 00:23:27,555
MAYURI: Nemu, didn't
I tell you to use

342
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,689
the same cosmetics as me?

343
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:33,222
I'll sew up every
one of your pores.
