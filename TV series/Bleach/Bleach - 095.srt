2
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:40,166
MAN: Security alert.

3
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,833
Disturbance reported in
the West Kugai Sector.

4
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:44,866
Enact precautionary measures
three through eight.

5
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,400
I repeat, disturbance
in West Kugai Sector.

6
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,966
Enact pracautionary orders
three through eight.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,466
ICHIGO: The Bounts who invaded
the Soul Society have already

8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,566
defeated the two court
guard squad lieutenants who

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,266
were sent to apprehend them.

10
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,566
soon they disappeared
into the Rukon District.

11
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,500
My group began
using Kokaku's house

12
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,500
as our base of
operations, and we soon

13
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:07,166
decided to split up and start
searching for the Bounts.

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,833
However, because
of their ability

15
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,233
to hide their
spiritual pressure,

16
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:11,933
they are not easy to find.

17
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,466
Rukia was on her
way to the Seireitei

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,600
to rejoin her squad
when she encountered

19
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:16,933
a female Bount, Yoshi.

20
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,266
The court guard squad captain
sensed their spiritual pressure

21
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,600
and immediately headed
there, but it turned out

22
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:26,466
to have been only a
diversion to cover

23
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,966
the destruction
of the Senzaikyu.

24
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:34,066
Meanwhile, Rukia
was losing to Yoshi.

25
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,933
Just when it appeared she
would surely be killed,

26
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:41,200
her brother Byakuya Kuchiki
arrived to save her.

27
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,033
At the same time,
we received word

28
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:45,400
that Jin Kariya was
hiding out in Kusajishi,

29
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:47,400
the roughest part of
the Rukon District.

30
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,066
We headed there at
once to find out

31
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,500
if the information was accurate.

32
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,200
-So then.

33
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,333
You're Jin Kariya.

34
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:15,833
-I am.

35
00:03:15,866 --> 00:03:19,333
-You seem to think that you
can do whatever you like.

36
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,533
-Huh.

37
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:23,100
Do you seek revenge?

38
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:24,900
-That's not why I'm here.

39
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,000
This isn't just about her.

40
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm sworn to kill the Soul
Society's enemies, who

41
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,033
ever they are.

42
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,600
Why won't you take a stance?

43
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,200
-There's no need.

44
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:48,066
-You can come at me
whenever you want.

45
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,333
-So that's how it is.

46
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:06,366
Well, evidently, the
Bounts have developed

47
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,366
speed equal to the flash step.

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,366
-Aw.

49
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,866
You grazed me.

50
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,533
Now I think I'll go next.

51
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:37,600
I've got you.

52
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:52,933
-I have heard that the
Bounts control puppets,

53
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:57,466
and I gather the thing that I
cannot see here is your puppet.

54
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,133
-Well, that may be.

55
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,700
-In that case, I'll cut your
puppet down along with you.

56
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:54,000
-The Byakuya Kuchiki.

57
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:56,366
Just as great as I had expected.

58
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,633
I'm glad that I encountered you.

59
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,866
-Why?

60
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,400
-Yours is one of the
Soul Society's four

61
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:06,166
great noble clans, and
as head of that family,

62
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,766
you are said to be the
strongest in the clan's history.

63
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,700
It's only natural, don't
you think, that someone

64
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,700
with the level of
skill that I have

65
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:18,033
would want to test himself
against someone like you.

66
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:22,533
I've decided that your
strength is satisfying enough.

67
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:24,000
-So then.

68
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:27,100
What do you intend to do?

69
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,066
-You mean my plan?

70
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,633
Of all the captains of all the
13 Court Guard Squads squads

71
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:36,633
that protect the Soul Society,
you are the most famous.

72
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,500
So, if you are defeated,
the people of the Seireitei

73
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:47,166
will be shocked and demoralized.

74
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,400
-Stop talking nonsense.

75
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:51,500
-Oh, I assure you I'm not.

76
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:54,333
I never would have come
here if I weren't absolutely

77
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:57,466
convinced I could defeat you.

78
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,033
However, you are
quite a bit more naive

79
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:02,033
than the stories about
you would have indicated.

80
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:08,933
One of my comrades was on the
verge of finishing off Rukia

81
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:13,266
earlier, and I'm told you
were desperate in your desire

82
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,233
to save her life.

83
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:31,566
Furthermore, you have
come here by yourself

84
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
to avenge your younger sister.

85
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,833
How odd someone
like you could be

86
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:40,533
lured in with such
a cheap trick.

87
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,933
-Didn't you hear?

88
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:43,866
I already told you.

89
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,066
I have sworn to kill the Soul
Society's enemies, whoever

90
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,333
they may be.

91
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,400
-That's fine.

92
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:53,800
In any case, you're
going to die right here

93
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,300
as part of our great plan.

94
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,600
Then obviously there's
no use talking.

95
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:04,466
But you are the one
who is about to die.

96
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,700
Scatter, Senbonzakura.

97
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,600
-So this is the
famous Senbonzakura.

98
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:49,800
A beautiful technique,
but it seems

99
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,633
that it's not going
to work on me.

100
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,433
And now, allow me to
show you my attack.

101
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:06,366
Come to me, greater winds.

102
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,766
Come into me greater strength.

103
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,733
-I thought so.

104
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:14,700
That thing you were controlling
earlier which I couldn't see

105
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:17,133
was the wind.

106
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,767
-Windestanz.

107
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:40,706
You die.

108
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,240
-Hado 33, Sokatsui.

109
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:02,873
Hado 4, Byakurai.

110
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:08,573
-Heh.

111
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,373
Yes, I remember this.

112
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:27,573
The Senbonzakura
thousands of blades

113
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:29,440
have been split into
fragments so small

114
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:31,373
they can no longer be seen.

115
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:36,373
When they catch the light,
they look like flowers falling.

116
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:42,240
But, as you may have already
noticed, my doll is the wind.

117
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:46,073
And of course, there is a
limitless supply of air.

118
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:48,806
Gathering it allows me
to create a power which

119
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,106
rivals even your blade.

120
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,240
It becomes a simple
matter of numbers.

121
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,173
Your Senbonzakura, your
Kido, and even direct attacks

122
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:03,240
from your zanpakuto.

123
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:07,773
They are wonderful strikes
indeed, but they cannot cut me.

124
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:11,440
And soon you will be
the one on the ground.

125
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:13,173
-Is that a fact?

126
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,773
-Stop acting so tough.

127
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:52,287
-The sheer reckless courage
to face me bare handed.

128
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:53,754
For this, you must be commended.

129
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:06,887
But from here, I could
cut off your head

130
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:09,187
with a single
stroke of my sword.

131
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:10,621
-Oh, no you couldn't.

132
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:12,387
You'd lose yours
before you moved.

133
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:30,687
And now, we can separate
from each other.

134
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,254
-Scatter, Senbonzakura.

135
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:48,854
-My left arm is a small price
to pay for defeating Byakuya.

136
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:49,521
-Are you insane?

137
00:13:03,254 --> 00:13:03,721
-Ah!

138
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:15,854
-Getsuga Tensho!

139
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:35,054
Oh, Byakuya, for someone
who didn't want any help,

140
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,587
it seems you're
having some trouble.

141
00:13:58,221 --> 00:13:58,887
-Heh.

142
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,421
What a bunch of losers.

143
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:00,887
-Wow.

144
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:02,254
Ganju.

145
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:05,121
-Now, now, don't go giving
Ganju all the credit.

146
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:06,354
He didn't do anything.

147
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,487
It was Bonnie here
and the others

148
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:11,087
who knocked these guys out.

149
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:13,254
-Don't get hung up with
the technicalities.

150
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,521
And besides--

151
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,121
-That spiritual pressure.

152
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:18,787
Ichigo.

153
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:19,987
-Mm-hm.

154
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:21,954
It's him, all right.

155
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:22,921
Hey.

156
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:24,154
Where's Uryu?

157
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:26,921
-He was just here
a second ago, but--

158
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:29,354
-He probably headed
in Ichigo's direction.

159
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:29,821
-No.

160
00:14:29,854 --> 00:14:30,754
Wait.

161
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,954
-Huh?

162
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:34,287
-Let's just leave that whole
mess to the two of them.

163
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:36,687
-Yeah, but--

164
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:38,287
-It'll be all right.

165
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,921
I think those two can
probably survive on their own

166
00:14:40,954 --> 00:14:42,421
pretty well.

167
00:14:42,454 --> 00:14:44,587
-I suppose.

168
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:46,387
-And besides, we
need to find out

169
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:49,921
what's really going on
at Kusajishi, first.

170
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:51,454
Wake up, you.

171
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:52,587
-No, don't hurt me.

172
00:14:52,621 --> 00:14:55,387
Please don't hurt me, mister.

173
00:14:55,421 --> 00:14:57,287
-Tell me more about
these newcomers

174
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:00,321
with impressive skills who
showed up in Kusajishu.

175
00:15:00,354 --> 00:15:00,821
-Oh.

176
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:01,754
Right.

177
00:15:01,787 --> 00:15:03,754
Their leader's name is Kariya.

178
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:06,087
Or something like that.

179
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:07,921
-That's what I figured.

180
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:10,921
So what exactly
is he up to there?

181
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:14,154
-He says that he's going to turn
the Soul Society upside down,

182
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:17,421
and he's trying to recruit
people to join him.

183
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:18,787
-Join for what?

184
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:21,087
-So what else can you tell us?

185
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,387
-Just that right now,
they're at the gambling house

186
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:25,654
where the main
bookie in town is.

187
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:29,321
Kariya said anybody who went
there would have something good

188
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:31,554
happen to him.

189
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:32,787
-Thanks, pal.

190
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:35,754
You've been great.

-Ganju.

192
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:38,921
What do we do now?

193
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:41,087
-We've got to go to
this gambling house.

194
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:44,554
-You know, if they're
recruiting people there,

195
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:46,221
that could be dangerous.

196
00:15:46,254 --> 00:15:47,454
-Yeah, I know.

197
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:55,654
Just the same, I guess that I'm
going to have to talk to him.

198
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:58,154
-Do you mean who
I think you mean?

199
00:15:58,187 --> 00:15:59,987
-The Bull of Kusajishi.

200
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:01,387
-Ganju, you can't be serious.

201
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:02,621
It's way too dangerous.

202
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:04,854
What are you gonna do
when you meet him, anyway?

203
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:05,987
-Shut up.

204
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:08,387
What better way to
learn about Kusajishi

205
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:10,254
than from guys who live there?

206
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:11,887
-It's not that
simple, though, Ganju.

207
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:14,387
What if Bull is there
with the Bounts right now?

208
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:16,287
-I don't think so.

209
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:18,254
Bull is definitely
not the type to be

210
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:19,721
persuaded by the
Bounts' arguments.

-And?

212
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:33,054
-Master Kariya would like all
of you to fight alongside him.

213
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,887
-Fight against who?

214
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:39,687
-Against the men
of the Seireitei.

215
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:40,521
-That's impossible.

216

What chance would any of us
have at attacking that place?

220
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:50,254
-We'd be dying for nothing.

-No.

We can win.

You have to be with us
before I can tell you.

233
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:22,787
But in reality,
this entire world

234
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:25,054
is ruled by only a
small part of it.

235
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,654
The power is all held
in the Seireitei.

236

There shouldn't be poverty
in the Rukon District.

237
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:34,921
This place,
Kusajishi, is a place

238
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,587
where death can come
for you at any time.

239
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:40,487
Where blood is washed
away with more blood.

240
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:43,954
It was similar for us in
the world of the living.

241
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:45,087
-No.

242

In a way, we lived in
even worse conditions.

243
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:53,654
So you see, we can
understand your feelings.

Don't you ever want to see
the light of day again?

Don't you want to live
your lives the way

looks of scorn

Out of the way!

KON: Illustrated
Guide to Soul Reapers.

330
00:24:35,035 --> 00:24:36,135
GANJU: Golden!

331
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:39,168
-That second guy's
name is Hawk, isn't it?

332
00:24:39,202 --> 00:24:40,568
-Hm.

333
00:24:40,602 --> 00:24:43,335
-Come to think of it, I never
introduced you guys to my gang.

334
00:24:43,368 --> 00:24:44,435
First is Fever.

335
00:24:44,468 --> 00:24:46,435
His real name is Mitsudo Ishino.

336
00:24:46,468 --> 00:24:49,135
Next is Saramoto
Saiyonji, AKA Dumbbell.

337
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:51,668
Then comes Top, real
name Kenji Yamashita,

338
00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:55,768
and finally, Taichi
Miyamoto, who we call Hawk.

339
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:58,202
-So, did you give them
those names, Ganju?

340
00:24:58,235 --> 00:24:59,168
-I sure did.

341
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:01,302
Pretty cool, aren't they?

342
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:03,868
-They're as bad as his boars.
