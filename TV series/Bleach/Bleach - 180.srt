[theme song]

00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:51,745
NARRATOR: Ichigo reluctantly
became a bodyguard

3
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,578
for Rurichiyo Kasumioji,
the young princess

4
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:56,778
of a highly ranked noble family.

5
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:59,245
He soon found himself
battling assassins

6
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:02,211
sent by Gyokaku Kumoi,
the viceroy plotting

7
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:04,378
to take control of the clan.

8
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:08,445
Kumoi gave his assassins bakoto,
blades with special powers

9
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:12,011
that are made using secret
Kasumioji Clan techniques.

10
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,545
Armed with these unique
weapons, the assassins

11
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:16,711
attacked Ichigo and his friends.

12
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:19,311
But wielding the incredible
power of the bakoto

13
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:22,078
proved to be too much
for the assassins.

14
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:25,278
Unable to fully unleash the
power of their new weapon,

15
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,011
each of Kumoi's
men were defeated.

16
00:02:47,745 --> 00:02:49,178
-[sigh]

17
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,411
-Ah, Lord Kannogi.

18
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:05,678
You look absolutely magnificent.

19
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:08,311
-Yeah, but what if
Rurichiyo doesn't come back?

20
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:11,611
I won't be able to go through
the wedding ceremony alone.

21
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:13,911
-You have nothing
to worry about.

22
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:16,145
There's no doubt in my mind
that Princess Rurichiyo

23
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:19,311
will be here for the ceremony.

24
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:20,378
-Really?

25
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:23,345
You certainly seem
confident about that.

26
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:25,711
-I am, so try not to worry.

27
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:32,245
-Wedding ceremony?

28
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,378
-That's right.

29
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:36,345
The Kasumioji Clan is
finalizing preparations

30
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:39,345
for the upcoming
wedding of Shu Kannogi.

31
00:03:39,378 --> 00:03:40,345
-I've never heard of him.

32
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:42,245
Who is this Kannogi?

33
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:45,911
-Master Shu is Lady
Rurichiyo's fiance.

34
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:47,411
-Her fiance?

35
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:49,845
She never even told
me she was engaged.

36
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:53,178
-Well, that's the
aristocracy for you.

37
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:55,245
-There's talk that they've
skipped the formalities

38
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,311
and that Shu Kannogi has
already been installed

39
00:03:57,345 --> 00:03:59,745
as the head of the
Kasumioji clan.

40
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:02,145
So now they want to push
through the wedding ceremony

41
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:03,578
as quickly as possible.

42
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,478
That way, it will
all be official.

43
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,278
-But they can't hold a wedding
ceremony without the bride,

44
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:09,845
and Rurichiyo is here.

45
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:11,311
-That's a good point.

46
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:14,278
Still, I suppose they
could get around that

47
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:17,078
by using a stand in, seeing as
how most people wouldn't notice

48
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:18,145
a difference.

49
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:19,711
-Invitations have
already been sent out

50
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:22,378
to all the prominent
nobles in the Soul Society.

51
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:23,911
On the day of the
marriage, they plan

52
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:26,678
to open the gates to the
Kasumioji clan's palace

53
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:29,411
and invite all the citizens
to get a glimpse of the bride

54
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:32,078
and join in the celebration.

55
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:33,945
-They're trying to
destroy our credibility

56
00:04:33,978 --> 00:04:36,911
by having as many
witnesses as possible!

57
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,078
Damn that Kumoi!

58
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,445
He'll do anything to
get what he wants!

59
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:44,211
-When is the ceremony
scheduled to take place?

60
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:46,578
-The day after tomorrow.

61
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:49,211
-So we're not talking
about a lot of time.

62
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:51,645
I'm sure Kumoi will do
everything in his power

63
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:54,678
to get the princess back, so
we'll have to be wary of traps.

64
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,545
That would be just like him.

65
00:04:57,578 --> 00:05:00,978
-He's anticipating our actions
and driving us into a corner

66
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:04,678
by removing our
options one by one.

67
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:08,611
-Pretty soon, we won't have
any options left at all.

68
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:11,478
-Orihime is doing her
best with Chad and Uru,

69
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,778
but it's going to
take time for her

70
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,696
to reject the damage
inflicted by the assassins.

71
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:22,345
-The assassin sword-- a bakoto.

72
00:05:22,378 --> 00:05:25,211
That's what they
called it, right?

73
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:26,645
-Yeah.

74
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:29,445
It absorbed its
wielder's spirit energy

75
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:30,811
and converted it into power.

76
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:38,478
-I'm not familiar with it, but
I assumed you would be, Kisuke.

77
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:40,311
-I know it's hard to
believe, but there

78
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:43,478
are a few things that
I don't, uh-- huh?

79
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,245
-Enryu, is everything all right?

80
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:55,211
-No, Lady Rurichiyo isn't here.

81
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:57,345
Have you checked the guest room?

82
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:59,878
-Uh.

83
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:01,578
-You really understood all that?

84
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:16,178
-Lady Rurichiyo.

85
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:18,045
I thought that I
might find you here.

86
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:27,245
Try not to worry, your highness.

87
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,178
I'm sure they'll both
make a full recovery,

88
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:31,111
and we have to give
Orihime room so

89
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:32,611
that she's able to do her work.

90
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:39,145
It would be best
for us to leave now

91
00:06:39,178 --> 00:06:42,445
so that we don't get in her way.

92
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:44,278
Uh, my lady?

93
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:47,011
-I understand how do feel,
but you needn't worry.

94
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,511
Wait a minute.

95
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:58,511
I hate to ask, Rurichiyo, but
mind wringing out these towels?

96
00:06:58,545 --> 00:06:59,545
-Huh?

97
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:00,245
-Please?

98
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:04,311
It would help me out.

99
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:05,778
-[laughs]

100
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:10,545
-Here.

101
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:11,911
You can rinse them in this.

102
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:29,445
-Perfect.

103
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:30,511
Thanks, Rurichiyo.

104
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:31,978
-I am so sorry.

105
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:34,678
-Huh?

106
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:37,878
-I am just so useless.

107
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:38,678
-No, please!

108
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:39,711
Rurichiyo, that's not true!

109
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:41,678
This wasn't your fault!

110
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:02,078
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
So, here you are.

111
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:02,947
-Huh?

112
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:11,611
-They say that only smoke
and fools like high places.

113
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:16,945
So why do I keep
finding you up here?

114
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:18,444
-I am not sure.

115
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:28,945
-You know, you can stop feeling
guilty about Chad and Uryu

116
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:29,678
getting hurt.

117
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:32,111
It wasn't your fault.

118
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,411
-But it was.

119
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:35,378
-No it wasn't.

120
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:37,178
-You're just saying that!

121
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:40,011
All their pain and suffering--
it is all because of me!

122
00:08:40,045 --> 00:08:41,278
-That isn't true!

123
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:43,711
Because you're not the one
those thugs were after.

124
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:45,678
Nukui only had one
thing on his mind.

125
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:49,378
He was coming after
me personally.

126
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:51,745
-Do not lie.

127
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:53,545
Because I also know
they weren't just

128
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:55,845
some bandits who
stumbled on us by chance.

129
00:08:55,878 --> 00:08:59,178
They were assassins who
were sent here by Kumoi!

130
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:01,878
Kumoi will stop at nothing to
take over the Kasumioji clan,

131
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:05,945
and I'm standing in his
way, so he wants me dead!

132
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,245
-But Rurichiyo, I thought you--

133
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,011
-I acted like I had no idea,
but I have known for a long time

134
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:15,778
that Kumoi is after me.

135
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:18,611
And I know that none of you
talk about it when I am around,

136
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,545
because you don't
want me to worry.

137
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:24,078
I am grateful for all the
kindness you have shown,

138
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:28,611
but still, I can't--

139
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:32,278
-Listen, Rurichiyo, nobody
forced us to protect you.

140
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:34,678
We all chose to do it.

141
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:37,045
We couldn't let you
face those guys alone.

142
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:42,478
And besides, I'm a
substitute Soul Reaper.

143
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:45,578
If I find someone like you
wandering helplessly around,

144
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:49,045
it's part of my job
to take care of you.

145
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:49,578
-Ichigo.

146
00:09:52,545 --> 00:09:55,378
-Aw, come on, quit crying.

147
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,878
-I'm not crying!

148
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:00,178
-Everyone's going
to be all right.

149
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:02,378
It may take a little
time, but Uryu and Chad

150
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:03,678
are going to be as good as new.

151
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:06,078
Orihime doesn't
give up so easily.

152
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:07,145
So stop your worrying.

153
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:10,211
We'll be fine.

154
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:11,245
-Thank you, Ichigo.

155
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:19,711
-Hey!

156
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:20,678
What do you think you're--

157
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:26,372
-Please forgive me.

158
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:35,015
Now unlock!

159
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:37,481
-[groan] Huh?

160
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:43,748
-Rurichiyo, no!

161
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:46,015
-Please don't think I'm
not grateful for everything

162
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:47,381
you've done.

163
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:50,815
But I will not sit back and
let you suffer because of me.

164
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:56,181
I'm gonna take back the
Kasumioji clan myself.

165
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:57,515
-Rurichiyo, don't!

166
00:10:57,548 --> 00:10:59,081
-Ichigo, what's wrong?

167
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:01,281
-What's happening out here?

168
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:02,315
-Oh!

169
00:11:02,348 --> 00:11:02,915
Lady Rurichiyo!

170
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:09,181
What's the meaning
of this, Ichigo?

171
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:11,648
-I'll explain that later, but
we've got to go after her!

172
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:17,648
What are you waiting for?

173
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:19,181
You've gotta open the Senkaimon!

174
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:20,448
-I know what to do!

175
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,915
-Unlock!

176
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:26,748
Huh?

177
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:27,848
-What is this?

178
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:28,881
What's the problem?

179
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:30,948
-The gate won't respond.

180
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,315
-How is that possible?

181
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:34,848
-Lady Rurichiyo must have known
that we'd try to follow her,

182
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:37,915
so she probably locked
it from the other side.

183
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,048
-Are you telling me that
you can't open that gate?

184
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,081
-I can't do it without a key!

185
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:43,481
-Damn!

186
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:46,881
-Ichigo, you need to slow down
and think about this situation.

187
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,381
If you go rushing
through that gate,

188
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,648
you'll fall right
into the enemy's trap.

189
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:52,881
-What do you expect us to do?

190
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:54,915
-You need to calm down, Ichigo.

191
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,415
-What could have
happened that would

192
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:59,848
make Princess Rurichiyo risk her
life and return to her clan so

193
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:01,615
suddenly?

194
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:02,948
-She knew.

195
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,915
She knew that Kumoi
was trying to kill her,

196
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:07,181
and that she was putting
us all in danger.

197
00:12:07,215 --> 00:12:08,981
-What?

198
00:12:09,015 --> 00:12:11,515
-And she thinks she's
responsible for Chad and Uryu

199
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:14,181
and everything else that's
happened since she arrived.

200
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:16,015
-Oh, no.

201
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:17,848
-I guess that explains it.

202
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:20,081
But what could she
possibly hope to accomplish

203
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,581
by going back alone?

204
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,448
-I think that she'll
try to deceive Kumoi

205
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:25,848
by submitting to his will and
proceeding with the marriage

206
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:27,915
so that she can take
over as head of the clan!

207
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,781
-I don't think he's naive
enough to go for that!

208
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:34,281
Rukia, you're the only one
who can open up the Senkaimon.

209
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:34,848
-All right.

210
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:39,548
Now, unlock!

211
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,048
-Ichigo!

212
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:52,348
You guys, be careful.

213
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:55,015
-Orihime, please take
care of Chad and Uryu.

214
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:55,848
Let's do this.

215
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,915
-Well, they're on their way.

216
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,415
I guess I could have tried to
stop them, but knowing Ichigo,

217
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:07,381
it wouldn't have matter.

218
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:10,215
-But this time, his opponent
is a high ranking noble clan.

219
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,281
It will not be easy.

220
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,879
-Princess!

221
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:43,279
The princess has
returned to the palace!

222
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:43,846
-Huh?

223
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:44,746
The princess?

224
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:46,646
-Forget about those dishes!

225
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:49,079
We have to go out and
welcome the princess!

226
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:49,746
-What?

227
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,046
-It's the princess!

228
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:01,713
-It's wonderful to see
you again, Lady Rurichiyo.

229
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:19,480
-Hold it!

230
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:21,447
-I'm Rukia Kuchiki of Squad 13.

231
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,580
-And them?

232
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,880
-This is substitute Soul
Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki,

233
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:28,380
and these two are Sir Kenryu
and Enryu of Kasumioji Clan.

234
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:29,847
-There's no
authorization for you.

235
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,947
You'll have to wait here
while we verify this.

236
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,313
-There's no time for that!

237
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:34,413
-Not now, Ichigo.

238
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:35,647
We have to do as they say.

239
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,947
-I'm glad you were able to make
it back in time, Rurichiyo.

240
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,380
They held a ceremony
and appointed

241
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:57,380
me lord while you were gone.

242
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,213
Sorry, Rurichiyo.

243
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,113
-It makes no difference.

244
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:04,213
It was never my intention to
become head of the clan anyway.

245
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:07,113
-The important thing is that
we can be together from now on.

246
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:09,913
There are so many things that
we could do, like play cards,

247
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:11,813
or have a fan toss.

248
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:13,413
Oh I completely forgot.

249
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:14,847
You like to play kenmeri, right?

250
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:24,447
-Why the hell did it
take so long for us

251
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,147
to get through the Senkaimon?

252
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,347
-When someone shows up
without authorization,

253
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
they're required to
follow procedure.

254
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,813
We're lucky we made it
through without complications.

255
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:35,847
-The ceremony takes
place tomorrow.

256
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,613
We don't have much time.

257
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:38,680
-Damn.

258
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:40,580
-What happens when
we get to the palace?

259
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:45,080
How do we get inside without
creating a disturbance?

260
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:45,947
-Don't worry!

261
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,547
You can leave that to us.

262
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,147
I can handle getting
Lady Rurichiyo out.

263
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,080
After all, I am Chief
Chamberlain of the clan.

264
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:54,847
-Does that mean you're
someone important?

265
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,647
-Not only does it
mean I'm important,

266
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,913
it means I'm the number one
guardian of Princess Rurichiyo!

267
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:02,180
And I have full
access to the palace.

268
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:08,513
Open the gate!

269
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:12,147
Chief Chamberlain of the
Kasumioji clan, Ryusei Kenzaki,

270
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,713
and Rusaburo Enkogawa
wish to enter!

271
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:18,013
-All this time, who knew they
had such impressive names?

272
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,080
-What are you waiting for?

273
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:19,747
Open the gates!

274
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,547
Huh?

275
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,880
What is the meaning of this?

276
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:29,947
-Silence.

277
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,847
I have orders for
your immediate arrest.

278
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,780
You are both being
charged with the abduction

279
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:36,047
of Princess Rurichiyo.

280
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,347
-That's ridiculous.

281
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,247
This is Kumoi's doing.

282
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,313
-We won't be much help
if we get arrested.

283
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:42,647
-That's not going to happen.

284
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,247
-So you've got a plan?

285
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,247
-Of course I do!

286
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:49,813
Run like the wind!

287
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:53,647
-Hey, hold on!

288
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,280
Why the hell are you
running away for?

289
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:56,647
I thought you were
supposed to be

290
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,380
some kind of
bigshot around here!

291
00:16:58,413 --> 00:16:59,813
-We're not running
away from them!

292
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:01,647
We're just falling
back to regroup!

293
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,747
-Sure feels like
we're running away!

294
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,147
-This way!

295
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:12,713
-What?

296
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:13,580
Where did they go?

297
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:15,980
[interposing voices]

298
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:17,047
-Spread out and find them.

299
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:26,313
-It looks like
we're safe for now.

300
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:29,180
-Do you guys always have
a getaway room ready?

301
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:30,880
-It's common for
these old palaces

302
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:32,847
to have secret passageways.

303
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,713
-Is he making this up or what?

304
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:35,980
-I don't know.

305
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,480
-We have to decide what
we're going to do next.

306
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:40,113
If we stick to the
secret passages,

307
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:41,747
we might be able
to search most of--

308
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,880
-Hold on a minute.

309
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:46,413
-What's the problem?

310
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:48,547
-Judging by the reception
we got at the main gate,

311
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,780
I think it's pretty obvious
that the entire palace is

312
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:52,280
going to be under heavy guard.

313
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:54,647
-That's because it's the day
before the wedding ceremony.

314
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,113
-Then rather than
searching blindly

315
00:17:56,147 --> 00:17:58,747
and taking the chance of running
into another bunch of guards,

316
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,480
I think we should wait
until tomorrow when

317
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,580
we know exactly where
Rurichiyo will be.

318
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:04,780
-But if we wait until
tomorrow, then she'll already--

319
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:06,180
-He's right.

320
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:08,647
I think Lady
Rurichiyo plans to use

321
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,247
her power as the head
of the Kasumioji clan

322
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,547
to publicly denounce
Kumoi, and that's

323
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,713
why she's chosen this occasion.

324
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:17,447
-We tried to protect
her, but ended up

325
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,880
backing her into a corner
by taking away her freedom

326
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:22,780
and treating her like a child.

327
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:24,680
And after everything
she's endured,

328
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:27,713
we couldn't even protect her.

329
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:31,147
Rurichiyo knew how dangerous it
was, but she came here anyway.

330
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,613
All she wants is to take
control of her own destiny.

331
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,747
So what do you say?

332
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,613
Should we give her a chance to
do what she came here to do?

333
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:44,280
-[sigh] It's worth a try.

334
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:47,513
-Kenryu, it'll be your job
to get us inside the palace.

335
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:50,280
-You can count on me.

336
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:51,947
-Hang on, Rurichiyo.

337
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,230
You're not alone.

338
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:23,980
-I hereby proclaim
that Lord Kannogi,

339
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:28,180
the 37th Lord of Kasumioji,
and Princess Rurichiyo,

340
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:30,613
are officially husband and wife.

341
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:34,513
[applause]

342
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,213
-Announcing the
arrival of Lord Shu,

343
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:46,747
the new lord of
the Kasumioji clan,

344
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,347
and his bride, the
Princess Rurichiyo.

345
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,013
Long live Lord and Lady Kannogi!

346
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,547
[cheering]

347
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,847
-Can you believe it, Rurichiyo?

348
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,947
Listen to that.

349
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,447
There must be thousands
of them down there,

350
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,213
and they're here to
celebrate our wedding.

351
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:24,080
-Rurichiyo!

352
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:30,913
Let's go.

353
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,213
-Stop right there!

354
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:40,478
-Intruders!

355
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:43,480
-Rurichiyo!

356
00:21:43,513 --> 00:21:44,047
Rurichiyo!

357
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,880
Listen to me!

358
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:45,980
-Huh?

359
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:46,980
What?

360
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:48,813
-Rurichiyo, we've come for you!

361
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:49,847
It's me, Ichigo!

362
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,213
Hey!

363
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:52,313
-They fell for it.

364
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:53,513
-Don't move, Ichigo Kurosaki.

365
00:21:57,647 --> 00:21:59,147
-Captain Soi Fon!

366
00:22:02,347 --> 00:22:03,280
-What's going on?

367
00:22:07,147 --> 00:22:09,165
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): Rurichiyo!

368
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:20,245
[theme song]

369
00:23:47,318 --> 00:23:48,938
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): When
we filled out those forms

370
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:51,538
to pass through Senkaimon, there
was a line for a guarantor.

371
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:52,638
Who did you put?

372
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:54,005
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): My brother.

373
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:56,471
So be careful, because if we get
in trouble, it'll be his head.

374
00:23:56,505 --> 00:23:58,071
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
It's a little late

375
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,105
for that now, isn't it?

376
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,671
That sucks for him.

377
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:01,564
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Damn.
