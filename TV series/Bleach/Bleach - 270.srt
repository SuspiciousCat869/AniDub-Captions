1
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:16,100
The only reason I
continue to fight, is
because I have to win!

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,333
Those are the words
of someone who doesn't
know defeat.

3
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:13,877
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Ulquiorra.

4
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:17,944
I believe this is what
you wanted to see...

5
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:21,444
My Hollowfication!

6
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:25,211
[yelling]

7
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:33,044
[yelling]

8
00:03:01,111 --> 00:03:02,377
Come back here!

9
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,511
Damn it! How far is he
planning to go?

10
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:22,844
Wait a minute...!

11
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:26,377
Are we above Las Noches'
canopy?!

12
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:28,444
<i>That's right.</i>

13
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:37,744
Under Aizen's orders,
two things are forbidden
below the canopy of Las
Noches...

14
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:45,177
The first is... Gran Rey
Cero, which exists only
for... an Espada.

15
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:52,044
And the second is.. the
sword release of Espadas
with the rank of 4 and
higher.

16
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:58,777
They are both so powerful,
that if released, they would
threaten to destroy Las
Noches itself.

17
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,677
Imprison...! Murcielago!

18
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:23,144
[gasping]

19
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,344
Compose yourself.

20
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:00,344
You must hold your
stance...

21
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:04,344
...Extend your
consciousness. Do not
let your guard down.

22
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:16,977
[gasping]

23
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:43,877
[panting]

24
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,677
It's not possible.
That was too fast!

25
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:50,477
This can't be happening.
I couldn't react at all!

26
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:53,044
Even in my Hollowfied
state!

27
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:06,811
The power of your
so-called Hollowfication
has increased.

28
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:11,311
You're even capable of
wearing the mask longer.
And yet...

29
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:14,011
I didn't expect it
would shatter that
easily.

30
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:15,277
[gasping]

31
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,811
How unfortunate for you.

32
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,544
Watch closely.

33
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,477
I see it!

34
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:33,644
[gasping]

35
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,377
[grunting]

36
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:23,511
Look at that! There's
a hole in the sky!

37
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,611
The sky of Las Noches. It
was fake this whole time.

38
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:41,311
Orihime?

39
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:42,744
Uh?

40
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:50,411
We're not out of
the woods yet, but
I'm glad you're all
right.

41
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,644
Don't worry.

42
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:58,311
Ichigo will be
fine. He'll win.

43
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,744
Uhh... mm.

44
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:04,677
Come on, Ichigo.

45
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:07,077
Don't make a
liar out of me.

46
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,677
You can do it.

47
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:14,977
What is it
you're waiting for?

48
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,844
Fire your Getsuga.

49
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:19,277
[gasping]

50
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:21,144
Fire it at me.

51
00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:28,577
That's when you are at
your most lethal. A form
capable of holding up
even against an Espada.

52
00:08:29,044 --> 00:08:32,877
And we both know Getsuga
is your most powerful
technique.

53
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:36,511
Fire it. Show it to me
and I will let you see...

54
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:38,711
The difference in
our strengths.

55
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:42,844
[gasping]
You serious!? You want
me to fire Getsuga?

56
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:53,411
Well allow me to help
you with your request!

57
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:02,844
Getsuga tensho!!

58
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:12,244
It's just as
I had thought.

59
00:09:15,311 --> 00:09:18,077
You are, after all,
merely human.

60
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:19,777
You're not hurt?!

61
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:26,377
No, not quite. Though your
black Getsuga is actually
very similar to our own
Cero.

62
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:30,144
Cero? Don't compare
it to something like
that!

63
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:31,977
Ah, that's
right.

64
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,344
I forgot you
haven't gotten
to see it, yet.

65
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:42,944
Since this is your last
battle, I will show it to
you. This is the black
Cero that an Espada can

66
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:45,777
discharge in a released
state.

67
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:48,044
Cero Oscuras.

68
00:09:56,977 --> 00:10:00,744
[grunting]

69
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,611
[struggling]

70
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:06,877
Orihime!

71
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,477
Damn it, Ichigo, what's
happening up there?!

72
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:26,711
<i>Uryu?</i>

73
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:38,411
Do you think it's possible
that by using your powers,
you could lift us above
that canopy?

74
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:45,577
<i>At that moment, I</i>
<i>might've known she</i>
<i>would request that of me.</i>

75
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,911
But what was I to
do? I couldn't say
no to her.

76
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:55,711
Can you please?

77
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:02,077
I did want to help. And I
would soon come to regret
that decision.

78
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:12,377
Damn it!

79
00:11:12,411 --> 00:11:14,311
[struggling]

80
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:23,877
[grunting]

81
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:41,877
Do you understand
it, now?

82
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:54,944
[struggling]

83
00:11:55,211 --> 00:12:00,411
I'm afraid that no matter
how closely your form and
techniques resemble an
Arrancar's...

84
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:05,644
The difference in our
power will always be as
great as that between
heaven and earth.

85
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:20,944
Imitating Hollows seems
like a perfectly logical path
for you to follow in order to
gain more power.

86
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:27,711
It's not surprising you
would do that to become
stronger, but you will
never be my equal.

87
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:36,677
[struggling]

88
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:50,911
[struggling]

89
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:51,944
Getsuga...

90
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:54,511
<i>I told you,</i>
<i>it's useless!</i>

91
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:56,444
Why won't you
let go of your
sword?

92
00:13:56,477 --> 00:14:00,377
[choking]

93
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:06,644
You've experienced the
vast difference in our powers,
and yet, you actually still
think you can defeat me?

94
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:16,211
[choking]
Difference... in
power... that doesn't
matter at all.

95
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:24,877
You think I'd give up
just because you're more
powerful than me?

96
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:28,844
From our first battle
together, I knew that
you were stronger.

97
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:35,144
At this point, no
matter how many times I
see how powerful you are,

98
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:37,144
it won't make a
difference to me!

99
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:40,411
I am determined to see
this through to the end.

100
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:42,977
I refuse to
give up!

101
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:45,777
You should've realized
that by now.

102
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:52,077
I... will find a
way... to beat you!

103
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:56,911
[choking]
Ul...qui...orr...a.

104
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,177
That's nonsense.

105
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,144
[coughing]

106
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:17,544
Ichigo Kurosaki, those are
the words of someone who
doesn't know the true
despair of defeat.

107
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:22,744
[struggling]

108
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:32,377
Since you don't
understand, I
will teach you.

109
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:37,677
This is what true despair
looks like.

110
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:04,769
How incredible!

111
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:07,635
I learned this when I
went through Garganta.

112
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:12,302
I realized on the way
here, I could use this
technique in Hueco Mundo
as well.

113
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:17,169
I wish I'd figured this
out a bit sooner, I could've
used this in some of my
earlier battles.

114
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:18,202
Uryu...

115
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:19,335
[gasping]

116
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:21,335
What the hell
was that?!

117
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:23,135
It came from
up above!

118
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:31,702
What's that force?!
Spirit Energy?!

119
00:16:32,635 --> 00:16:37,835
It's too different...
This isn't like any
Spirit Energy I've ever
experienced before!

120
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:42,202
It's not just
powerful...

121
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:48,902
It feels... thick and
heavy. It's as if there's
an ocean spread above the
sky.

122
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:52,202
It's something other
than Spirit Energy.

123
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:54,435
I feel like it
could crush us!

124
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:56,235
I've never...

125
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:58,369
I know. Let's hurry!

126
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:06,169
Resurreccion Segunda
Etapa.

127
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:13,569
[gasping]

128
00:17:13,602 --> 00:17:15,902
<i>Among the Espadas...</i>

129
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:20,202
I, alone, have found a
way to achieve this
second-stage release...

130
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:25,969
I have not even shown
this form to the great
Lord Aizen.

131
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:37,902
[struggling]

132
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:43,869
[struggling]

133
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:50,469
So you have seen my
imposing form and you
still have the will
to fight?

134
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:59,202
He's not so confused
that he can't feel
fear.

135
00:18:01,002 --> 00:18:04,035
<i>And yet, those are not the</i>
<i>eyes of someone who has</i>
<i>given up.</i>

136
00:18:05,202 --> 00:18:08,302
Does this mean he
actually believes
he can win?

137
00:18:11,202 --> 00:18:12,969
Very well.

138
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:18,435
I will make you realize
the depth my power, even
if I have to grind your
body into dust.

139
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,369
You will understand!!

140
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:53,102
Uh!

141
00:18:58,369 --> 00:18:59,402
[gasping]

142
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:08,135
[gasping]

143
00:19:08,835 --> 00:19:10,235
[groaning]

144
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:20,902
You are a fool...
Ichigo Kurosaki!

145
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:22,502
Ah!

146
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:28,835
Why would you challenge
an enemy that you can't
possibly defeat?

147
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:31,402
Most beings want to
preserve their life!

148
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:33,469
I can't comprehend
this!

149
00:19:55,702 --> 00:20:00,102
You must be doing all of
this because of what you
humans call heart.

150
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:04,435
If so, it would seem to
be more of a liability
than a strength.

151
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:11,635
What stupidity. Because
you possess this antiquated
concept of heart, you have
chosen to lose your life.

152
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:19,235
[grunting]

153
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:24,035
I didn't decide to
fight you because I can
see myself winning this
battle...

154
00:20:26,835 --> 00:20:31,602
The only reason I
continue to fight, is
because I have to win!

155
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:42,469
Have it your way.

156
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:56,202
[grunting]

157
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:59,835
I don't sense Ichigo's
Spiritual Pressure,
where is he?!

158
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:05,502
[panting]

159
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,269
So you've
come. How nice.

160
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,702
[gasping]
Ichigo.

161
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:40,835
You're just in
time. Watch closely.

162
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:42,435
[gasping]

163
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:45,369
Here is the man to whom
you've entrusted all
your hope.

164
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:48,369
Bear witness as his life
comes to an end.

165
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:56,135
[screaming]
No!

166
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,810
What can we do?! Ichigo
was supposed to be in charge
of this episode's preview,
but he's in no shape to--

167
00:23:50,844 --> 00:23:53,610
<i>Relax. I'll take</i>
<i>over for him.</i>

168
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:57,877
<i>Great! Then would you</i>
please dance wearing an
Afro wig and a tight
dress, just like Yoruichi

169
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,110
did in the end credits?!

170
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:00,544
<i>Huh?</i>
