CHILD: Gotcha!

[humming]

00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,475
-All done.

6
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:51,442
What do you think?

7
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:53,908
Your new outfit is
all ready, Bostov.

8
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:54,975
See?

9
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:56,508
Isn't it just the cutest
little thing ever?

10
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,442
Wow, I just thought
of something else.

11
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:00,375
Some colorful embroidery.

12
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:01,608
Huh?

13
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:02,908
I'll use blue.

14
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:04,142
No, red.

15
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:05,275
Aw.

16
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:07,508
Since there's no red,
guess I'll use yellow.

17
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:08,475
Aw.

18
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:09,708
This is awful.

19
00:02:09,742 --> 00:02:11,508
I hate it when I don't have
the thread that I need.

20
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:12,808
Don't worry, Bostov.

21
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,075
I'm gona buy some new thread
for your outfit right now.

22
00:02:15,108 --> 00:02:16,308
I'll be right back.

00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:19,508
-Kon here.

25
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:21,508
Day 175.

26
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,208
As if it wasn't
humiliating enough

27
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:26,275
having to live as a stupid stuff
animal trapped in this house,

28
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:28,608
now I'm supposed to wear that?

29
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:30,575
After all the endless
hours I've been

30
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,542
forced to actually play house
with the other stuffed animals?

31
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:35,042
I can't take it!

32
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:36,642
I'm outta here!

33
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:37,942
I what the hell?

34
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:39,042
My hands!

35
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,008
Ah!

36
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:41,308
I've been stitched
into a threesome

37
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:42,675
with stupid and stupider!

38
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,842
How dare that human
do this to me?

39
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,275
[scream]

40
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,875
-The spirits are
always with you--

41
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:57,742
-I heard that the squishy
bug drinking juice,

42
00:02:57,775 --> 00:02:59,008
it'll make you really sick.

43
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,342
-Wow, I guess I shouldn't
have done that then, huh?

44
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,375
-Damn you kids!

45
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:04,375
You totally messed
up my catch phrase.

46
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:07,408
Once again, the spirits
are-- [mumbling].

47
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,875
-Customer parking only here
in front of the clinic.

48
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:11,275
Move that pile of junk.

49
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:12,275
-Hey, it's Karakura Red!

50
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:14,075
Long time no see.

51
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:15,675
-Not nearly long enough.

52
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,208
What do you want, Don Kanonji?

53
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:20,908
-Oh, now is that any way to talk
to a friend, a comrade in arms

54
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:23,042
who fought with you side
by side for peace and love

55
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:24,308
in the free world?

56
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:25,542
-It's the middle of the day.

57
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:27,575
Aren't you supposed
to be working?

58
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:28,842
-Hey, now!

59
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,575
It may look like I'm unemployed,
but I can explain, kid.

60
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:33,775
You see, TV shows are
taped weeks in advance,

61
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:35,708
so right now I'm
just on vacation.

62
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:37,942
The fact is, the
network can't wait

63
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:40,075
to renew my contract
for another season.

64
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:41,342
Wah, ha ha ha!

65
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,275
-That's funny.

66
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:43,842
I heard you were
getting cancelled.

67
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,942
-Huh?

68
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,342
-I hear your ratings
have been really bad.

69
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,575
-Not so loud!

70
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,408
If I lose one more sponsor,
I'll be back to selling

71
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:52,142
used cars at midnight on cable!

72
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:53,542
Never mind all that.

73
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:56,375
I've come to enlist you in
a special training session!

74
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:58,075
-Oh, brother.

75
00:03:58,108 --> 00:03:59,508
What does that mean?

76
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:00,908
-I'll tell ya!

77
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:03,308
We need to train like crazy to
protect this happy little town

78
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:06,242
from the bad spirits that
even now are threatening!

79
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:07,608
Whoa!

80
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:09,108
Almost lost my head there.

81
00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:10,108
Come on, Karakura Red.

82
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:11,608
Let's start with
some jumping jacks!

83
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:12,908
Wah, ha ha ha!

84
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:13,742
Wah, ha ha--

85
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,075
-What's this really all about?

86
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:15,575
-Huh?

87
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,442
Damn.

88
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:19,375
It's painful to
admit, but it's true.

89
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:23,942
I, Don Kanonji, have seen my
popularity dropping lately.

90
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:26,908
But anyone who thinks they've
seen the last of Don Kanonji

91
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,575
has another thing comin'!

92
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:31,042
I'll do whatever it takes
to revive this show,

93
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:34,142
and I knwo just what I need to
grab the hearts of my audience.

94
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,308
We all know everyone wants a
hero, so now all I have to do

95
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:41,442
is bring back the
Karakura Superheroes!

96
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:43,808
-Waste of time, if you ask me.

97
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:44,308
-Huh?

98
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:45,675
Ah!

99
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,708
Hold on!

100
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:47,208
No, wait!

101
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:47,708
Please!

102
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:48,242
Don't go!

103
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:49,442
I need you!

104
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:51,142
I'm begging you, Karakura Red!

105
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:52,142
Please don't abandon me!

106
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:54,142
Not now, in my time of need!

107
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:54,742
Please!

108
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,975
Please!

109
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:59,242
-Ha ha!

110
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,275
On these wings of
freedom I shall now

111
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:03,975
take flight, and soar
far away from here.

112
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,375
Ah, they're freakin' heavy!

113
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,375
All right, fine, so I'm not
soaring so much as I'm walking.

114
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:16,708
The point is, I'm
getting out of this-- ah!

115
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:19,075
Damn, I've been spotted!

116
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:19,642
-Hello, there.

117
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:24,042
[mumbling]

118
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,308
-I'm a robot.

119
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,575
-Look, a silver dollar!

120
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:27,542
-That's mine!

121
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:28,042
Where?

122
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:29,175
Ah!

123
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:33,575
-You are not a plain old
stuff animal, are you?

124
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:34,908
-Well, sure I am.

125
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:35,942
Look.

126
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,008
You just wind me up,
and I dance around

127
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:38,075
like any other cheap toy--

128
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,775
-You're an evil
spirit, aren't you?

129
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:40,775
-(THINKING) Oh, crap!

130
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,242
I've had about enough of this!

131
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,275
I'm Bostov, a stupid sailor
suit wearing prisoner

132
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:46,742
of a little girl, sewn together
with these two yahoos, Buri

133
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:47,408
and Puri.

134
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:48,975
Now's my chance!

135
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:49,708
-Oh, no you don't!

136
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:51,575
Come back here!

137
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,208
Hold it there, bad spirit.

138
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:55,075
I'm curious about you.

139
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:56,008
Hm?

140
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:57,308
-What are you doing, you freak?

141
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:58,442
I'm no rose.

142
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:00,775
I-- ah, your nose breath!

143
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:02,908
-Well, you certainly
have a strange odor,

144
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:04,108
but it's not awful.

145
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:05,275
I think I've got it.

146
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:06,942
You're not an evil spirit.

147
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:08,075
You're just a weird spirit.

148
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:09,908
-Who are you calling
weird, you reject

149
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:11,275
from hell's marching band?

150
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:14,442
-As every TV action fan
knows, no team of superheroes

151
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,375
can be complete
without a mascot.

152
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,075
This walking, stalking
stuffed animal

153
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:19,875
could be just the thing
to put the Karakura

154
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:21,442
superheroes over the top!

155
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:23,208
Wah, ha ha ha!

156
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:24,975
-Whatever the hell
you're planning for me,

157
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:25,975
you can forget about it.

158
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:26,908
-Oh, good heavens.

159
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:28,608
Did I say all of that out loud?

160
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:30,342
It must be old age kicking in.

161
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,275
I hardly even know my
own name, much less

162
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,375
what I'm blabbering about.

163
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:34,675
-What are you blabbering about?

164
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,808
-I'll tell you!

165
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:38,508
How would you like to
become an actual hero?

166
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,042
-A hero?

167
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:40,842
For real?

168
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,742
-Yes.

169
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:44,508
A hero of justice.

170
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:47,608
-A hero of justice, huh?

171
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:48,542
Ha ha.

172
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,742
-Oh, you're the best!

173
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,142
Wow!

174
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:54,242
-This must be heaven, squeezed
by so many lovely marshmallows!

175
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,775
-So, what do you say?

176
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:58,975
Do you think you're
ready to join

177
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:00,542
the superheroes of justice?

178
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:08,542
-My name is Kon, also
known as Karakura King!

179
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:11,875
-Wah, ha ha ha!

180
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:14,108
-Welcome aboard, new member.

181
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:14,875
-Hi!

182
00:07:14,908 --> 00:07:15,442
-Huh?

183
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:16,842
-Don Kanonji!

184
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,275
Wah, ha ha ha ha ha ha!

185
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:21,208
-Wah, ha ha ha ha!

186
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:22,775
Everybody!

187
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:24,575
Wah, ha ha ha ha!

188
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:27,108
Oh, it has little a
while, sister of Ichigo.

189
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:29,742
-Are you here to do a
Spirit Hunter episode?

190
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:30,775
-Oh, no.

191
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:32,542
I'm here recruiting
the latest member

192
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:33,975
for my team of superheroes.

193
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:34,508
-Really?

194
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:35,842
Who is that?

195
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,642
-Let me introduce you.

196
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:40,208
Here he is, the newest member
of the Karakura Superheroes,

197
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:40,775
Karakura King!

198
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:43,975
-Huh?

199
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:45,375
You mean this stuffed animal?

200
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:46,708
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

201
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:48,308
Tell me this isn't happening.

202
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,408
-Hm.

203
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:52,408
You sure look a lot
like a friend of mine.

204
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:53,808
Nice to meet ya.

205
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:55,208
-N-nice to meet you, too.

206
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,142
-You even talk.

207
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,475
That's amazing!

208
00:07:58,508 --> 00:07:59,808
-How about you, Karakura Yellow?

209
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:02,175
You'll join up too, right?

210
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:02,675
-Absolutely!

211
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,208
Yes, sir!

212
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:04,408
Affirmative!

213
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,775
Oh?

214
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:07,642
Hey, I have a new outfit I made
for Bostov's boyfriend that

215
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:09,575
might be just right.

216
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:11,842
What do you think,
Karakura King?

217
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,208
-Huh?

218
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,875
You've got to be kidding me.

219
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:17,875
All this time I've been
wearing frilly dresses,

220
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:21,608
I could have been dressed
like a bad ass superhero?

221
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:24,975
I wish I knew she could
make outfits like this.

222
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:25,475
Oh!

223
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,775
-How do I look?

224
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:31,242
-You look so cool,
Karakura King!

225
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:33,208
It fits perfectly!

226
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:35,075
-That makes one
member and a mascot.

227
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:38,008
If only I could pull the rest
of them out of the ground,

228
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:39,342
just like a bunch of taters!

229
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,608
-What's a bunch of taters?

230
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:42,442
-Did I say that out loud, too?

231
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:43,242
I gotta watch that.

232
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:43,908
Never mind.

233
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:44,708
Everything is OK!

234
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:45,642
Wah, ha ha ha!

235
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:52,108
-There it is.

236
00:08:57,908 --> 00:08:59,475
-So Karin turned you down, huh?

237
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:00,742
-Yes, but it doesn't matter.

238
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,542
I think we go left here.

239
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,408
-OK.

240
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:04,308
-Wah!

241
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:05,342
-Uh-oh!

242
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,708
I forgot she didn't
know I could walk.

243
00:09:06,742 --> 00:09:07,842
Oh, well.

244
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,075
If she hasn't recognized
me by now, she won't.

245
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:12,542
-I have never seen a
stuffed animal that walks.

246
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:14,908
-What did you expect
of the Karakura King?

247
00:09:14,942 --> 00:09:15,975
-Amazing!

248
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:17,975
-Hey, I can jump rope
double dutch, too.

249
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:19,608
-Even more amazing!

250
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,242
All my friend Bostov ever
does is sit around in my room

251
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:24,008
and sleep all the time.

252
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:26,875
But for the most part, I think I
know what she's dreaming about.

253
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:29,508
She thinks about having a
boyfriend, or pretty girls'

254
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:30,442
clothes.

255
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:31,475
-Girls without
clothes, you mean.

256
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:33,042
-Soon my heroic team
will be complete,

257
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:35,508
and my resurrection can begin!

258
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:36,208
-That's right!

259
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,508
Whatever he just said!

260
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,008
-Look out!

261
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,475
-Huh?

262
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:40,308
Wah!

263
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:43,542
-What's the big idea?

264
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,575
-Hey, there's still
more tash up here!

265
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:46,842
Huh?

266
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,708
Why'd you throw trash
on those people?

267
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:50,642
-I know this place.

268
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:56,375
-So what kind of training?

269
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:57,775
-I'm glad you asked
that question.

270
00:09:57,808 --> 00:09:58,575
You should join us!

271
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:00,508
-I love how you talk.

272
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:01,908
Oh?

273
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:03,308
-You've gotta be kidding!

274
00:10:03,342 --> 00:10:06,575
The last time I helped you guys,
I was grounded for six months!

275
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:07,575
-Oh, please?

276
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,042
-I've got nothing
against you, Yuzu.

277
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,042
But you?

278
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:11,908
I'll never take
orders from you again!

279
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:12,442
-Oh?

280
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:13,042
-Got that?

281
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:15,708
-For sure?

282
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:20,808
-Somehow I know I'm going
to regret this, but OK.

283
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:23,275
Karakura Red, here we go again!

284
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:26,208
-Jinta, remember what Tessai
does when you goof off?

285
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:29,175
[screaming]

286
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,008
-You're right.

287
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:32,142
I never want to feel that again.

288
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:34,442
-It'll be OK if we do
it together, though.

289
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:35,808
-Huh?

290
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:38,042
-And we'll Be doing something
to help out our neighborhood.

291
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:39,842
Right?

292
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,308
-Oh, all right, all right, I'll
do it, I'll do it, I'll do it!

293
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,208
-Ururu, you're joining, too.

294
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:48,175
Then if we get in trouble,
we'll both get it equally.

295
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,142
-I don't know.

296
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:50,108
-Please, Ururu?

297
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:51,108
It'll be fun.

298
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:52,075
OK?

299
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:53,508
-All right.

300
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,808
KON (THINKING): What kind of
a nightmare superhero team

301
00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:57,175
is this?

302
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,875
A goofball in a clown suit,
a psycho runt, a space cadet?

303
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:01,675
and a monster
disguised as a girl?

304
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:06,308
You guys have got
to be kidding me!

305
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,142
I can't work with these losers.

306
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:09,142
I'm outta here.

307
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:10,242
Wah!

308
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:11,608
-And just where do you
think you're going?

309
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:12,908
-Let's start training.

310
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:16,242
You wouldn't want to miss
out on that, now, would you?

311
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:16,808
-No!

312
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,908
Of course not!

313
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:19,908
I was just about to
suggest that, myself!

314
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:29,509
-All right!

315
00:11:29,543 --> 00:11:31,676
Let's get this training
session started!

316
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:34,076
-Karakura King, are you ready?

317
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:37,943
-What is this supposed to
be training me for, exactly?

318
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:44,176
-10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,
4, 3, 2, 1, blast off!

319
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:46,009
-Ah!

320
00:11:46,043 --> 00:11:47,143
-First exercise successful!

321
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:48,076
-We did it!

322
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:49,043
-Good job!

323
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:53,443
-Now what am I learning?

324
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:55,643
-Learning to be fabulous!

325
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:58,409
-What does that have
to do with anything?

326
00:11:58,443 --> 00:12:01,009
I'm a superhero, not
a giant wedding cake!

327
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:03,443
-Karakura King,a big
and beautiful thing!

328
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:04,543
-Song and dance?

329
00:12:04,576 --> 00:12:07,309
-Karakura King, a big
and beautiful thing.

330
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:08,276
-Wha's this string?

331
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:10,043
-Oh, you shouldn't
pull on that yet.

332
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:11,876
-You should have said
that before I pulled.

333
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:13,709
-You shouldn't have
pulled before you asked.

334
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:14,643
-Huh?

335
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:16,009
Ah!

336
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:17,243
This is not training!

337
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:19,376
This is torture!

338
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:24,076
Why does everything
happen to me?

339
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,009
-Marvelous!

340
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:25,576
-A failure.

341
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:26,743
-Oh, really?

342
00:12:26,776 --> 00:12:27,876
You think so?

343
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:29,309
-It would have been a
lot prettier at night.

344
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:32,043
-I get blown up, and
that's all you care about?

345
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:33,676
I don't have to put
up with this abuse!

346
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,943
I'm through with your training!

347
00:12:35,976 --> 00:12:36,643
-Hey!

348
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:38,009
-Wait, Karakura King!

349
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:39,109
-See ya, losers!

350
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:43,976
-This headache.

351
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:47,909
it must be about to
rain, or something.

352
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:49,276
Yuzu?

353
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:50,709
Not here.

354
00:12:50,743 --> 00:12:51,543
Where'd she go?

355
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:57,309
-Rukia, where are you?

356
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,609
Please come back.

357
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:00,576
I need you to hold me and
save me from these monsters.

358
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:01,976
You don't know the
horrors they're

359
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:04,243
putting me through here.

360
00:13:04,276 --> 00:13:05,809
Come home, Rukia!

361
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:06,676
Huh?

362
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:07,176
No.

363
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:07,643
No.

364
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:08,076
No.

365
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:08,543
No.

366
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:09,009
No!

367
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:09,576
No!

368
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:11,776
No, no, no, no!

369
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:13,676
-Karakura King!

370
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,576
-Karakura King?

371
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:17,709
-Karakura King?

372
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:19,076
Where did he go?

373
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:21,509
-Hm.

374
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:24,109
Disaster, crisis!

375
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:25,809
Spine-tingling suspense.

376
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:27,876
Just when things were
going along so well,

377
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:29,643
fate has reared its
ugly head with the loss

378
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,743
my super team's lovable mascot.

379
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:34,009
My perfect plan lies in ruins!

380
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:36,209
What will I do?

381
00:13:36,243 --> 00:13:37,543
-Have you guys noticed?

382
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:39,143
-He keeps talking to himself?

383
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:40,143
-A lot.

384
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:41,243
-Huh?

385
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:43,576
I'm not about to give
up on the King yet.

386
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:45,643
-But we haven't found a
trace of him anywhere.

387
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:47,443
-If only he'd give us a sign.

388
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:48,876
KON: Help me!

389
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:50,409
-There he is!

390
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:50,909
-Help!

391
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:51,409
Help!

392
00:13:51,443 --> 00:13:52,843
It's got me!

393
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:54,643
-That is one big, bad spirit!

394
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:56,076
-Whoa, it's a hollow!

395
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:57,976
-Way to go, Karakura King!

396
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:58,909
-Huh?

397
00:13:58,943 --> 00:14:00,743
What are you
talking about, girl?

398
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:02,609
-Karakura King can fly, too.

399
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:04,476
Isn't he just the coolest?

400
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:05,676
DON KANONJI: Oh, I forgot.

401
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,609
You can't see him, can you?

402
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:08,876
Well, it doesn't matter.

403
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:10,509
With big trouble
brewing and dark

404
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:12,276
clouds gathering on the horizon.

405
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,109
But when evil rears
its ugly head,

406
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:15,543
there's only one thing to do.

407
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:19,243
And Don Kanonji is
just the man to do it!

408
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,909
I love the sound
of my own voice!

409
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:25,243
So, the first mission for
the newly reformed Karakura

410
00:14:25,276 --> 00:14:27,609
Superheroes is to save
the Karakura King!

411
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:28,443
-Yes, sir!

412
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:30,376
-All right!

413
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,343
-Help me!

414
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:36,709
Ah!

415
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:40,976
Don't eat me!

416
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:41,809
Don't eat me, please!

417
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:43,343
I'm not very tasty.

418
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:45,176
I'm just full of
cotton on the inside.

419
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:46,543
-Ha, ha, ha.

420
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:50,276
Oh, I have no intention
of eating you.

421
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:51,209
-What is this?

422
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:53,109
You mean you can actually talk?

423
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,309
-Of course I can.

424
00:14:54,343 --> 00:14:56,776
-Well, what are you planning
to do with me, then?

425
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,609
-I'm going to take you back
home with me and give you good

426
00:14:59,643 --> 00:15:00,809
lovin'.

427
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:02,876
-I think that might be
worse than getting eaten!

428
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:05,843
-Come on, my little
flat faced lion.

429
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:06,809
-No, no!

430
00:15:06,843 --> 00:15:08,309
No, let me go!

431
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:11,043
-You don't have to do
so afraid, little one.

432
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,309
I'm a professional, you know?

433
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:17,276
-Oh, I can't believe it's really
going to end like this for me.

434
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:19,443
Goodbye, my fair Rukia.

435
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:21,476
Goodbye, my sweet Orihime.

436
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:23,176
Farewell to all
the beautiful girls

437
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:26,276
I never had a chance to meet!

438
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:27,043
-Aw.

439
00:15:27,076 --> 00:15:29,209
-Please make it painless.

440
00:15:29,243 --> 00:15:30,876
-Hold it right there!

441
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:31,709
-What?

442
00:15:31,743 --> 00:15:32,676
-Oh, good!

443
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:34,543
About time you
came to rescue me!

444
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:37,243
[shouting]

445
00:15:37,276 --> 00:15:38,876
-This is a rescue?

446
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:42,043
-The spirits are
always with you!

447
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:44,409
Wah, ha ha ha ha ha!

448
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:54,976
-The burning heart is
the flame of justice!

449
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:58,543
Burning eternal
fire, Karakura Red!

450
00:15:58,576 --> 00:16:01,943
-I'm Karakura Pink.

451
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:04,276
-Um, I, oh, right.

452
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:04,909
Introductions.

453
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:06,809
Well, I'm Yellow.

454
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:08,543
And there's Karakura King!

455
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,243
-How ridiculous you are.

456
00:16:10,276 --> 00:16:12,776
And so foolish, to think you
could stop the love affair

457
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:13,609
I've begun.

458
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:15,976
Little flat face
is all mine now.

459
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:16,909
-Oh, no!

460
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,076
It's even changed
my name already!

461
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:22,176
-Anyone who messes with
my love life gets sliced!

462
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:24,109
-I don't understand.

463
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:25,076
What's happening?

464
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,043
-Yuzu, no!

465
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:27,043
Get away!

466
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:28,909
-She can't see the Hollow.

467
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:29,676
-Well, look here.

468
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:30,509
A willing victmi?

469
00:16:30,543 --> 00:16:32,109
-Where-- where did everyone go?

470
00:16:32,143 --> 00:16:34,576
-Do you want to taste my claw?

471
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:35,776
-Run away!

472
00:16:35,809 --> 00:16:37,709
-Tear at flesh, my claw!

473
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:38,476
-Yuzu!

474
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:39,276
-Karakura Yellow!

475
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:45,809
-Huh?

476
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:46,809
Hey, Karin!

477
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:49,309
-That was close.

478
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:53,243
No wonder I've been
having headaches.

479
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:54,209
-Well, Karakura Red.

480
00:16:54,243 --> 00:16:56,309
You've come to
join us after all.

481
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:58,243
-Hey, I'm Karakura Red!

482
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:00,443
-Don't tell me you guys
are still doing that stuff

483
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,143
and calling yourselves
those silly names.

484
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:03,643
-Listen, I joined
because there were

485
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:05,309
people who needed our help.

486
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:07,309
-What's with Karakura King?

487
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:08,243
-Stealthy.

488
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,676
-Isn't that Yuzu's Bostov doll?

489
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:12,843
-No, that's Karakura King.

490
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:14,843
Karakura King needs
our help, Karin.

491
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:16,709
And you're just
the one to do it.

492
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,643
-You don't know what
you're asking for.

493
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:21,543
-But where are
you my lover lion?

494
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:24,143
Wait for me!

495
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,543
My swetheart!

496
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:26,743
Oh, don't leave me, my love.

497
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:27,876
-All right!

498
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:29,176
Then I'll go take care
of this monster myself!

499
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:29,776
-Huh?

500
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:30,643
Oh, no you don't!

501
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,109
-Wait, you guys!

502
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:34,109
-What do you think you're doing?

503
00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:35,976
-I'm not about to leave
this all up to you!

504
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:37,543
-You've got some
nerve, mocking me!

505
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:39,943
-You're the one who put Yuzu
in danger in the first place.

506
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,009
-Oh, shut up, shut up, shut up!

507
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:43,243
-What would you know about it?

508
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:44,609
You're just a girl!

509
00:17:44,643 --> 00:17:45,576
-Oh, no you didn't!

510
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:47,009
-Oh, yes I did!

511
00:17:47,043 --> 00:17:48,843
-Argh!

512
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,709
-Wait, flat face!

513
00:17:50,743 --> 00:17:51,676
-Huh?

514
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:55,376
[screaming]

515
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,076
-Leave him alone!

516
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,043
He's mine!

517
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,009
-Just get away from
me, all of you!

518
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:00,976
-Now I've got you!

519
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:01,976
-You stay out of this!

520
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:07,876
-I told you to let
me handle this!

521
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:09,809
-Let you mess it up, you mean!

522
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:11,109
-That's your job, clown!

523
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:15,109
-How dare you call me clown!

524
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:16,109
-You little twerp!

525
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:18,043
-Look who's talking, wannabe!

526
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:19,009
-Shut up, stupid!

527
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:21,776
-You're stupid!

528
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,876
-Oh, yeah?

529
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:23,576
Well, you're stupid
for calling me stupid.

530
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:23,976
Oh, really?

531
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:24,843
-Stupid!

532
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:25,509
-And you're even stupider for--

533
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:26,809
-Silence, both of you!

534
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:30,143
Enough of your bickering!

535
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,709
I've had it with you
annoying creatures.

536
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:36,343
I'm going to release my
twister and destroy you!

537
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:37,309
-Whoa!

538
00:18:37,343 --> 00:18:37,809
-Whoa!

539
00:18:37,843 --> 00:18:38,809
A typhoon!

540
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:40,743
-What did I do to deserve this?

541
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:46,176
-Yuzu!

542
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,576
Take my hand!

543
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:50,009
-Yuzu!

544
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:52,543
-They're all falling
right into the center.

545
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:53,676
-I'm spinning and swirling!

546
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,376
I'm getting sucked in!

547
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:56,309
Oh, wow.

548
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,343
I guess I'm all
right, after all.

549
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:01,343
-The Hollow is
down at the center.

550
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:04,309
I've got to throw a
really powerful attack.

551
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:04,809
-Huh?

552
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,243
What now?

553
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:09,843
[mumbling] What
have you done to me?

554
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:10,809
-Do it, Ururu!

555
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:11,509
-Huh?

556
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:13,276
What are you gonna do?

557
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:15,709
-Karakura Storm Serve!

558
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:16,209
-Ah!

559
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:21,443
-Now it's our turn, Karin!

560
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:22,243
Home run!

561
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:27,143
-I got it!

562
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,609
-Yah!

563
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:34,609
-Goal kick!

564
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:37,543
-Why me?

565
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,676
-Huh?

566
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,009
This technique!

567
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:42,676
I think they're using the
legendary Karakura Ultimate

568
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,109
Buster Attack!

569
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:46,743
Yow!

570
00:19:46,776 --> 00:19:49,343
-I guess this is the end for me.

571
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:54,943
I can see eternity
reaching out to suck me in.

572
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:59,776
-How humiliating to
have it end this way!

573
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:00,709
-Where is everyone?

574
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:01,209
-Up there.

575
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,209
-Huh?

576
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,009
-Wah, ha ha ha ha ha!

577
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:07,076
-Listen here, you pervert!

578
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:09,443
You put me down right
now, you hear me?

579
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:18,243
-Is, is this heaven?

580
00:20:18,276 --> 00:20:22,309
If it is, then are you an angel?

581
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:23,109
Oh.

582
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:24,243
Obviously not.

583
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:27,209
-Are you gonna be all
right, Karakura King?

584
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:29,709
-Well, I'm alive, if
that's what you mean.

585
00:20:29,743 --> 00:20:31,076
-Thank goodness.

586
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:33,276
For a minute there, I thought
you sacrificed yourself

587
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:34,943
to save all the rest of us.

588
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:36,043
-Oh, yeah.

589
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:37,643
That was my plan right
from the beginning.

590
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:38,576
Sure.

591
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:39,876
-Now you see the
impressive results

592
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:41,843
of all our hard training!

593
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:42,776
Magnificent!

594
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:46,809
Wah, ha ha ha ha ha!

595
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:48,909
The spirits are always with you!

596
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:51,243
Yeah!

597
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:52,643
[cheering]

598
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:53,609
-All right.

599
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,243
Welcome to a special
edition report,

600
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:58,609
in which I, Don Kanonji, join
the legendary superheroes

601
00:20:58,643 --> 00:21:00,943
of Karakura town
on a brave mission

602
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,243
into the uncharted wilderness!

603
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:04,776
Shock and suspense!

604
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:07,209
-Shock and suspense!

605
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:08,209
-Huh?

606
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:09,409
Hey, Karin!

607
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:11,209
Take a look at what's on
the television right now.

608
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:12,043
It's you!

609
00:21:12,076 --> 00:21:12,976
-Huh?

610
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:15,576
What the-- When
did he shoot this?

611
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:16,709
-Oh, the joy of it.

612
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,609
Here you see one of the
tortured evil spirits

613
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,143
that can never rest!

614
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:23,009
-I wonder how Karakura
King is doing?

615
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:23,976
Huh?

616
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:25,443
-But don't be sad, Bostov.

617
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:27,243
I haven't forgotten you.

618
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:29,043
I'm making you a
brand new outfit

619
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:30,743
so you'll be even prettier.

620
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:31,709
-(THINKING) Oh, joy.

621
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:33,376
I can hardly wait.

622
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:43,748
[theme music]

623
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:46,814
