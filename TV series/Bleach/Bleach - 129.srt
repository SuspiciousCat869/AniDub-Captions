00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:51,595
NARRATOR: Now that Aizen's true
objective has been revealed,

3
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:54,695
the battle between the Soul
Society and Hueco Mundo

4
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:58,362
has intensified and
taken on new urgency.

5
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:01,128
-This winter we shall fight!

6
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,695
Until then, we must
hone our skills,

7
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:07,928
and not rest until we
are prepared for battle!

8
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,462
NARRATOR: Everyone
has begun training

9
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,895
in preparation for the
showdown with Aizen,

10
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:15,562
most notably Ichigo,
Chad, and Uryu.

11
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:19,462
Captain Hitsugaya, along with
Ikkaku, Yumichika, and Rangiku

12
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:22,295
continue to keep watch
over Karakura Town.

13
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:26,162
One evening, a new
Arrancar-like creature appeared.

14
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:28,462
While battling the
Arrancar, Rangiku

15
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:30,028
encountered the
soul of a boy named

16
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:32,362
Shota, whom she
took into her care.

17
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:34,762
But that was just
the first thread

18
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:36,628
in the events that
are about to unravel.

19
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:45,162
-It's that sound!

20
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:48,495
-That same spiritual pressure,
just like the Arrancar

21
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:49,595
from earlier today.

22
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:56,795
Shota, be a good boy and
head back to the house, now.

23
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:59,362
I'm going to find out where
that noise is coming from.

24
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:01,895
-Then I'm going, too.

25
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:02,762
-Listen to me.

26
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:05,462
You can't keep doing this.

27
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:06,862
Wait.

28
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,528
If there was one Arrancar in the
area, there may be more nearby.

29
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:11,928
OK, Shota.

30
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:14,462
You can come with me, but you
have to promise to stay close.

31
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:15,162
-Huh?

32
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,662
OK, sure, Rangiku.

33
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:17,362
I promise.

34
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:18,795
-Then let's get going.

35
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:19,295
-OK!

00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:42,795

38
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:55,628
-No!

39
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:56,328
Stop!

40
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:57,162
Help me!

41
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,562
Please, don't do this!

42
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:03,062
No!

43
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:07,062
RANGIKU Don't move!

[shout]

45
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:10,762
-It looks the same.

46
00:04:10,795 --> 00:04:14,162
And its spiritual pressure is
exactly like the other one.

47
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:14,662
-Hm?

48
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:21,762
[roar]

49
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,162
-Let him go!

[scream]

51
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:25,928
-Dammit!

52
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:26,862
-Rangiku!

53
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:29,662
-Stay right where you are!

54
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:31,928
-I feel the power growing in me!

55
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:33,262
-What's giong on here?

56
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:36,195
I was standing right there
when Ikkaku killed you.

57
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:40,362
Is it possible that there's
more than one of you?

58
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:40,862
-Oh, no.

59
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:51,028
-Take that!

60
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:52,595
You big jerk!

61
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:53,095
-Shota!

62
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:53,595
No!

63
00:04:58,528 --> 00:05:00,462
-Wah!

64
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:01,928
-Shota!

65
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:04,762
-Ah!

66
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:06,662
RANGIKU: Captain!

67
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:09,262
-Take him out.

68
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:09,828
-Yes, Captain.

69
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:18,462
-Growl, Heineko.

70
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:28,095
-It's over for you.

71
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,528
Rangiku, we're taking
this one alive.

72
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,595
-Understood, Captain.

73
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:36,028
[laughter]

74
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:37,862
-What are you laughing at?

75
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:41,562
-You don't really think
you've caught me, do you?

76
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:44,962
[laughter]

77
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:51,762
-Another one?

[roar]

79
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:56,728
-How many are there?

80
00:05:56,762 --> 00:05:58,395
-We're just getting started.

81
00:06:04,262 --> 00:06:07,628
-What the--

82
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:08,995
-They're identical.

83
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:11,128
Now it makes sense.

84
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,995
[scream]

85
00:06:13,028 --> 00:06:13,495

Shota!

87
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:28,562
-It doesn't matter how
many of us you kill.

88
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,728
-What the--

89
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:39,462
YUMICHIKA (OVER RADIO):
This is Yumichika.

90
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:42,362
We've encountered a large
group of these things.

91
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:44,595
We detected the same
spiritual pressure

92
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:46,495
that we felt earlier today.

93
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:48,195
Ikkaku and I followed
it to the source,

94
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:49,928
and now we're completely
surrounded them.

95
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:52,828
Can you explain to us what
the hell is going on here?

96
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:53,962
Come on.

97
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:55,995
I thought Ikkaku killed
this guy already.

98
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:57,228
-So did we.

99
00:06:57,262 --> 00:07:00,028
I think we've got a similar
situation on our hands.

100
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:00,995
-Ikkuak.

101
00:07:01,028 --> 00:07:01,962
Yumichika.

102
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:03,695
We're fighting
another group here.

103
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:04,695
They can multiply.

104
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:05,962
-Huh?

105
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:07,862
HITSUGAYA (OVER RADIO):
Exterminate them immediately.

106
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,062
Kill them all.

107
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:09,995
-You heard the man.

108
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:10,795
-Right.

109
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:11,728
That's how I like my orders.

110
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:13,195
Straight and to the point.

111
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:16,662
-Yah!

112
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:34,328
-I'm not getting
anywhere like this.

113
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:35,195
-All right, Shota.

114
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:36,962
Hold on tight, OK?

115
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:37,462
-Yeah.

116
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,462
-We have to lead them
into an open area

117
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:46,128
where we can deal
with them all at once.

118
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:47,862
-Have you got any ideas?

119
00:07:47,895 --> 00:07:48,662
-Hey!

120
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:50,328
What about that park we saw?

121
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:51,295
-Yes, that's it!

122
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:52,762
[roar]

123
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:53,262
-Rangiku!

124
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:53,862
Go on ahead!

125
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:54,362
-Right!

126
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:14,428
-You have nowhere left to run.

127
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:15,162
It's over!

128
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:28,595
-Now, Captain!

129
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,095
-Hey!

130
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:38,095
You're the ones who have
nowhere left to run.

Hyorinmaru!

133
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,628
-Captain, that was incredible.

134
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:18,828
-Awesome.

135
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:20,928
-Yumichika, Ikkaku.

136
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:23,095
Are you both all right?

137
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:24,128
-Are you kidding me?

138
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:25,495
Those guys may
have looked tough,

139
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:27,195
but we barely broke a sweat.

140
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:30,295
-But still, having to deal
with so many of them at once

141
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:31,328
was somewhat annoying.

142
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:35,195
HITSUGAYA: It's too bad.

143
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:37,128
I wanted to capture at
least one of them alive.

144
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:45,395
-Huh?

145
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:46,028
Could that be--

146
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:49,228
-Shota!

147
00:09:49,262 --> 00:09:49,962
What is it?

148
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:06,328
-Yui.

149
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:07,562
Yui.

150
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:10,495
Yui!

151
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:11,428
-Shota.

152
00:10:11,462 --> 00:10:13,428
What's wrong?

153
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:15,162
-This is her.

154
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:18,462
This is my sister, Yui.

155
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,362
-What?

156
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:21,462
-Yui.

157
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:21,962
Yui!

158
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:42,676
-There's nothing
unusual about this girl,

159
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,143
from what I can tell.

160
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,476
She's a normal soul.

161
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:46,143
-I see.

162
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:47,209
-It's all right, Yui.

163
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:48,309
We're safe here.

164
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:49,943
Everything's going to be OK.

165
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:53,209
-When you refused the Konso, it
wasn't because you were scared,

166
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:54,376
was it?

167
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:55,776
You wanted to come so you
could find your sister.

168
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:03,243
-Shota, please tell
us what happened.

169
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:04,443
-We just left.

170
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:06,643
We were all in the car.

171
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:11,509
Mom and Dad were up front,
and we were in back.

172
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:14,209
Going to the amusement park.

173
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:20,209

-See?

176
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:32,276
I'm getting better.

177
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:33,643
Didn't that sound pretty?

178
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:34,609
-Yeah, right.

179
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:36,043
It sounded pretty bad.

180
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:39,476
-That's not true,
and you know it!

181

[crash]

184
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:55,909
-When I woke up, this chain
was attached to my chest,

185
00:11:55,943 --> 00:11:58,243
and I knew my Mom
and Dad were gone.

186
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:01,676
-So, that's why you were so
determined to find your sister.

187
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:12,943
-Um-- You're awake!

188
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:16,843
Yui, do-- do you
remember who I am?

189
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:19,643
-My big brother.

190
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:20,743
-You remember.

191
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:21,709
You're OK!

192
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:29,809
-Now, all we need
to do is figure out

193
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:32,076
why she suddenly appeared
out of nowhere back there

194
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:34,076
in that park.

195
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:37,009
Do you have any idea how
that could have happened?

196
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:39,909
-I, uh--

197
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:40,609
-It's OK.

198
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:44,309
You can tell us.

199
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:45,209
-Jushiro.

200
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:46,909
-Captain Hitsugaya.

201
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,843
It sounds as if you've had
your hands full down there.

202
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:51,343
-Have you found something out?

203
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:52,643
Tell us what it is.

204
00:12:52,676 --> 00:12:55,809
-It has to do with the
Arrancars you encountered.

205
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:58,576
Since I'm not fully
qualified to talk about this,

206
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,776
I'll let someone from the
Department of Research

207
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:02,776
and Development explain things.

208
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,343
-Good afternoon,
Captain Hitsugaya.

209
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:06,409
My name is Akon.

210
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:08,176
According to reports
we've received,

211
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:10,809
the Arrancar you
defeated has reappeared.

212
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:12,176
-Yes.

213
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,743
It has the power to duplicate,
which I've witnessed myself.

214
00:13:14,776 --> 00:13:17,043
We were able to lure them
all to a central location

215
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:19,976
and kill them, but I'm not
sure that that's the end of it.

216
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,943
-I'd be surprised
if it was, Captain.

217
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,476
-What have you found out?

218
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:27,276
-When I analyzed the spiritual
pressure in the area,

219
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:29,576
each of them had the exact
same spiritual pressure

220
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,909
as the first Arrancar
like creature.

221
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:34,343
So what you encountered
were not separate Arrancars

222
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:36,309
that were created
through duplication,

223
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:38,376
but rather multiple
parts which combine

224
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,043
to form a single entity.

225
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:43,809
-So you're saying that they all
share a single consciousness?

226
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:44,809
-Yes.

227
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:46,509
If our theory is
correct, this Arrancar

228
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:49,943
is able to utilize multiple
clones at the same time,

229
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:52,743
giving it the ability to
absorb a large number of souls

230
00:13:52,776 --> 00:13:54,309
very quickly.

231
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:57,043
-It sounds to me like
they're working as a team.

232
00:13:57,076 --> 00:13:57,976
-True.

233
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,376
We think the main
body is probably

234
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:02,843
hiding somewhere safe, while
issuing orders to its clones.

235
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,109
-That makes it tough.

236
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,509
-Well, is there
anything we can do

237
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,843
to figure out the
location of the nest?

238
00:14:07,876 --> 00:14:11,209
-We've been trying, but
it's difficult to pinpoint.

239
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:13,309
In your report you
mentioned a whistling sound.

240
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:14,243
Is that right?

241
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:16,209
Just before the
Arrancar appears?

242
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:17,043
-Yes.

243
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:18,776
It's almost a flute-like sound.

244
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:21,776
We always hear it just
before the Arrancar shows up.

245
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:27,609
[whistling]

246
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:30,443
RANGIKU: The sound seems to
have an effect on the soul,

247
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:34,943
giving the Arrancar control
over the victim's movements.

248
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:36,643
-I'm hoping when we
analyze the sound,

249
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,476
it will give us
some sort of clue.

250
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:41,143
Perhaps tell us where
the Arrancar will appear.

251
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:43,676
-Thank you.

252
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,376
This just gets more
and more complicated.

253
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:48,809
-Hey, guys.

254
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:50,076
We picked up some takeout.

255
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:51,976
-Can you believe that place?

256
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:53,843
I'm telling you, the
convenience store

257
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,643
is the greatest invention ever.

258
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:57,809
The place even has
rice balls, and you

259
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:00,643
can get all this
stuff 24 hours a day.

260
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:01,809
-About time.

261
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:03,676
They finally got back
with the food, Captain.

262
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:06,609
I say we eat first, and
once we're all full,

263
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:09,776
then we can think of a plan.

264
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,209
[belch]

265
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,476
IKKAKU: I'm stuffed.

266
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,543
-Now then, I know it's
not much, but that's

267
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:17,876
all the information we have
about the Arrancar, so we'll

268
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:19,876
just have to get
by as best we can.

269
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,109
Here's what I'm thinking.

270
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:23,309
Our best plan of attack will
be to spread ourselves out

271
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:25,976
over a large area and see
if we can get its attention.

272
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,043
We need to be
ready for anything.

273
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:29,109
-Good.

274
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,676
That sounds pretty
straightforward to me.

275
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:33,409
-This should keep me from
getting bored for awhile.

276
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,609
-We'll all take turns
patrolling the town.

277
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,743
Rangiku, you stay here.

278
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:39,476
And watch them.

279
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,776
-Yes, captain.

280
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:45,609
-So why aren't we
performing a Konso on them?

281
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:46,909
-What does he mean?

282
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,043
-No.

283
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:49,843
There'll be time
enough for that later.

284
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,409
-Why wait?

285
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:55,543
-I know why.

286
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:58,076
Because the captain
has a kind heart.

287
00:15:58,109 --> 00:15:59,276
-What?

288
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:01,476
-These two have just found
each other again, right?

289
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:04,643
He wants to give them some time
together before they pass on.

290
00:16:04,676 --> 00:16:06,109
-How, nice, Captain.

291
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,943
-Give it a rest.

292
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:08,809
Let's get going.

293
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:03,909
-Shota.

00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:12,009
[sigh]

295
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:13,576
RANGIKU: That felt so good.

296
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:18,543
Nothing like a hot bath
before going out on patrol.

297
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:19,043
Huh?

298
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:22,676
Hey.

00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,343
How's Yui?

300
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,276
-She's still sleeping.

301
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:29,543
-Tell me, what's going on?

302
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:32,209
Aren't you happy to have
your sister back again?

-Come on.

There's something you're
not telling me, isn't there?

306
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:40,709
Shota, I saw your face
when my Captain asked you

307
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,176
about what happened in the park.

308
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:44,076
How Yui just appeared like that.

309
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:49,709
It's OK.

310
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:51,676
Maybe if you tell me about
it, I'll be able to help you.

311
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,576
-It's nothing.

312
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:56,376
Really.

313
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,809
-You can tell me, Shota.

314
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:58,609
-Stop asking!

315
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:02,609
It's none of your business!

-Yui!

-Shota!

337
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,876
How can you be so
sure she's here?

338
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,843
-I just know!

339
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:24,476
-That's it.

340
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:25,343
It's the Arrancar.

341
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:29,309
Shota!

342
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:33,643
-Wait!

343
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:46,843
Where did it go?

[whimpering]

345
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:55,576
-Hey.

346
00:19:58,676 --> 00:19:59,376
You're OK.

347
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:00,309
It's gone.

348
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:02,509
Everything's going
to be all right.

349
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:05,643
Did you just see a monster?

350
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:07,009
You don't have to worry.

351
00:20:07,043 --> 00:20:09,509
I'm not going to
let it hurt you.

[whimpering]

353

354
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:14,509
Damn.

355
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:27,409
-Shota, wait a minute.

356
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:29,443
I too dangerous for us here.

357
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:30,209
We've got to go.

358
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:31,943
-I won't leave.

359
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:33,176
-Come on.

360
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:35,876
We need to go back home,
and let the others find Yui.

361
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:37,776
-I'm not going back!

362
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:38,509
Not without Yui.

363
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:39,276
She's my sister.

364
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,509
I've got to protect her.

365
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:42,776
-Listen to me.

366
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:43,476
You've got to--

[creaking]

368
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:04,509
-Yui.

369
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:05,276
-How did she--

370
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:09,276
-Yui.

371
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,443
Why did you leave the house?

372
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,743
-I don't know why I left.

373
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,743
I just wanted to come
here, that's all.

374
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,643
Shota.

375
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:29,276
Now that you're with
me, I feel a lot better.

376
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:32,509
I don't have to
be afraid anymore.

377

[laughter]

378
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:36,476
-It's my fault.

379
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:43,576
I ran away.

380
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,409
-Huh?

381
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:49,676
-I ran away, and left my
sister here all alone.

382
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,043
It's all my fault!

384
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,923
IKKAKU: The Arrancar multiplies,
so as long as one is around,

385
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:48,023
it can keep duplicating.

386
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:48,957
YUMICHIKA: What a coincidence.

387
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,223
I've just realized
the same thing.

388
00:23:50,257 --> 00:23:51,923
We'll never get bored
fighting something like that.

389
00:23:51,957 --> 00:23:54,223
IKKAKU: We have got to
catch one of those things!

00:23:54,257 --> 00:23:55,923
RANGIKU: You guys need to relax.

up with these stupid ideas?
