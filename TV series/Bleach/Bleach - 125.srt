NARRATOR: Soul Reapers,
the spiritual guardians

3
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,995
to the world of the living.

4
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:56,228
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

5
00:01:56,262 --> 00:02:01,028
of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

6
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:03,162
Ichigo sought out the
Visoreds with hopes

7
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:04,762
of increasing his power.

8
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:07,795
Shinji guided Ichigo
to his inner world,

9
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,528
where he was forced to
face his Hollow self.

10
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:12,462
-I am Zangetsu!

11
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:20,028
NARRATOR: Byakuya and Jin
Kariya appeared before Ichigo

12
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:21,128
as illusions.

13
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:23,162
They questioned his
resolve, as well as

14
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:27,362
his determination
to truly fight.

15
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:30,195
Finally, Ichigo confronted
his Hollow self,

16
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:33,962
who viciously ran him through.

17
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:36,695
-Which means I'll be king.

18
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:48,362
ICHIGO: What the--
where am I now?

19
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:57,562
[shout]

20
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:00,795
-So, it looks like you're
finally awake, eh, kid?

21
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:02,295
Thought you might be dead.

22
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:08,295
-Kenpachi.

23
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:11,795
So, you're next, huh?

24
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:12,928
-Kenpachi?

25
00:03:12,962 --> 00:03:15,695
Who the hell is that?

26
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:19,628
Makes no difference, because
I'm here to kill you!

27
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:41,795
[growl]

28
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:54,828
-Well, it looks like he's
completely Hollowfied now.

29
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:55,762
Who would've thought?

30
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:02,362
LISA (VOICEOVER): By the
time Love began his turn,

31
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:04,762
60 minutes had already passed.

32
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:08,928
Shouldn't be long now
before it's my turn.

33
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:09,828
Kensei.

34
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:11,028
-Hm?

35
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:12,928
-What's the longest amount
of time any one of us

36
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:16,128
has taken to control our Hollow?

37
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:20,295
-It was Hiyori, at 69
minutes, 2 seconds.

38
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,928
-How many minutes
has it been now?

39
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,062
-68 minutes.

40
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:27,395
And 44 seconds.

41
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:28,362
LISA: I see.

42
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:40,595
-Why are you doing this?

43
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:44,495
Cut it out!

44
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:46,628
We settled things
a long time ago.

45
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,162
There's no reason
for us to fight!

46
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:51,928
-Settle things?

47
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:55,095
One thing was never settled.

48
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,028
This is a battle with
swords, not some fist fight.

49
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:00,262
As long as one of us
is still breathing,

50
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:01,995
then this fight's not over.

51
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:03,995
-You're making this
a fight to the death?

52
00:05:04,028 --> 00:05:04,595
Why?

53
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:06,495
There's no reason.

54
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:09,228
-You mean you need
a reason to fight?

55
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:17,495
Why don't you just
accept it, Ichigo?

56
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:20,828
You enjoy fighting
as much as I do.

57
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,495
you cave power.

58
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:25,862
Isn't that right, Ichigo?

59
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:29,328
And anyone who truly
loves power loves

60
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,595
to measure that power in battle.

61
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:33,262
It's a simple fact.

62
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:36,728
The question is, do we fight
in order to gain more power,

63
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:40,095
or do we gain more
power in order to fight?

64
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:42,762
I haven't figured it out yet.

65
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:43,962
But who cares?

66
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,395
Because one thing
is for certain.

67
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:49,728
There is no reason we should
ever deny it, or try to change.

68
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:52,028
Because we were born this way!

69
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:56,928
You have always wanted to fight,
and you always will, Ichigo.

70
00:05:56,962 --> 00:05:58,162
It's part of you.

71
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:01,195
You do it instinctively.

72
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:04,695
You have no choice but to fight.

73
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:08,128
Because it's the only
way to gain power.

74
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:10,262
Fight, Ichigo!

75
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:13,262
If you want to control
that power, take your sword

76
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:15,195
and cut down your enemies.

77
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:17,028
There is no other path.

78
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:19,762
No way to move forward.

79
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:22,662
Or back.

80
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:23,228
Fight, Ichigo!

81
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:01,362
-It's a Cero!

82
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:03,562
Look out!

83
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:05,928
-Don't worry.

84
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:07,795
-Do you think he's going
to have to Hollowfy?

85
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:08,428
-Of course.

86
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:09,962
He's not an idiot.

87
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:12,228
Even Love must
Hollowfy to block that.

88
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:13,995
The spiritual pressure
is too intense.

89
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:24,428
[roar]

90
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:27,928
-What's going on?

91
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:28,928
-Hachi!

92
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:32,862
Get love out of the barrier now!

93
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:36,362
[scream]

94
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:05,195
-Damn.

95
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,195
What do you know?

96
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:11,562
I guess I must have
been wrong about you.

97
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:14,462
Looks like you still have a
little of that killer instinct,

98
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,295
after all.

99
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:22,295
Fine.

100
00:08:22,328 --> 00:08:24,128
You've defeated me.

101
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:26,128
You have won the fight for now.

102
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:28,128
I guess I've no choice.

103
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:30,128
I'll have to accept
you as the king.

104
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:32,562
Still, I wouldn't
want you to forget.

105
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,295
While you're strutting around
like a king on his horse,

106
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:38,228
I can take that crown
away at any time.

107
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:41,262
I'll keep an eye on you, and
the moment I sense the slightest

108
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:45,228
weakness, I'll toss you to the
ground, stomp on your skull,

109
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:46,695
and crush it like an egg!

110
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,695
Just one last piece
of advice before I go.

111
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:55,695
If you're serious about
controlling my power,

112
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:59,095
then all you have to
remember is one thing.

113
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:01,895
Don't get yourself killed
before we meet again!

114
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,695
-Now, Hachi.

115
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:48,495
-As you command.

116
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:06,662
-He's looking pretty
banged up, Hachi.

117
00:10:06,695 --> 00:10:08,062
You think he'll be all right?

118
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:08,562
-Shh.

119
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:16,395
-So how do you feel now?

120
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:25,862
-Fine.

121
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:26,995
Not bad at all.

122
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:33,028
-Very good.

123
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:40,728
-Don't forget, I'll
keep an eye on you,

124
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:43,062
and the moment I sense
the slightest weakness,

125
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:46,195
I'll toss you to the
ground, stomp on your skull,

126
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,162
and crush you like an egg!

127
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:07,928
-Sorry to break it to ya, but
that's not going to happen.

128
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:28,630
-Ichigo wasn't in
school again today,

129
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,863
and it's not like him to
be missing for two days.

130
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:38,163
When I concentrate, I can
sense his spiritual pressure.

131
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:41,763
And it's still strong, so I
guess he must be all right.

132
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:44,030
If I know Ichigo, he
probably just went off

133
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:45,830
to do some kind of
training in secret

134
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:47,996
because he doesn't want
anyone to bother him.

135
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,163
And if that's all he's
doing, then I probably

136
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:52,830
shouldn't go looking for him.

137
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:54,430
Rukia must be worried, too.

138
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,063
I wonderif he disappeared
without saying anything to her?

139
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,263
Wh-- what am I doing?

140
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:08,696
Would you listen to me?

141
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,430
This is so depressing.

142
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:14,430
I need to figure out what
I want to do this weekend!

143
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,196
Ha ha!

144
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,696
Oh!

145
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,463
I know.

146
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:17,996
I'll give Tatsuki a call.

147
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,596
She said she wanted
to go out and find

148
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,796
something interesting to eat.

149
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,530
Rice cream.

150
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:24,463
Skewered donuts.

151
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,896
And yokon steaks!

152
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:31,730
[chatter]

153
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:33,730
-Oh, yeah.

154
00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:35,663
I just remembered,
Tatsuki really

155
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:39,496
hasn't been herself lately.

156
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,563
-Oh.

157
00:12:40,596 --> 00:12:42,863
It's good to see you
back home, Orihime.

158
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:43,830
-Thanks.

159
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,463
It's good to be
home, Mrs. Shimura.

160
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,763
-I've been meaning
to ask you something.

161
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:49,363
It's about your
two young friends,

162
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:50,963
the ones who've been visiting.

163
00:12:50,996 --> 00:12:54,096
Now, I don't mean to pry, but
are you sure they're all right?

164
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,430
-Uh, sure.

165
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:56,830
Why do you ask?

166
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:59,496
-Well, I wasn't spying, but I
couldn't help but notice them

167
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,163
carrying something
odd into your place.

168
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:16,330
-Whoa.

169
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,463
That's really cool.

170
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:19,030
No!

171
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:19,863
I mean not cool!

172
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:20,730
What's going on?

173
00:13:20,763 --> 00:13:21,763
-Damn.

174
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:22,830
She couldn't have
picked a worse time

175
00:13:22,863 --> 00:13:24,030
to walk through that
door if she'd tried.

176
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:28,230
-I'm sorry.

177
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:29,430
Thank you for waiting.

178
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:31,296
You've reached the call
center for the Department

179
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,030
of Research and Development.

180
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,663
-Tell him Toshiro Hitsugaya,
captain of Squad 10,

181
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:36,230
is calling.

182
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:36,996
-Yes, sir.

183
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,930
He's expecting your call.

184
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:41,830
-It's the Head Captain.

185
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,963
-I must commend you for taking
care of this so quickly,

186
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:46,863
Captain Hitsugaya.

187
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:49,963
The recent development made it
imperative that we establish

188
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,630
this emergency channel
as soon as possible.

189
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:57,563
We have discovered Sosuke
Aizen's true objective.

190
00:13:57,596 --> 00:13:58,996
-That's what this is about?

191
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,930
So you've found out
what Aizen's after?

192
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:02,830
-Mm.

193
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:05,463
We have, indeed.

194
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:06,763
-You know what?

195
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:08,996
It sounds like you guys are
discussing important Soul

196
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,930
Reaper stuff, so I'll
just go outside, OK?

197
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:15,096
-Wait a moment.

198
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,730
Unfortunately, the matter
I'm about to discuss

199
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:20,830
concerns you humans as well.

200
00:14:20,863 --> 00:14:25,163
You should hear
what I have to say.

201
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:27,796
-Yes, sir.

202
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,530
-As you may know, Sosuke
Aizen disappeared months ago,

203
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:35,196
and since then we have launched
an extensive investigation.

204
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,696
We've had teams scouring the
Squad 5 captain's room where

205
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,896
Aizen lived, the underground
assembly hall of Central 46,

206
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,130
the Seijoto Kyorin,
where he hid himself

207
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:48,363
after his feigned death.

208
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:50,596
And even the Daireisho
Archive, where

209
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,696
after countless hours of
sifting through all the data,

210
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,896
Captain Ukitake
discovered something.

211
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,096
-Hey.

212
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,463
You're working hard.

213
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:03,663
-Shunsui and Nano.

214
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:04,896
What are you doing here?

215
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,963
-We had some free
time, so we thought

216
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:09,063
we'd come down here
and help you out.

217
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:10,830
-Hopefully we can
help you find whatever

218
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:12,596
it is you've been looking for.

219
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,263
-Thank you.

220
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,030
MAN: Captain!

221
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:19,230
We just found some
traces of Captain Aizen's

222
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:21,063
spiritual pressure!

223
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:23,963
-I'm sending the data over
to your monitor right now!

224
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:28,530
-The Hogyoku.

225
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:29,463
Look at that.

226
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:30,696
See?

227
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,163
He accessed all the research
and data related to it.

228
00:15:33,196 --> 00:15:34,096
-Yeah.

229
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,430
Since that's what
Aizen was after,

230
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:38,130
it only makes sense that he'd
be poking around in there.

231
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:39,196
-But look at this one.

232
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,096
It's different from
all of the others.

233
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,730
This information
here is completely

234
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:43,763
unrelated to the Hogyoku.

235
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,663
-This is--

236
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,396
-The information
Captain Aizen had

237
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,230
ben looking at-- what was it?

238
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:04,063
-The Oken.

239
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:16,096
-Um, what exactly is an Oken?

240
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,363
-The literal translation
is the royal key.

241
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,363
You may not have known,
but the Soul Society

242
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:24,230
has a royal family.

243
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:27,430
We do have a king, but he had
placed Central 46 in charge

244
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:29,863
of governing the Soul
Society, and the royal family

245
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:31,830
chose never to get involved.

246
00:16:31,863 --> 00:16:34,696
Neither the captain
nor myself, none of us

247
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,030
have actually seen the
royal family in person.

248
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,130
-Indeed.

249
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:42,096
Our king is called the
Reio, or Soul King.

250
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,596
Not only is he
revered, he is also

251
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,263
an important symbolic figure
within the Soul Society.

252
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:52,330
The royal palace is located in
a completely separate dimension,

253
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:55,496
and is guarded by its own
private force, an elite group

254
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,030
known as the Royal
Security Guards.

255
00:16:58,063 --> 00:17:00,896
And the Oken is the
key that opens the gate

256
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,663
to the dimension where
the royal palace is.

257
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:06,363
-If that's true, and
Aizen's after the key,

258
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:08,230
that means he wants to--

259
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:10,096
-Murder the king.

260
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,730
I'm afraid we must assume
that is his motive.

261
00:17:13,763 --> 00:17:17,230
However, I believe there
is a more immediate threat.

262
00:17:17,263 --> 00:17:18,896
-Could there have
been any information

263
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,063
in the book Aizen was looking
at that would lead him

264
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,896
to the location of the Oken?

265
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,996
-Not exactly.

266
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,363
The location of the
Oken is a secret

267
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:29,896
that has been passed down from
one head captain of the 13

268
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,396
Court Guard Squads to
the next for generations.

269
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,496
There has never
been, nor ever shall

270
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,530
be a written record
of its whereabouts.

271
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:42,096
The document Aizen was looking
at dealt not with the location,

272
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,496
but the creation of the Oken.

273
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,796
He now possesses the
knowledge with which

274
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,063
to create the royal key.

275
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:52,730
-The Oken Codex.

276
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:55,296
The materials required
to create an Oken

277
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,396
are 100,000 souls and a jureichi
one spirit mile in diameter.

278
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,963
A jureichi is an
enriched spirit zone

279
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:04,530
found in the world
of the living.

280
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:07,296
Its location changes over time.

281
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,496
Because it is so
spiritually charged,

282
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,996
it's an area spirits
are drawn to.

283
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,030
-Nanao, is there any
way to figure out

284
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:17,096
the current location
of the jureichi?

285
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,330
-Of course.

286
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,830
It'll only take a minute.

287
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:28,763
-I don't believe it.

288
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:30,530
HEAD CAPTAIN: Perhaps
you understand now.

289
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:35,430
The jureichi that Aizen
is after is Karakura Town.

290
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:46,963
I realize 100,000 souls and the
jureichi with a radius of one

291
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:50,196
spirit mile may seem
like abstract concepts

292
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,696
and be difficult for
you to visualize,

293
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,063
so I'll put it in
more concrete terms.

294
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:59,130
If Aizen is able to follow
the instructions which he now

295
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:03,130
possesses, and he succeeds
in completing the Oken,

296
00:19:03,163 --> 00:19:06,563
Karakura Town, the land
on which it stands,

297
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:08,863
and every person
living there, will

298
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:13,463
be carved out of this world
and erased from existence.

299
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:14,430
-No.

300
00:19:14,463 --> 00:19:17,930
That's not possible.

301
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:21,296
But-- isn't there
anything you can do?

302
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,530
Isn't there some
way to stop him?

303
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,496
HEAD CAPTAIN: We
will find a way.

304
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,163
The 13 Court Guard Squads were
created for this very purpose.

305
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:44,263
Thankfully, we still have
a little time to work with.

306
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:47,396
According to Captain
Kurotsuchi's report,

307
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,330
the Hogyoku remains a dormant
state for a period of time

308
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:53,730
after being released
from its seal.

309
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:56,263
There is nothing Aizen
can do to change that.

310
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:00,330
We believe it will take
four months to fully awaken.

311
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:02,830
Aizen will be unable
to assemble his forces

312
00:20:02,863 --> 00:20:05,230
until the Hogyoku
has fully awakened.

313
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:09,463
Then he will make his move.

314
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:12,930
This winter we shall flight.

315
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:16,463
Until then we must
hone our skills,

316
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:19,530
and not rest until we
are prepared for battle.

317
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:21,630
-Yes, sir.

318
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:26,963
-Now as for you, Orihime
Inoue, since Aizen's objective

319
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:29,196
is the world of the
living, the area

320
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,263
may be too large for us
to handle by ourselves.

321
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:34,030
We will need the
world of the living

322
00:20:34,063 --> 00:20:36,696
to gather its strength as well.

323
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,930
Go.

324
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:42,996
I want you to inform Ichigo
Kurosaki of this matter.

325
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:43,996
-Yes, sir.

326
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:50,563
-I'll find Ikkaku and make sure
that everyone else is notified.

327
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:51,263
-Good.

328
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:52,596
I'll give you a hand.

329
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,963
-Wait.

330
00:20:53,996 --> 00:20:56,963
I was wondering if I might have
a moment of your time, Captain

331
00:20:56,996 --> 00:20:58,463
Hitsugaya?

332
00:20:58,496 --> 00:21:00,896
I realize there are
urgent matters at hand,

333
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,730
but there is
someone here who has

334
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,530
been waiting to speak with you.

335
00:21:12,196 --> 00:21:12,930
-It can't be.

336
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:24,296
-Is that it?

337
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,596
Have you had enough,
Yasutora Sado?

338
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:33,463
Considering the fact
that the sun's still out,

339
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:36,463
it's a little early to
be calling it a day.

340
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,130
-I'm not done yet.

341
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,130
-Now you're talkin'.

342
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,596
-Where are they?

343
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:58,596
Ichigo.

344
00:22:13,092 --> 00:22:16,558
[theme music]

345
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:46,575
RANGIKU: Orihime, since we've
got such a huge wide screen,

346
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:47,975
what do you say we go
out and rent something?

347
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:49,741
ORIHIME: There's a new comedy
I've been dying to see.

348
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:50,741
RANGIKU: Sounds good.

349
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:51,875
HITSUGAYA: Listen, you two.

350
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:53,508
That's not what this was
meant to be used for.

351
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:54,508
RANGIKU: Don't worry.

352
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,475
I'll rent one of
those kids' anime DVDs

353
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:57,241
that you like so much.

354
00:23:57,275 --> 00:23:58,408
HITSUGAYA: Rangiku.
