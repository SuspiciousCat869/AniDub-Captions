00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:49,174
-I can't believe we got stuck
guarding such a boring place.

3
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:51,174
-They say there are a
lot of bizarre things

4
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:53,107
in the Department of
Research and Development.

5
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:54,641
Some of them must be
dangerous, or they

6
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:56,807
wouldn't have posted us here.

7
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:59,207
-It's still boring.

8
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,441
Huh?

9
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:01,474
Hey.

10
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:02,174
-Huh?

11
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:06,341
-Who is that?

12
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:13,074
-A Ryoka!

13
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,774
-It's a fine day today.

14
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,607
-Please keep up the good work.

15
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,374
-Yes, ma'am.

[explosion]

17
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:43,841
-Hm.

18
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:45,541
Lieutenant.

19
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:47,341
What could that be?

20
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:49,241
-I don't know.

21
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:52,807
But whatever it is, it
has immense spirit energy

22
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:55,807
and it's coming this way.

23
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:56,807
-Lieutenant.

24
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:58,741
We have a report
of Ryoka nearby.

25
00:02:58,774 --> 00:02:59,807
We are here to intercept them.

26
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:31,741
-Feel that?

27
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:33,507
Something's different.

28
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,507
The spiritual
pressure just changed.

29
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,307
-Yes.

30
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:39,307
It's hard to tell for sure
because of all the battles

31
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,574
going on all over the place,
but the presence of oneof

32
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:43,674
the bounts just vanished.

33
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:47,107
And now I'm getting
a different one.

34
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,074
-What's the matter now?

35
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:50,507
-I think--

36
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:51,641
-It's Kariya.

37
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:53,274
-Ah huh.

38
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:55,507
-He's finally revealed himself.

39
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,674
-Which way?

40
00:03:56,707 --> 00:03:58,241
-Uh, it's that way!

41
00:03:58,274 --> 00:03:59,341
-All right.

42
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:00,607
Hey Chad.

43
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,474
-Ichigo.

44
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,441
-What's happening?

45
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:03,474
Are you all right?

46
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:04,807
-I'm fine.

47
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:06,674
No problem.

48
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:08,374
-You sense the Bount.

49
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:09,574
Just like us.

50
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:10,541
-Yes.

51
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:11,374
There's no doubt about it.

52
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:12,774
It's Kariya.

53
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:14,307
-Let's go.

54
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:14,741
-You're right.

55
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:15,674
No time to lose.

56
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,541
-So, this is all there is?

57
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:25,574
Haven't you got anyone
worth fighitng around here?

58
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,074
-Get her!

59
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:27,774
-Nieder.

60
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:29,107
-Leave them to me.

61
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:29,407
-Hi-yah!

62
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:35,274
Huh?

63
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:48,741
-So the Quincy boy has returned.

64
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:09,774
What an annoying child.

65
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:39,374
So now you're trying
to lure me in, are you?

66
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,474
That's interesting.

67
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,741
Let's see what you're up to.

68
00:05:56,674 --> 00:06:01,474
You just never learn, do you?

69
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:03,507
When are you gonna give
up on this quest of yours

70
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,441
for revenge?

71
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:06,841
URYU: This isn't about revenge.

72
00:06:06,874 --> 00:06:08,274
-Huh?

73
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:11,541
-Even if it were,
who are you to talk?

74
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:14,274
Why do you proceed when there
is no point to this fight?

75
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,474
-Huh?

76
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:17,441
What are you talking about?

77
00:06:17,474 --> 00:06:18,841
And for that matter,
I could ask you

78
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:22,441
why a Quincy would be taking
sides with Soul Reapers.

79
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:23,741
I always thought
that the two of you

80
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:26,374
were supposed to
be mortal enemies.

81
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:27,707
-I'm not.

82
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,807
I've never allied myself
with the Soul Reapers.

83
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:35,374
For me, the goal is to try
and stop senseless violence.

84
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:37,641
-You're not making
any sense at all.

85
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:38,807
-Perhaps.

86
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:46,341
But on my honor as a Quincy,
I will put a stop to this.

87
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:48,107
-Well, then good.

88
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,607
If you really want to
die so badly, I can help.

89
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:52,807
ICHIGO: Ran'Tao.

90
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:55,074
I assume you know about Uryu
and about his special Quincy

91
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:56,541
accessory.

92
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:59,641
How long do you believe
that'll keep on working?

93
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:02,541
-I'm afraid there's
no way of knowing.

94
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:06,407
It could become useless today,
or it could be tomorrow.

95
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,241
With all the destructive
energy it has,

96
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:10,541
it's conceivable that it
could obliterate everything

97
00:07:10,574 --> 00:07:13,307
inside a 20 square mile radius
if it goes off accidentally.

98
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:20,374
-(IN HEAD): I made up my mind.

99
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:23,507
I decided I was
going to do this,

100
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,441
no matter what might happen.

101
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:32,441
I know that somehow, these
Bounts have to be stopped.

102
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:34,107
Here I come!

103
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:34,741
-Enjoy your death!

104
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,541
-Now you shall
witness my true power.

105
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:51,674
My, my.

106
00:07:51,707 --> 00:07:54,741
That wasn't a very
good shot at all.

107
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,141
-Damn.

108
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:57,207
-He's just a boy, after all.

109
00:07:57,241 --> 00:08:00,274
What do you expect?

110
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:02,207
-I expect him to die.

111
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,341
Well, at least he's
fast, if nothing else.

112
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:20,441
Why have you ended our fusion?

113
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:22,107
-Oh, just shut.

114
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:24,474
You know I hate the
feeling of being fused

115
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:26,174
with you for the length
of a whole battle.

116
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:28,107
-You tell him.

117
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,474
I know exactly what you mean.

118
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:32,574
-That's cold!

119
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:36,641
-So, what are you planning
to try next, Quincy boy?

120
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:38,741
-(IN HEAD) The way
things are going,

121
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:41,641
all I can hope to do is
keep dodging her attacks.

122
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:43,841
That'll have to do.

123
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:45,441
-If you won't
attack, then I will.

124
00:08:50,707 --> 00:08:55,274
-That was a pretty
lame shot, Quincy boy.

125
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:56,674
-(IN HEAD) Damn it.

126
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:58,607
Just when I need it most,
my power keeps dropping.

127
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,541
It's definitely unstable.

128
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:05,607
Even if I hit her, it would
probably have no effect.

129
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,741
My reishi level decreased
just before my third attack.

130
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:18,207
That's why the arrow had no
velocity when I released it.

131
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:21,641
I know that when I absorb enough
reishi, and I'm at full power,

132
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:25,107
I have the ability to
destroy my opponent.

133
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:31,474
But when I absorb
too much reishi,

134
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:34,441
there's also the danger that the
arrow could go off accidentally

135
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:37,407
and destory everything
in the vicinity.

136
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:42,207
And of course, it'll also blow
away the person who fired it.

137
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:43,707
-What's wrong, Quincy?

138
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:47,674
Are you brooding over the
last minutes of your life?

139
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:49,241
-(IN HEAD) Can I do this?

140
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:51,541
Is it possible for me
to control this arrow?

141
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,507
I've got to.

142
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:57,741
I've got to do this.

143
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:17,474
Did I get them?

144
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:25,674
-Ha ha!

145
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,674
-No way.

146
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:28,474
-Oh, yes.

147
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:31,841
And now you see me
in my true form.

148
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:34,774
In this state, I boast perfect
protection against all strikes.

149
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:37,274
Your attacks are now
completely ineffective.

150
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:06,575
-I've noticed that his arrow's
power is different every time

151
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:07,808
he releases it.

152
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:09,008
-Yes.

153
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:11,742
It appears he's
unable to control it.

154
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:14,875
But you must admit thatif I
hadn't shielded us just now,

155
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,275
it would have been a close one.

156
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:20,742
-Enough with your
boring explanations.

157
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:22,075
-(THINKING) Damn.

158
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:23,908
I finally fired an arrow
at her at full power,

159
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,342
and it didn't hit her.

160
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,575
Still, I can't give up.

161
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:29,942
It is not an option.

162
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:31,808
I have to keep on firing.

163
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:37,808
-Do it now.

164
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:45,075
-(THINKING) That's good.

165
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:13,742
[laughter]

The first Bount
crest ever created.

183

tell me where it is, was I?

I'll find it myself, and when
I do, I'm going to take it.

You have to tell me
where the crest is

I never expected it to be here.

00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,608
All this time, it's remained
hidden in this place.

233
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,808
This is the crest I have been
searching for all this time.

-Ultimate power?

241
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,175
KARIYA: For eons, I have been
investigating and researching

242
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,975
ancient records.

243
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:36,175
Once I narrowed it down, I had
Ichinose begin searching here.

244
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,842
And soon he was able to
track it to somewhere

245
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,742
here in the Department of
Research and Development.

246
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:47,042
The name of this
original crest is Jokai.

247
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:50,342
Its incredible power can
purify and erase everything.

248

-The Jokai Crest?

249
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,675
KARIYA: This chamber is where
the infamous experiments that

250
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,908
led to the creation of
the Bounts were conducted.

251
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:02,742
-They were?

252
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:05,708
KARIYA: When the accident
occurred and the experiments

253
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:08,875
were halted, the
incredible energy

254
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:12,575
that made up the foundation for
the experiments and the Jokai

255
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:18,075
Crest was sealed away,
and now I have become one

256
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:19,608
with that very energy.

257
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:22,742
I wonder if you can
comprehend what that means.

258
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:25,975
It means that I
now have the power

259
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,908
to blow up the
Seireitei at any time

260
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:31,208

Jokai Crest's energy.

-You what?

262
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:34,875
-Do you expect us
to believe that?

00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:37,042
-Believe whatever you like.

264
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:41,942
What you or anyone else
thinks is not important to me.

-What are you going to do then?

270
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:52,875
I imagine you want to
attack to try to stop me.

271
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:58,108
But if you do, I will release
the Jokai Crest's energy.

272
00:20:58,142 --> 00:21:02,808
If you are that foolish,
then go ahead and attack.

273
00:21:02,842 --> 00:21:06,108
Otherwise, go and tell the
people of the Seireitei this.

274
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:08,775
I will give them
one day's grace.

275

Until then, may they
all tremble in wait.

to the Quincy boy

here that we were able to
get into this place at all,
