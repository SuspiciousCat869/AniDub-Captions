[theme song]

2
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:56,048
-Ichi-- oof!

3
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:59,448
-What's up, Keigo?

4
00:01:59,482 --> 00:02:00,282
-But why?

5
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:03,682
I didn't even say anything yet!

6
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:05,348
-Hey, Mizuiro.

7
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:06,415
-Oh, hey, Ichigo.

8
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:07,782
Quiet morning, isn't it?

9
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,348
-Yep, sure is.

10
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:10,115
-Stop!

11
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:11,782
Didn't you just see that?

12
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:13,248
He just smashed my face!

13
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,782
Why are you pretending
like I don't exist?

14
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:16,882
-Oh, yeah.

15
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:18,015
There was someone here
to see you earlier.

16
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:18,982
-To see me?

17
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:24,615
-Hm?

18
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:25,448
-Hm?

19
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:26,348
-Mm.

20
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:26,848
-Hm.

21
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:33,548
-Long time no see, Ichigo.

22
00:02:33,582 --> 00:02:35,182
[laughing]

23
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:42,548
-As always, everyone
is so carefree here.

24
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:45,682
No one even scolds you
for playing Kemari.

25
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,915
It's sure a far cry
from life at the palace.

26
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:51,948
I do envy you.

27
00:02:51,982 --> 00:02:52,715
-So what's up?

28
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:54,648
Is something going on?

29
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:55,682
-Hm?

30
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:57,815
-I mean, why'd you
bother coming back here?

31
00:02:57,848 --> 00:02:59,048
And all alone, too?

32
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:01,848
-I may travel
wherever I so please.

33
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,815
And besides, if
anything bad happens,

34
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:05,648
I am sure you will protect me.

35
00:03:05,682 --> 00:03:06,915
-That's quite an assumption.

36
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:10,048
You know, I've got my own
things to take care of as well.

37
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,748
Where are Kenryu and Enryu?

38
00:03:11,782 --> 00:03:13,782
Aren't they around somewhere?

39
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:15,382
-I have no idea.

40
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:17,748
I came here all by myself.

41
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:19,015
-Huh?

42
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:20,548
Hold on.

43
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:23,448
But aren't you the head
of the Kasumioji clan now?

44
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:24,915
Isn't that a little dangerous?

45
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:26,782
-I'm well aware of the dangers.

46
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:28,548
Listen, I have a
good reason why--

47
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:29,682
-Hold that thought.

48
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:30,982
I got a class to get to.

49
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:31,482
-Wait!

50
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:32,115
No!

51
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:35,315
Come back at once!

52
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,148
-What did you hit me for?

53
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:39,448
-Listen to what I have to say!

54
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:44,615
-Maybe you should calm down.

55
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:54,315
-[growling] Ichigo, you jerk!

56
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:01,182
-Yes!

57
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:03,115
It's lunch time!

58
00:04:03,148 --> 00:04:06,948
Well, Ichigo, what do you
think today's main course is

59
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:08,082
gonna be?

60
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,415
-If you're looking for
Ichigo, he left already.

61
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,215
-Huh?

62
00:04:10,248 --> 00:04:11,115
That fast?

63
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:12,315
No way!

64
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:15,348
He's taken blowing me
off to a whole new level.

65
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:16,815
-By herself?

66
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:17,882
-That's right.

67
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:20,215
She doesn't have Kenryu
or Enryu with her.

68
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:22,948
-Do you have any idea
why she came back?

69
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:24,282
-I don't know.

70
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:26,315
Maybe she just got sick of
living at that palace of hers

71
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:28,082
and decided to run away.

72
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:28,848
-I see.

73
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:31,448
And where's Rurichiyo now?

74
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:34,448
-Beats me.

75
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,682
That really hurt!

76
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:36,782
-Idiot!

77
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:38,282
Even though her clan
isn't fighting anymore,

78
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:39,882
she's still a princess!

79
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:42,948
What if something
happens to her here?

80
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,948
-What could happen to her?

81
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:49,515
-Innertube!

82
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:50,548
I've got it!

83
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,748
What we need is a life jacket!

84
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:55,282
-And how on earth did you
come to the conclusion

85
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:57,348
that we need a life jacket?

86
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,682
-It's simple.

87
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,148
Rurichiyo has jumped
from the pier of despair

88
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:03,015
into the ocean of sorrow.

89
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,082
She'll drown in a sea of--

90
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:04,982
-Orihime.

91
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:06,282
-Huh?

92
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:08,782
-This sounds like it's gonna
take too long to explain.

93
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:10,148
-OK.

94
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:12,315
-Let's split up and find her
before anything bad happens.

95
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:15,015
-Right.

96
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,115
-Guess I have no choice.

97
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,348
-Find her?

98
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:40,848
-Uh-uh.

99
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,048
-Oh, man.

100
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,715
Even though she's
head of her clan now,

101
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:46,615
she still loves causing
trouble, doesn't she?

102
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:47,848
-That's true.

103
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:54,282
But remember, even though
she's head of her clan,

104
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:56,115
she's still just a child.

105
00:05:56,148 --> 00:06:00,448
We have no idea how heavy
a burden that must be.

106
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:04,348
It drove her to seek refuge
in the world of the living.

107
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:06,515
We can't waste any more time.

108
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:08,748
Let's keep looking for her.

109
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:09,382
-Right.

110
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:10,548
-What's going on?

111
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:12,182
-Huh?

112
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:13,282
-Uryu.

113
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:14,615
-Uryu!

114
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:15,948
Rurichiyo has gone missing.

115
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:18,448
Any idea where she might be?

116
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:19,115
-Well, actually.

117
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:25,515
-My, my, my, my.

118
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:29,648
I was wondering when you'd swing
on by to pick her up, Ichigo.

119
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:31,715
I assumed you'd come
here right away,

120
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:33,682
so I didn't bother
contacting you.

121
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:36,115
What took you guys so long?

122
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:37,482
-Well, I, uh--

123
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,482
-Yeah, we were just--

124
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:44,348
-So why didn't you think
of checking here earlier?

125
00:06:44,382 --> 00:06:45,615
-Anyway, let's go.

126
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:46,582
-No!

127
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,248
I will be staying here.

128
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,415
Do not make me go with that
strange orange haired man!

129
00:06:51,448 --> 00:06:52,448
-Really?

130
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:54,448
You're still using
that old insult on me?

131
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:56,648
Listen, if you won't
cooperate, I'm gonna--

132
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,315
-I'm telling you
to leave me alone.

133
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:01,248
-Oh come on, I can't do that.

134
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:02,515
-And why not?

135
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,515
-Because when you just
show up like this,

136
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:07,048
it causes everyone
here a lot of problems.

137
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:09,348
You're in charge of
a noble clan now!

138
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:10,748
-Fine!

139
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:12,882
I am a selfish, spoiled noble
who knows nothing of the world!

140
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:14,148
-Whoa, what's gotten into you?

141
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:14,848
-Silence!

142
00:07:14,882 --> 00:07:16,915
I do not need you to--

143
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:18,315
[stomach growls]

144
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,182
-Huh?

145
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:22,848
You're in a bad mood
because you're hungry.

146
00:07:22,882 --> 00:07:23,415
-No!

147
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:24,248
That was not me!

148
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:26,182
I assure you, I am not hungry!

149
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:28,082
-Sorry.

150
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,848
You heard all that?

151
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,215
URYU (VOICEOVER):
So it was Orihime?

152
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:34,248
CHAD (VOICEOVER): What
incredible timing.

153
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:36,515
-Obviously I'm hungry.

154
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:38,415
You want to go eat something?

155
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:39,348
[stomach growls]

156
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:40,782
-Huh?

157
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:44,582
-Uh, oh, excuse me.

158
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:45,848
That one was me.

159
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:53,948
-That was delicious.

160
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:57,148
Only in this world can you get
exquisite meals like that one.

161
00:07:57,182 --> 00:07:59,682
Where is my after dinner tea?

162
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:02,415
You there, waiter,
fetch me my tea!

163
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,848
-Um, Rurichiyo, you
don't have to yell.

164
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:15,882
-[yawn]

165
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:30,315
-The princess is sound asleep.

166
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:32,548
-If only she were this
quiet when she's awake,

167
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:33,882
I'd be a happy man.

168
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:35,982
-Sorry for being so loud.

169
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,282
-Uh, did you hear all that?

170
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:41,848
Well, anyway, things must
be pretty rough for you

171
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:42,848
these days.

172
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:46,782
-I do not need your sympathy.

173
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:49,015
-Well, sorry for
leaving you like that.

174
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:50,448
-Huh?

175
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:50,948
Hm.

176
00:08:57,748 --> 00:08:59,182
Huh?

177
00:08:59,215 --> 00:08:59,882
Who's there?

178
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:04,848
-Kenryu?

179
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:06,982
-Lady Rurichiyo,
leaving the clan

180
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:09,948
and coming to the world of
the living is outrageous.

181
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,648
What could you
have been thinking?

182
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:13,215
-Hey, hang on a minute!

183
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:14,848
Give her a chance to explain.

184
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:16,815
-I know I scolded you
about playing kemari,

185
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,415
but was this really an
appropriate response?

186
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:21,115
-No, that's not why she came.

187
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:21,682
She wouldn't--

188
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:22,382
-I would!

189
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,848
What is so wicked about kemari?

190
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:31,282
-As I said, we have a
mountain of critical matters

191
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:33,448
to handle before we
run off playing kemari!

192
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:35,948
-As your ruler, that
is for me to decide.

193
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:36,948
-Hold on a sec!

194
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:40,048
The reason you came here was--

195
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:40,548
-Kemari!

196
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:46,215
-That is what I
keep telling you!

197
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:49,515
Right now, a fun distraction
like kemari is important.

198
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,182
-I have already gone over
this with you again and again,

199
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:53,948
but you refuse to understand.

200
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:56,348
With your subjects feeling
alienated from you,

201
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:58,148
our priority is
repairing relations

202
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,882
with the other noble leaders.

203
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,815
-I do not know
about such things.

204
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:05,115
But I am in command now,
and I will do as I see fit.

205
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:06,915
-That is unacceptable!

206
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:08,582
-Just hang on a minute.

207
00:10:08,615 --> 00:10:10,015
Both of you need to calm down.

208
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:12,882
-How do you expect
me to calm down?

209
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:14,748
Ichigo, you talk
some sense into him.

210
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,415
-You see what I deal with?

211
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:19,182
You're on my side here,
aren't you, Ichigo?

212
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:21,448
-Come on, Ichigo, do something!

213
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:23,548
-Ichigo Kurosaki!

214
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:24,848
-Oh, come on.

215
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:26,748
Just leave me out of this.

216
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:29,182
-[growling]

217
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:30,948
-[growling]

218
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:32,182
Hmph.

219
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,248
Are you telling me that you
will forbid what I want,

220
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:35,548
no matter how much I insist?

221
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:37,548
Is that it?

222
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:38,682
-That's right.

223
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:40,648
Milady, I'm aware that I
have very little chance

224
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:44,315
of persuading that
stubborn head of yours.

225
00:10:44,348 --> 00:10:45,148
-Stubborn?

226
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:47,515
-But it is my duty nonetheless.

227
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:49,715
My resolve will not
falter, even if it

228
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:52,648
means I will incur my
lady's wrathful anger.

229
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:54,315
-I never liked you, Kenryu!

230
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:56,982
Why, in fact, I hate you!

231
00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:05,082
I've hated you since
I first met you!

232
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:08,848
If you refuse to obey
me, then leave my sight!

233
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:15,282
-Very well then.

234
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:20,815
Excuse me.

235
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,315
-Sir Kenryu?

236
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:25,148
-Hey, wait.

237
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:27,748
Hold on, come back.

238
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:28,648
Rurichiyo!

239
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:29,415
-I don't care.

240
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,107
-What?

241
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,174
-Yeah.

242
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,874
And now it's Kenryu
who's gone missing.

243
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,140
-That Kasumioji
clan really seems

244
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:53,507
to enjoy causing a
commotion, don't they?

245
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,340
-But Princess
Rurichiyo-- I mean,

246
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:58,740
he didn't seem that much
different from her usual self.

247
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,874
-Yeah, you got it!

248
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:06,707
[interposing voices]

249
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,874
-They are not very skilled.

250
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:17,240
-Found you!

251
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:18,374
-Huh?

252
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:22,074
-What the hell are you
doing out here anyway?

253
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:23,140
-Oh.

254
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:24,540
-Sorry, pal.

255
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:27,307
-Oh, man, that really hurt.

256
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,807
Huh?

257
00:12:36,874 --> 00:12:37,674
[interposing voices]

258
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,740
-Did you see that?

259
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,307
My technique is perfect.

260
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,840
-Sure is.

261
00:12:49,874 --> 00:12:50,707
I mean, no!

262
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,774
It's-- wait!

263
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:54,440
I mean, this isn't
going to solve anything!

264
00:12:54,474 --> 00:13:01,374
--[sigh] Kumoi's incident
is at the root of all this.

265
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:04,907
Ever since then, the Kasumioji
clan has been so tense.

266
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,707
No one feels safe anymore.

267
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,874
The anxiety and
distrust have made

268
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:13,107
my people lose their
spirit, and ultimately, I

269
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,574
am the one responsible.

270
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:20,074
That is why I had the idea
to hold a kemari festival.

271
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:22,340
I recalled seeing a similar
event when I was last

272
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:25,407
in your world, and
I thought perhaps

273
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,474
it would make the
people happy again.

274
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:32,107
So along with Shu,
I worked out a plan.

275
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,207
But--

276
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,174
-What are you saying,
Lady Rurichiyo?

277
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:39,007
Leave this nonsense
alone, for your own good.

278
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
And for the good of
the Kasumioji clan.

279
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:42,940
-I am the head of this clan.

280
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:44,340
Let me lead as I wish to.

281
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:46,007
-Absolutely not.

282
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,340
And I will repeat my
position until it sinks in.

283
00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:52,707
-[growling]

284
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,107
RURICHIYO (VOICEOVER): I tried
to explain my plan to him,

285
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,974
but Kenryu would not
even listen to my ideas.

286
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,474
I still believe
the head of a clan

287
00:14:02,507 --> 00:14:05,207
should do what she thinks is
right, even if it is unpopular.

288
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,774
But it has been difficult.

289
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:16,840
-So it turns out Rurichiyo does
have some pretty good reasons.

290
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:18,507
But if we go and
explain it to Kenryu,

291
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,540
do you think you'll hear us out?

292
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:22,340
-Well, I don't know.

293
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:24,107
The way he reacted
back there, it

294
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,940
would be tough to get him
to even listen to you.

295
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:28,907
-And no one's going
to explain anything

296
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,040
to him unless we can figure
out where Kenryu went.

297
00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:34,340
-Yeah, you got that right.

298
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,007
Where in the world could he be?

299
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,507
-Ichigo.

300
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,007
-Huh?

301
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:42,607
-Wha?

302
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,807
-Huh?

303
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,540
-Hey, guys.

304
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:47,640
-I see.

305
00:14:47,674 --> 00:14:50,007
So that was Lady
Rurichiyo's goal.

306
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,240
-That's right.

307
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:53,574
And the truth is,
Kenryu, she didn't really

308
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:56,107
mean it when she told
you to take a hike.

309
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,407
So you think you can accept
what she's trying to do?

310
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,340
-It's difficult.

311
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:05,707
At the moment, Lady Rurichiyo
is solely focused on her people.

312
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,107
And it is true that
regaining their trust

313
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,440
and rebuilding the
clan is important.

314
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:15,640
However, I believe that in order
to restore the Kasumioji clan,

315
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:18,740
we first need to mend relations
with other noble families

316
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:23,674
and powerful persons and work
in concert with them to govern.

317
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:26,407
It's a matter of priorities.

318
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,074
One day we can live
Lady Rurichiyo's vision,

319
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:32,640
but at present, we do
not have that luxury.

320
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:34,340
Unfortunately, we
must do what we

321
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:38,074
must do, for above all,
that is best for the people.

322
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:41,140
-Oh, man, how complicated.

323
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:44,607
I mean, it sounds like both
of them have valid opinions.

324
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
What are we supposed to do?

325
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:48,074
-Hey, don't look at me.

326
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:49,940
-[sigh]

327
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:50,874
-Hm.

328
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:53,674
-This is a conundrum.

329
00:15:53,707 --> 00:15:56,307
-It's all my fault Lady
Rurichiyo feels this way.

330
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,007
I should have
convinced her by now!

331
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,307
-What the hell are you doing?

332
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,207
-Since I have failed,
I will offer my life.

333
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,007
-Augh!

334
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,207
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

335
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,707
-Do not stop me,
Ichigo Kurosaki!

336
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,007
I must bear the responsibility!

337
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,707
-Forget that!

338
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,740
Just calm down!

339
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:19,040
You don't have to
do anything rash!

340
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:20,207
-Let me do it!

341
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,640
I said stop it!

342
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,240
-Wait, Ichigo.

343
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:27,907
Let him do it.

344
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,874
-What?

345
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:30,007
Uryu!

346
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,074
-Do not dishonor this warrior.

347
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:33,840
We'll watch him end
his life and report

348
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,374
the news to the princess.

349
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:36,307
-What?

350
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,474
Wait, what are you saying?

351
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:40,940
-Kenryu, please proceed
with your ritual.

352
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:43,840
In fact, I will assist
you if you wish.

353
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:46,540
Except I'll be using
an arrow rather than

354
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:47,640
a traditional sword.

357
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:10,840
-Huh?

358
00:17:10,874 --> 00:17:12,574
-There you are.

359
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:13,307
-What is wrong?

360
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,040
You look pale.

361
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:16,174
-It's Kenryu.

362
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:17,640
-Did you find him?

363
00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:19,640
Where is he?

364
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:22,074
-He says he's gonna
commit suicide.

365
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:28,740
-Well, why should I care?

366
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:29,774
-Wait, what?

367
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:32,140
-Kenryu already left my service.

368
00:17:32,174 --> 00:17:34,274
His fate is none of my concern.

369
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:38,540
-How can you even
say such a thing?

370
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:40,507
You made him protect
you in every way,

371
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,574
but you won't even
consider protecting him?

372
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,774
Fine, then!

-Thank you, Kenryu.

378
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,207
Oh, Enryu.

RURICHIYO (VOICEOVER): Kenryu!

382
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:38,874
-Aw, you really
think this will work?

383
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:40,607
-What are you talking about?

384
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,507
Wasn't this the plan you came
up with in the first place?

385
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,974
-Well, yes, that's true, but--

386
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:50,374
-Kenryu, please proceed
with your ritual.

387
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:52,407
In fact, I will assist
you if you wish.

388
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:56,207
-Forgive me.

389
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,474
I cannot go through with this.

390
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:01,507
-Enough with the melodrama.

391
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,874
-I'm not being melodramatic.

392
00:19:04,907 --> 00:19:07,074
If I cannot make Lady
Rurichiyo change her mind,

393
00:19:07,107 --> 00:19:10,107
I am compelled to do whatever
it takes to stop her,

394
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,174
even if that means I must do
the unthinkable and take my own

395
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:15,007
life.

396
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,107
I happened upon you
all as I was wandering

397
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,774
around the town trying
to build up my courage.

398
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,540
-Oh, so you weren't
just there by chance.

399
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:24,607
-I'm begging you!

400
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,240
Please!

401
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:26,916
You must help me!

402
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,116
-Ugh.

403
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:31,877
-Well, I still think
this is the best

404
00:19:31,877 --> 00:19:34,243
way to persuade Kenryu's master.

405
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:35,710
-Hope you're right.

406
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:38,110
-[gasp] She's coming!

00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,010
Quickly!

408
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:42,043
-OK.

409
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:43,243
-Are we ready?

410
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,077
-Mm.

00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:06,610
-Lady Rurichiyo!

414
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,043
-How could you be so brainless?

415
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:14,443
Did you really
think going through

416
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:16,843
with that was going
to make me happy?

417
00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:19,343
-I-- I don't know.

418
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:21,543
-I am responsible
for my guardians,

419
00:20:21,577 --> 00:20:24,777
and that means I
cannot let you die.

420
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,643
Got that?

421
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:28,577
-You mean-- Lady Rurichiyo--

422
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:40,010
-They certainly are a
handful, no doubt about it.

423
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:41,777
-You're telling me.

424
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,110
RURICHIYO (VOICEOVER): Oh, well.

425
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:46,943
I suppose we will have to
concede just this once.

426
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:50,377
-I am so happy that you
understand, my lady!

427
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,210
I won't have to lose my life!

428
00:20:52,243 --> 00:20:55,843
Not for something
as dumb as kemari!

429
00:20:55,877 --> 00:20:58,043
-What did you say?

430
00:20:58,077 --> 00:20:58,843
-Uh.

431
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:01,243
-Did you just call kemari dumb?

432
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:04,843
So, you believe your
princess has dumb ideas?

433
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:06,177
-No!

434
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,577
I, uh, just meant-- well,
silly hobbies like kemari are--

435
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,410
-What do you mean,
silly hobbies?

436
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:13,477
-No, it-- that came out wrong.

437
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,377
-I decided not to
concede the point.

438
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,310
-Huh?

439
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,610
But my lady, mere
seconds ago, you

440
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:21,677
said you'd see things my way.

441
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,343
-That was before you trampled
all over my feelings!

442
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:26,743
-This is hopeless.

443
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:29,977
-But everybody worked so hard
together to stage this in order

444
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,343
to convince you that--

445
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:32,310
-What's that?

446
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:34,477
Staged this?

447
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,277
So all this talk about
committing suicide

448
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,877
was to deceive me?

449
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,710
Absolutely unforgivable!

450
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:44,977
-Well, if the cat is out
of the bag, then no kemari!

451
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,977
I forbid it!

452
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,810
-You do not understand, because
you have never played it!

453
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,877
-Oh, I have played it plenty.

454
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,577
Why, in fact, I would wager
I'm better at kemari than you,

455
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,677
my lady.

456
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,210
-Then I challenge you
to a kemari contest!

457
00:21:59,243 --> 00:22:00,910
That will settle this argument!

458
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:04,210
The loser must concede the issue
and never bring it up again!

459
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:06,243
-Fine, you have a deal!
