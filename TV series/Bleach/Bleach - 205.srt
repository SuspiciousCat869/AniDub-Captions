NARRATOR: Rurichiyo
Kasumioji, the princess

3
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:54,134
of a high-ranking noble family
within the Soul Society,

4
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,901
was supposed to remain in her
palace as head of the family

5
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:59,667
after a period of internal
strife had been resolved.

6
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:02,101
Instead, she suddenly
returned once again

7
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:03,901
to the World of the Living.

8
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:05,867
Rurichiyo had argued
with her guardian

9
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:07,967
Kenryu over her priorities.

10
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:09,534
He felt she should
mend relations

11
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,101
with the other noble families.

12
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:13,701
Rurichiyo wanted to hold a
Kemari tournament to cheer up

13
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,801
for subjects.

14
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,701
In a fit of anger, she
ran away from home.

15
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:19,901
In despair and feeling
responsible for his inability

16
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:24,067
to persuade Rurichiyo, Kenryu
decided to commit suicide.

17
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:27,101
When Rurichiyo became
aware of Kenryu's plans,

18
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:29,267
she realized how
important he was to her,

19
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:31,834
and raced to stop him
from taking his own life.

20
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,601
RURICHIYO: You fool!

21
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,967
KENRYU: Lady Rurichiyo.

22
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:39,434
-How could you be so brainless?

23
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,067
Did you really
think going through

24
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,634
with that was going
to make me happy?

25
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:46,067
I am responsible
for my guardians,

26
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:48,867
and that means I
cannot let you die.

27
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:50,567
Got that?

28
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:52,301
-You mean, Lady Rurichiyo--

29
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:03,901
-They certainly are a
handful, no doubt about it.

30
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,167
-You're telling me.

31
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,467
RURICHIYO (VOICEOVER): Oh well.

32
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:10,867
I suppose I will have to
concede just this once.

33
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,734
-I am so happy that you
understand, my lady.

34
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:16,801
I won't have to lose my
life, not for something

35
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:19,701
as dumb as Kemari.

36
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,567
-What did you say?

37
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,534
-Uh.

38
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:25,434
-Did you just
called Kemari dumb?

39
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:28,834
So, you believe your
princess has dumb ideas.

40
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:30,201
-No!

41
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:33,534
I, uh, just meant, well, silly
hobbies, like Kemari, are--

42
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,301
-What do you mean,
silly hobbies?

43
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:36,067
-No.

44
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:38,334
It-- that came out wrong.

45
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,234
Well, if the cat
is out of the bag.

46
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:43,234
-You do not understand because
you have never played it.

47
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:45,334
-Oh, I have played it plenty.

48
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:49,167
Why, in fact, I would wager
I'm better at Kemari than you,

49
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,267
my lady.

50
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:52,734
-Then I challenge you
to a Kemari contest!

51
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,101
That will settle this argument.

52
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,934
The loser must concede the issue
and never bring it up again.

53
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:58,501
-Fine.

54
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:00,001
You have a deal.

55
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:03,534
-How the hell did things
wind up like this?

56
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,701
[whistle]

57
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:14,734
-Why are we being
forced to participate

58
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:15,934
in settling this issue?

59
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,267
-Stop complaining, Ichigo.

60
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:18,601
It's an opportunity.

61
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,367
Think of it as an honor to
play in a noble family's Kemari

62
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,534
competition.

63
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:25,701
-Oh, so demanding we play
now becomes an honor.

64
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:27,967
And how in the world did you
come up with these teams,

65
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:28,834
anyway?

66
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:30,267
-I'm sorry about this.

67
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:33,834
I couldn't refuse his request
since I'm part of a noble clan.

68
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:37,634
-In my case, I've been your
enemy from the beginning.

69
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,634
-And, of course,
you know how I feel.

70
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,934
I go wherever Rukia goes.

71
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:42,634
-There.

72
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,034
Are any more questions?

73
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,201
-Good grief.

74
00:04:45,234 --> 00:04:48,101
-Kenryu, our team appears
to be short a player.

75
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:49,234
What are we supposed to do?

76
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,801
-I'm glad you
noticed that, Uryu.

77
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,734
There's someone
here whose duty is

78
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:55,501
to help guide Lady Rurichiyo.

79
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:59,134
He appears to have betrayed us.

80
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,801
-I don't think of it
as a betrayal at all.

81
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,534
Unlike you, Enryu is
always on my side.

82
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:07,067
-The truth of the
matter is I wanted

83
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:09,701
to be on Lady
Rurichiyo's team as well.

84
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:12,534
Enryu is always her favorite.

85
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,601
At any rate, I suspected
this might happen.

86
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:17,467
So I arranged for a
qualified substitute.

87
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:21,601
ICHIGO: Yoruichi?

88
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:22,567
-Leave it to me.

89
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:24,601
This competition
is as good as over.

90
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,101
-I admire your conference.

91
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:29,901
That's why I asked Kisuke to
help me find a good player.

92
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:33,701
-The Kasumioji clan is a
major customer of mine.

93
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:36,534
That's why I had to
come through for them.

94
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:37,901
Thanks, Yoruichi.

95
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:40,967
I know your participation will
catapult your team to a win.

96
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:41,901
-Kisuke?

97
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,701
What the hell are
you doing here?

98
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:44,667
Oh my.

99
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:47,834
Did I forget to mention
my store happens

100
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:51,201
to be the main sponsor
of this competition.

101
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:54,501
[cheering]

102
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,801
-We've arranged for
the referees as well.

103
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,401
-I'm going to be
watching very closely.

104
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:02,967
Obey the rules.

105
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,634
-Are you kidding?

106
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:07,567
-Speaking of the rules, we
will now explain them to you.

107
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,734
Begin, Ms. Kuchiki.

108
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,967
-Kemari is an ancient
Japanese sport

109
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:16,067
which is played by two
opposing team using a ball.

110
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:19,101
Players kick the ball in
the air to a set height,

111
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:21,367
and then pass it to the
other members of their team

112
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:23,334
without letting it
fall to the ground.

113
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,901
-By the way, those are
horrible drawings, as usual.

114
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:27,267
-[growl]

115
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:29,101
-The playing field is an open
space marked at each corner

116
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:30,701
by trees called kekari.

117
00:06:30,734 --> 00:06:33,501
All you do is keep kicking the
ball within the open space.

118
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:35,067
The rules are very simple.

119
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:37,501
-So it's a game where keeping
the ball up and assisting

120
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:39,901
your team members
is very important?

121
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:42,901
But you haven't explained how
someone is supposed to win.

122
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:43,834
-Good point.

123
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:45,167
And that's why for
this competition

124
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:47,901
we're using a special
Kasumioji rule.

125
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:50,234
--[clears throat] I believe
you'll find this to be quite

126
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,201
simple.

127
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:53,034
Whichever team drops
a pass is deemed

128
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:54,567
to have lost the contest.

129
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:57,667
The final decision will
be made by the referees.

130
00:06:57,701 --> 00:07:00,667
Lady Rurichiyo, are these
rules acceptable to you?

131
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:02,067
-Yes, of course.

132
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:04,634
If your team should somehow win,
Kenryu, I will then obediently

133
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:07,767
return to the Soul Society
and do whatever you say.

134
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:10,501
But we're going to hold a
Kemari tournament if I win.

135
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:12,234
Do you accept that?

136
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:13,634
-That will be fine.

137
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,934
-Believe me, though, there's
no doubt that my team will win.

138
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,401
-You sure about that?

139
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:20,034
I wouldn't start
celebrating just yet.

140
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,767
-For this competition,
we've marked

141
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,467
all corners of Karakura
Town as kekari.

142
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,734
There's a 90-minute time limit.

143
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,134
And for the duration
of the game,

144
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:32,034
we've set up conditions
identical to an area

145
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,101
freeze and Konpaku protection.

146
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:36,634
So please stay
within the kekari.

147
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,634
-How did you determine
the time limit?

148
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,501
-It was the most we
felt we could do.

149
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:42,167
If we keep it
frozen for too long,

150
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:44,167
the Soul Society
will reprimand us.

151
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:46,401
-You're sure it's
all right to do this?

152
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:48,701
-Ichigo, you shouldn't worry
so much about the details.

153
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:49,767
-She's right.

154
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:51,334
You'll be more motivated
to put your effort

155
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:53,667
in if there's a time limit,
rather than facing something

156
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:56,401
that can drag on endlessly
without a resolution.

157
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,234
-He's telling the truth.

158
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:00,001
URURU: Excuse me?

159
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:03,001
If everyone's ready, we
should begin the competition.

00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,567
[whistle]

161
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,801
[grunting]

162
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,134
-And kick off.

163
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:19,867
-Oh, great.

164
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:20,867
The ball's gone into orbit.

165
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:29,634
-[grunt]

166
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,334
-Oh, yeah!

167
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:34,134
My lady, how'd you
like that move?

168
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:37,434
-That was nothing.

169
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,734
-Oh, wow!

170
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,867
Both team captains are
challenging each other

171
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:43,401
from the very start.

172
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:44,234
-Right.

173
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:46,734
Let's win this thing, Ichigo.

174
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,101
-I'm with you.

175
00:08:49,134 --> 00:08:51,067
-We'll see about that.

176
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,134
Damn it, I missed.

177
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,534
-Hey, that was dangerous!

178
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,534
-I forgot to mention that it's
OK for those without the ball

179
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,501
to try and block moves
by the opposing team.

180
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:02,501
-That's some oversight.

181
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:03,734
-What are you doing, Ichigo.

182
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:05,134
Game on.

183
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,101
-Just a minute.

184
00:09:06,134 --> 00:09:07,167
KURODO: Uh-oh.

185
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,267
There's a problem.

186
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:11,167
The ball's about to
go outside the kekari.

187
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:12,401
-Don't worry, guys.

188
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:13,667
I'm all over it.

189
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:15,801
I'm uniquely suited
for this situation.

190
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:19,101
After all, I'm a Mod-Soul,
reinforced leg strength model.

191
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:21,034
Check out the action.

192
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,867
Kon kick!

193
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,801
How was that?

194
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:32,201
[grunt]

195
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:36,667
JINTA: I believe I distinctly
said no going out of bounds!

196
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,667
-[shout]

197
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:42,567
-Referee Jinta just administered
a penalty kick to player Kon

198
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,001
for going out of bounds.

199
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:46,201
-If the Soul Society
finds out the barrier is

200
00:09:46,234 --> 00:09:48,601
being used as kekari,
there'll be trouble.

201
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:50,601
Because of that, I
understand the severity

202
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:52,001
of the penalty kick.

203
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:53,367
-That's right.

204
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:55,267
It's the player's fault for
going out of bounds on his own,

205
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:56,401
the idiot.

206
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:57,501
-What kind of trouble
are we talking about?

207
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:00,601
And why are we taking
so many risks here?

208
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:01,434
-Got it!

209
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,901
Rukia, I'm passing it to you.

210
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:04,367
-It's time for a block.

211
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:09,767
Are you ready for
this, Enryu? [shout]

212
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:20,067
-What the--?

213
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,501
-A [inaudible].

214
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:23,401
Nice move by Enryu.

215
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:25,367
-Daichimaru is a
defense-type Zanpakuto

216
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:27,667
that can create an
instant barricade.

217
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:30,001
It can block an opponents
attack by building

218
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:33,167
a set of walls from the ground
directly underneath them.

219
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:35,134
It is quite effective.

220
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,334
-What a brilliant move!

221
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:37,434
-Why all the shouting?

222
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,301
You're about to make
my eardrums pop.

223
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,967
I'm covering for Enryu.

224
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:42,501
It turns out he's
embarrassed to have

225
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:43,934
other people hear his voice.

226
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:44,934
-Fine.

227
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:46,267
But please don't
scare your teammates.

228
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:48,767
ORIHIME: Ichigo, we
have to get the ball!

229
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:52,667
-Hey, Chad!

230
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:56,767
Pass it over when you get it.

231
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:58,234
-[grunt]

232
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:03,801
ICHIGO: Can't you kick lightly?

233
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:06,201
-Ichigo, go after
it with Flash Step.

234
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:07,601
-Guess I'll have to.

235
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:12,734
What's going on here?

236
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,401
-I'm going to get that ball.

237
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:16,134
I figure I can
beat you in a race.

238
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:16,901
-Heh.

239
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:19,901
I think you figured wrong.

240
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:20,734
-Ah!

241
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,001
I've got to do something.

242
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:23,534
I'm pretty limited in this form.

243
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,001
-Good.

244
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,334
I made it time to spare.

245
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:37,467
-You thought you could beat
me to the ball with such

246
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,301
a slow Flash Step?

247
00:11:39,334 --> 00:11:40,867
What a joke, Ichigo.

248
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,934
-Will you put something on?

249
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:45,634
-In a surprise move, Yoruichi
transforms and catches

250
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:46,701
Ichigo off guard.

251
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:48,234
-He'll be all right in a minute.

252
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:49,467
-It's his own fault.

253
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,267
He should have expected it.

254
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:54,134
-Lady Yoruichi, pass
the ball down here.

255
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,734
-I guess I'd better.

256
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,234
Here, take care of the ball
while I put on my clothes,

257
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:58,734
Rukia.

258
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:03,867
-It exploded!

259
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:05,234
What are you doing?

260
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,334
-Sorry.

261
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,267
I guess I just don't
know my own strength.

262
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:10,267
-Soten Kisshun.

263
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,634
-Great job, Orihime.

264
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,567
Did you see that, Kenryu?

265
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:21,967
Now that's pulling
together as a team.

266
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,167
-We'll see.

267
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,167
From here on, the real
contest is about to begin.

268
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:36,334
-[sigh] Look at all this.

269
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,667
The way this is going, I'll
be an old man by the time

270
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:39,934
I'm finished.

271
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,267
Rurichiyo and Kenryu went
to the World of the Living

272
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:43,734
and they haven't come back.

273
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:44,934
I want to go to.

274
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,967
Maybe I can take a little break.

275
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,867
Huh?

276
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,134
-Lord Shu, I've
brought more documents.

277
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:53,201
-I can't handle what
I've already got!

278
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:54,667
-These are different, my lord.

279
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:55,167
-What?

280

-Gotcha.

283
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:11,663
I'm on it.

284
00:13:11,696 --> 00:13:14,863
-Oh, no you don't!

285
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:16,763
-Santen Kesshun.

286
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:21,629
-Hey, is that fair?

287
00:13:21,663 --> 00:13:22,863
-All right, he's blocked.

288
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:23,529
Go for it!

289
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:24,296
-Good move, Orihime!

290
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:29,896
-Oh, no you don't!

291
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:30,963
Come on, Kon!

292
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,929
Dance, Sode no Shirayuki!

293
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:38,929
-Huh?

294
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:40,196
What are you planning
to do, Rukia?

295
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:41,529
-You'll find out.

296
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:42,296
Sorry.

297
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:43,096
You better brace yourself.

298
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:43,596
-Huh?

299
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:59,263

-That was brilliant,
Ms. Kuchiki.

-I think my nose is bleeding.

go outside the kekari.

-Unavoidable.

310
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:37,263
You seem to forget
we're trying to do this

311
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:39,029
without telling
the Soul Society.

312
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:40,396
-I haven't forgotten!

313
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,496
Why are we doing something
we have to keep secret?

314
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,029
IKKAKU: What's all this about
keeping a secret from the Soul

315
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:45,529
Society?

316
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:53,263
So, is there something you
want to tell me, Ichigo?

317
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:55,429
-Uh, Ikkaku.

318
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:57,829
Uh, well-- uh, let me think.

-We've been facing some
strong adversaries lately,

so I'm in the process
of retraining Ichigo.

-Special training--
that's what's going on?

-Yeah, and you came along
at just the right time.

323

I'm afraid someone got
injured a moment ago.

I'm wondering if you'd be
willing to give us a hand.

325
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:16,096
-I don't know precisely
what's going on.

326
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:18,296
But it seems very interesting.

327
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:19,663
-Substitution.

328
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,996
Mr. Madarame will be taking
the place of Mr. Kon.

329
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,129
ICHIGO: Hey, wait a minute.

330
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:25,829
We don't agree to that!

331
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:26,729
-We need a ruling.

332
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:35,363
Substitution is approved.

333
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:36,629
-What?

334
00:15:36,663 --> 00:15:39,429
-The treat you're enjoying
comes from the candy maker

335
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:41,196
to Kasumioji clan.

336
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:43,463
I had a feeling you'd
find it most enjoyable.

337
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:48,496
--[laughs] You are a
sneaky one, Kenryu.

338
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,996
-I am a student, one who bows
to the master, Mr. Urahara.

339
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:55,329
-It's been a while
since I've taken you on.

340
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:58,229
Are you ready for me, Ichigo?

341
00:15:58,263 --> 00:15:58,763
-You serious?

342
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:08,563
Hold on.

343
00:16:08,596 --> 00:16:12,096
-Don't hold back, or
you're gonna get hacked!

344
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:19,129
-Well, fine, if that's the
way you want it. [shout]

345
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:22,129
-This is when the
real fight starts.

346
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:23,363
Extend, Hozukimaru!

347
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:31,796
[shouting]

348
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:35,796
-Heh.

349
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,696
[fighting noises]

350
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:41,463
-What's Ichigo doing up there?

351
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:43,596
He's not even kicking the ball.

352
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:44,596
-Don't know.

353
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:45,596
-Hang in there.

354
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,429
You're doing great, Ichigo!

355
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:48,396
-What's happening?

356
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:49,729
It appears that
everyone's forgotten

357
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:52,163
the original point
of this competition.

358
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:53,529
-I have to agree.

359
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:56,663
-Looking at the overall picture,
does it even really matter?

360
00:17:00,363 --> 00:17:03,829
-I have to say, you're
very persistent.

361
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:06,263
The same goes for
you, Lady Rurichiyo.

362
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:08,263
Let's say we put an end
to this contest already.

363
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:09,363
What do you say?

364
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:10,229
-Sure.

365
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,596
It's no big deal to me.

366
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:15,663
-All you have to do is admit
your team lost the competition.

367
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:17,196
-The important
thing in all of this

368
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:19,329
is restoring the clan
as soon as possible.

369
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:21,896
I've told you over and over
that recreational activities

370
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:23,496
can still be provided afterward.

371
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:24,563
That's still my position.

372
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:28,163
Are you prepared to accept it?

373
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:29,063
-Not yet!

374
00:17:32,796 --> 00:17:35,829
-Lady Rurichiyo, why
are you so obstinate?

375
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:37,296
-Isn't it obvious?

376
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:41,696
Because I want to see
smiles on everyone's faces.

377
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:44,163
Ever since I came
back to lead the clan,

378
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,296
everybody has been
working very hard in order

379
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:49,096
to keep things together for me.

380
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:51,696
But in spite of that,
there's still many things

381
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:53,363
that I just have
not mastered yet.

382
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:56,563
And as a result, I end up
putting a terrible burden

383
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:57,663
on you and all the others.

384
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:03,229
-[gasp] But, my lady!

385
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:04,796
-Do not bother saying it.

386
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:06,996
I know the situation
is unavoidable,

387
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,596
because I am still just a child.

388
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:13,729
But regardless, I
still felt guilty.

389
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:15,996
And I tried to think if there
was something I could do,

390
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,363
some way that I could
make my subjects,

391
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:22,563
and the staff at the mansion,
and even you feel happy.

392
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:26,629
And the Kemari tournament
is what I came up with.

393
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:30,496
[cries]

394
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:31,863
-I didn't know, my lady.

395
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:42,696
[gasping]

396
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:45,663
[screech]

397
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:46,829
-A hollow?

398
00:18:46,863 --> 00:18:49,163
-Guess we exerted too
much spirit energy.

399
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,829
-This is trouble!

400
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:55,796
-Everyone, run for it!

401
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:00,429
-[scream]

402
00:19:00,463 --> 00:19:02,829
-Lady Rurichiyo.

403
00:19:02,863 --> 00:19:05,763
-[inaudible]!

404
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:07,729
[scream]

405
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:22,496
-Hold tight, my lady.

406
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:30,096
Lady Rurichiyo, you
have to go with Enryu.

407
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:31,063
-No way.

408
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:32,529
I'm not doing it.

409
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:33,963
I'm not leaving
you behind, Kenryu.

410
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:43,896
-[cries] Lady Rurichiyo!

411
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:46,753
[cries]

412
00:19:48,764 --> 00:19:50,097
-What?

413
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:56,431
[shouting]

414
00:19:57,206 --> 00:19:58,639
-Getsuga Tensho!

415
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:10,221
-Lady Rurichiyo, were
you hurt in the attack?

416
00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:10,988
-I'm fine.

417
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,621
Really, Kenryu.

418
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:14,988
-What happened to
the Kemari ball?

419
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:16,088
-I am not sure.

420
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:17,855
I lost track of it when
the Hollow attacked,

421
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:19,721
and it disappeared.

422
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:21,521
I guess that means
it fell to the ground

423
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,921
on my turn, which also
means this contest is--

424
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,788
[gasping]

425
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:27,721
-Is that the Senkaimon?

426
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,421
-Oh, there you are!

427
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:34,555
-Shu?

428
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:36,988
-Why did you come her to
the World of the Living?

429
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:38,688
-Because I wanted to
show you something.

430
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:47,121
-My lady, these are
letters from your subjects.

431
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:48,821
SHU: Remember you once
mentioned publicly

432
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:51,121
that you wanted to hold
a Kemari tournament?

433
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:53,655
Well, since no details have
been released since then,

434
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:55,021
people decided to
send in letters

435
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:56,221
of encouragement and support.

436
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,821
They're really excited about it.

437
00:20:58,855 --> 00:20:59,488
You see?

438
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:00,088
There's a lot.

439
00:21:03,621 --> 00:21:05,455
I don't know where you
came up with the idea,

440
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:06,955
but it turns out
to be a good one.

441
00:21:06,988 --> 00:21:09,288
You captured
everybody's imagination.

442
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:11,355
They can hardly wait to
hear the details of how

443
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:13,155
the tournament is going to work.

444
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,888
-That is great.

445
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:17,788
But the arrangements might
be kind of complicated.

446
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:19,055
KENRYU: Lady Rurichiyo?

447
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:20,321
-Huh?

448
00:21:20,355 --> 00:21:22,455
-There could be no
more definitive outcome

449
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:23,821
to our competition.

450
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:28,088
It's clear to everyone that
I lost, and I hereby concede.

451
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,421
As a result, Enryu
and I will do whatever

452
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,321
it takes to help
with your tournament.

453
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:35,788
-Kenryu, Enryu!

454
00:21:35,821 --> 00:21:40,155
[laughter]

455
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:48,621
-Well, got to be going.

456
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:50,188
There is quite a
bit of preparation

457
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:51,655
to do before the
Kemari tournament,

458
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:53,121
so I have to leave at once.

459
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:55,488
Sorry for causing
such a commotion!

460
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:56,855
KENRYU: We put
you through a lot,

461
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:58,355
and we appreciate all your help.

462
00:21:58,388 --> 00:21:59,488
RURICHIYO: See you soon!

463
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:00,155
Bye now!

464
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:01,155
ICHIGO: But-- hey, wait!

465
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:07,121
Would someone mind explaining
to me what all that was about?

466
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,783
[theme music]

467
00:23:46,981 --> 00:23:49,214
URAHARA: In the next episode,
we're going back in time

468
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:50,414
110 years.

469
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:52,114
It'll feature me when
I was very young,

470
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:53,614
which should be
very embarrassing.

471
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:55,047
ICHIGO: Hey, what
about my scenes?

472
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:55,847
URAHARA: Don't worry.

473
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:56,981
You're still in the episode.

474
00:23:57,014 --> 00:23:58,981
They gave you two lines
in the illustrated Guide

475
00:23:59,014 --> 00:23:59,914
to Soul Reaper segment.

476
00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:03,447
ICHIGO: I see what's going on.
