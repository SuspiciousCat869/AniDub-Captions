-Where are Ichigo and Renji?

5
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:52,215
Did they stay out
training all night long?

6
00:01:52,248 --> 00:01:53,448
-Who knows.

7
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:55,615
It's probably best to
just let them both get it

8
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,282
out of their system.

9
00:01:57,315 --> 00:02:01,782
That fool shouldn't let a single
defeat get him so depressed.

10
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:06,015
-Yeah, that's true.

00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:07,415
-But that's stupid!

00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:09,348
How is fighting going
to make him feel better?

13
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:11,548
Are men really
that simple-minded?

14
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:15,115
-Speaking of men, I wonder
what's up with Uryu?

15
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:16,615
Something happened with Yoshino.

16
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:17,882
It was obvious.

17
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:20,882
At the mansion, Uryu was
really worried about her.

18
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:22,215
-Ah, why?

19
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:24,982
Bounts are our enemies,
and always were.

20
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:27,482
Why waste time
worrying about a Bount?

21
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:28,815
-Hmm.

22
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,782
There are a lot of things we
need to ask this one though,

one she's recovered a bit more.

24
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:39,048
-I'm exhausted.

25
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:41,982
-I can't believe we trained
until the sun came up.

26
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:45,848
-Good day, men.

27
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,382
I have your breakfast
prepared for you.

28
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:51,982
I feel generous today, so I even
prepared some for the moocher.

29
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:54,848

when you call me that.

00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:02,248
-Want some coffee?

34
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,915
-Sure.

35
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:05,415
-Coffee?

36
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:10,915
-Thanks.

37
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:14,348
-Here you go.

-Ah, what the hell?

39
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:20,815
What's wrong with you?

40
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:21,948
-That's disgusting!

41
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:23,248
What is this stuff?

42
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:25,015
-I told you before, it's coffee.

43
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:26,882
-Well it's horrible.

44
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,048
-You're serious, aren't you?

45
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,815
You've never had it before.

46
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:32,282
What a child.

47
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:34,182
-What did you say?

48
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,648
-Want some sugar?

49
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:37,848
-Sugar?

50
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:40,315
You mean you're supposed
to put sugar in it first?

51
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:41,482
Well, it couldn't hurt.

52
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,115
One more.

53
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:56,782
Maybe two more.

54
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:57,648
-Oh, come on.

55
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:58,848
Why not just eat
the sugar cubes.

56
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:02,248
-What's all the commotion
in here this morning?

57
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:03,615
-Hi, everyone.

58
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:04,782
-Oh, hi.

59
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:12,548
-What is it?

60
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:15,515
-Well, it looks like you're
finally over your depression.

61
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:17,648
-Yeah, but it took him forever.

62
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,748
I thought he was never
going to cheer up.

63
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:22,348
-Hey, it was not
that big a deal.

64
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:23,282
-Oh?

65
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:25,048
-Don't give me that look.

66
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,315
-Ugh.

67
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:28,182
Let's forget about that.

68
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:29,648
-Right.

69
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:31,448
-Wow, looks good!

70
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:33,248
-I really hope you like it.

71
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:36,048
I started with a
French toast as a base,

72
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:38,282
then I spread a melted
bean jam, instead

73
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:40,248
of just going with
the usual syrup.

74
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:41,982
-Another experiment.

75
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,315
-Bon appetit!

76
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:46,582
-Hey, Rukia.

77
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:49,648
Have you tried this horrible
stuff they call coffee?

78
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:51,615
-Yes, I'm familiar with that.

79
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:54,448
I got used to coffee
a long time ago.

80
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:55,415
-Oh, but how?

81
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:56,082
-Hm.

82
00:04:56,115 --> 00:04:56,782
You're surprised?

83
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:03,682
-It's nice to see them enjoy
a little rest between battles.

84
00:05:03,715 --> 00:05:06,315
Just a normal bunch of
friends, sharing talk

85
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,815
over a good breakfast.

86
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:12,248
So Noba, why are you
looking so miserable?

87
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:15,082
-That's the Bount.

88
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,948
-Ah, you noticed that Yoshino
has left the building.

89
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:19,482
Yes, I noticed too.

90
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:22,915
She seems to have left awhile
ago without telling any one.

91
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,382
But then we're all adults here,
who can take responsibility

92
00:05:25,415 --> 00:05:27,648
for our own actions,
wouldn't you agree?

93
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:29,948
It's hardly our place to
monitor the comings and goings

94
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:32,515
of everyone in the
group, now is it?

95
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,282
Besides, it doesn't
seem right to disturb

96
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:37,215
this happy morning circle
with such bad news.

97
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,948
Let's wait until later, when
things have calmed down a bit.

98
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:49,782
-Master Kariya, I
had all the others

99
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:53,648
proceed to that location
ahead of us, as you ordered.

100
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:54,215
-All right.

101
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:14,848
-By restarting the
hands of the clock,

102
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:18,048
you restart the
motion of time itself.

103
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:20,215
Right?

104
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:23,682
-For Bounts, time stopped
from the beginning.

105
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:26,548
We can fix the gears,
but the hands of time

106
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:27,948
will never move for us.

107
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:34,948
-Human lives are all
governed by time.

108
00:06:34,982 --> 00:06:38,582
That's why they reject us
Bounts, because we simply

109
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:39,782
exist.

110
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,382
And that's all.

111
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:42,282
-It's true.

112
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:44,282
For Bounts, time does not flow.

113
00:06:44,315 --> 00:06:47,915
And it's for that reason
that the humans despise us.

114
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:52,448
Still, we will try to force
those intractable hands of time

115
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:54,148
into motion.

116
00:06:54,182 --> 00:07:00,215
We will take things into our own
hands and then change our fate.

118
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:20,348
-Where are you going?

119
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:25,648
So your wounds are
all healed all ready?

120
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:27,182
I thought you were
seriously injured.

121
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:30,582
But I guess it's none of
my concern what people do.

[screaming]

123
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:36,982
Put me down!

124
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:38,282
What do you think you're doing?

125
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:39,948
You can't just grab a girl
and haul her off like that.

126
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:41,315
Where are you taking me, anyway?

127
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:44,382
-Can you track Yoshino's
spiritual pressure?

128
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:45,615
-Yoshino?

129
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:47,648
You mean that Bount you
were so determined to save?

130
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:50,215
Come to think of it, I didn't
sense her presence in the house

131
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:51,282
this morning.

132
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:52,982
-Just tell me where she is now.

133
00:07:57,348 --> 00:07:59,215
-Oh, all right.

134
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:02,815
-Sad to say, it seems one
of them has disappeared.

135
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,615
-What do you mean?

136
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:06,482
-Well, Noba here detected it.

137
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:07,115
-Oops!

138
00:08:07,148 --> 00:08:08,148
Another one, now.

139
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:10,082
So I guess that two
have disappeared.

140
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,915
-But two of what?

141
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:12,615
-Hm.

142
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:14,348
How shall I put this?

143
00:08:14,382 --> 00:08:16,182
-Their presence disappeared.

144
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:17,482
-Presence?

145
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:19,482
-Yes, their presence
has disappeared.

146
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:21,282
It's disappeared.

147
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:24,248
-Hm, are we playing
a game in here?

148
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:27,048
-Come to think of it, I
haven't seen [inaudible] today.

149
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:28,348
Maybe I should go and wake her?

150
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,082
-Let me explain it
to you one more time.

151
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:31,248
-What's the game?

152
00:08:31,282 --> 00:08:32,615
Can I get in on it too?

153
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:44,082
[wind]

154
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:54,548
-You're back.

155
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:02,248
-Are you serious?

156
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:05,915
-What are you talking about?

157
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:09,682
-Are you really going ahead
with this plan of yours?

158
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,848
-Why do you ask?

159
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:17,215
-I won't let you.

160
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:20,048
-Oh?

161
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:21,848
-Which way?

162
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:23,448
-Stop swinging me
all around like that.

163
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:24,782
You're only making me dizzy!

164
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,282
-This way?

165
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,015
Or is she that way?

166
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:29,315
Come on, hurry up and tell me!

167
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:29,789
-Stop it!

168
00:09:29,823 --> 00:09:30,264
Stop it!

169
00:09:30,297 --> 00:09:32,297
Stop it!

170
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,030
You're making me so confused
I can't tell anything.

171
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,730
-I thought you
said that it still

172
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:39,097
wasn't the right time yet.

173
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,997
-Well, the situation
has changed somewhat.

174
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,030
-What could have changed
between now and then?

175
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:47,230
-You want to know?

176
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:47,730
-Hm.

177
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:53,697
-I need your help.

178
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,130
In fact, the whole
thing depends on you.

179
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:00,830
-Stop it!

180
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,430
Help you?

181
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:09,264
I'm going to stop you.

182
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:09,764
Zeige Dich!

183
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:10,264
Goethe!

184
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:21,730
-What is your command, Yoshino?

185
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:24,364
-Goethe, are you my alter ego?

186
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:26,064
-Why do you ask?

187
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:30,164
-Tell me, do you have any
problem with dying here?

188
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,997
-So we're going to die together?

189
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,730
All right.

190
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,964
-Back here again.

191
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:42,564
What's going on in there?

192
00:10:42,597 --> 00:10:43,897
-Bounts are fighting each other.

193
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:55,164
-My, how dangerous.

194
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:03,530
-Running away?

195
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,030
-Goethe, stop!

196
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,430
Don't chase him!

197
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,030
-Yoshino!

198
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:11,197
-Stay out of this!

199
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,597
If you get involved,
you'll only be in her way,

200
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,530
and you'll make things worse.

201
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,567
-So that's pretty
much the whole story.

202
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,367
Yoshino left sometime
during the night,

203
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,000
and then Uryu and Ririn
went after her this morning,

204
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:34,867
but who knows--

205
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,700
-Idiot!

206
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:36,933
Why'd you wait so long?

207
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:38,867
-I've been trying to
tell you for a while now,

208
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,067
but no one seemed to listen!

209
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,033
-Just stop it!

210
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,467
This is not the
time to be arguing.

211
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,633
-Deal.

212
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:47,133
-We've got to drop
everything and go after them.

213
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:50,133
Noba, we'll have to count
on you to lead us to them.

214
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,100
Can you?

215
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:52,567
-Yes, I think so.

216
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,200
-All right.

217
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,100
Let's get moving.

218
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,200
-One moment.

219
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:55,900
-Hm?

220
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:56,967
-What is it, Kisuke?

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,433
We have to do this, so--

222
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,700
-Yes.

223
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,700
But since this is a
race against time,

224
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,167
you and Renji should
use Flash step,

225
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,633
and go on ahead as
fast as you can.

226
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,467
The rest of us will
catch up with you.

227
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,033
-Right.

228
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:11,200
-One more thing.

229
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:14,800
Since getting Uryu back in one
piece is our only goal here,

230
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:18,733
we should avoid fighting
if at all possible.

231
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:19,733
[music playing]

232
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:37,200
-Yoshino!

233
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:44,233
-I'm all right.

234
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,233
Goethe!

235
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:47,867
You just fight,
don't worry about me!

236
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,767
-Why are you in
such a rush to die?

237
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,267
-Jin!

238
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,667
-Yoshino!

239
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,800
-It's surprising that you can
use a doll, in your condition.

240
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:04,967
The thing is, we utilize
these crests of ours

241
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,567
to harness the greatest
power in this world.

242
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,967
But if our balance is lost, then
that power goes out of control.

243
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,967
It can even turn on its
user and attack him.

244
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,400
Weakened by injury
as you are, you're

245
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:21,300
lucky to even summon a
doll, much less control

246
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,367
one with any degree
of accuracy or power.

247
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,633
-As long as I stop you, I
don't care what happens to me.

248
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,667
That's not right.

249
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,167
You don't seem to realize
how incredibly valuable

250
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,933
you really are, Yoshino.

251
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,767
Haven't you noticed
it with Goethe?

252
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,533
Those aren't feelings of
subservience he has for you.

253
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:45,833
He has feelings of love.

254
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:49,700
Bounts cannot leave descendants,
so it is truly special to be

255
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:51,333
a Bount like you.

256
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:54,600
A Bount who has
a maternal power.

257
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,400
-What?

258
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,933
What are you talking about?

00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,900
-Come on out, Quincy.

260
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:02,833
I know you're there
behind me somewhere.

261
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:06,567
I knew that both of
you would come back.

262
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,767
-No!

263
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,967
Why have you come?

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,933
-My guess is he has some
old-fashioned idea about being

265
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,567
a hero, and saving
a woman in distress.

266
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Is that it?

267

-What do you plan to do with me?

268
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:24,833
Just because I'm a Quincy I--

-There's nothing more
useless than a Quincy

I have no further use for you.

But seeing as
you're here, let me

273
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:36,100
show you something interesting.

Yoshino.

-It's you again.

-Sorry, but we
can let you go in.

284

An important ritual
is just starting.

-Ritual?

-Too easy.

291
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,600
But I guess I'll play with
you for a little while.

292
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,433
-What the hell is this ritual?

293
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,400
-That's nothing you
need to know about.

294
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:35,033
-Just what do you
plan to do to her?

295
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:39,100
-Yoshino has as a
rare maternal power.

296
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,333
-Maternal?

297
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:43,133
-Over long years of
personal experience,

298
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:46,033
I've come to learn that
the level of power I desire

299
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:49,733
can't be achieved by sucking
out living human souls.

300
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:52,200
And then, when I
began to research ways

301
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:55,000
to absorb souls
for maximum effect,

302
00:15:55,033 --> 00:15:57,400
I discovered this
woman's incredible power.

303
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:01,600
So don't be afraid.

You're about to become
a new mother, my dear.

body with that of his doll.

been so foolish.

00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:02,100
-As you wish.

331
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:32,500
-Come to me, Goethe.

332
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:33,000
-Yoshino.

333
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,700
-We're together,
to the very end.

334
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:42,633
-Mother.

335
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,067
-Yoshino.

336
00:18:54,933 --> 00:19:00,567
-So you fused with your
doll, just as I thought.

337
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,333
-Goethe, let's go.

338
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:26,300
-She wasn't absorbed
by the doll,

339
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,600
even though
[inaudible] was gone.

340
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:31,333
So this is Yoshino's
maternal spiritual power.

341
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,333
-They're just floating up there.

342
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,233
-Don't interfere!

343
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:41,067
-Damn!

344
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,867
What are they doing up there?

345
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,433
-Don't ignore me,
or you'll be sorry!

346
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,467
-This is the power I
have wanted for so long.

347
00:19:57,767 --> 00:20:03,167
But I can't afford
to let you waste it.

348
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,633
-Jin!

349
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,067
-No!

350
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,567
Stop!

351
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:21,967
Yoshino, no!

352
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh Yoshino, don't die!

353
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:27,033
You can't die now.

354
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:31,300
-At least, maybe I
can die the right way.

355
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,600
-There's no right way to die.

356
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:33,733
Not now.

357
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:34,233
No!

358
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,933
-This will be fine.

359
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:43,933
This way of dying is just fine.

360
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,733
-Don't go!

361
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:48,267
-Your eyes are so intense.

362
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,167
I thank you.

363
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,667
For everything.

364
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,633
The proud last Quincy.

365
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,333
[crying]

366
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,067
[scream]

367
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:17,000
-I've waited a
long time for this.

368
00:21:17,033 --> 00:21:29,633
[speaking foreign language]

369
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,733
-Yoshino, from out of death,
you shall now be reborn.

370
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:39,667
-Hey!

371
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,633
Come back!

372
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,700
-You all right?

373
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:44,167
What in the world is that?

374
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,233
-Wonderful.

375
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:57,967
Just as we had hoped.

376
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,867
The birth of thousands
of new dolls.

377
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,500
Oh yes, more still!

378
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:06,000
More still must
be born this day.

379
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:06,967
[laughter]

380
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:19,967
-What are those
disgusting things?

381
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,467
-Look!

382
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:39,622
[theme music]

383
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:10,851
-What were those
bat-like things?

384
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:12,218
More of [inaudible] friends?

385
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,351
-How insulting!

386
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:14,818
Everyone knows I'm the
bluebird of happiness!

387
00:24:14,851 --> 00:24:16,851
-Is that really how
you see yourself?

388
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:19,751
You're more like a cursed
doll of bad luck and disaster.

389
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:21,751
-How dare you say
such a think about me?

390
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:23,418
I'll put a curse on you!

391
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:24,318
[theme music]

392
00:24:34,518 --> 00:24:35,718
-[inaudible] the Soul Reapers!

393
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:36,218
-Golden!

394
00:24:39,684 --> 00:24:40,384
-Captain Kyouraku!

395
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:42,084
-Stop right there!

396
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:44,284
Old man Yama summoned
me here suddenly,

397
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,751
so it must be important.

398
00:24:46,784 --> 00:24:49,918
Obviously something very
unusual is going on.

399
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:51,451
Old man Yama!

400
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:52,884
-Oh, for heaven's sake.

401
00:24:52,918 --> 00:24:54,918
-Is he?

402
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,784
-Let's leave him alone, Nanao.

403
00:24:56,818 --> 00:24:57,984
-Huh?

404
00:24:58,018 --> 00:24:59,784
-I don't know why he called me.

405
00:24:59,818 --> 00:25:02,518
But old man Yama
is sound asleep.

406
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,718
-Well he is old.
