NARRATOR: In order
to save Orihime,

3
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:53,527
who was kidnapped by Sosuke
Aizen, Ichigo and his friends

4
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:56,108
snuck into Hueco Mundo,
the realm of the Hollows,

5
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:59,308
and infiltrated Aizen's
fortress, Las Noches.

6
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:02,208
Upon entering the fortress,
they are engaged in battle

7
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:04,441
by some of the Aizen's
most powerful Arrancars.

-Well, well.

10
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,908
At the head of
the pack, are you?

11
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:19,875

00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:42,575
how long you would be
fooled by my little charade.

NARRATOR:
Unexpectedly, Ulquiorra

20
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:54,641
appears before Ichigo, who is
on his way to help his friends.

21
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,708
Ichigo attempts to avoid an
altercation with Ulquiorra

22
00:02:57,741 --> 00:03:01,008
in order to rush to Rukia's aid,
but the fight is inevitable.

-You kidnapped her
and brought her here!

24
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:08,608
I suspected that she
didn't come to Hueco

ULQUIORRA (VOICEOVER):

00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:19,841
And how can he possess
such spirit energy?

00:05:57,508 --> 00:05:59,441
But you still used your
powers to fight with!

00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:00,408
Stop that!

00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,841
That's nutty crazy!

58
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,008
I was really worried about you.

59
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,075
Yeah, that's the thing,
because you were fighting,

60
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,575
and I was scared.

61
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:10,541
So don't-- don't
do that anymore.

62
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:11,575
Don't do it!

00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:13,575
-Sorry, Nel.

65
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:17,375
I guess that you
got pretty scared.

-Oh, Ichigo!

You used your mask

But this time, it
shattered instantaneously.

I am afraid that you won't be
able to bring it out again.

You've nothing left
to hold me off.

It's time to give up.

You're the leader of
the Espada, aren't you?

113
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,841
So it's very simple.

114
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,308
What I have to do is
defeat you in battle.

115
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:07,775
Then this war is
as good as over.

Ichigo Kurosaki, it's pointless.

00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:56,675
You cannot defeat me.

126
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:01,475
Even if you were lucky
enough to succeed,

127
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:04,008
there are three
Espada ranked above me

128
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:09,975
who are much stronger than I.

The results will
always be the same.

It appears that I have
grossly overestimated you.

00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:29,475
Your development didn't
meet my expectations.

133
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:41,041
This is the end, then.

134
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:43,741
If you can still move
in that condition,

135
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:46,608
leave Hueco Mundo immediately.

then die there.

I must say, you
really are amusing.

But I've told you
several times now,

153
00:12:17,643 --> 00:12:20,910
you can't damage an Espada
with just your Shikai.

154
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:22,343
Try to get that

It doesn't matter
what information

170
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:25,543
you've gathered on it.

171
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:28,543
Zabimaru is an extension
of my arms and legs.

172
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:29,943
Just 'cause you
can read my moves

173
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:34,310
doesn't mean I'm done,
not by a long shot.

174
00:13:34,343 --> 00:13:38,376
In fact, this battle
has barely begun!

175
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:47,676
You're not getting away.

176
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:52,110

-How unfortunate that you
lack the basic elements

179
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:01,976
of intelligence.

180
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,710
I've already told
you that I received

181
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,876
all of your data and statistics.

182
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,643
Now what else?

183
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:11,510
Your attack speed's obviously
a basic part of your technique

184
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:13,010
and is extremely predictable.

185
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:14,476

Hmph.

189
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,043
Let's consider all
the facts, shall we?

190
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:42,043
You no longer have a
way to win or to escape.

191
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:43,276
-What are you saying?

192
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,643
-Simple, really.

193
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,976
Once you've played your best
hand, then what's left to play?

196
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,243
Not fair, not fair!

197
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:57,843
Give it to me.

198
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:58,310

SZAYELAPPORO: I'm tired of this.

201
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:06,376
-What was that?

202
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,043
-I told you, I've
grown tired of this.

203
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:13,410
Perhaps you'd like me to speak
slower, so you can understand?

204
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:16,843
Your Zanpakuto is a power type.

205
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:20,443
There's absolutely nothing
special about it, is there?

206
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:22,743
In fact, the manner in
which it changes forms

207
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:24,210
is extremely rudimentary.

208
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:26,310
I know it's rude of
me to point this out,

209
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:30,043
but whatever interest it
once held has long faded.

210
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:37,610
Hmph.

211
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,476
Why don't we finish this?

[wailing]

00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,943
-[gasp] What the?

214
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:01,243
-They're the Fracciones.

215
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:04,676
Espadas are given Arrancars that
have the rank of 11th and lower

216
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,410
to be our direct
subordinates, and they

217
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:09,476
serve as living testaments
to our ultimate supremacy

218
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,643
as Espadas.

219
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:12,876
Those are Fracciones.

220
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,710
Some of the Espadas
have only one,

221
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:18,776
while there are
others who have many.

222
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,943
Not to brag, but my eight
Fracciones are a bit unique.

223
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:25,410
They were originally
Hollows that I modified.

224
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,510
Lord Aizen was kind
enough to use his power

225
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:29,210
to turn them into Arrancars.

226
00:16:29,243 --> 00:16:30,310

00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,576
is over?

231
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,010
Why don't we be
realistic about this?

232
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,076
Your incompetence
is definitive proof

233
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,043
that you are not worthy
to fight me directly.

Of course, I'm not going
to interfere, either.

Do try your best to make our
epilogue exciting, won't you?

You live in a fancy

-Yeah, it's a very nice room.

I guess Lord Aizen must
really like you a lot.

-Isn't that the truth, princess?

254

You're the girl of the hour.

Everybody is talking about you.

You must be important.

think that everybody should
kneel down to worship you?

You'll have to
speak up, princess.

Miss Orihime, princess.

Don't start thinking
you're so special.

You're nothing but a human.

279
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:04,176
You don't deserve the honor
of being at Lord Aizen's side.

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,676
What?

281
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,376
Nothing to say?

-Sounds good to me.

We'll stop when the

-[laughing] An excellent idea.

are when you cry.
