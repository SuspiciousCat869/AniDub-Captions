NARRATOR: Soul Reapers,
the spiritual guardians

3
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:54,910
to the world of the living.

4
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,644
Their job is to maintain the
balance between the myriad

5
00:01:57,677 --> 00:02:00,744
of good and evil souls
that fill this world.

6
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:03,477
Sosuke Aizen, who
betrayed the Soul Society

7
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,744
and left the Seireitei in chaos,
has set his plan into motion.

8
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:10,577
Arrancars have arrived
in Karakura Town.

9
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,744
Using the Hogyoku, Aizen
has created these Arrancars

10
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:15,944
by shattering the boundary
between Soul Reapers

11
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:17,210
and Hollows.

12
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:19,644
Meanwhile, Visoreds,
Soul Reapers

13
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:22,044
who have awakened the
powers of their Inner Hollow

14
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:24,977
have appeared and
confronted Ichigo.

15
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,777
Aware that Ichigo
is one of them,

16
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,510
the Visored named Shinji Hirako
invites Ichigo to join them.

17
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,344
Despite the fear
and the anxiety he

18
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:35,510
feels from awakening
the Hollow within him,

19
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:37,410
Ichigo, nonetheless,
found the strength

20
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:41,377
to confront the two powerful
Arrancars, Ulquiorra and Yammy,

21
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,644
who were sent by Aizen.

22
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,244
-What do you want to
do with her, Ulquiorra?

23
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:51,044
Maybe we should take
her back to Aizen

24
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:54,710
to show him this weird
healing power she possesses.

25
00:02:54,744 --> 00:02:56,844
-Wait, Aizen?

26
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,044
-No, that won't be necessary.

27
00:03:00,844 --> 00:03:03,277
Just kill her, Yammy.

28
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,277
-Gotcha.

29
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,244
-Uhh.

00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:15,577

34
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,077
-Uh!

35
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:33,610
-Sorry, Ichigo.

36
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:34,777
-It's all right.

37
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,977
I'm sorry I couldn't
get here sooner.

38
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,277
-No, I mean, all
this is my fault.

39
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,777
If I-- if I was stronger,
I could have stopped this.

40
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,244
-There's no need for
you to apologize.

41
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:50,310
You did everything you could.

42
00:03:50,344 --> 00:03:55,644
Now, I'm going to deal with
these two and end this!

43
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:56,477
-Hm.

44
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,477
-Bankai!

45

-Tensa Zangetsu.

47
00:04:16,244 --> 00:04:18,677
ORIHIME (VOICEOVER):
That's Ichigo's Bankai.

48
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,144
Wow!

49
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,577
I've never seen it
this close up before.

50
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,044
It's amazing!

51
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:27,477
I know it must be the
same, but somehow it

52
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,777
feels different from the
time at Sokyoku Hill.

53
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,177
Uh.

54
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,944
His spiritual pressure
is so wild and fierce.

55
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:36,310
It's so heavy.

56
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:38,844
I feel like it's smothering me.

57
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:42,977
This doesn't feel
like Ichigo at all.

58
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,677
-Orihime, stay back.

59
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,644
-All right.

60
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,877
-You got a Bankai, huh?

61
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,044
Hey, Ulquiorra, this the guy?

62
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:05,377
-Yes.

63
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,744
Considering how clumsily you've
dealt with the situation,

64
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:11,177
I'm surprised we were able
to flush him out at all.

65
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,377
The orange hair,
the black Bankai.

66
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,977
No doubt about it.

67
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,610
This is our target, Yammy.

68
00:05:17,644 --> 00:05:18,844
He is the one.

69
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:21,544
-So he saved us the trouble
of searching for him.

70
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:22,044
Hah!

71
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:22,844
Que suerte!

-I'm guessing you're
the reason Chad's

74
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,110
lying on the ground over there.

75
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:36,677
-Hm, you're going to
do something about it?

76
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:46,144
-Huh?

77
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:46,977
Hhrghah!

78
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,210
ULQUIORRA (VOICEOVER): Idiot.

79
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:50,377
That's what you get for
charging into a fight

80
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,544
before evaluating
your enemy's strength.

81
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:56,077
You should have mastered the
Pesquisa, like I told you.

82
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,877
Even so, he sliced
through Yammy's Cero

83
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,744
and lopped off his arm
like it was nothing.

84
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,544
Not what I would have
expected from someone

85
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:05,810
who had just learned Bankai.

86
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:10,144
His spiritual
pressure is strong.

87
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:12,310
Still, at this
level of power, he

88
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:15,544
couldn't possibly pose
a threat to Lord Aizen.

there and call me names.

I guess you're as
tough as you are ugly.

-It seems you're
having a hard time.

Shall I take over?

98
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:35,210
-I can't believe you
need your Zanpakuto

99
00:06:35,244 --> 00:06:37,044
to deal with a runt like this.

100
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:38,610
YAMMY: Shut up and stay back!

101
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:40,044
-That's a Zanpakuto.

ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
I should have known.

103
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:44,177
His sword is a Zanpakuto.

104
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,610
The cracked Hollow mask,
the hole in his chest,

105
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:48,977
and the Zanpakuto.

106
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,010
I know I felt something odd
about their spiritual pressure.

107
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:55,844
Who are these guys?

108
00:06:55,877 --> 00:07:00,244
Are they Visoreds,
like Shinji and me?

Just switch with me, will you?

I'll take care of this guy.

115

I can't move my body.

I rejected you.

So now, you want to get
in my way and sabotage me?

Damn it.

He stopped moving.

ULQUIORRA (VOICEOVER):
Something strange is going on.

139
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:24,444
His spiritual pressure,
it keeps fluctuating.

140
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:27,577
One second it's none, and
then it suddenly spikes.

141
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,344
When it's low, it's
inconsequential.

142
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:33,477
But when it's high,
it's stronger than mine.

143
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,610
What the hell is going on?

144
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:39,677
-I'm done messing around!

145
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,010
Time for you to disappear!

146

00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:45,544
Ugh.

168
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:50,644
-Humph.

169
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:07,377
-Yo-- Yoruichi, is it you?

170
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,410
-Yeah?

171
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:11,410
-Is Ichigo all right?

172
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,910
Where is he?

173
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:14,244
-He's fine.

174
00:10:14,277 --> 00:10:15,644
Don't worry.

175
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:17,477
Can you swallow?

176
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:17,977
-Yes.

177
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:23,877
-You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

178
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,844
-[growls]

179
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,777
-Uh!

180
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,777
A Cero.

181
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:42,610
-[laughing]

182
00:10:42,644 --> 00:10:46,477
You mess with me, little
girl, you got blown to bits.

183
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,610
No one could escape the blast
of my Cero at this range.

184
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:53,310
Huh!

185
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:54,444
Who are you?

186
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:56,910
And how did you survive my Cero?

187
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:59,010
You should all be dead!

188
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:01,077
-You need to pay
closer attention.

189
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,710
I knew if I tried to block
it, the others might get hurt.

190
00:11:03,744 --> 00:11:06,144
So I simply took the
offensive and responded

191
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:07,210
with a similar attack.

192
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:08,610
-That's impossible!

193
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:12,010
-If you don't believe me, I'd be
happy to demonstrate it again.

194
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:13,110
-[grunts]

195
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:13,777
-Now, scream.

196
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,277
Benihime!

197
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,644
-Uh.

198
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,144
-Uh.

199
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:23,110
-Ulquiorra.

200
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:26,744
Ugh!

201
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,377
Why did you do that?

202
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,744
-Idiot.

203
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,110
If you had a brain in your head,
you would have figured it out.

204
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:41,744
That's Kisuke Urahara and
she's Yoruichi Shihoin.

205
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:44,677
At your current level, you
wouldn't last five minutes

206
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,044
against the two of them.

207
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:46,977
Let's go.

208
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,077
-Are you running away?

209
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,110
-Why?

210
00:11:55,144 --> 00:11:56,910
Are you trying to
goad me into a fight?

211
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:58,944
You know very well
what would happen

212
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:00,777
if you tried to fight
me while protecting

213
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,844
those pieces of trash.

214
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:05,944
Even you must realize the
odds are stacked against you.

215
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:07,744
Normally, I'd be
happy to oblige.

216
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:10,810
But we've completed
our mission here.

217
00:12:10,844 --> 00:12:14,044
It's time we deliver our
report to Lord Aizen.

218
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:15,944
I'll tell him the Soul
Reaper he's interested

219
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:18,110
in has no value whatsoever.

220
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:19,877
He's not even worth killing.

221
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:48,334
-I'm home.

222
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,588
I picked up the juice
you asked me to get.

223
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:58,288
Ururu, Jinta, what's up?

224
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:59,754
Is Yoruichi doing all right?

225
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,654
[gulps]

226
00:13:58,954 --> 00:13:59,888
-Aah!

227
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,288
[exhales loudly]

228
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:06,421
-I was going to ask you
how your arm is doing,

229
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,121
but I can see it's fine.

230
00:14:08,154 --> 00:14:11,721
-Yeah, well, being able
to handle everyday tasks,

231
00:14:11,754 --> 00:14:14,621
like eating and
drinking, is one thing.

232
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:15,421
-What about combat?

233
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:20,788
-[sighs]

234
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:22,621
It was my own fault
for not getting off

235
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:26,154
and attack while I
was ready for it.

236
00:14:26,188 --> 00:14:29,421
The Arrancar's exterior had
stronger spiritual pressure

237
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:30,421
than I had anticipated.

238
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:35,421
They're strong, Kisuke.

239
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:37,154
They're very strong.

240
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:39,054
I hate to admit
it, but I think we

241
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:41,621
may have misjudged the full
extent of their powers.

242
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:57,754
-[groans]

243
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:08,054
-Bore!

244
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:08,529
Bore!

245
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:09,003
Bore!

246
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:09,503
Bore!

247
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:10,403
Bore!

248
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:11,803
Boring!

249
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:13,236
Grrr.

250
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,103
Urgh!

251
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:16,303
Rrrgh!

252
00:15:16,336 --> 00:15:17,936
What are you doing,
moping around?

253
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,570
On a day like this, we should
be out there picking up chicks!

254
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:22,770
I'm out of here, Ichigo!

255
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:23,270
Agh!

256
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:25,703
[crash]

257
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:27,170
[pattering rain]

258
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,403
-Ngh!

259
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:34,370
Aargh!

260
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:36,270
Just because the
guy owns me, I have

261
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,603
to be a slave to his moods!

262
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:40,370
Ugh!

263
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:42,703
I cut myself to shreds for
you, and you can't even

264
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:43,670
get out of bed!

265
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:47,836
Hey, you!

266
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,370
I'm talking to you, you slug!

267
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:51,503
Well, I'm going to find
a cute young hottie.

268
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:54,403
And when I do, I'm not going
to introduce her to you!

269
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:58,236
She'll be like, oh,
Kon, you're so sweet!

270
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,303
We're going to have more
fun than you've ever had.

271
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,836
And you'll be like, oh,
man, why didn't I go?

272
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,970
But don't come crying to me!

273
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:06,636
Hey!

274
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,303
Are you listening to me?

275
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:09,303
Say something!

276
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:15,336
Hm, I wish I could
figure out what

277
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,136
the heck is wrong with that guy.

278
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:17,936
GIRL: Dad, hurry!

279
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,570
It sounded like glass breaking!

280
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,636
And then I heard someone--

281
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,570
-Oh, no, not her!

282
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:24,536
GIRL: --shouting
outside the house!

283
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,503
Oh, look!

284
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:26,970
It's bust up.

285
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:28,903
What are you doing out here?

286
00:16:28,936 --> 00:16:29,770
Poor thing.

287
00:16:29,803 --> 00:16:31,370
How'd you get so dirty?

288
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,170
-If it keeps up
like this-- damn it!

289
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,436
ORIHIME: No, no, no, no!

290
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,503
Getting depressed like
this won't solve anything.

291
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:07,970
Uh.

292
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:08,970
[moans]

293
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,436
-Hm.

294
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,336
GIRL: No!

295
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,803
What on earth happened?

296
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:28,803
Tell me right now?

297
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:31,270
-Uh, he-he, I tripped
and fell down the stairs.

298
00:17:31,303 --> 00:17:34,503
-You expect me to believe you
got those injuries falling down

299
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:35,736
the stairs!

300
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,236
-[chuckles]

301
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,203
-This is no laughing matter!

302
00:17:39,236 --> 00:17:41,003
You've been absent
for five days now.

303
00:17:41,036 --> 00:17:42,470
And just look at you.

304
00:17:42,503 --> 00:17:43,536
You're a mess.

305
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,470
Why do you always
make me worry so much?

306
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:49,503
-Eeh, you're not going to get
all mushy and hug me, are you?

307
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,170
CHIZURU: No way.

308
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:50,870
Just look at you.

309
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,270
How could I?

310
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:52,936
ICHIGO: Orihime.

311
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,303
-Uh, oh, what is it, Ichigo?

312
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:06,170
I, uh, well, don't
worry about it.

313
00:18:06,203 --> 00:18:07,136
It's not important.

314
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:12,636
-What's up with Ichigo?

315
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,203
-Sorry, Chizzy.

316
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:15,703
I have to use the restroom.

317
00:18:15,736 --> 00:18:16,336
-What?

318
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,203
Orihime, wait up!

319
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,603
ORIHIME (VOICEOVER):
Please don't feel bad.

320
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:30,603
I wasn't thinking,
and I just jumped in.

321
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:32,536
I have no one else
to blame but myself

322
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,936
for getting hurt like this.

323
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,236
It looks a lot worse
than it really is.

324
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,303
So please don't look
like that or act

325
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:43,403
like you're the one
who's responsible.

326
00:18:43,436 --> 00:18:45,870
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
Who else can I blame?

327
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:49,770
Chad was injured, too.

328
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:52,203
Tatsuki nearly died.

329
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:54,703
It's all because I'm weak.

330
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:58,670
I don't know what I can
do other than feel guilty.

331
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:29,836
MAN: So where the heck is it?

332
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,103
WOMAN: How should I know?

333
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,470
MAN: Wait a minute.

334
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:34,636
I thought you wrote it down
before we left the Seireitei?

335
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,636
WOMAN: I lost it.

336
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,236
MAN: Oh, that's just great.

337
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,236
WOMAN: I think that Renji
would lead us, right?

338
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,336
You've been here before.

339
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,770
You should know
where you're going.

340
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:42,903
RENJI: What are
you talking about?

341
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:43,870
You've been here, too.

342
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:44,736
WOMAN: I know.

343
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,536
But it was such a short time.

344
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,703
RENJI: Enough already.

345
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:50,070
Just search for his
spiritual pressure.

346
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:52,336
MAN: Man, I can't believe
the weird clothes they all

347
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,303
wear here in the
world of the living.

348
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:56,070
-It's called a
uniform, brainiac.

349
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:57,836
The students are
required to wear them.

350
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,936
WOMAN: Oh, well, listen
to you, Mr. Smarty-Pants.

351
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,636
-Give me a break.

352
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,470
Besides, I don't think
that's the standard uniform.

353
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,603
-How are you supposed to
move in these clothes?

354
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:08,936
They're so tight!

355
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,570
-Yeah, well, maybe you should
try untucking your shirt,

356
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:12,570
like the rest of us.

357
00:20:12,603 --> 00:20:13,136
-What?

358
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,136
Are you crazy?

359
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,836
If I did that, I
wouldn't be able to fit

360
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,070
my sword to my belt!

361
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:19,603
-A wooden sword really
isn't part of the uniform.

362
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,036
-For crying out loud!

363
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,303
You're the ones who said I
couldn't bring a real sword,

364
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:25,170
so I brought a wooden one!

365
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,003
-We are not the ones
who make the rules.

366
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,936
It's a law here in the
world of the living.

367
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,603
-Well, it's ridiculous!

368
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:34,270
What kind of stupid law says
you can carry a real sword?

369
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:35,603
-What's the big deal?

370
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:38,070
I actually kind of
like these clothes.

371
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,403
-That's easy for you to say.

372
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:41,403
You only like them because
they show off your--

373
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:42,536
-Shut up, you guys!

374
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,536
We don't need to draw
attention to ourselves.

375
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,903
So just walk quietly
and try to blend in.

376
00:20:46,936 --> 00:20:49,770

Toshiro?

385
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,270
Wait a minute.

386
00:21:08,303 --> 00:21:11,503
What are you guys doing here?

387
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,736
-That's Capt. Hitsugaya to you.

388
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,770
-Yeah, fine.

389
00:21:15,803 --> 00:21:18,136
But I don't understand
why you're here.

390
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,670
-Orders from above.

391
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:22,970
Looks like there's a major storm
brewing with the Arrancars.

392
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:25,970
We were sent here to join forces
with the Substitute Soul Reaper

393
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:27,570
and prepare for the battle.

394
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,970
-Uh, Arrancar.

395
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:31,103
What the hell is that?

396
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:32,270
-What?

397
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:33,503
You're not serious, are you?

398
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:35,503
You mean you've been
fighting these guys without--

00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:43,736
-Huh?

404
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,570
WOMAN: He's talking about
those guys who beat you up

405
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:46,303
the other day.

-What do you mean?

00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:51,399
Everyone likes costumes.

412
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:53,899
I've also got a nurse's
uniform and a maid's outfit.

00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,832
YUMICHIKA: Yeah, well,
about the maid thing, I

00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:57,065
don't know if that--

415
00:23:57,099 --> 00:23:58,965
RANGIKU: I tried to get
the captain to try some on,

00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:00,499
but he said he wasn't into it.

tell you, I really

00:24:16,265 --> 00:24:19,132
appreciate you're inviting
me over to dinner like this.

Not to worry.
