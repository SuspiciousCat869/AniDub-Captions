00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:06,233
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER):
I'm Ichigo Kurosake,

2
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:08,300
and other than having the
ability to see spirits,

3
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,566
I used to be an ordinary
high school student.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,033
But the day I met
Rukia Kuchiki, I

5
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:13,866
was given the powers
of a Soul Reaper

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,900
in order to protect the
world of the living.

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,266
As I began my work as a
substitute Soul Reaper,

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,733
I found myself thrown into
a never ending battle.

9
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:23,466
In the midst of everything,
my best friend, Orihime Inoue,

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,600
was abducted by ex-Soul
Reaper captain, Sosuke Aizen.

11
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:28,333
My friends Chad
and Uryu joined me

12
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:30,200
as I raced to rescue Orihime.

13
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:32,600
Once we arrived in Hueco
Mundo, we entered a fight

14
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,666
with powerful enemies
known as Arrancars.

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,700
We were too late to
keep Aizen from entering

16
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:39,133
the world of the living,
but luckily the 13 court

17
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,400
guard squads were
already there to stop it.

18
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:44,266
An all out war was
about to begin.

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,266
[theme music]

20
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:31,069
NARRATOR: In order to prevent
Sosuke Aizen from wiping out

21
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,836
Karakura town, the Soul
Reapers moved the town

22
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:36,402
to the Rukon District
in the Soul Society.

23
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,969
Then they positioned themselves
in the world of the living,

24
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:41,669
where they placed an exact
replica of Karakura Town

25
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:44,036
to fool Aizen and his forces.

26
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,769
Head Captain Yamamoto assigned
each of the Soul Reapers

27
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:48,736
to protect the town,
having them face off

28
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,069
against the Espadas
and Fracciones.

29
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:52,902
Sui-Feng, the
captain of Squad 2,

30
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:56,836
was assigned to face off against
Barragan's Fraccion Ggio Vega.

31
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:59,569
They engaged in a midair
battle, with Sui-Feng fighting

32
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:02,836
Ggio Vega in his released
form, Tigre Estoque.

33
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:05,336
But as the speed and strength
of his attack increased,

34
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:08,736
Sui-Feng found herself weakened
by his relentless onslaught.

35
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:11,536
Meanwhile, another
Fraccion, Nirgge Parduoc

36
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,502
is locked in combat with
Marechiyo Omaeda, who

37
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:16,702
appears lost in trying
to deal with Nirgge's

38
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,636
powerful released form, Mamut.

39
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:20,636
The only difference
Omaeda could manage

40
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,669
was running away from Nirgge,
who used his trunk as a weapon,

41
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:26,436
chasing after Omaeda with
surprising quickness.

42
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:29,102
It seemed certain Nirgge's
overpowering attacks

43
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:31,202
were about to spell defeat
for the hapless Omaeda

44
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:32,436
when the unthinkable happened.

45
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:39,302
-How did you do that?

46
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:42,269
-Who do you suppose
you've been dealing with?

47
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:43,669
-What?

48
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:46,969
-I'm the lieutenant of Squad 2,
and the head of Stealth Force

49
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:49,569
2nd Unit, known
as Patrol Troops.

50
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:52,169
My name is Marechiyo Omaeda.

51
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:54,302
If you knew about
the Stealth Force,

52
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:59,036
you'd know I'd
never be that slow.

53
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,236
Now smash them!

54
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:00,736
Gegetsuburi!

55
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:25,802
All right, I won!

56
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,336
Hey, look at you now.

57
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:34,102
You got exactly
what you deserved.

58
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:35,369
Talk smack to me, will you?

59
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:37,169
You see what
happens, butterball?

60
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:39,169
You thought you were
pretty damn smart, right?

61
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:40,769
You've got no somethings.

62
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:42,436
Oh, sure big man.

63
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:44,969
You and your tricky
body, hopping around.

64
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:47,169
So, who's in charge now,
you with your weird nose

65
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:48,236
like a vacuum cleaner.

66
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:50,402
Maybe I should tear that
think off your face.

67
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:51,402
what do you think?

68
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:00,802
-I see.

69
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:03,069
So, your running away
was all just an act?

70
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,769
-No, I'm not that
good of an actor,

71
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:07,036
and I'm really sorry
about trying to run away.

72
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:08,569
Come on, how about
giving me a break?

73
00:05:17,102 --> 00:05:18,636
My nose is still here.

74
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:20,236
It feels in one piece.

75
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:21,169
Whoa.

76
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:22,702
What just happened?

77
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:24,436
Oh no.

78
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,936
Captain.

79
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:42,369
C-C-Captain!

80
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:43,669
Are you all right, Captain?

81
00:05:43,702 --> 00:05:46,336
I mean, what have you
gotten yourself into now?

82
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:47,436
Captain!

83
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:48,736
From the look of things,
you must be injured.

84
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:49,436
-Shut up.

85
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:54,702
Don't make such a big
fuss over nothing.

86
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:57,202
You're stifling me.

87
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:58,536
-But Captain.

88
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,069
-Turning your back on your
enemy any time during a battle

89
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:03,069
is inexcusable.

90
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:06,202
Even if you see your
superior go down.

91
00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:13,169
-But ma'am.

92
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:15,536
What subordinate wouldn't rush
to their fallen superior's

93
00:06:15,569 --> 00:06:16,636
side?

94
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,402
You are my captain.

95
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:22,069
Besides-- (IN HEAD) That guy
must have overwhelming strength

96
00:06:22,102 --> 00:06:25,402
to be able to put the captain
in a position like that.

97
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:28,569
I strongly suggest that we
fight this opponent together,

98
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:30,302
Captain.

99
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,602
-Do I hear compassion
for your superior,

100
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:35,002
or do you speak out of loyalty?

101
00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:36,502
-That's not it at all, ma'am.

102
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,136
It's just--

103
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:39,902
-It's just what?

104
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,702
I really do my best to ignore
your recklessly arrogant

105
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:48,269
attitude, but you
repay my efforts

106
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:51,369
with simply more
insulting behavior.

107
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:52,436
Stand back.

108
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:53,136
You're in my way.

109
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:08,602
-You done saying your farewell
to that lousy lieutenant

110
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,002
of yours?

111
00:07:10,036 --> 00:07:13,802
-And just why would I be
saying farewell to him?

112
00:07:13,836 --> 00:07:17,469
-Obviously it's because
you're about to die.

113
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:19,636
-Even if I should
die fighting you,

114
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:23,336
it would serve no real purpose
for me to tell him goodbye.

115
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,436
-Then let's get started.

116
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:35,069
-What's the idea of
treating me like I'm

117
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:36,802
a big pain in the
ass when all I did

118
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:39,669
was express concern for her?

119
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:41,636
I mean, she was flat
on her backside.

120
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,536
No matter how you look
at it, it was mean.

121
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:45,236
She pisses me off.

122
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,069
Wow, that bastard's impressive.

123
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:55,602
It really looks like he's
got the captain working hard.

124
00:07:55,636 --> 00:08:00,236
In fact, against the captain,
I'd say he's an even match.

125
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:00,736
Wait.

126
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,802
I can't really call this even.

127
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:13,736
-It's nice the way our
weapons are so similar.

128
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,102
That way, you can fight using
techniques familiar to you

129
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:18,669
and make full use of
all your strength.

130
00:08:18,702 --> 00:08:22,769
You see, even using
all your strength,

131
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,702
I know this is the
best you can do.

132
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:29,736
-I knew it.

133
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:33,002
He's actually pushing her back.

134
00:08:33,036 --> 00:08:35,802
Is she putting on an act?

135
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:37,169
No way.

136
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:40,136
The captain has so much pride,
she rejected my offer to help.

137
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,102
Even if she were acting, she'd
never pretend to be losing.

138
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:46,336
So, should I go
help her out now?

139
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,469
I can't.

140
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:49,336
If she acts the way
she did last time,

141
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:52,336
I'll just catch another brick
and a bucket of complaints.

142
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:53,602
-Ha.

143
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:55,736
If that's how she is, let
her fight her own battles.

144
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,802
Why should I care
what happens to her?

145
00:08:57,836 --> 00:08:59,269
NIRGGE: Is that so?

146
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:01,169
-Yeah, damn right.

147
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:02,802
-Guess you forgot about me.

148
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:22,469
-Worried about your
lackey after all?

149
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:24,102
-If I worried about
my subordinates

150
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:26,502
whenever they're
challenged, I'd never stop.

151
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:27,469
-Really?

152
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:28,836
Well, it looks
like you won't have

153
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,536
to concern yourself worrying
about your little lieutenant.

154
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:33,369
-Why's that?

155
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:36,802
-I doubt that loser will
be alive much longer.

156
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:38,036
-Oh well.

157
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:39,569
That's his problem.

158
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:40,369
He's just too weak.

159
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:44,436
MAN: You're quite a
cold one, Captain.

160
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:52,502
-Maybe I over did it
with that last punch.

161
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:54,336
I should've held back a little.

162
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:57,969
But that fat wise ass
was really annoying.

163
00:09:58,002 --> 00:10:01,769
It's just no fun what
it's one and done.

164
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:05,869
-Well now, you have no one
to worry about anymore.

165
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:10,269
I think it's time for
me to finish this off.

166
00:10:10,302 --> 00:10:12,236
-I wasn't worried.

167
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:15,536
I have no such feelings for
the subordinates in my squad.

168
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:16,536
And besides--

169
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:21,469
-Huh?

170
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,836
Ow, my head.

171
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:31,702
-Damn you.

172
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:33,836
-I have such good luck.

173
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:36,069
I don't know why, but
since I was a kid,

174
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,902
my body's always
been pretty sturdy.

175
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:40,769
Maybe it's because
us rich people

176
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:44,502
are built to handle tougher
stuff than most poor folks are.

177
00:10:44,536 --> 00:10:45,602
-I've heard enough.

178
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:50,036
I'm shutting your wise
ass mouth for good.

179
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:52,336
-I'm not falling for that again.

180
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:53,136
Now smash them!

181
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:53,636
Gegetsuburi!

182
00:10:57,369 --> 00:10:58,469
How about a little payback?

183
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,202
Come on, Pal.

184
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,436
What happened to all
that tough talk of yours?

185
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:15,169
Now that I'm not
running, you look scared.

186
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:17,569
Yeah, the tables have turned.

187
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:18,702
You hear that, Captain?

188
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:30,269
Hey.

189
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:31,136
What the hell is she doing?

190
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:32,569
She'll wind up dead!

191
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:37,669
You won't get away with this.

192
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,369
You stinky bastard.

193
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:46,502
-Take another spin.

194
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:56,302
-Looks like our roles have
switched, captain of Squad 2.

195
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:02,202
And it certainly appears your
second in command's battle

196
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:04,569
will be settled soon as well.

197
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:07,602
But you won't live
to see the end of it.

198
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:14,236
-Now you know.

199
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,869
-Damn bastard.

200
00:12:19,902 --> 00:12:20,869
-It's useless.

201
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:23,469
You can't get out
of this this time.

202
00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:24,836
Hey.

203
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,902
Looks like you're going to get
to see your captain's fight

204
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:28,869
finish up first.

205
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:30,236
-That's not my main concern.

206
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:37,069
(IN HEAD) She's really
in trouble over there.

207
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:38,436
Should I go to help her?

208
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:41,769
I want to, but if I don't do
something about this guy first,

209
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,602
he'll attack me
from behind again.

210
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:47,502
I can't do anything unless I
get this trunk of his off me.

211
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:52,536
Damn.

212
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:54,502
That's a Cero!

213
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:55,269
-Here we go.

214
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:02,802
You ready to get hit by
this at point blank range?

215
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:19,240
-Now that I think of it,
I did tell you my name.

216
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:24,107
But things have happened so
fast, I still don't know yours.

217
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,673
Not that it really matters.

218
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:32,407
See you, Captain of Squad Two.

219
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,673
[shouts]

220
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,140
[groan]

221
00:13:41,173 --> 00:13:42,440
-You're in the way.

222
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:43,273
What is this?

223
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:44,607
You can't appear out of nowhere.

224
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,573
-Gotcha.

225
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:51,173
-Hold on.

226
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:54,173
Didn't Nirgge kill you?

227
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:55,607
-Who's Nirgge?

228
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,440
Oh, yeah.

229
00:13:56,473 --> 00:13:58,440
You mean that elephant creep?

230
00:13:58,473 --> 00:14:00,407
[scream]

231
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,573
-Hey, I can use this
force against him.

232
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:05,073
Yah!

233
00:14:08,573 --> 00:14:09,040
Yah!

234
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,473
Idiot!

235
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:17,007
I just took the strength of your
pull and used it to nail you!

236
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,507
Captain!

237
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,773
That's how it happened.

238
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:27,007
Anyway, Captain,
I really did it.

239
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,773
I have him locked.

240
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:31,073
So Captain, now,
this is your chance.

241
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:32,640
-Her chance?

242
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:35,807
You're not being serious?

243
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,307
-Huh?

244
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,540
[groan]

245
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:43,673
-Now fly away.

246
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:46,107
[groan]

247
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:02,940
-Who told you to come rescue me?

248
00:15:02,973 --> 00:15:05,173
Didn't you hear me earlier?

249
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:06,807
You are quite arrogant.

250
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,207
And when you operate this way,
it's quite insulting to me.

251
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,873
-Um, but I-- well, you see--

252
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:15,840
-As I was fighting
him, I was holding back

253
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,440
because I wanted to gauge
the strength of an Arrancar's

254
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:20,373
Resurreccion attack.

255
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:22,507
I was merely preparing
for my next battle

256
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,640
against the Espadas.

257
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:30,940
Oh, never mind.

258
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,040
I think I've seen
enough of his limits.

259
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:37,707
-Well-- you-- you-- you don't
have to put it like that!

260
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,773
I came on the double
to rescue you, Captain,

261
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:46,407
because I thought that you
were gonna be wiped out.

262
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,507
Hey!

263
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,807
Who told you to
come and rescue me?

264
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,873
What the hell did that mean?

265
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,873
You said that like
I did something

266
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:55,573
I shouldn't have done.

267
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:56,340
You witch!

268
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,040
You're wicked!

269
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:59,173
You mean-spirited creep!

270
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:01,840
-Lend me your ear, Omaeda.

271
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:02,707
-Huh?

272
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,273
What is it?

273
00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:11,373
-Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

274
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:12,807
-Moron.

275
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,207
My guess is that you were
worried that if I was killed,

276
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,107
then you supposed
you would be next.

277
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,673
That's why you came to help.

278
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:22,340
Well then, am I correct?

279
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:24,773
-I never thought that.

280
00:16:24,807 --> 00:16:26,507
SUI-FENG: What if
I had been killed?

281
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,773
I never taught you
to come to my rescue.

282
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:29,773
Think.

283
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:31,807
What did I teach you?

284
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,473
When one of us dies, that
gives the other of us

285
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:36,073
a chance to strike.

286
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:37,540
Don't get in between.

287
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:38,573
Stab him from behind.

288
00:16:42,473 --> 00:16:46,307
If the enemy is too powerful
for you to do even that,

289
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,740
then abandon your
fellow squad member.

290
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:52,940
That is the way of
the Stealth Force.

291
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,207
Look.

292
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,740
Your enemy is still
alive and well.

293
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:05,607
-What?

294
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,307
-Go on.

295
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,507
Get going.

296
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,707
-Come on!

297
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,273
You don't have to speak
to me so harshly, do you?

298
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:12,140
-Never mind.

299
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:15,007
You need to go now.

300
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Go defeat him.

301
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:16,540
Quickly.

302
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,973
-Sorry to keep you
waiting, Arrancar.

303
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,807
Now, listen to me.

304
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,807
Earlier you mocked what you
thought were my best efforts,

305
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,540
so allow me to show you
a real assassination.

306
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:41,540
-What?

307
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:44,507
[shouting]

308
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,707
OMAEDA (VOICEOVER):
That bastard's

309
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,407
seriously on a rampage.

310
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,173
I can't go attacking him when
he's swinging his trunk around

311
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,607
like that.

312
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,673
-I'll show you.

313
00:17:57,707 --> 00:17:59,873
Get ready to be
smashed to death!

314
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,607
[shout]

315
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:10,165
-Ha ha ha ha!

316
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:11,565
What a way for this to end.

317
00:18:11,598 --> 00:18:12,498
You're mine!

318
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:18,398
Huh?

319
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,365
OMAEDA: Sorry.

320
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,798
-Where are you?

321
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:33,865
-Earlier I learned
something important.

322
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:36,565
-When one of us dies,
that gives the other of us

323
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:38,431
the chance to strike.

324
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:39,398
Don't get in between.

325
00:18:39,431 --> 00:18:41,865
Stab them in the back.

326
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:44,765
-It's not only when
one of our squad dies.

327
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,865
Our own crisis can give us
a chance to strike, as well.

328
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:49,865
-You bastard.

329
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:52,365
You mean you went
down on purpose?

330
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,831
-You're through.

331
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,765
Yah!

332
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:58,731
[scream]

333
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:09,665
-So, you're going to show
me a real assassination?

334
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,098
Heh.

335
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:13,098
Go ahead.

336
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:14,331
SUI-FENT: Wait.

337
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:15,898
I take back what I just said.

338
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:16,998
-Huh?

339
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,531
Why is that?

340
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:22,065
-This will end so quickly,
you won't even notice it.

341
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:24,731
-Don't you mock me!

342
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,665
[shout]

343
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:37,598
-What was that?

344
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:39,198
-Look, you.

345
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:41,598
I'll show you what
true strength is!

346
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:56,765
[shouting] Behold, Tigre
Estoque's actual battle form.

347
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:57,931
This is Tigre Estoque Sabre!

348
00:20:07,598 --> 00:20:12,265
-Sorry victims of my Suzumebachi
are killed by the two stings

349
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,298
that I deliver.

350
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:17,598
But I'm betting
you only felt one.

351
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:41,498
[gasping]

352
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,465
-Dammit.

353
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:48,398
[scream]

354
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:56,098
-Yeah!

355
00:20:58,865 --> 00:20:59,831
Way to go, Captain!

356
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:00,598
Incredible!

357
00:21:00,631 --> 00:21:03,365
You did it!

358
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:04,731
-I'm confused.

359
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,531
So Suzumebachi is effective
even if it doesn't sting twice

360
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,331
in the same place?

361
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:10,198
-It did.

362
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:11,898
-What?

363
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:13,931
SUI-FENG: I struck him
twice in the same location

364
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:15,398
in his right lung.

365
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:19,831
One from the front,
and one from the back.

366
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:23,265
I went for his internal organs
from the very start, not

367
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:24,798
the wound.

368
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:26,831
But enough, already.

369
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:29,765
We don't have any time
for a chat, Omaeda.

370
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:30,265
-Huh?

371
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:42,965
-A new opponent.

372
00:21:42,998 --> 00:21:45,931
Don't say anything that
might compromise us.

373
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:47,798
-Right.

374
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:51,065
-And this time,
follow me closely,

375
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:52,965
so that you don't
get in the way.

376
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:57,265
-Right.

377
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:20,603
[theme music]

378
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:47,419
OMAEDA: That Mamut
what's his name

379
00:23:47,452 --> 00:23:48,952
wasn't much of an opponent.

380
00:23:48,985 --> 00:23:49,719
NIRGGE: Rawr!

381
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:51,619
My name is Nirgge Parduoc!

382
00:23:51,652 --> 00:23:55,085
Mamut is my name in my giant
elephant soldier Resurreccion

383
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,252
form!

384
00:23:56,285 --> 00:23:57,519
OMAEDA: It doesn't really
matter, "Pardukey."

385
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:58,852
You're already did.

386
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:02,385
NIRGGE: Oh, shut up!
