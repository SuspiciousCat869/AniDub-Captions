[theme music]

2
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:58,590
-I now call this captain's
meeting to order.

3
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:01,590
The Ryoka infiltration
has been confirmed.

4
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:04,023
Subsequently, here
are my orders.

5
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:08,057
All squads are on second class
alert, effective immediately.

6
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,890
In addition, because of
this serious situation,

7
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,923
I am taking this special measure
assigning Squad 10 Captain

8
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:18,390
Hitsugaya chief responsibility
for the Ryoka's capture.

9
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:20,123
-Yes, Head Captain.

10
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:22,490
-We are having difficulty
gathering reliable intelligence

11
00:02:22,523 --> 00:02:24,090
at the moment, captain.

12
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:26,057
There is also a problem
with information leaking

13
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,323
from the Department of
Research and Development.

14
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,623
You must find out what
is really happening,

15
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:34,023
and disseminate the information
to all of the 13 squads.

16
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:36,023
-Sir.

17
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:40,085
-Finally, and this is the most
important directive of them

18
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:48,357
all-- anyone who
encounters a Ryoka

19
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,457
is to eliminate him
without hesitation.

20
00:02:57,123 --> 00:02:57,718
-Look.

21
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:04,423
-Watch out!

22
00:03:04,457 --> 00:03:06,090
It's coming this way!

23
00:03:06,123 --> 00:03:09,023
[shouting]

24
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,423
-Have any of the other
squads been deployed?

25
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:30,957
-Yes they have, Captain.

26
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,023
Lieutenant Omaeda and
some other from Squad 2

27
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:35,290
were ordered to head out
a little while ago, sir.

28
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:36,623
-Were there any others?

29
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:38,657
-Lieutenant Iba
of Squad 7 is also

30
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,157
reported to be headed
to the Rukon District.

31
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,957
-Very well.

32
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,990
Continue gathering
any information

33
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,323
you can about squad
movements, and especially

34
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:46,623
reports on the Ryoka.

35
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:48,390
And make sure you
overlook nothing.

36
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:48,890
-Yes, sir.

37
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:58,557
-It's so quiet.

38
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,357
-For now.

39
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,257
But it will be
noisy soon enough.

40
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,423
MAN: There they are!

41
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:12,057
-I get to go first.

42
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:12,957
-No.

43
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,057
I get first crack at them.

44
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,923
Taking us all on in
broad daylight, huh?

45
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,057
You've got some nerve.

46
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,223
-Hmph.

47
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:22,223
-Kariya, sir?

48
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:24,623
May I request that you
leave this one to me?

49
00:04:24,657 --> 00:04:25,523
-Ah, yes.

50
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,490
This will serve as
a good test for us.

51
00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:30,657
-[inaudible] doll.

52
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:35,615
-Huh?

53
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:48,923
-Ha ha!

54
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,290
Hello.

55
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,257
Nice to see you all.

56
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,057
-Huh?

57
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,157
-Huh?

58
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,890
-The air here is
quite delicious.

59
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,990
It makes me feel wonderful.

60
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:02,223
-Heh.

61
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:04,457
I heard you Bounts used
strange techniques,

62
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,890
but I had no idea how strange.

63
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,457
-You mean cowardly techniques.

64
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,657
What's the matter.

65
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,590
You can't even fight
your own battles?

66
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:26,157
How is he doing that?

67
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,257
That bastard's absorbing reishi.

68
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,023
-That's impossible.

69
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:31,423
What are you?

70
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:34,457
-You look at me as if
I'm some sort of monster.

71
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,990
But that's where you're wrong.

72
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:40,590
Regardless of what you
think, I'm still a human.

73
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:41,657
Just an improved one.

74
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:46,390
-Get him!

75
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:48,123
-Now, Doll, take them out.

76
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:52,657
-I'm feeling especially
dangerous today.

77
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,038
-Hey!

78
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:18,423
-I'll make you pay for this.

79
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:21,290
[laughter]

80
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:22,490
-Wait.

81
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:23,423
Isn't there anyone
else to help out?

82
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:28,223
-I feel so strong right
now, it's amazing!

83
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:31,090
[laughter]

84
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,223
-Someone help!

85
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:33,257
There are too many of them!

86
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:39,590
-Don't bother.

87
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:41,557
It's a waste of your energy.

88
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,423
-What did you do to him?

89
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,157
I don't like attacking
unarmed opponents,

90
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,277
but you leave me no choice.

91
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,279
What the hell is going on?

92
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:09,145
-Ha ha ha!

93
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:14,079
Ah, ha ha ha!

94
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,179
Ha ha ha ha!

95
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,279
-You call yourself
a Soul Reaper?

96
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:31,179
You don't deserve the name.

97
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:48,545
Feel all right?

98
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:50,745
-It's wonderful.

99
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,612
There's an unlimited amount of
reishi of the highest purity

100
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:55,645
all around us.

101
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,645
-Excellent.

102
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,079
Then let us be off.

103
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:14,795
-Call for the med crew.

104
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,245
Now.

105
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,645
-Yes, sir.

106
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,045
-The rest of you,
full battle alert.

107
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,879
Fan out and see to the
wounded, on the double.

108
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:22,012
-Say something, lieutenant.

109
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:22,712
Can you move?

110
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,879
-Captain Hitsugaya,
it's Lieutenant Iba.

111
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:31,145
He was thrown through the wall.

112
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:32,579
-How is he doing?

113
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,279
-It's too soon to tell.

114
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:35,979
But at least he's
regained consciousness.

115
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:38,245
-Captain!

116
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,245
I'm sorry I'm late.

117
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,512
I've just returned from
the world of the living.

118
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:43,079
-Rangiku.

119
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:45,245
I'm afraid I've failed in my
mission, and now as a result,

120
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,112
I've allowed the Ryoka to
invade the Soul Society.

121
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:51,612
-As the officer who sent you,
the responsibility is mine.

122
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:53,612
Understand?

123
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:55,279
-Yes.

124
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:57,179
-What can you tell
me about the Bounts?

125
00:08:57,212 --> 00:09:00,145
I'm afraid that I don't
have very much to report.

126
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:03,712
Locating Bounts by our usual
means is virtually impossible.

127
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:05,912
Even right now, the
only spiritual pressure

128
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,545
in detectable amounts is
that of the two lieutenants.

129
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:11,779
-More bad news.

130
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:12,679
Keep looking!

131
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:14,179
Report anything unusual.

132
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:15,679
-Yes, sir!

133
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:17,945
-Welcome back,
Lieutenant Matsumoto.

134
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:18,612
-Thank you, sir.

135
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:31,945
-Well, here we are again.

136
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:33,612
-Yes.

137
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:35,045
-Rukia, did you feel it?

138
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:36,112
A while ago?

139
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:38,112
-Yes.

140
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,145
It felt like a Soul Reaper
was fighting a Bount somewhere

141
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,945
nearby.

142
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:44,079
-But you probably couldn't sense
the Bount's spiritual pressure,

143
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:45,079
could you?

144
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:49,679
-Just like in the world
of the living, isn't it?

145
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:51,945
-What's with the two of
you all lost in thought?

146
00:09:51,979 --> 00:09:54,245
Don't you know this is
a state of emergency?

147
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,279
-Huh?

148
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:56,812
-That's right!

149
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,945
No one wants to see you
looking all romantic.

150
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:00,912
You two were only supposed
to be friends, remember?

151
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:01,879
-Huh?

152
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:03,612
You don't know what
you're talking about.

153
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,979
-Oh, I don't, do I?

154
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:06,779
I've got eyes,
and I can see when

155
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:08,545
something suspicious
is going on.

156
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:09,779
-Come now, friends.

157
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:11,045
Everyone needs to calm down.

158
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:12,745
We have no chance of
defeating the Bounts

159
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,212
if we're fighting
amongst ourselves.

160
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:15,245
-Well, that's true.

161
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,912
-I don't care!

162
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:17,912
-Ichigo, Rukia.

163
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:18,712
Yoruichi.

164
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:21,579
We have some bad
news about Kukaku.

165
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:22,312
-What do you mean?

166
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:23,612
-I'm afraid that
she's not there.

167
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:25,179
-Huh?

168
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:28,145
-Well, Kukaku does have a habit
of picking up and moving out

169
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:29,745
all of a sudden.

170
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,212
-Is there someone we can ask?

171
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:34,212
Who would know where
she could have moved to?

172
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:36,912
-I think I have an idea of
where she just might be.

173
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:53,179
-There it is.

174
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:54,112
[laughter]

175
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:56,112
ORIHIME: That's Kukaku's
house, all right.

176
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:58,245
We found her!

177
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,279
-Nice remodel.

178
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:00,745
-You think so?

179
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:01,745
-Yeah.

180
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:03,545
-It's so odd.

181
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,945
Every time she
moves, she completely

182
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:06,979
changes the design of her house.

183
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:11,245
-And every time, she proves
she has no sense of style.

184
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,145
-Like the way you draw.

185
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:16,845
-Watch it.

186
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,779
-Gettin whacked by you is
supposed to be Kon's job,

187
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,212
isn't it?

188
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:21,745
And by the way, where is Kon?

189
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,212
-Huh?

190
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:24,679
-Come to think of it, I
haven't seen him for a while.

191
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:26,079
-That's strange.

192
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:28,112
I'm positive he came along
with us to this Kukaku--

193
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,512
-Oh!

194
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:31,779
If Kon is lost, we
have to find him.

195
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:34,112
Do you think we should split
up and start searching?

196
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:36,245
-I don't think we'll need
to worry too much about him.

197
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,245
He'll be all right.

198
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,212
Kon is bursting with energy.

199
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:39,279
-Well, that's true.

200
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:40,471
-That's right.

201
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:41,912
-All right.

202
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:43,779
[screaming]

203
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:49,073
-I know that scream.

204
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,859
-Ichigo!

205
00:11:57,892 --> 00:11:59,192
Rukia!

206
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:01,025
Doesn't that figure?

207
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,192
We come all this way
together, and who gets lost?

208
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:04,392
Me.

209
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:08,359
It could have been one of
them, but no, it had to be Kon.

210
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:09,859
-Sorry, but no entry.

211
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:11,592
This area is sealed.

212
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,192
-What's this about?

213
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,225
Hello?

214
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:18,092
What's all the excitement about?

215
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,125
[gasps]

216
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,692
-What is that thing?

217
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:23,225
-It has to be some kind
of miniature monster.

218
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:23,992
-What?

219
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:24,892
I'm no monster.

220
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:26,892
-You can just tell
how dangerous it is.

221
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:27,459
-No, no.

222
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:28,359
You've got me all wrong.

223
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:29,159
I'm not dangerous at all.

224
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:31,192
I'm a Mod-Soul.

225
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:32,292
-If that's an intruder--

226
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:34,092
-Then we should
grab it before it

227
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,325
tries to destroy any
other walls and houses.

228
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,259
-Hey, wait.

229
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,159
I didn't destroy anything.

230
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,959
I couldn't do that
even if I wanted to.

231
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,792
-Get him!

232
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:44,225
-Stupid people
acting like they've

233
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,825
never seen a stuffed
animal before.

234
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:47,992
Well, they're not gonna
kick the stuffing out of me!

235
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,359
I'm gonna live if I
have to run all night!

236
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:54,225
-You're such a bumbling idiot!

237
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:00,759
The only reason I sent you
to the world of the living

238
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,792
in the first place was because
I heard something strange was

239
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,592
happening there, and
I stupidly thought

240
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,659
you could be of some use to her.

241
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:09,959
-Yes, but I got distracted.

242
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,792
-Your mission failed because
you were paying more attention

243
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,759
to your job as a
convenience store clerk?

244
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:16,159
Are ya kidding me?

245
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,159
-It's the same old story.

246
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,159
-I'm sorry he couldn't
have been of more help.

247
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:26,992
-How is it you know what a
convenience store is, Kukaku?

248
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:27,525
-Why?

249
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,259
Is that a surprise?

250
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:30,592
What do you mean?

251
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,792
Are you trying to
say I'm stupid?

252
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:33,125
-No, it wasn't that at all.

253
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,392
I was just--

254
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:36,892
-In case you hadn't noticed, I'm
not in the best mood right now!

255
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:43,325
-Just keep your mouth shut
around her for a while, Ichigo.

256
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:45,892
-But I don't know what
I said that was so bad.

257
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,692
-I can see now I'm going to have
to teach both of you a lesson.

258
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:50,792
[whimpering]

259
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:52,325
-Take it like a man!

260
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:53,759
-What did I say?

261
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:54,725
-Ah, Kukaku.

262
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,792
-You have to watch what
you say around her.

263
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:57,892
-I don't want to
take it like a man!

264
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,992
-Go on.

265
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:12,025
-We know that the leader of the
Bounts, a man named Jin Kariya,

266
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,859
said the reason
he was coming here

267
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:16,925
was to take revenge
on the Soul Society.

268
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,859
The Bounts were
originally created

269
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,992
by the Department of
Research and Development.

270
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,925
Despite that fact,
there's strangely

271
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,292
almost no record of their
existence in the Soul Society

272
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:26,192
files.

273
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:27,792
-Well, how can that be?

274
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,959
-People tend to put a lid
on anything that stinks.

275
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:32,292
That's probably
what happened here.

276
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:35,659
I don't have any details as to
exactly how the Bounts intend

277
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:39,159
to exact their revenge
on us, but at least we

278
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:41,725
know it will be very difficult
for them to gain entrance

279
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,959
to the Seireitei, since
it's heavily guarded.

280
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:46,792
-So, you want to
find these Bounts,

281
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:48,192
and then figure out
what they're up to.

282
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:49,259
Is that the case?

283
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:50,959
-That's right.

284
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:53,225
I know there are a lot of
us, and I'm sorry to impose,

285
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,959
but would it be all right if we
stay here for the time being?

286
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:57,892
The Rukon District
is a big area,

287
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:00,725
and this is a good
central location for us.

288
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,359
-Koganehiko, Shiroganehiko.

289
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:04,892
How are our food supplies?

290
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:07,059
-We'll put body and
soul into the task.

291
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:10,159
-We could feed up to 100, if
that is your wish, master.

292
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:11,392
-Very well.

293
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:14,092
It's the least I can do, since
the Bounts wouldn't be here

294
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,259
in the first place if it
weren't for my idiot brother.

295
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:17,592
-Huh?

296
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,925
Hey, why should
I take the blame?

297
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,192
I just did my job.

298
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:22,759
You're right.

299
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:25,925
The whole thing's all my fault.

300
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:26,925
-It's all settled, then.

301
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,092
Make yourselves at home here.

302
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,259
I am curious, though.

303
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:31,859
Have you thought
much about how you're

304
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:33,359
going to locate these Bounts?

305
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,992
-Tah-dah!

306
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:35,959
-That's where we come in.

307
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:38,059
Just leave the locating
to the three of us.

308
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:41,659
-What in the hell are these
bizarre little things?

309
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,825
-They're Mod-Souls that
Kisuke Urahara created

310
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,592
with the ability to detect
Bount spiritual pressure.

311
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,259
-I see.

312
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:49,792
Then these are Mod-Souls.

313
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,692
Who'd have thought to
use stuffed animals?

314
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:55,725
Leave it to Kisuke to come
up with something so strange.

315
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,592
-We're not that strange.

316
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,892
-And it's our
abilities that matter.

317
00:15:58,925 --> 00:15:59,592
Sheesh.

318
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,825
-There's still one more item.

319
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:03,692
I have an important
request of everyone.

320
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:04,925
-What's that?

321
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,659
-I'd like you all to try to
collect information on someone

322
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:08,825
called Ran'Tao.

323
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:09,859
-Ran'Tao?

324
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:11,059
Who's that?

325
00:16:11,092 --> 00:16:15,692
-Well, Ichigo, think back to
when Kariya was telling you

326
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,925
about the history of the Bounts.

327
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:19,992
He mentioned the person
here in the Soul Society

328
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:23,025
who was the lead researcher,
the one who actually created

329
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:24,825
the Bounts in the first place.

330
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,825
That was Ran'Tao.

331
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:28,092
ICHIGO: What?

332
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,092
RUKIA: Are you saying at this
Ran'Tao person is still alive,

333
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,159
and still here?

334
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,959
-Yes.

335
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:37,359
It's been more than 1,000 years
since Ran'Tao was expelled from

336
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:40,259
the Seireitei, but rumors
persist that he still lives

337
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,625
in Rukon.

338
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:42,859
-Let's track him down, then.

339
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:45,259
I mean, who would be able to
tell us more about the Bounts

340
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,725
than the one who created
them in the first place?

341
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,725
-Indeed.

342
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,692
-All right, now.

343
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:52,859
If that's all, then
let's have some dinner.

344
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:55,792
Koganehiko, Shiroganehiko,
is everything ready for us?

345
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:56,659
-Yes.

346
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:58,359
Right this way.

347
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,825
-Come to think of it,
I am pretty hungry.

348
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:02,292
I can't remember the
last time I ate anything.

349
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:03,659
-Mm.

350
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:07,359
-Thank you for your
hospitality, Kukaku.

351
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,259
-Yoruichi.

352
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,959
-What is it?

353
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:14,225
-Is there anything else
you want to tell me about?

354
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:15,359
-What do you mean?

355
00:17:15,392 --> 00:17:17,825
-Come on, don't
play dumb with me.

356
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:21,359
If you want me to help, you
have to tell me everything.

357
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:23,325
Why stay here instead of
going into the Seireitei?

358
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,025
It's not just because it's
convenient for the search,

359
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:32,059
is it?

360
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,825
-I've learned that
among the Bounts,

361
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,059
there's a Soul Reaper
who's helping them.

362
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:38,725
He not only has the ability to
hide his spiritual pressure,

363
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,592
but he can make
himself invisible,

364
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,759
and he's broken into
the Seireitei already.

365
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,892
-Oh?

366
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:47,025
-That's why I have no
doubt that it was this Soul

367
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,092
Reaper, whose name is Ichinose.

368
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,925
He's the one who broke
into the archives

369
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:53,792
at the Department of
Research and Development.

370
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:56,759
He manipulated the data,
and then sealed the database

371
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,259
so that Mayuri Kurotsuchi
would become interested

372
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:01,325
in the Bounts.

373
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,592
Having fallen for
such a simple trick,

374
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,292
Kurotsuchi then
helped the Quincy

375
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:08,692
to regain his powers, which
then allowed the Quincy to let

376
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:12,925
the Bounts enter
the Soul Society.

377
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,359
-I understand.

378
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,692
So in other words, you
need to hide out somewhere

379
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,159
where this Soul
Reaper, Ichinose, won't

380
00:18:18,192 --> 00:18:20,692
be able to track your movements.

381
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,225
-Sui-Feng is taking steps to
strengthen the Seireitei's

382
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:26,692
security, but given everything
that's happened so far,

383
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:29,959
I don't think much can
be done to stop him.

384
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,259
-Probably not.

385
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:33,025
-There's also the
fact that as someone

386
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,225
who left the Soul Society, it
would be a real pain for me

387
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:39,359
to go back after all this time.

388
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:40,525
-Forget the other stuff.

389
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,192
That sounds like the real
reason you don't want to go.

390
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:48,925
-Let's just say I want to
do things my way this time.

391
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,992
-Can you win?

392
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,059
-I don't know.

393
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:53,859
-Well, fine.

394
00:18:53,892 --> 00:18:56,759
You know that I've never been
one to shy away from trouble.

395
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,925
I'll do whatever I can to help.

396
00:18:58,959 --> 00:18:59,659
-Thank you.

397
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:10,092
-All of you will
split up and head out.

398
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,759
Use the Mod-Souls to try and
detect the Bounts' presence.

399
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,692
If you find any trace of
them, use a small amount

400
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:18,759
of spiritual pressure
to inform the others.

401
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:19,625
Is that clear?

402
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,992
-Mm-hm.

403
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:24,659
-Rukia, what are you
going to be doing?

404
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:26,125
-I'd like to go along
with you and help,

405
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:27,959
but now that I'm here,
I have to report back

406
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:30,025
to my squad for duty.

407
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:33,225
I'm afraid that I've already
put it off for too long.

408
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,825
-Well, take care, then.

409
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,925
-Try not to do anything stupid.

410
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,992
-All right.

411
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,192
-Not this again!

412
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:42,725
-Huh?

413
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,092
-I'm more valuable than
her, and I'll prove it!

414
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,925
I'm gonna go and
find a Bount myself.

415
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,859
And then you'll see!

416
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:47,825
I'll beat you, Rukia!

417
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:49,125
I'll beat you all!

418
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,825
-What was all that about?

419
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,692
-Nothing makes people more
irrational than jealousy.

420
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:56,792
-So true.

421
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:58,959
-She's such a pain,
but I need her.

422
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:00,225
-Yes, you do.

423
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:02,025
-Too bad she didn't hear that.

424
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,359
-Hey, where are you going?

425
00:20:04,392 --> 00:20:06,892
-We don't have any
time to waste here.

426
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:08,925
I'm going to get
started searching.

427
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,792
Just leave me on my own for now.

428
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:12,925
-Uryu, wait.

429
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,025
-I'll be all right.

00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:21,025
-Yes?

432
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,059
-Take care of Orihime.

433
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:24,092
-Just leave everything to me.

434
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,447
-Orihime, don't push yourself.

435
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:27,725
-I won't. Don't worry.

436
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,025
-All right.

437

Let's move.

of the Rukon District

I'm just so mad!

what I'm so mad about.

Argh!

I'm mad because I'm so mad.

Huh?

446
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:32,192
That presence.

447
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,292
I'd know that scary
presence anywhere.

448
