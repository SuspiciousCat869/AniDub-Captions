1
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:57,756
Ahhh!

2
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,430
Aww, what's wrong?

3
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,967
Taking your sweet time to
analyze the situation?

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,804
Don't you want to finish this?
I know I do!

5
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:14,239
I was right...

6
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:20,445
His attacks are laced with Ichigo's spirit
Energy. Stealing Ichigo's Fullbring

7
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,014
must have made
that possible.

8
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:25,784
This is going to
be a problem...

9
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:28,453
So uh, any
bright ideas?

10
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:30,989
Ideas?
Like what?

11
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:34,960
Great! You're the one who wanted
to freakin' analyze everything!

12
00:02:34,993 --> 00:02:38,430
I mean I thought you were figuring
out a quick way to drop this guy!

13
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:43,001
What are you, stupid? There's
no easy solution here.

14
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:45,337
Come on, you
serious?

15
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,341
I've been watching him closely,
observing his Spirit Energy.

16
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:53,011
Now listen, his Spiritual
Pressure contains your-

17
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:54,279
I'll catch ya
later, okay?

18
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,214
(angry grunt)

19
00:02:56,248 --> 00:02:58,483
Ichigo! Wait! If his
attacks are combined with

20
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:00,752
your own Spirit Energy,
then that means-!

21
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:05,157
So you've finally
come out, have you?

22
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,162
Well? Were you able to hatch up some sort
of plan while you were off in hiding?

23
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:14,900
I checked but he didn't have anything, so
I figured I may as well just come on out.

24
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:20,172
Getsugatensho... Makes sense.
You almost

25
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:23,408
finished me off with that
the last time around.

26
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:27,479
If you're going to beat me, it's
about the only chance you've got!

27
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,949
Don't do it, Ichigo!
He's egging you on!

28
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:40,358
Hmph!
Getsuga...

29
00:03:40,392 --> 00:03:42,427
...tensho!

30
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:45,430
(struggling grunts)

31
00:03:58,143 --> 00:04:03,215
If he's incorporated your Spirit Energy
into his own, then he can probably use your

32
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:05,317
techniques as well.

33
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,853
Are you listening,
Ichigo?!

34
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:10,322
I heard ya. Now
quit naggin'!

35
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:14,092
Nagging, are you kidding me?! Maybe if
you heard people out once in a while,

36
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,027
you wouldn't feel like
you were being nagged!

37
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:18,296
Like listening to you is
gonna change anything!

38
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:20,432
What're ya gonna do,
talk his powers away?!

39
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:24,035
Very funny... But at least
you know to be careful now.

40
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:26,471
Watch it, Ichigo
.

41
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:29,407
His last blow made
it very clear.

42
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:33,778
It wasn't just your Spirit Energy
and Fullbring that he took.

43
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:39,050
He's probably acquired every one
of your abilities, as well.

44
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:47,993
How could you...

45
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:54,132
Did you forget everything
I've done for you?

46
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:59,471
Doesn't it pain your heart...
to do this...

47
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:07,746
No, I have not forgotten. And I
appreciate all you've done. However, you

48
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:09,881
are Ichigo
Kurosaki's enemy.

49
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:13,718
Bitter it may be, but any
foe of his must die.

50
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:16,254
Regardless of
who they are.

51
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:26,831
Damn...

52
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:41,212
Good, so you finally
made it out!

53
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:44,182
Hey, Captain. Man,
you were quick.

54
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:47,118
Ahh, shut up.
You're just slow.

55
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:51,756
Renji...

56
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:56,294
What happened? You such a mess?
Damn, you look pathetic!

57
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:59,331
Sorry, I escaped from
that dimension a while

58
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:02,200
ago, during the blast.
It was a long time

59
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,301
before I could
move again...

60
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:06,905
Oh... So that huge explosion
was your doing, eh?

61
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:09,074
What about your opponent...
you get 'em?

62
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:13,278
I took care of her. She's dead...
I think.

63
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:15,480
Long as we're keeping
track, how'd you do?

64
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:21,019
Uh, well...Funny story actually he kind
of disappeared after I scolded him a bit!

65
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:25,423
What do you mean scolded?! At least
now I know why I had to wait so long!

66
00:06:25,423 --> 00:06:27,759
Took your sweet
ass time, huh?!

67
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,194
E-Excuse me, sir...

68
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:32,964
Seriously, why do you guys always
start arguing the minute you show up?

69
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:36,134
Huh?! Butt out! This is
none of your damn business!

70
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:41,039
Yes, that's true. All right then. Go
ahead, get it out of your system.

71
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,340
Uh...

72
00:06:42,374 --> 00:06:44,442
What the hell? This
wasn't the deal?

73
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:47,912
You promised you were going to let
me go once I turned off my powers!

74
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:51,483
That's right, and once we've
confirmed everyone is free, I will.

75
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:54,419
There's no sign of
Kuchiki or Kuchiki yet.

76
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,156
Can you use their first names, sir?
Kinda gets confusing.

77
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,925
I'm losing feeling in my
arms and legs over here!

78
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,827
(gasp)

79
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:04,195
Rukia!

80
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:05,497
Look after her.

81
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,231
Yes, sir!

82
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:07,932
Is she all right?

83
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:14,339
She's alive. Her wounds are slight, and
her Spirit Energy is normal. However...

84
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:19,144
...there were no signs of the enemy or its
corpse in the area where I found her.

85
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:24,149
You look as though you
know something about this.

86
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,717
Course not.

87
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:30,188
I could barely even tell you what Rukia's
abilities are. We were trying to conceal

88
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:31,423
are powers from
each other.

89
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:35,326
I don't know if she's
dead, or if she got away

90
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:37,362
but trust me, I'd be
grateful for her demise.

91
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:41,933
Come on! Isn't this enough?!
Melt this ice off me already!

92
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:43,034
Not yet.

93
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:44,369
Why not?!

94
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,810
Oh, I can't undo
that one.

95
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:53,411
(gasp)

96
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:55,980
I-It's the truth,
I swear!

97
00:07:56,014 --> 00:08:00,752
Did you know Fullbringers and Substitute
Soul Reapers can trade their powers?

98
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:05,223
When we first joined Kugo, we traded a
portion of our powers with each other as

99
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:10,195
a sign of loyalty. We also placed a
small restriction on those powers.

100
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:14,165
The restriction I share with Kugo?
Anytime he's in a close enough range

101
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:17,469
of me wielding my abilities
then I can't undo them.

102
00:08:17,502 --> 00:08:19,804
Unless he
orders me to.

103
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:25,944
(fighting grunts)

104
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:32,150
That was pretty good. But, you
put yourself at quite a risk.

105
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,319
Not really what I
was going for!

106
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:38,857
Yeah I figured as much. You just
charged in with everything you've got.

107
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,293
So what are you even
fighting for now, anyway?

108
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,362
What do you mean?

109
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:47,165
Tsukishima...
He's dead.

110
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:48,433
(gasp)

111
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:49,167
Hmph.

112
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:57,308
Well, he's not dead yet, but it's only
a matter of time before his Spiritual

113
00:08:57,342 --> 00:09:02,180
Pressure is gone. I'd give him
another ten minutes tops.

114
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:07,452
What's more... when a Fullbringer dies,
all traces of their abilities disappear.

115
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:12,457
Do you know what that means? If
Tsukishima dies... All the memories

116
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,426
of the past he created
will be wiped away.

117
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:21,800
Your friends and family will all
be just as they were before.

118
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,102
So I'll ask
you again...

119
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:28,206
...Knowing that, what exactly
is it that you're fighting for?

120
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,247
No answer? Then let me
enlighten you further.

121
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:41,319
I think it's about time you
learned who your real enemy is.

122
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:52,030
They've finally
stabilized.

123
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:54,833
Yes.
Tessai...

124
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,734
I leave the
rest to you.

125
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:58,303
Of course, I'll
look after them.

126
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:00,004
Where are you
going?

127
00:10:00,338 --> 00:10:02,140
To catch up
with everyone.

128
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:05,009
To assist them?
I'm coming with you.

129
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:09,147
Most of the fighting is probably over.
I'm going to provide healing.

130
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,718
You unfortunately wouldn't be of any help,
Isshin. You'll be more useful staying here.

131
00:10:14,018 --> 00:10:17,422
I don't like this. Shouldn't we try
to wrap things up quickly by helping

132
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,090
Ichigo in his fight?

133
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,792
If we don't,
then...

134
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:24,028
Then the truth will come out.
Ginjo will tell him everything.

135
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:27,732
It's fine...

136
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:32,770
He was bound to find out.
Sooner or later.

137
00:10:34,038 --> 00:10:37,909
What are you talking about?
My real enemy?

138
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:39,744
Yes.

139
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:44,148
Don't mess with me. I've had about all
I can stand of your stupid mind games.

140
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:46,284
We've both had
enough.

141
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:50,255
You've found yourself at a disadvantage,
so you present a shocking fact to whip

142
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:52,357
up a bit of
psychological pressure.

143
00:10:52,757 --> 00:10:56,494
You'd be better off joining
forces with me. Pretty

144
00:10:56,728 --> 00:11:00,198
obvious, really. Go ahead.
Tell me I'm wrong.

145
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:02,767
Oh I'm at a disadvantage, am I?

146
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,071
And that's based on what exactly? I'm
sorry, but it would be fairly simple to

147
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:09,440
dispose of you
both if I chose to.

148
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:15,246
Attack from behind if you like, I can
parry. Won't even have to stop our chat.

149
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:19,284
Kurosaki...

150
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:20,985
Tell me...

151
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:24,289
Do you know why you were
entrusted with a Combat Pass?

152
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:25,757
(gasp)

153
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:28,226
What are you
getting at?

154
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:33,398
I can just imagine what they must have told
you when they placed it in your hands.

155
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:38,269
If a Soul Reaper is deemed
beneficial to the Soul Society...

156
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:42,874
...it is customary to entrust
them with the Combat Pass.

157
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:47,011
Listen closely,
Kurosaki.

158
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:49,147
You've been
fed a lie.

159
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:54,953
It's no simple task for an organization
to determine whether someone will be of

160
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:58,056
benefit, or
hindrance...

161
00:11:58,356 --> 00:12:01,159
They may have told Ichigo,
that those deemed

162
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,428
of benefit are given
combat passes...

163
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:09,033
...but they neglected to tell him...
what happens to those who are not.

164
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:14,405
The truth of it is, whether one is of
benefit or detriment to the Soul Society

165
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:19,010
is irrelevant. Combat Passes are always
handed out equally, regardless of the

166
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,812
person in question.

167
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:24,148
The pass's official
name is the "Substitute

168
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:27,719
Soul Reaper Combat Pass."
It certifies one has

169
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:31,322
permission to conduct Soul Reaper
duties in the World of the Living.

170
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:33,324
I know.

171
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:38,196
Undoubtedly so, but have you ever, to
this moment, truly felt its authority?

172
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:39,764
(gasp)

173
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:44,769
I'm Ichigo. Substitute Soul Reaper.
Look. This is my pass.

174
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:48,740
A Combat Pass! Gimme a break, kid!
Who do you thing you're fooling with

175
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,273
that thing?!

176
00:12:49,273 --> 00:12:50,408
(laughter)

177
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:54,746
What's with this?! This damn
thing is completely useless!

178
00:12:56,414 --> 00:13:00,418
Are you saying there's another
reason they hand out Combat Passes?

179
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,320
Yeah.

180
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:06,457
Their real purpose is
surveillance and control.

181
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:09,861
Thanks to the Combat Pass,
the Soul Society is

182
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:12,897
able to keep constant
tabs on your whereabouts.

183
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,301
It also allows them to control your
Spirit Energy. At least whenever you

184
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:19,404
have the pass
on you.

185
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:24,409
Didn't you ever find it odd? Your Spirit
Energy rages out of control when you're

186
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:29,847
agitated, even in Soul Reaper form. So
why did it have no effect on you in

187
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:31,416
your human state?

188
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:38,122
Why, when you used your Combat Pass to
draw out Fullbring, did your Spirit

189
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:40,291
Energy gush forth
from it?

190
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:45,163
Why, during your Fullbring training were
you able to hear your friend's voice

191
00:13:45,163 --> 00:13:46,898
through the
pass?

192
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:51,436
Surely you've asked
yourself these things.

193
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:52,737
(gasp)

194
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:57,442
The Combat Pass is a
device that communicates

195
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:00,344
with the Soul Society,
absorbing your Spirit

196
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:05,316
Energy, then analyzing and controlling it.
It was given to you so that they could keep

197
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:09,954
you under their eye... And...
under their thumb.

198
00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:14,058
It's not that you never felt
it was strange, though...

199
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:18,296
...You simply pushed those questions
into the back of your mind.

200
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:22,900
These were people you
bonded with in battle.

201
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,770
They would never do
such a thing to you!

202
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:30,308
It defied reason. You didn't want to
believe they could betray you like that.

203
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:32,243
Am I right?

204
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:38,783
Now let me tell you... the name
of the man who spawned this idea!

205
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:43,721
Jushiro Ukitake! The
Captain of Squad Thirteen!

206
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:45,289
(gasp)

207
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:55,099
A Combat Pass?
Uh... What is it?

208
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,936
The Soul Society has an ancient
law covering the emergence of

209
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,405
Substitute Soul
Reapers like you.

210
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:05,309
Over the centuries there have been
other instances where Substitutes

211
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:07,178
have been deemed
useful.

212
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:11,115
They too were given this Combat
Pass as proof of their status.

213
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,317
Now this one
belongs to you.

214
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:16,921
I... I see.
Thanks, Jushiro.

215
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,934
Jushiro, huh...

216
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:33,804
We've been duped by the most peace-loving
man in all the Court Guard Squads!

217
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:36,007
He has completely
betrayed our trust!

218
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:38,276
What do you
think of that?!

219
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:47,885
All of this time his aim was to watch us.
Control us. To use you and me as

220
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:53,057
pawns of the Soul Society. But if
we'd resisted we'd be eliminated!

221
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,792
This is bad...

222
00:15:55,026 --> 00:15:56,794
Ichigo!

223
00:15:56,827 --> 00:16:00,398
There's no way he can cope with
these truths in his present state.

224
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:05,169
They all know, do you understand! Everyone
in the Soul Society knows the truth!

225
00:16:05,203 --> 00:16:06,504
Except you!

226
00:16:06,737 --> 00:16:10,408
And now they've abandoned you
and left you to die here.

227
00:16:10,408 --> 00:16:11,409
Ichigo!

228
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:13,144
Ignore him,
Ichigo!

229
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:14,212
Shut up!

230
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:15,413
(gasp)

231
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:17,448
Hnph!

232
00:16:26,057 --> 00:16:27,391
Bankai!

233
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:40,012
Rukia!

234
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:41,146
Renji?

235
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:45,817
Talk to me, are you all right?! Let
me help you, does it hurt anywhere?!

236
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:48,887
Yeah... Primarily around
my right shoulder!

237
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,569
Is Ichigo...
still inside?

238
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,847
With this many captain-
class Soul Reapers

239
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:19,117
present, destroying that
dimension should be easy.

240
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:24,056
I get it. They're waiting
to see what he decides.

241
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:26,792
(gasp)

242
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:32,898
Hey... What...
What's going on?

243
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:36,134
Impossible! There's no way
they can break that...

244
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:02,894
Bankai...

245
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:05,697
Shut up?
Ha!

246
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:08,567
About what exactly?

247
00:18:09,034 --> 00:18:14,606
Do I pain you so terribly that you'd
use Bankai to silence me forever?

248
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:19,711
And what good would that do you? Would it
hide your eyes from the harsh reality?

249
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:21,913
Shut the hell up.

250
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:28,520
That one was for you, Ginjo. But when
I said it the first time it wasn't.

251
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,155
It was to Uryu.

252
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:30,956
Huh?

253
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,992
You expect me to ignore him?
You kidding?!

254
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:36,995
For once in your life,
mind your own business!

255
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:39,464
Ichigo...

256
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:46,004
Truth is it sounded strange to me too.
Everything that Jushiro told me that day...

257
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,773
What?!

258
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:53,045
But I just didn't want to believe it.
I didn't want to suspect Jushiro.

259
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:58,683
You were right. I've shoved those
thoughts to the back of my mind.

260
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:07,159
But then I realized something. I asked
myself... "Why was I suspicious of him?"

261
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,798
Jushiro is a lot
smarter than I am.

262
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:17,035
He knew what he was doing. If he had
genuinely intended to deceive me...

263
00:19:17,702 --> 00:19:21,106
...he could've kept me in the
dark and that would've been that.

264
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:26,678
But, when he gave me the Combat Pass.
He said all that I needed to know.

265
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:37,823
Wasn't long before I realized... The Pass
didn't seem to mean anything at all.

266
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:43,728
I figure Jushiro knew I'd
put two and two together.

267
00:19:44,696 --> 00:19:48,433
He wanted me to realize it, so
I could make my own choice.

268
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,068
And what would
that be?

269
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:54,506
Your little epiphany amounted to nothing.
You haven't any choice at all.

270
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,844
You're wrong. I chose the
path of protecting others.

271
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:04,749
I wanted power. The power to protect
everyone I could, wherever and

272
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:06,084
whenever I could.

273
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:10,789
And losing my abilities reminded
me how all this started...

274
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,095
I had been seeking the power to protect
people. And Rukia gave it to me.

275
00:20:17,662 --> 00:20:22,667
And when I eventually lost it...everyone
helped me to get it back.

276
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:28,974
I made my choice. And that means kicking
your ass to protect everyone else.

277
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,814
So much for negotiations.
You leave me no choice.

278
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:41,086
I really wanted to avoid
killing you if I could.

279
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:43,455
Ban...
kai.

280
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:07,012
Oh yeah. I almost forgot. You were
a Substitute Soul Reaper yourself.

281
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:11,149
That's right. But you're
forgetting something else...

282
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:18,690
As I told you, us Fullbringers, we were
attacked by Hollows when we were born.

283
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:24,396
Don't you remember? I have the
power of a Hollow within me.

284
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:25,964
Is that so?

285
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,744
It's time for you to make your move.
Let's get this over with, Ginjo.

286
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:43,782
Big talk, kid. That's why I like ya.
Ha ha ha.

287
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:49,454
Ahh!

288
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:54,392
Ahhh!

289
00:23:42,742 --> 00:23:48,848
Time is perpetually biting at our heels,
and with a roar, it overcomes us all.

290
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:53,753
There's no use looking ahead. For
hope lies only in the unforeseeable

291
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:56,889
current closing
in from behind.
