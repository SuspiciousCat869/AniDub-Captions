00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:52,596
As the only surviving heir
of the noble Kasumioji clan,

3
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:55,296
Princess Rurichiyo had
become a target for trouble

4
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:56,629
in her homeland.

5
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:58,529
For her own protection,
her guardians

6
00:01:58,563 --> 00:02:01,629
took the unsuspecting princess
to the world of the living,

7
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,163
where Ichigo reluctantly agreed
to become her body guard.

8
00:02:05,196 --> 00:02:07,529
Rurichiyo quickly
turned Ichigo's

upside down with her
spoiled behavior.

Elsewhere in the Soul
Society, Shusuke Amagai

11
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:16,496
became the new
Captain of Squad Three

12
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:19,229

men on unusual new missions.

He's over there!

-Get him!

00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,263

coming this--

-Come here!

21
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:28,929
-Maybe over here.

00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:29,404
-Yeah.

00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:36,104

62
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,937
reasons for giving
these assignments.

63
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,270
Lieutenant Kira,
what do you think?

64
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:48,470
-Huh?

65
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:49,304
Uh.

00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:53,037
That's a-- good question.

67
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,104
-Well, I, for one, prefer going
on more important missions.

00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,837
I can't.

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,637
I, uh, should write
up the report.

-I'm fine.

82
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:31,670
It's just-- I was a bit
startled to hear my first name.

83
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,004
-Yes, well, I thought it
would help the Squad feel more

84
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:38,704
comfortable with me if I started
using first names around here.

-Ah.

00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:46,470
Yeah, I see.

00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:49,737
I thought it was a decent
idea, but I guess not.

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,604
Oh well, back to
the drawing board.

92
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:54,670
-Here's today's report.

93
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:55,470
And sir?

94
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,904
-Hmm?

95
00:04:57,937 --> 00:05:01,070
-About the mission for tomorrow.

96
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:05,437
What's this about repairing the
walls at the Squad 12 barracks?

97
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,637
-Just what it sounds like.

98
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,970
You're fixing the walls.

99
00:05:08,004 --> 00:05:08,804
-No, sir.

100
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:11,537
That's not what I'm getting at.

101
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,937
-What's the purpose
of these orders?

102
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,004
The Squad thinks that I--

103
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:18,370
-Lieutenant, look.

104
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:21,837
I know this might be difficult
for you to deal with,

105
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,904
but Squad Three's previous
Captain, Gin Ichimaru,

106
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:28,170
betrayed these men, understand?

107
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:29,437
-Mmhmm.

108
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,270
-And the fact is, when
you lose somebody's trust

109
00:05:32,304 --> 00:05:34,237
it's tough to get it back.

110
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,804
I don't know how
things will play out,

111
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:38,237
but we'll have to work hard to
regain the respect of the Soul

112
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,737
Society.

113
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,404
Don't you worry, OK?

114
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,037
Seeing you like this makes
me realize something.

115
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,837
When he was Captain,
Gin Ichimaru

116
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,404
played too big a
role in this Squad.

117
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,504
-Huh?

118
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:56,904
-You are a lot
different than he was,

119
00:05:56,937 --> 00:06:00,737
and no one expects you
to act the same way.

120
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,337
A charismatic Captain can
bring a team together.

121
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,470
But once that pillar falls,
the team can as well.

122
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:10,637
That's why I want to rebuild
this Squad with you and Makoto.

123
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,537
The three of us will be
the pillar of strength

124
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,404
his team needs.

125
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,904
-Hmm.

126
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:19,937
-Say, where is Makoto now?

127
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:24,804
-Well, he's drinking
with the others.

128
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:26,470
After the battle
of the other day,

129
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:29,770
the men really seemed
to open up to him.

130
00:06:29,804 --> 00:06:31,470
-I say.

131
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:32,537
All right.

132
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,737
Well, then I think I'll
call it a day, too.

133
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,137
Go enjoy your evening.

134
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,037
You worry too much, you know?

135
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,904
-Huh?

136
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:41,070
But--

137
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:41,837
-See ya around.

138
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,737
[door shuts]

139
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,270
-Good evening to you, too, sir.

140
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,704
-Today we'll be learning
a new technique.

141
00:06:55,737 --> 00:06:58,904
Recently we faced a marked
increase in powerful enemies

142
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:00,937
like the Menos.

143
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,004
Case in point, the Precipice
World incident the other day.

144
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,370
So from now on, you will
learn to work together

145
00:07:13,404 --> 00:07:17,437
with fellow Squad members
in battle, or you'll die.

146
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:17,937
-Huh?

147
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,770
-What?

148
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:20,404
-I--

149
00:07:20,437 --> 00:07:24,304
-Well, this training should make
certain that doesn't happen.

150
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:24,837
Makoto?

151
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,337
-Sir.

152
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:30,770
-Choose one of these
colored headbands.

153
00:07:30,804 --> 00:07:33,070
When I call out a color,
those wearing that color

154
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:34,870
will act as the enemy.

155
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:39,437
The rest of you will then attack
the enemies in groups of three.

156
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,604
Keep in mind the enemy color
will change periodically.

157
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:47,404
The moment I call out another
color, the roles reverse.

158
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:50,870
This will refine your
decision-making as a group.

159
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,804
Makoto, go take your
place with the others

160
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:55,104
and lead the exercise.

161
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,337
-Sir.

162
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,470
-I'll join them, too.

163
00:07:57,504 --> 00:07:58,537
-Hold up.

164
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,804
Stay here, please.

165
00:07:59,837 --> 00:08:01,304
-Huh?

166
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:03,004
-I devised this
technique back when

167
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:05,304
we were with the
expedition unit.

168
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:08,404
Makoto is familiar
with all the tactics.

169
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:09,270
-Sir--

170
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:10,804
-Sorry for that.

171
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:11,604
Now let's go!

172
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:12,270
ALL: Yes, sir!

173
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,070
-First enemy, purple!

174
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,837
-Aida, stay close by my side.

175
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,337
-Right!

176
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,404
-Inose, rank around to the rear!

177
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:28,204
-Got it!

178
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:31,937
-Next group, yellow!

179
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,604
-OK, now red.

180
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:40,070
-Very good.

181
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:41,670
Keep up the pressure!

182
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:43,770
-Amazing!

183
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:47,437
How could the men become
so organized so quickly?

184
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,637
[water running]

185
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,004
-Captain Amagai's
fighting tactics--

186
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:55,370
they're unlike anything the
Squad has ever seen before.

187
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:56,437
-I hear ya.

188
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,237
I don't think Captain
Ichimaru ever used

189
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,937
group training techniques.

190
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,237
-It made me realize just
how much more powerful

191
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,070
our squad can be when we all
work together as a group.

192
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:05,937
-Yeah.

193
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,937
That Captain Amagai isn't bad.

194
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,370
I like his style.

195
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:11,370
-Third Seat Kibune, too.

196
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:12,970
-From what I've
seen so far, he's

197
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:15,570
much more experienced
than Lieutenant Kira.

198
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:16,970
-Something tells
me there's going

199
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:18,770
to be a change in
lieutenants soon.

200
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:20,504
-You should keep
your voice down.

201
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:23,870
-Oh. (CLEARING THROAT) Oops.

202
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:26,237
-Lieutenant Kira.

203
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,070
-Oh, Third-Seat Kibune.

204
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:29,537
-You OK?

205
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,104
-I know you heard the men.

206
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,470
-Yeah, um, I'm fine.

207
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:36,504
-Tell the truth.

208
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:40,170
-(CHUCKLING) I must admit,
you're good, Third Seat Kibune.

209
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,470
-Oh, no.

210
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:43,804
It's nothing compared to how
you kept Squad Three going

211
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:45,437
all this time, Lieutenant Kira.

212
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,070
-That's kind of you.

213
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:48,737
You're the kind
of leader the men

214
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,470
want to follow,
much more than me.

215
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:52,304
-But you--

216
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:54,704
-It's the truth and you know it!

217
00:09:54,737 --> 00:09:57,037
Huh?

218
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,170
I'm-- I'm sorry.

219
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:00,304
Just a bit tired.

220
00:10:00,337 --> 00:10:01,870
Please, excuse me.

221
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:03,370

[gulping]

225
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,670
-Keep 'em coming!

226
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:23,604
-(LAUGHING) Looks like
you're thirsty tonight!

227
00:10:23,637 --> 00:10:26,437
Here, you can have
a swig of my drink.

228
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,237
[gulping]

229
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,204
-You're really
putting them away.

230
00:10:32,237 --> 00:10:34,070
Say, uh, did something happen?

231
00:10:34,104 --> 00:10:35,270
-Nnngh.

232
00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:36,837
(SLURRING) No, I'm fine.

233
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,237
Squad Three is just going to
be a little different now,

234
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,504
that's all.

235
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:43,370
It's not going to be this
same Squad Three anymore.

236
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:44,237
-OK, OK!

237
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,637
Easy.

238
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,637
-When the captain changes, the
whole squad changes with him.

239
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,970
-Huh?

240
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:52,404
-This must be hard on you.

241
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:54,170
I get it.

242
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:55,637
[sighs]

243
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:03,637
-But thanks to Captain Amagai,
Squad Three's reputation

244
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,037
is on an upswing.

245
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,504
He's done some remarkable things
in a relatively short period.

246
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,270
-I agree.

247
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,670
The Squad is better.

248
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,704
-Then you should hold
your head up high!

249
00:11:13,737 --> 00:11:16,004
Because if you keep
acting like this,

250
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:17,970
all downtrodden
and miserable, then

251
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:20,037
that new guy in the
Squad-- what's his name?

252
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,104
That Third Seat fella--

253
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:22,404
-Third Kibune.

254
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:23,870
-Yeah, that guy!

255
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:27,937
Watch out or he'll steal
your title as lieutenant.

256
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,470
Huh?

257
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:32,070
-I'm OK with that.

258
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:35,004
May the best man win.

259
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:36,370
-Give it a rest.

260
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,037
-Oops.

261
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,104
-Uh oh.

262
00:11:38,137 --> 00:11:40,637
Looks like we hit a nerve there.

263
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,704
-Malcolm, party of two?

264
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:43,204
Right this way.

265
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:45,370
-Do you have a private room?

266
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,204
-Yes we do, sir.

267
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:49,137
-Uh.

268
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,970
-Speak of the devil.

269
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:54,404
-What's he doing
with Captain Kyoraku?

270
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:55,570
-All right, then.

271
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:56,504
Bottoms up.

272
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,504
-I'm honored to
have been invited

273
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,837
for a drink with the new
Squad captain everyone's

274
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,004
talking about.

275
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:07,704
-Well, I'm still
relatively new to the job.

276
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:10,704
So getting to know the senior
members is quite helpful.

277
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:12,270
-I see.

278
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:15,537
So, what is it you
wanted to talk about?

279
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,137
-I'll be straight with you, sir.

280
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,437
-Fine by me.

281
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,837
I'm not a big fan of
beating around the bush.

282
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:27,270
Well, sir, it's regarding
the 13 Court Guard Squads.

283
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:29,004
I'd like to find a
way for this Squads

284
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:31,437
to coordinate more
closely with each other.

285
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,304
-Oh, I see.

286
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,704
That sounds like a
rather ambitious project.

287
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:39,504
-I don't expect to be able to
meet all my goals right away,

288
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:41,304
but things can't
remain as they are!

289
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:43,370
-Easy, no need to get worked up.

290
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:45,737
-Oh, my apologies.

291
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,570
But I kind of like that idea.

292
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:48,570
It's not bad.

293
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:50,670
-So you agree with me then?

294
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,404
-You know, Shisuke,
you're a pretty bright guy

295
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:54,270
for a youngster.

296
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:54,770
-Me?

297
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:56,170
No.

298
00:12:56,204 --> 00:12:59,737
-But listen, as long as you and
I are discussing Squad affairs,

299
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,470
maybe we should get
Jushiro in on this.

300
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:04,870
-You mean the
captain of Squad 13?

301
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:05,837
-Yeah.

302
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,370
I mean, don't get me wrong.

303
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:09,170
I won't stand in
your way or anything,

304
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:11,337
but I'm just not
the type of guy who

305
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,537
likes to take the lead
on this stuff, you know?

306
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,404
So how about next time we
round up Jushiro and hash it

307
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:19,170
all up together?

308
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:21,204
-Sir, it would be my pleasure.

309
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:22,404
-Good.

310
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:25,004
Then let's kick off this
plan of ours with a toast.

311
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,137
Hold up, you're not drinking?

312
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:27,904
-No, I can't.

313
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:28,570
-Come on.

314
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:29,570
-Oh, uh.

315
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,104
Here goes nothing.

316
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:39,037
(GULPING)

317
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:45,570
-(CHUCKLING) Wait, what?

318
00:13:45,604 --> 00:13:47,037
You can't drink?

319
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,137
For real?

320
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,070
Aw man.

321
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:52,804
[door opening]

322
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:57,037
-Lieutenant Kira, East
Area Seven is all clear.

323
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,670
-Good work, Third Seat Kibune.

324
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:01,870
-And all's quiet
in the Inner Court.

325
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:03,837
-Is that so?

326
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,137
Thank you for the update.

327
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:12,237
Sir, is something the matter?

328
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,670
-Oh no, nothing.

329
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:14,637
Everything's fine.

330
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,604
Uh, anyway.

331
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:21,670
Why don't we have some tea?

332
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:22,604
