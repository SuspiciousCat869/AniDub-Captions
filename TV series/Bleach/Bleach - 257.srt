1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,966
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined by
its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,566
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:27,300
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:30,366
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:23,016
This is an instance of a
Zanpakuto going out of
control, after Muramasa
manifested it.

7
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:27,549
It isn't hard to
understand. You know that
Muramasa's abilities
affected not only

8
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:32,249
captains, but also
regular squad members,
right? And in those
cases, once their

9
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:36,916
Zanpakuto were released,
some of them found that
they had suddenly lost
control over these

10
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,749
weapons, and as a result,
they died.

11
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:45,149
This Zanpakuto is one of
the many that lost control
after the unfortunate loss
of its master.

12
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,816
Here's a thought.

13
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,783
I shall call these
creatures Sword Beasts!

14
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:08,149
Did you just hear a crash
coming from over there?

15
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:09,149
I didn't.

16
00:03:10,783 --> 00:03:12,649
Everything looks okay to
me.

17
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:15,283
<i>Guess I must be hearing</i>
<i>things.</i>

18
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:35,716
Hey! What's up Ichigo?!

19
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:41,149
Is it- You sensing
something that can't be
seen by humans? like
the undead??

20
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:45,916
Could be. You're
dead, right?

21
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:51,816
I know nothing about
this! I don't wanna see
or know about anything
that can't be seen!

22
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,949
Okay. It looks like
I've hit a nerve.

23
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:58,183
I know absolutely nothing
about that weirdness! See
you later!

24
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:01,883
That guy's got
some issues.

25
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:18,916
It's just
as I thought.

26
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:20,183
An enemy?!

27
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:41,949
So who are you?

28
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:45,149
You don't seem to be a
Hollow or a Soul Reaper.

29
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:49,183
My master. Where's
my master?!

30
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,883
Master? You mean
that you're a---

31
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,916
<i>He's a Zanpakuto!</i>

32
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:02,783
Stop!

33
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:08,316
He got away!

34
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,916
A Zanpakuto?

35
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:14,916
What's going on? I
thought we already
settled this whole
Muramasa problem.

36
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,183
I'm here to tell you
we're not done.

37
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:25,949
I heard things grew quite
intense and restoring
order took a lot of work
this time.

38
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:29,716
So... Just how is the Soul
Society doing now?

39
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:32,216
Has it completely
recovered yet?

40
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,249
I wish, I could say
yes.

41
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:42,383
Well I heard that
Muramasa was betrayed
by his own master. That
just isn't right.

42
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:47,716
Still, Muramasa's
actions caused major
damage to the Soul
Society. He's not

43
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,349
someone that we
should feel sorry for!

44
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:53,516
Sword Beasts?!

45
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:57,916
They're Zanpakuto who
have lost their masters.

46
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:04,116
Certainly I feel for
them, but we can't let
them just roam free. And
as I suspected, some of

47
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:06,883
them have already
wandered into this world.

48
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,683
Things could get
dangerous awfully quick.

49
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:13,149
Do you understand
Ichigo?

50
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:15,916
Yeah-guess there's more
work for me, again.

51
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,449
<i>Hey! Just who are you?</i>

52
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:23,549
<i>It doesn't matter who I</i>
<i>am, little bird! I'm not here</i>
to see you! I've got no business
<i>with stuffed animals.</i>

53
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,749
<i>[arguing]</i>

54
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:28,983
Rangiku!

55
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:34,016
Oh there you are! Hello
Captain Hitsugaya!

56
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:35,249
Uh-Captain?!?

57
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:41,783
What are you two
doing?! I never gave
you orders to accompany
me here!

58
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:47,416
<i>You never gave us orders</i>
<i>not to either. Besides,</i>
<i>Haineko wanted to take a peek</i>
<i>at the World of the Living!</i>

59
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,016
I am not here to have
fun!

60
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,616
<i>Calm down! Here, check</i>
<i>these out!</i>

61
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,449
Whoa!

62
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:06,283
Hey!-So who is this
woman?!

63
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:10,149
She's my
Zanpakuto, Haineko. Be
nice to her, okay?

64
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:14,183
No way!

65
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,749
Hell-lo!

66
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:22,449
Come on, take a look!

67
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,649
That's okay.

68
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:27,483
Really? I'd think
you'd wanna see these
little beauties.

69
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:31,816
Come on, come on, look.
You're gonna like what
you see.

70
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:38,983
That is it!

71
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:41,516
<i>You two-knock it off!!</i>

72
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:53,316
So those Sword
Beasts...

73
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:58,249
You know, I can't stop
wondering how many Zanpakuto
are out there who lost their
owners.

74
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:05,549
It stands to reason that
there is one for every
squad member who died in
battle. Hundreds.

75
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:09,016
That's awful. We lost
so many good men.

76
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:14,449
But now our own Zanpakuto
who we thought we'd turned
back into swords,

77
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:17,883
are wandering about
creating chaos for us
again.

78
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:20,749
So it would seem.

79
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,216
Yes, we face
quite a problem!

80
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:34,083
The Sword Beasts are
totally lost on their own.

81
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:40,249
If their loss of control
turns into violence and
destruction, we will not be
able to simply ignore them.

82
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:43,749
<i>I win boys!</i>

83
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,383
You're right. Hey, how
about that? Looks like
I lose again.

84
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:51,516
You owe me.

85
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:52,816
I know.

86
00:08:57,049 --> 00:08:59,583
Come on!...Draw for us!

87
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:03,149
All right, very well.

88
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:08,783
Draw some more!
That's it!

89
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:09,649
Like this?

90
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,549
Keep drawing!
More, more!

91
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:15,049
So, yes. We've
got work to do.

92
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:18,949
Yep, right. Lots
of work, if you ask me.

93
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:24,949
<i>The most natural state</i>
<i>for a Zanpakuto is for it</i>
<i>to remain in its sword</i>
<i>form. And when they</i>

94
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:26,749
leave that sword,
it's trouble.

95
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,616
They should all change
back.

96
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,283
[gasping]

97
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:33,383
Owo-wooow!

98
00:09:33,816 --> 00:09:37,016
Take this and that and
this and that and this
and this!

99
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:39,949
Next time, let's
discuss this matter alone!

100
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:49,949
This feels really
strange...

101
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:51,783
<i>What makes you say that?</i>

102
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:58,849
Well, I know that you and
I have always been
together, even before you
manifested. But it still

103
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:02,583
feels very different to
actually be walking side
by side with you...

104
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:04,183
<i>It is, isn't it?</i>

105
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:08,349
There was a time, when
I never believed a day
like this one would ever
come.

106
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:10,116
And just when was that?

107
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:14,449
It was when I found you
destroyed, depleted of all
your spiritual pressure.

108
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:26,816
I was terrified. I
thought I'd lost you
forever!

109
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:29,183
<i>Sorry I made you worry so</i>
<i>much.</i>

110
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:36,083
But now, luckily, I'm
here with you, thanks to
Captain Kurotsuchi's work
and research.

111
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:38,183
What kind of
research did he do?

112
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:43,349
Very well, let us begin.

113
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:44,216
Right.

114
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:58,083
<i>Captain, an unknown</i>
<i>signal wave appears to be</i>
<i>influencing the</i>
<i>Zanpakuto.</i>

115
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,916
It seems that the theory
I had, is being proven
valid.

116
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:14,583
<i>She has regenerated.</i>

117
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:24,016
To tell the truth-with
those crazy experiments
he does, I've always
had my doubts about him.

118
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:29,349
But in this case, I am
grateful for Captain
Kurotsuchi's research.
Especially now that I

119
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:31,583
know he is the one who
saved you.

120
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:33,249
It all worked out.

121
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,183
<i>Master.</i>

122
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:55,316
I have to find him now.

123
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:04,383
A Hollow!

124
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:35,697
A Sword Beast.

125
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:39,797
Yes, but it disappeared
instantly. I wonder what's
going on.

126
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:41,531
Call Haineko and the
others?

127
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:45,097
No, let's not do that.
That would just complicate
things.

128
00:12:47,764 --> 00:12:49,664
<i>Wow!</i>

129
00:12:49,697 --> 00:12:51,364
You're so cute!

130
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:56,631
You think so?

131
00:12:56,664 --> 00:13:02,164
Well, the portable gigai is
working out fabulously and
Orihime's clothes seem to
fit you really well!

132
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:06,564
Just one thing. There!

133
00:13:06,597 --> 00:13:08,397
Right! That's
much better!

134
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:10,064
I agree!

135
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:10,997
Super!

136
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:11,964
So, Rangiku...

137
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,164
What's up?

138
00:13:13,197 --> 00:13:16,797
How were the Zanpakuto
able to turn back to
normal?

139
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,731
Oh, well, you see--

140
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:24,197
When a Soul Reaper calls
out his Zanpakuto's
name, it allows the
Zanpakuto and the Soul

141
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:27,931
Reaper to synergize as
one for battle. We
become one.

142
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:34,631
Captain Kurotsuchi tried
many experiments to try
to achieve this all
important goal.

143
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:39,364
To return Zanpakuto to
back to their normal
state, he utilized their
physical properties.

144
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:41,031
I see.

145
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:46,331
There were two keys to
this. Synchronization
and interference.

146
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:51,764
I found that all of the
brainwashed Zanpakuto
were in a very unstable
state.

147
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,597
So that meant, I just had
to stabilize them.

148
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:58,364
Though, you probably
wouldn't understand my
complete explanation.

149
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:00,564
Stabilize?

150
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:05,664
That's right. Muramasa was
able to find a way to
destabilize our physical
existence.

151
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:10,897
Once he succeeded in
doing that, all the
anxiety we'd kept from our
masters became magnified.

152
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:13,564
And we couldn't help
but lose control.

153
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:16,731
Hm. So that's what
happened...

154
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:21,064
What's so funny,
Lieutenant?

155
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:22,397
Nothing.

156
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,564
So...

157
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:28,464
Could we control these
Sword Beasts using the
same method, do you think?

158
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:32,497
I guess that's a
question only Captain
Kurotsuchi can answer.

159
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:38,464
Sorry Nanao, but could
you go to the Department
of Research and Development
again and try to find that

160
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:39,364
out for us?

161
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:40,697
Of course, sir.

162
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:42,997
And don't forget to
take some sweets!

163
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:47,431
So now you want me to
solve this mess?

164
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:48,064
Yes.

165
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:49,964
It is easy for
you to ask.

166
00:14:49,997 --> 00:14:51,531
Can you do it, sir?

167
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:54,497
It is not something
I am interested in.

168
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:55,597
It's not?

169
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:01,831
Don't forget that I was
the one who released the
Zanpakuto from the clutches
of Muramasa's mind control.

170
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:03,631
Yes...

171
00:15:03,664 --> 00:15:08,031
I understand that the
Zanpakuto who lost their
masters have become
troublesome Sword Beasts;

172
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:11,431
but the prospect of
taming them does not
interest me.

173
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:14,097
But the current situation
demands--

174
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:16,931
You may go.

175
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:18,531
Sir wait!

176
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:23,231
Another time. I'm sorry
but the captain is not
feeling well.

177
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:31,297
Nemu, prepare some green
tea.

178
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,164
Right away, Captain.

179
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:36,831
I guess I have no choice.
This damn thing.

180
00:15:38,264 --> 00:15:41,331
Soul Reapers and their
Zanpakuto share a close
bond.

181
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:46,897
Yes. That is what I find
intriguing. What led to
Muramasa's madness could
have happened to any of

182
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:48,597
us Zanpakuto.

183
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:53,764
Thankfully, now all of us
are more aware and can
prevent it from happening
ever again.

184
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:56,164
I'm glad.

185
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:09,364
You really know all the
hotspots, Orihime. I
never knew that there was
a photo booth like that!

186
00:16:10,964 --> 00:16:15,897
The World of the Living
really is amazing!
Every time I come here,
there's something new!

187
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:19,464
So, what's next on our
agenda? Do you girls wanna
head to another shop?

188
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:21,031
You bet!

189
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:25,231
What is it Rangiku?

190
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:28,964
I sensed the Spiritual
Pressure of a Sword Beast.

191
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:32,797
Wait, you were actually
doing your job?

192
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:38,731
I've been tracking its
presence this whole time.
Keep in mind I am a
lieutenant! But now--

193
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,231
<i>But now, what?</i>

194
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:42,531
Its Spiritual Pressure
just changed.

195
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:43,864
<i>Huh? Why?</i>

196
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:45,764
Who knows?

197
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,564
We still don't know
nearly enough about Sword
Beasts. The only thing we
really know about them is

198
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:54,831
that they're Zanpakuto
that have kind of lost
control. I'm going to
try to capture this one.

199
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:58,231
As a Zanpakuto, what do
you think is causing them
to act up?

200
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:04,864
You are my master and I
returned to normal
because you survived.

201
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:09,897
But these Sword Beasts
were not as fortunate and
without their masters,
they're lost.

202
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:12,531
All Zanpakuto are
the same and---

203
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:16,231
Whether a Zanpakuto lives
or dies all depends on its
master.

204
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:25,797
A storm.

205
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:29,731
<i>Stay alert!</i>

206
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:48,131
It's close!

207
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:49,397
How close?

208
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:51,131
A Sword Beast?!

209
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:55,564
I definitely sense the
Spiritual Pressure of a
Sword Beast. But there's
something else...

210
00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:56,697
<i>Up there!</i>

211
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:06,664
What? It's a Hollow.

212
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:10,331
Now stand back!

213
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,197
Are you all right?

214
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:29,931
Yeah, I'm fine.

215
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:39,364
<i>That's no Sword Beast!</i>
<i>That's a Hollow!</i>

216
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:42,397
Not now! I can't fight
it in my present form!

217
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:43,931
Leave this one to me!

218
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:45,064
Hold on!

219
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:46,631
I can take him!

220
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,064
Haineko!

221
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:59,197
Where? Where is he?
Give me back my master.

222
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:04,231
What're you blabbering
about, you Hollow?

223
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:08,497
What have you
done with him?!

224
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:17,531
Who is this guy?

225
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:18,997
Ichigo!

226
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:20,464
Thank goodness!

227
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:29,697
Take care of
her. Here.

228
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:49,931
If he becomes a Hollow, the
pockets of Reishi in the World
of the Living will become
dangerously unbalanced.

229
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:53,064
And Karakura Town
could be destroyed.

230
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,697
There's no escaping.
I'm gonna end this here.

231
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:16,464
Ichigo. This is the Zanpakuto
that you encountered earlier.

232
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:17,364
It is!?

233
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:26,564
My master. Where's
my master?!

234
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:31,331
But it looks completely
different.

235
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:34,331
It appears it has fused
itself with a Hollow.

236
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:38,931
You're right. I had a feeling
I recognized that weapon that
he's carrying.

237
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:58,397
Sorry, but you have
to go. Getsuga---

238
00:21:07,697 --> 00:21:11,097
A Cero!...Damn!

239
00:21:12,297 --> 00:21:16,131
Reign over the Frosted
Heavens! Hyorinmaru!

240
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:29,431
Toshiro.

241
00:21:43,131 --> 00:21:45,464
<i>It's just as I thought.</i>

242
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:48,564
Yeah, it was a lot
stronger than I
expected.

243
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:53,297
I figured if these Sword
Beasts fused themselves
with another Spiritual
Entity, their Spirit

244
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:55,397
Energy would be
intensified.

245
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:58,064
They will not be easy to
defeat.

246
00:21:58,097 --> 00:21:59,697
<i>Be very careful.</i>

247
00:21:59,731 --> 00:22:00,831
Right.

248
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:51,330
I'm heading back to the Soul
Society to turn in my full
report on this incident. Hey,
where did everybody go?

249
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:54,597
<i>Rangiku and the others</i>
<i>ran off to do more</i>
<i>shopping.</i>

250
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,864
Hyorinmaru isn't here,
either.

251
00:23:55,897 --> 00:23:58,097
<i>He was forced to carry</i>
<i>their shopping bags.</i>

252
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,030
Hyorinmaru!
