00:00:04,433 --> 00:00:08,900
[MUSIC - BEAT CRUSADERS,
"TONIGHT, TONIGHT, TONIGHT"]

2
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,374
-Hm.

3
00:01:50,308 --> 00:01:53,275
Welcome, substitute Soul Reaper.

4
00:01:57,808 --> 00:02:00,242
ICHIGO: I take it your
the leader of the Bounts.

5
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:02,042
You invited us, so here we are.

6
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:08,908
-Huh.

7
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:09,408
-Ichigo.

8
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,542
-Yeah.

9
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:22,275
-Now then, my name
is Jin Kariya.

10
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,075
Pleased to meet you,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

11
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:27,975
-[grunt] How the hell
did you know my name?

12
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:30,142
-I make it my business.

13
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:32,908
Would I be correct in
assuming the lady next to you

14
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:35,242
is the Soul Reaper
Rukia Kuchiki?

15
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:37,708
RIRIN: (WHISPERING) Rukia.

16
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:39,108
-Is something wrong?

17
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:42,608
You all look as if you're
surprised to see us.

18
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:45,342
That would mean you're
afraid, because surprise

19
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,742
is the same as fear.

20
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,008
-What did you say?

21
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,108
-Take it easy.

22
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:51,508
He's just saying that
to get under your skin.

23
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,675
-Ichigo's right.

24
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:53,842
Let them say what they want.

25
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,975
It means nothing. [laughs]

26
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,042
-We're not falling for it.

27
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,708
-No, but this is bad.

28
00:02:59,742 --> 00:03:00,475
This is really bad.

29
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:01,942
Bad, bad, bad.

30
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:03,408
That man is definitely scary.

31
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,242
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): Those eyes.

32
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:14,675
What a repulsive glare.

33
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,275
RUKIA: Ichigo, you've
got to be careful.

34
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:20,608
ICHIGO: I know.

35
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:23,375
We've come here
to take back Uryu.

36
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:26,742
-I have no intention of
returning your friend.

37
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:29,175
We need the Quincy, so
I'm afraid you'll just

38
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,408
have to live without him.

39
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:31,342
-Get over it.

40
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,575
I don't care how
much you need him.

41
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:33,942
It's not what Uryu wants.

42
00:03:33,975 --> 00:03:35,308
-Oh, really?

43
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:37,642
So what do you plan to do?

44
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,908
-Give him back to us.

45
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:42,008
Or we're going to take him back.

46
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:43,442
-You think you can?

47
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:44,542
ICHIGO: Definitely.

48
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:46,308
Rukia.

49
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:49,175
-All right.

50
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:53,475
Zeige Dich, Fried!

51
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:56,908
-You're not leaving.

52
00:03:56,942 --> 00:04:00,342
-Sorry, no snakes allowed.

53
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,308
-How dare you?

54
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,875
-Ichigo, are you all right?

55
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:05,175
ICHIGO: Don't worry about me.

56
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,308
Just take care of Uryu.

57
00:04:07,342 --> 00:04:08,275
-Be careful!

58
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:22,342
-So it's seven against one, huh?

59
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,275
-Don't know much
about us, do you?

60
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,242
We Bounts are very independent.

61
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:31,308
We're far too proud
and free spirited

62
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:34,175
to ever fight in a
group, especially

63
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,675
against a substitute
Soul Reaper.

64
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,208
I can easily handle you myself.

65
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:40,942
ICHIGO: Oh, really?

66
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:43,775
-You don't think I'm capable.

67
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:45,508
I'll tell you what, then.

68
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:49,442
Master Kariya, in order
to prove my point,

69
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:51,942
would you remove your crest?

70
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:53,342
-What's this about?

71
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,742
-A Bount needs his crest in
order to call out his doll.

72
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:59,008
Without our dolls, we're
basically powerless

73
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:01,042
and have no other means
to defend ourselves.

74
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,142
KARIYA: Take your time, Utagawa.

75
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:13,475
I'm going to enjoy
watching this.

76
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:15,708
-Feel better now?

77
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:18,175
You see if any of the other
Bounts breaks the rules

78
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,475
and tries to attack you.

79
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:21,408
Then you can go after
our leader Kariya,

80
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:23,842
and he'll be
completely defenseless.

81
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,075
He is powerless.

82
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,808
He can neither attack
you nor protect himself.

83
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:30,208
-Look, I don't know what kind
of game you're playing here,

84
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:31,475
but I'm going to cut you down.

85
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:37,608
-What kind of defense is that?

86
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,975
-[grunts]

87
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:48,942
UTAGAWA: I've got you.

88
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:56,308
-Do you really think Ichigo
will be all right back

89
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:57,775
there by himself?

90
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:59,442
-Ichigo's not an idiot.

91
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:01,675
He knows all he has to
do is buy enough time

92
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,242
for us to find Uryu and
get him out of here.

93
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:06,675
-Even so, I think we're
grossly unprepared to do battle

94
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:07,642
with these Bounts.

95
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:09,008
We know next to
nothing about them.

96
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:10,675
If we were to gather
more information

97
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,075
and carefully analyze it
to make a cohesive plan--

98
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:14,408
-Will you shut up?

99
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,942
If he wants to analyze, he
can do it while he's fighting.

100
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:18,275
And if you're really
worried about him,

101
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:20,408
then you should have been
thinking about a strategy

102
00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:22,042
long ago, instead of
waiting until now.

103
00:06:22,075 --> 00:06:23,608
-You don't have to
get so nasty about it.

104
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:25,842
I was just trying to express
my anxiety over the fact

105
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,008
that we stranded him there.

106
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:28,008
-Stop!

107
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:29,408
If you had a brain
in your head, we'd

108
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:30,975
realize that we can
use Noba's ability

109
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:33,075
to get us to Ichigo
whenever we want.

110
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:34,175
KURODO: Oh!

111
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,208
-It also means that
once we find Uryu,

112
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:38,008
we can use Noba's
space-warping ability

113
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:39,608
to get us out of this mansion.

114
00:06:39,642 --> 00:06:43,842
You are able to use your
ability in here, aren't you?

115
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,908
-No a problem.

116
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:46,342
-You know, I'm still here.

117
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,475
And I resent the fact that
you act as if you're all

118
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,208
coming up with brilliant
ideas and trying

119
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,908
to make me look like an idiot.

120
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:53,308
I think it's very rude.

121
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:55,508
RUKIA: Did it feel as if most
of the Bounts in this mansion

122
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,708
are concentrated in
that room back there?

123
00:06:57,742 --> 00:07:00,375
RIRIN: Yeah, but I think
sense one in the back.

124
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:02,975
They probably left him
there to guard Uryu.

125
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:07,775
-Huh?

126
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:08,675
-Huh?

127
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,175
-Huh?

128
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:14,408
Who's there?

129
00:07:18,975 --> 00:07:20,208
A Soul Reaper?

130
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,975
-You are partially
right about that.

131
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:28,875
You thought you felt the
presence of another Bount.

132
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:30,542
But the Bount you
sensed is not a guard,

133
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:34,042
but a traitor who is being
held with the Quincy.

134
00:07:34,075 --> 00:07:36,908
-You mean the Bount
who saved Uryu?

135
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:38,275
MAKI: That's right.

136
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:39,642
-What's your story?

137
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:41,942
What could the Bounts
possibly offer you?

138
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:44,008
-You probably
haven't heard of me.

139
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:46,208
I served with Squad 11.

140
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:48,775
Maki Ichinose.

141
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:49,775
-Really?

142
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,975
You were in Squad 11?

143
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:53,042
-Yes.

144
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:55,942
Back before Kenpachi
Zaraki was captain.

145
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,042
-So you ran away from
the Soul Society?

146
00:07:58,075 --> 00:07:59,608
All right, then.

147
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,242
What are you doing here?

148
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:02,275
-Some other time.

149
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:06,975
-What?

150
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:07,742
-No way!

151
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:14,908
-[grunt]

152
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,875
-[shout]

153
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:23,175
-That's your strategy?

154
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,508
Create a hallucination,
then teleport and attack

155
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:26,475
from behind?

156
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,342
Not a bad idea, I suppose.

157
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,675
But it's just a childish trick.

158
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,675
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): He's
strong-- very strong.

159
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,642
-You're a Soul
Reaper, aren't you?

160
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:38,375
-Squad 13.

161
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,208
Rukia Kuchiki.

162
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:42,408
-What are you doing
running around in a Gigai?

163
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:45,608
And why don't you have
your Zanpakuto with you?

164
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:47,608
-Due to some unfortunate
circumstances,

165
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:52,142
I can't use it-- although
I've got Hado 33.

166
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:52,642
Sokatsui!

167
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,242
-Chant discard?

168
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,775
Your skilled in throwing spells
without uttering the chant.

169
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:07,908
-It's obvious you're
familiar with the technique.

170
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,942
So why do you act surprised?

171
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:13,108
-Chant discard weakens
the power of Kido.

172
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:16,242
What's surprising is that
you have this much power,

173
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:19,108
and yet you aren't
using your true power.

174
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,342
I can't quite put
my finger on it,

175
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,708
but I sense that this isn't
your true power, is it?

176
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:27,175
-I wish I could lie to you
and say that it wasn't.

177
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,542
But the truth is, that was
the full extent of my power.

178
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:32,842
RUKIA (VOICEOVER): At
least in my current state.

179
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,275
My powers haven't
fully returned.

180
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:37,642
MAKI: Whatever.

181
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:40,542
RUKIA: Why would a Soul Reaper
want to help the Bounts?

182
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:41,542
-Good question.

183
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,042
Tell me, do you
know how to become

184
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:45,875
a captain of the 13
Court Guard Squads?

185
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:46,608
RUKIA: What?

186
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:47,575
-You know.

187
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:50,275
The same method
Kenpachi Zaraki used

188
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:53,708
when he made his name famous
throughout the Soul Society.

189
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:57,075
He didn't earn it with
intelligence or cunning-- not

190
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:59,208
Zaraki.

191
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:03,108
He became captain using nothing
but his physical strength.

192
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:04,608
He crushed the
vision the captain

193
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:09,175
and I had created and discarded
it like a fleeting dream.

194
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:15,208
Everything-- everything was
destroyed in that instant!

195
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:18,375
I refused to follow Kenpachi
Zaraki like the other squad

196
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:19,442
members.

197
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:22,408
I had seen him for what he was.

198
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:26,542
RUKIA: So you left, and
you ran away forever.

199
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:28,808
-I wandered around,
disillusioned and heartless,

200
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:31,075
until he gave me
a reason to live.

201
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:34,008
Jin Kariya-- because
of him, I was

202
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:38,275
able to pick up my Zanpakuto and
find something worth fighting.

203
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:40,608
I now have a purpose again.

204
00:10:40,642 --> 00:10:43,942
I will stand by him--
he who lives eternally,

205
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:45,475
he who is searching
for what lies

206
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:48,308
beyond by breaking
all laws of nature.

207
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:50,642
Once more, I plan
to lay everything

208
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:53,875
I have on the line for this man.

209
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:55,575
-So you're willing
to help him, knowing

210
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:57,508
full well what he plans to do?

211
00:10:57,542 --> 00:11:01,575
-I think we've wasted
enough time with talk.

212
00:11:01,608 --> 00:11:08,308
I'm sorry, but there's no way
I'm going to allow you to pass.

213
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:13,675
-[gasp] That spiritual pressure.

214
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,642
Ichigo and the
others must be here.

215
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,875
Open up!

216
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:19,275
Open the door!

217
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,642
URYU (VOICEOVER): Ichigo,
don't do anything crazy.

218
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:29,075
[gasping]

219
00:11:29,108 --> 00:11:34,475
YOSHINO (VOICEOVER): I
might have to get out.

220
00:11:34,508 --> 00:11:38,408
[grunting]

221
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,208
-[laughs]

222
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,808
-That old trick?

223
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:58,142
Are you making snakes
come out of walls again?

224
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,108
-[grunt]

225
00:11:59,142 --> 00:11:59,575
-Fried!

226
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:06,075
-No matter how sharp your sword
is, it'll never caught Fried!

227
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:08,042
-Who cares about it, anyway?

228
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:09,542
Why should I waste
my time with that

229
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,508
snake when I can
attack you directly?

230
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,975
-How will you do that?

231
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:15,008
-Like this, you jerk?

232
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,942
-That's Flash Step.

233
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:20,742
-[gasp]

234
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:22,975
-I'll cut you
deeper next to time.

235
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,475
-I have to admit, I'm impressed.

236
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:26,608
-How sloppy of you.

237
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:28,075
I don't see why
I should give you

238
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:30,542
my strength if you're
going to be so weak.

239
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,142
-No need to worry.

240
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:33,942
Have you made all
of the preparation?

241
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:35,208
-Of course.

242
00:12:35,242 --> 00:12:37,475
-Just let me know when you're
done talking over there.

243
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,275
UTAGAWA: Thank you.

244
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:39,575
I think we're finished.

245
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:40,542
-[gasp]

246
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,975
-[laughs]

247
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:51,108
ICHIGO: What?

248
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:54,408
What the hell is this?

249
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:55,842
FRIED: Snake Net.

250
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,308
-Damn it.

251
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,908
-No one has survived
Fried's absolute barrier.

252
00:12:59,942 --> 00:13:03,875
You can run if you want, but
it's just a matter of time.

253
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:11,742
-[grunts]

254
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,992
-You wouldn't happen to be
familiar with the term spinal

255
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:28,792
flexion, would you?

256
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:30,492
It's the kind of
thing that happens

257
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:32,226
when you touch
something hot and react

258
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:35,926
even before the signal has
time to reach your brain.

259
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:37,759
ICHIGO: So what's your point?

260
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:40,492
-I just thought you'd like to
know the physics behind Snake

261
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:41,626
Net.

262
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:43,859
If you try to approach
me with a Flash Step,

263
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:45,892
it's as if Fried
intercepts the impulse

264
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,859
and reacts even before you do.

265
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:50,526
FRIED: You can't
escape anywhere.

266
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,192
-It's a secret technique.

267
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:53,959
How do you know
about the Flash Step?

268
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:55,859
KARIYA: I was certain
the Soul Society would

269
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:57,326
interfere at some point.

270
00:13:57,359 --> 00:13:59,259
It seems they've
always got their noses

271
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:01,192
in other people's business.

272
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:03,259
So it was only natural
that I learned as much

273
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:05,159
about Soul Reapers as possible.

274
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,226
ICHIGO: What?

275
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:07,659
UTAGAWA: If you two
are done discussing

276
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:11,092
things-- continue Fried.

277
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,559
-I understand.

278
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:18,026
-[grunts]

279
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,026
-It's useless.

280
00:14:25,526 --> 00:14:30,959
-[shouts]

281
00:14:30,992 --> 00:14:32,859
-It's over.

282
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:33,759
-How uneventful.

283
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:43,892
Hm.

284
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,026
Please forgive
me, Master Kariya.

285
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,692
It appears as though
I accidentally

286
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:49,392
damaged your mansion.

287
00:14:49,426 --> 00:14:50,559
-Don't worry about it.

288
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:54,426
-What?

289
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:55,426
Done already?

290
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,292
-Heh.

291
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:57,926
A little sloppy,
don't you think?

292
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,526
UTAGAWA: What shall I do now?

293
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,192
Would you like me to
track down the others?

294
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:07,726
KARIYA: I've left
them to Ichinose.

295
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,626
UTAGAWA: Hm.

296
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,059
Ichinose, huh?

297
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:11,826
-But we have other
guests, whom I

298
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:15,459
expect will be arriving shortly,
that need to be dealt with.

299
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:16,092
-I understand.

300
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,292
-Hey, Bount.

301
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:22,959
Not quite dead yet.

302
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:24,726
-I see that.

303
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,959
-According to what the
two of you just said,

304
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,492
it sounds like
Rukia and the others

305
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:30,892
could use a little
bit of help right now.

306
00:15:30,926 --> 00:15:32,759
So if you don't mind,
I think I'll just

307
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:36,059
finish up here and head on
over to give them a hand.

308
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:38,726
-How much help will you
be in your condition?

309
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,559
ICHIGO: You haven't done as much
damage as you think you have.

310
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:43,059
-Hm.

311
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:44,259
Impressive.

312
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:47,459
You obviously have incredible
spiritual pressure.

313
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:49,726
Is that protected your body?

314
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,059
-Pretty much.

315
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:53,659
I've learned to envelope my
body in spiritual pressure.

316
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,926
It reduces the damage
I take from my enemies.

317
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:01,226
It's not like I spent all
that time in the Soul Society

318
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:03,659
fighting for nothing.

319
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:04,992
-Ha.

320
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:07,559
I wish I could say I'm impressed
with these tactics of yours.

321
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,592
But it's only a matter of
time, because you cannot escape

322
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,826
Fried's Snake Net.

323
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:15,559
I plan on crushing you
with a power so strong,

324
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:19,459
your spiritual pressure
will be helpless against it.

325
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:20,759
-I don't think so.

326
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,826
But you can go ahead
and try, because I'm not

327
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:23,859
going to run away.

328
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:25,592
And I'm not going
to be by some snake.

329
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:28,026
-Get him, Fried.

330
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:28,526
-Yes.

331
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,859
Here I go.

332
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,692
I'll tear you into pieces!

333
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,592
-Getsuga Tensho!

334
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,392
-What was that?

335
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:54,426
That spiritual pressure?

336
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:55,392
-Ichigo.

337
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:57,692
-[gasp] Master Kariya!

338
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:58,392
-Come back here!

339
00:16:58,426 --> 00:16:59,359
Hado 33!

340
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,159
-[gasp] That
spiritual pressure--

341
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,426
it was Getsuga Tensho.

342
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,126
Damn it to hell.

343
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:15,726
SADO (VOICEOVER): Ichigo.

345
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:18,626

-Keep running.

347

-You know, I just
remembered something.

348
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:27,592
This hide out of yours
is nice and secluded.

349
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,726
I don't have to worry
about bothering anyone.

350
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,959
So there's no need to hold back
with using my Getsuga Tensho.

351
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:35,426

Utagawa's technique using

353
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,392
nothing but raw power.

354

Still, it's perfect.

-Fried.

359
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,492
KARIYA: This was my
favorite mansion.

360
00:17:59,526 --> 00:18:00,959
But now look what you've done.

361
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:02,559
You've completely ruined it.

362
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:04,692
ICHIGO: Gee, sorry about that.

363
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:08,559
Do you want me to tear it down
so you can start all over?

364
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:11,726
-I think I'll pass on that.

365
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,759
ICHIGO (VOICEOVER): Damn.

366
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:16,792

KARIYA: Hm.

370
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:29,159
What is this, Utagawa?

371
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,292
What are you up to?

372
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:32,759
-What does it look like?

373
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,392
I've decided to relieve you
of the burden of [? mansho ?]

374
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:36,559
Kariya.

375
00:18:36,592 --> 00:18:37,926
-Utagawa.

376
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:40,959
UTAGAWA: Tell me, Koga, are you
honestly satisfied with the way

377
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:42,726
things are going under
Kariya's leadership.

378
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,726
Kariya's method is
far too convoluted.

379
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,126
There is no end in sight.

380
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,859
-So, Utagawa, you honestly think
you can do better than him?

381
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:56,926
-Without a doubt.

382
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:58,259
BOUNT: I don't trust you.

383
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:06,559
-The only reason Kariya has
been in charge up to this point

384
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:08,926
is because he had the power.

385
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:12,526
But as you can all see, his
[? mansho ?] is in my hands

386
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,059
now!

387
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:17,159
I've been biding my time,
waiting for the opportunity

388
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:18,826
to take it from him.

389
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:22,359
But never in my dreams did I
imagine it would be so easy.

390
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:23,492
ICHIGO: What are you doing?

391
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:25,159
You're fighting each other now?

392
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:27,626
-I doubt it'll come to that.

393
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:30,092
Remember what I
said earlier, when

394
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:33,059
I mentioned that we Bounts
are fiercely independent?

395
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:36,259
For us to collaborate on
anything is very rare.

396
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,392
We are a few in number.

397
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,759
But when we have
to work together

398
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:41,892
to achieve a single goal,
the one who acts as a leader

399
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:44,726
must be truly exceptional.

400
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,192
Someone with qualities
like mine, not Kariya's

401
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:50,292
KARIYA: Like arrogance
and stupidity?

402
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:52,226
-Quit acting like
you're in charge!

403
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:55,192
In case you forgot, I'm
holding your crest in my hand!

404
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:57,659
KARIYA: And your point is?

405
00:19:57,692 --> 00:20:00,192
-Have you completely
lost your mind, Kariya?

406
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:02,926
You stand there as if you're
still in control, knowing

407
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:06,126
full well that I now possess
the source of all your power!

408
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,259
You have nothing at all.

409
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,826
You're powerless, defenseless.

410
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:11,926
At this point, you
couldn't defend yourself

411
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:15,526
against me, much less this
substitute Soul Reaper.

412
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:16,626
-So tell me then.

413
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:19,592
Why is it you seem
so panicked, Utagawa?

414
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:22,226
-I'm in complete control
of the situation.

415
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:23,592
You're the one who's panicked.

416
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,192
You're just acting calm.

417
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:28,826
Now, kneel down before
me as your leader!

418
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:31,659
I have your Mansho
here, and I'll-- [grunt]

419
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:34,226
-Why do you keep
telling me that?

420
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:35,826
Am I supposed to be impressed?

421
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:38,792
-Kariya!

422
00:20:43,192 --> 00:20:45,026
[gasp] What was that?

423
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:48,759
The only that can block a
doll's attack is a doll!

424

It's impossible!

425
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:53,659
-Did I ever say that
I removed my crest?

What's a Soul Reaper doing here?

you defeated Kenpachi Zaraki?

-Tell me something.

449
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:13,792
Why would a Soul Reaper
want to help a Bount?

A Soul Reaper's spiritual
pressure is refreshing.

A Hollow's spiritual
pressure is smooth and rich.

A Bount's spiritual

Should a banana be

We should probably consider
them more as a main course.
