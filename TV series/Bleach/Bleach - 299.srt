1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Aahh!

2
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:20,833
Calm down.

3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,233
I'm a Soul Reaper.

4
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:25,266
(o.m. uneasy breaths, gasp of
fright)

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,600
Are you all right?
What happened?

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,600
[shriek]
Aaaa-Aaahhh!

7
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,633
AAAHHHHH!!!!

8
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,661
With these reports of Soul
Reapers going missing,

9
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:29,561
You sure you really
wanna do this?

10
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:31,595
<i>Go out without a gigai?</i>

11
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:34,695
<i>If something happens,</i>
<i>don't say I didn't warn you.</i>

12
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:35,728
Ugh.

13
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:40,361
Hey, you're the one who's
making me transport all
this merchandise for you!

14
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,561
And I can't tell you what
a big help you've been!

15
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:48,395
With all this trouble recently
I haven't been able to use my
normal transport route.

16
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:51,528
Heh-heh. It's tied up
a lot of my inventory.

17
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:54,095
No wonder there's so
much stuff on that cart.

18
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:57,361
Any items of interest?
I'll cut you a great deal.

19
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,295
No thanks!

20
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,295
Duh-huh-huh-huh... Boss?

21
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:05,461
We're all done and
ready to go, sir!

22
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:08,895
Okay, okay. Give me
a couple minutes
and I'll be ready.

23
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,928
Where are you going?

24
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:16,061
We're gonna close up the shop
in a bit and all of us are
finally going to take a much
needed vacation together.

25
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:20,695
Yeah, well, you see,
we had pretty much
sold out of everything
on the shelves,

26
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:22,928
and we didn't have
any new merchandise
coming in,

27
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,195
so I kinda thought we
might as well take a vacation.

28
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:30,761
But now, of course, we do
have new merchandise so, uh,
Back to work, everyone!

29
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:35,161
On second thought, we'll
stick with the vacation idea.

30
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:36,595
Oh, brother.

31
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,528
If you'll excuse us,
we'll be on our way.

32
00:03:41,528 --> 00:03:42,528
[sigh]

33
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:50,661
Rukia, I checked 'em out,
all the places where they
were said to be last seen.

34
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:57,695
From the looks of things, those
Soul Reapers were obviously
attacked and probably consumed.

35
00:03:57,728 --> 00:04:01,361
I see. That means we're
talking about Hollows.

36
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:03,228
<i>No. We're not.</i>

37
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:03,995
Huh?

38
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:09,628
Hollows would've left
residual Spirit Energy.
There was none at any
of the sites.

39
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:12,461
<i>It was something else.</i>

40
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:27,028
[running, panting]

41
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:27,761
Huagghh!

42
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:47,995
He he he ha ha ha ha ha!

43
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:51,228
Had enough yet,
Soul Reaper?

44
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:54,028
Drgghh...
Ehh...

45
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,495
Heh. What a
pathetic specimen.

46
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:59,128
You wouldn't even make
a good appetizer.

47
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:00,861
But what the hell.

48
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:02,428
Hehehehuhuhuhu!

49
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:04,795
[Rukia]
Dance!
Sodenoshirayuki!

50
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:10,061
Somenomai, Tsukishiro!

51
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:12,295
Geh!

52
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:18,795
So it is targeting
Soul Reapers.

53
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:21,128
That was close,
thanks for the backup.

54
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:23,695
I know you from
somewhere.

55
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:24,461
Eh?

56
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:26,628
Seriously?
You really remember me?

57
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:31,461
Yes! That's right, the one and
only Soul Reaper in charge of
Karakura Town!

58
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:35,128
Zennosuke Kurumadani,
that's me!

59
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:36,761
Aah hah hah haa!

60
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,595
<i>Unbelievable. This clown is</i>
<i>the guy who took over for me?</i>

61
00:05:42,028 --> 00:05:44,595
[menacing chuckle]

62
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:45,761
Huh?

63
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:47,561
Augh!!

64
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:53,561
Sorry, that trick's not
going to work on me.

65
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:59,461
<i>Kisuke was right,</i>
<i>This guy's Spiritual</i>
<i>Pressure is different</i>
<i>from the Hollows'.</i>

66
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,161
It's you!

67
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:04,628
Eh?

68
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:07,628
He he he ha ha ha!

Agh!

71
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:28,628
Hehehoohahaha!
Now I'm sure of it!
There's no mistaking
that technique!

72
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:36,161
I thought if I went
on a rampage in this
town, you'd appear,
and I was right!

73
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,861
What are you saying?
Do we know each other?

74
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:45,061
What, you really
don't remember?
It's me! Me! Look!

Augh!

Correct!

But you can't be!
No, it's not
possible! You...

80
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:14,495
You fell into the
depths of hell!

Aw, wouldn't you like to know?

Huh! Nice move.

90
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:24,928
I don't remember you being that
good the last time we met.

91
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:30,695
That was a long time ago.
I'd lost my powers back then;
you don't know what
I'm capable of now!

What are you doing here?

00:12:58,898 --> 00:13:02,098
Got a report from the
Department of Research
and Development.

152
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:05,932
Some kind of weird Spiritual
Pressure was detected in the
World of the Living.

153
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:08,598
So who is this guy?

154
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:10,932
He says he's a
Sinner from Hell.

155
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,065
He's a Sinner?
Get outta here.

00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:24,232
Haaa ha ha!

158
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:30,832
Your aim's a little off!

159
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:47,532
Hehehe ha ha ha ha!

160
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:50,998
That's one Soul Reaper down,
now for the other!

161
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,265
Bankai!

162
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:57,432
Hihio Zabimaru!

163
00:13:58,665 --> 00:14:00,832
Hikotsu Taiho!!!

164
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:05,265
Bleaggh!

165
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:09,498
[struggling]
Hrrgh!

166
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:19,665
[gurgle]
Bleaagh!

167
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,465
He he he ha ha ha ha!

168
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:35,765
Oh, it'll take more than that to
get rid of me! I'll keep
returning from the depths of
Hell!

169
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:38,432
Hoo hoo he ha ha ha!
Heeee ha ha ha!

170
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:46,898
Speaking of Hell,
what the hell was
all that?

171
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:49,732
Don't know, but,
I don't like it.

172
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:02,532
This emergency meeting of the
captains is now called to order.

173
00:15:03,098 --> 00:15:07,332
<i>[Retsu]</i>
<i>But I see that Captains</i>
<i>Zaraki and Kurotsuchi</i>
<i>have not yet arrived.</i>

174
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:10,798
Even so. You can explain
it to them later.

175
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:16,598
This matter cannot wait. There
is a reason I summoned you all
here on such short notice.

176
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:21,898
It is this. A short while ago,
we received the profoundly
disturbing news

177
00:15:21,932 --> 00:15:24,765
that a Sinner has appeared
in the World of the Living.

178
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:29,332
A Sinner? Impossible!

179
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:35,998
Excuse me. When you say
"Sinners", you're talking
about the beings that
reside in Hell, right?

180
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:43,365
<i>[Jushiro]</i>
<i>When people die, their souls</i>
<i>are sent to the Soul Society,</i>
<i>the home of souls.</i>

181
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:47,998
<i>However, the souls of</i>
<i>people who committed</i>
<i>heinous crimes while alive</i>

182
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:52,898
<i>are unable to enter the</i>
<i>Soul Society and are</i>
<i>plunged instead into Hell.</i>

183
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:06,132
For their crimes, these Sinners
are bound in chains and
condemned for all eternity.

184
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:13,098
This is the first time in the
history of the Soul Society that
a Sinner, a resident of Hell,

185
00:16:13,132 --> 00:16:17,132
has escaped his bonds and
found his way back to the
World of the Living.

186
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:22,598
It can only mean one thing. That
something's gone terribly wrong
down there.

187
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:29,165
I doubt that. There are
gatekeepers of Hell who're
known as Kushanaada and
their control is absolute.

188
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:37,165
Yes. But I've heard there are
other beings living deep in the
bowels of Hell, beings with
great and mysterious powers.

189
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:43,298
Whatever. If these things are
suddenly free to stroll in and
out of the World of the Living,

190
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:45,732
we've got a big
problem on our hands.

191
00:16:49,998 --> 00:16:51,998
The situation is grave.

192
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:57,598
I propose we send Renji Abarai
and Rukia Kuchiki back to the
World of the Living,

193
00:16:57,632 --> 00:17:00,532
<i>since it was they who first</i>
<i>encountered this Sinner.</i>

194
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:06,465
<i>And should the need arise,</i>
<i>I will provide them with</i>
<i>the procedures necessary</i>

195
00:17:06,498 --> 00:17:09,865
<i>to infiltrate Hell itself</i>
<i>and safely return.</i>

196
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:17,698
Captain, will we be asking
Substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo
Kurosaki for his help?

197
00:17:18,232 --> 00:17:20,165
No. We must not.

198
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,532
(c.m. surprise grunt)

199
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:27,132
<i>In fact, I want you to be</i>
<i>sure to give both Abarai</i>
<i>and Kuchiki strict orders</i>

200
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:30,932
<i>not to involve the Substitute</i>
<i>Soul Reaper in this matter.</i>

201
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:34,198
Not under any circumstances.

202
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,465
[coughs]

203
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,398
<i>[deep voice]</i>
<i>Szayelaporro.</i>

204
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:59,765
Oh. Aaroniero.

205
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:07,432
Well, well. Yes, I thought I
sensed someone else there,
falling alongside of me.

206
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:13,732
So I guess it was you, was it?
I must say, that's one sturdy
fish tank you've got there.

207
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,865
Huh. Were you hoping
it would break?

208
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:22,965
No! Well, at least not
before I got the chance
to crack it open

209
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:27,632
and run a full chemical
analysis on the liquid
sloshing around in there.

210
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:34,965
Shut up, you bastard!
I don't know what this place
is, but Lord Aizen's not
around to protect you here!

211
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:41,465
You'll get a better idea of
what's inside me when my
Glotoneria devours you!

212
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:42,732
Knock it off!

213
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:43,865
Oh?

214
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:48,632
Didn't you just say it
yourself? We don't even
know what place this is.

215
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:54,165
Why don't we find out where we
are first, before spending our
energy killing each other?

216
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:56,632
Might be a more
productive use of time.

217
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:59,165
I really don't care
where we are.

218
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:04,865
Ditto. There's plenty
of time for that later,
after I watch you die.

219
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:08,398
I don't think you're grasping
the difference in our abilities.

220
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:12,098
I'm Espada Number Eight and
you're Number Nine, remember?

221
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:15,332
However you do the math,
you come up short.

222
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:16,765
We'll see about that!

223
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:18,065
Heh heh heh heh.

224
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:19,365
You two are funny.

225
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:27,798
So you're wondering where
you are, eh? If you really
want to know, I'll tell you.

226
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:30,532
Welcome to Hell.

227
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:33,798
<i>[Aaroniero]</i>
<i>Who are you, anyway?</i>

228
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:36,065
Why don't you come down
here if you're so tough?

229
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:38,232
Heh. You're hilarious.

230
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:41,865
The way you go on and on
about killing each other.

231
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:44,998
You two are in Hell,
you're already dead.

232
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:47,498
Just what kind of
nonsense is that?!

233
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:52,232
Indeed, you're right.
Thanks for jogging my
memory, whoever you are.

234
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:56,198
<i>Yes, it seems I did die.</i>

235
00:19:56,232 --> 00:20:00,198
And I have that damned
despicable Soul Reaper
to thank for it.

236
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:11,032
So the question now is, is
there a way to get out of this
infernal wasteland you call
Hell and return to Hueco Mundo?

237
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:15,198
Of course there isn't,
don't be ridiculous.

238
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:20,065
You sure of that?
You'd better tell
us if there is.

239
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:26,198
Let's begin again.
My name's Shuren.

240
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:32,732
And the only way you will
survive here is if you do
exactly as I say, understood?

241
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,432
Oh, is that right?

242
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:36,398
<i>Taikon,</i>

243
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:37,798
<i>Gunjo,</i>

244
00:20:37,832 --> 00:20:39,098
<i>Garogai.</i>

245
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,432
Our guests don't seem
to like Hell very much.

246
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:46,465
Teach them to be
more appreciative
of our hospitality.

247
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:49,632
Raaaaghh!

248
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:50,898
Aaroniero!

249
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:55,232
Auggh!

250
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,798
A Gran Ray Cero, eh?

251
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:15,932
So that's an Espada's Cero.
Disappointing, I must say.

252
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:21,232
Sorry to have to tell you this,
but you're of no use to me.

253
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:24,498
That does it! Don't get
cocky with me, Sinner!

254
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:36,465
<i>[Shuren]</i>
<i>I knew it. Their power</i>
<i>was nowhere near great</i>
<i>enough to open the gate.</i>

255
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:42,132
Gunjo, what about the
one we sent to the
World of the Living?

256
00:21:42,165 --> 00:21:44,832
Sir. He survived
and has returned.

257
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:49,765
As he was of no further
use, I silenced him.
But the experiment succeeded.

258
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:51,332
I see!

259
00:21:53,165 --> 00:21:57,898
Then my friends, it would seem
our days in the darkness are
about to come to an end.

260
00:21:59,532 --> 00:22:02,832
<i>As I've suspected,</i>
<i>it will have to be you.</i>

261
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:07,998
I'm going to bring you down,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

262
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:47,915
<i>[Renji]</i>
<i>Thank goodness you're</i>
<i>all right, Rukia.</i>

263
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:51,048
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>Thanks for the help, Renji.</i>
<i>Now let's get on back to</i>
<i>the Soul Society.</i>

264
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:54,815
[Renji]
Right. I'm only glad no one else
got banged up besides us.

265
00:23:54,848 --> 00:23:57,915
<i>[Rukia]</i>
<i>Yeah. Let's just hope there</i>
<i>are no more surprises.</i>

266
00:23:57,948 --> 00:24:00,415
<i>[Zennosuke]</i>
<i>Zennosuke Kurumad-- Auugh!</i>
