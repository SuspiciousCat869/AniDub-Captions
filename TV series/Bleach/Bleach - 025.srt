THEME SONG: [sung in japanese]

2
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:49,067
-[gasping] What the
hell is going on?

3
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:51,801
Ganju, I'm talking to you.

4
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:54,034
-Sis, I'm so sorry.

5
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:55,467
-Huh?

6
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:58,234
-It's just that I
only showed him once.

7
00:01:58,267 --> 00:02:00,401
I never thought it would
turn out like this.

8
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:03,234
His spirit energy is strong,
but he's out of control.

9
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:06,867
-[gasping] Urgh!

10
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,367
Urgh!

11
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:08,867
Ah!

12
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:12,834
Ah!

13
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:16,334
-Hee.

14
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:21,001
-I did it.

15
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:21,501
-Eh.

16
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:22,167
Great.

17
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:23,867
You did it, Ichigo.

18
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:24,367
-Yeah.

19
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:29,067
-You ignorant dumb ass!

20
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:32,701
Ya gotta stay focused.

21
00:02:32,734 --> 00:02:33,201
-Ah!

22
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:41,467
-What are you, freagin
death or freagin stupid?

23
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:42,601
-Eh.

24
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:45,001
-Remember I told you if
you don't concentrate,

25
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,101
you're going to blow up.

26
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:46,667
-Yes.

27
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:48,201
Yes, you did.

28
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,401
-Next time, just be
sure not to do this.

29
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:51,401
-Ah!

30
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,167
-You're as guilty
as he is, schmuck.

31
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:55,001
-Ah-oh.

32
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:56,267
-Ah.

33
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,501
Why do you always have to
treat me the same as him?

34
00:02:58,534 --> 00:02:59,834
After all, I'm your brother.

35
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:02,034
-You quit your whining.

36
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:04,767
-Yoruichi, you're back.

37
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:07,534
-So our Ichigo has
finally succeeded

38
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:11,367
in forming a cannonball, has he?

39
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:14,267
-[snoring]

40
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:16,501
-What's wrong?

41
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:17,667
-Nothing's wrong with him.

42
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,334
He's just sleeping it off.

43
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:22,234
I need the rest of you
to go and sit over there.

44
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:23,034
-Um.

45
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,667
-Ah.

46
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:27,801
-We haven't got much time
before we begin our mission.

47
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,434
I'm going to tell you now
what you can expect once we're

48
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:33,334
inside the Seireitei, and
you must remember that-- yah!

49
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,167
-The fate of three sparrows.

50
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:41,034
The fate of four dragons.

51
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:43,634
The fate of the four
dragons enclosed

52
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:47,001
on five sides unable
to return six leagues.

53
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:50,501
1,000 sprinkles of ashes.

54
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:54,534
[sighing] A thousand
pieces of wisdom.

55
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,667
The knowledge of the ages.

56
00:03:58,701 --> 00:03:59,367
-Yow, man.

57
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:00,534
Holy crap.

58
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:06,701
[gasping] What was I
dreaming about just now?

59
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:11,234
-How the hell would I
know that, you moron?

60
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,234
-I hate when I forget my dreams.

61
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:14,534
Have I been here long?

62
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,534
What am I doing sleeping
here on the floor?

63
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,967
-Like I just said,
stupid, I don't know.

64
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,967
-What's with all that
chanting I heard you doing?

65
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:24,367
-None of your business,
dandelion head.

66
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,601
Now, why don't you
just shut the hell up?

67
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:27,234
-Watch it!

68
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,101
Huh?

69
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,301
-Oh.

70
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:30,567
I see you're awake.

71
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:31,534
Come on.

72
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:32,901
It's time for us
to get out of here.

73
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:33,534
-Hm?

74
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:34,501
We're leaving now?

75
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:40,367
-Very well.

76
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:41,601
Are we all here now?

77
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:43,201
-(TOGETHER) Yes, sir.

78
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:44,434
-Hm?

79
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,367
But what happened to
your tail, Yoruichi?

80
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:48,434
It looks like one of those
flexible toothbrushes.

81
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:49,201
-M-m.

82
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:50,401
-Ah.

83
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:53,701
-What do you mean?

84
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:55,667
Is there something
wrong with it?

85
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:58,001
-Yeah-- Eh, no.

86
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,067
Nothing.

87
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:01,434
It's a perfectly
wonderful, beautiful tail.

88
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,467
-Don't you remember?

89
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,067
You're the one that
actually did that?

90
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:05,167
-Huh?

91
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:06,401
I did?

92
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:08,134
-After you created that
cannonball, you fell asleep

93
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,934
and grabbed Mr. Yoruichi's tail.

94
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,767
It took the three of
us to get you to let go

95
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,034
and by then it was too late.

96
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:17,334
-M- m- my tail.

97
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,367
My pride and joy, ruined!

98
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,467
-(TOGETHER) Oh.

99
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:24,534
-I highly recommend avoiding
that subject from now on.

100
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:25,167
-Yeah.

101
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,601
Got it.

102
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:27,701
-Hey, wait.

103
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:29,801
Why isn't Ganju here
with the rest of you?

104
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:30,834
-Hm?

105
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:32,567
Last time I saw him
he was downstairs

106
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:34,401
muttering some
nonsense to himself.

107
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,601
-Never fear.

108
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:36,967
Ganju is here.

109
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:41,501
[gasping] You should know.

110
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:44,834
There hero Is always the last
one to make his entrance.

111
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:45,634
-OK.

112
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,867
But what's with that outfit?

113
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:47,634
-Heh, heh.

114
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:48,734
You like it, huh?

115
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,334
This is my custom battle custom.

116
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:51,634
It's pretty sweet, right?

117
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,801
Save your breath because
I'm not lending it to you.

118
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:54,701
Don't even ask.

119
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:57,334
-Oh, I'm crushed to hear that.

120
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:57,834
Hey, wait.

121
00:05:57,867 --> 00:05:58,467
What battle?

122
00:05:58,501 --> 00:05:59,301
You're not coming.

123
00:05:59,334 --> 00:05:59,801
-Hm.

124
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,134
-M-m.

125
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:12,101
-My big brother was
killed by a Soul Reaper.

126
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:13,367
-(TOGETHER) [gasping]

127
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:15,034
-Ganju, don't you dare.

128
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,467
-Why don't you
just listen and let

129
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,734
me talk for a change, sister?

130
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:18,234
-Huh?

131
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:24,734
-My brother, he was
a brilliant man.

132
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,967
He passed the Soul
Reaper Academy entrance

133
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:28,934
exam on his first try.

134
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:32,167
At that time, his spiritual
power was at sixth class.

135
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:34,901
That's the same level as a
lieutenant of the 13 Court

136
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:36,201
Guard Squads.

137
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:39,234
Then he finished his sixth
year curriculum in one year,

138
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:42,001
and he became a
member of a squad.

139
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,701
In just five years, he
became a lieutenant.

140
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:48,567
But he was betrayed
by his comrades.

141
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:52,167
His own Soul Reaper allies
led him to his grave.

142
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:54,267
I was still just
a kid back then,

143
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:57,467
so I don't remember all the
details of what happened.

144
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,934
But there are two things
I'll never forget.

145
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:01,867
Faces.

146
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:04,234
Those two faces.

147
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:06,767
The cruel face of
that Soul Reaper as he

148
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,567
dragged my brother's
mangled body back home,

149
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,801
and the face of my
dear, dying brother

150
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:15,901
happily giving thanks to
that same Soul Reaper.

151
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,934
Why did he do that?

152
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:20,601
Why would my brother
be so forgiving?

153
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:23,367
To this day, I just don't know.

154
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,234
But there's one thing
I do know for certain,

155
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:29,801
somehow my brother never
blamed the Soul Reapers,

156
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:31,767
and he never hated them.

157
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:35,501
-All this time he's kept
this pain bottled up inside.

158
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:37,134
-But how?

159
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:40,067
Why didn't he hate the fiends
who completely destroyed him?

160
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:44,767
Why did he continue believing
in them to the bitter end?

161
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:47,167
Somehow you seem different
from the other Soul Reapers.

162
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,234
-I owe her.

163
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:52,601
-Ah.

164
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:56,867
You see, she saved my life,
and I haven't repaid her yet.

165
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,867
I don't want to turn into
some kind of deplorable guy

166
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:04,434
who had just turned
his back on her.

167
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:04,934
Understand?

168
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,367
-That's what I think.

169
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,734
I think that's what
makes you different,

170
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,734
and I think if I go
with you, I might

171
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:14,934
discover something important.

172
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:19,101
That's why I've decided
I'm going to help you.

173
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:21,767
I'm willing to go along with
you into the heart of enemy

174
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,401
territory and try to learn
what being a Soul Reaper

175
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,801
really means.

176
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,467
-Oh, Ganju.

177
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:29,934
-That's so noble.

178
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,367
What a guy.

179
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:32,334
-Oh, Ganju.

180
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:36,001
-Such a fine man you've become.

181
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:37,401
-Huh, huh.

182
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,101
Well it sounds like you've got
your mind made up about this.

183
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,434
-You and me then.

184
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:49,701
-You and me.

185
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:50,734
-All right, then.

186
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,701
Are you all ready
for the cannonball?

187
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:54,834
-(TOGETHER) Yes.

188
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,301
-Hey, I just thought
of something.

189
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,434
-Hm?

190
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:00,134
-Do you know how to
make a cannonball?

191
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,267
-Actually, that's
a good question.

192
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:03,801
I guess I ought
to give it a try.

193
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,334
-(TOGETHER) Hm?

194
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:08,801
-Don't tell me this
is your first attempt?

195
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,301
-Put that down on
the floor, Ichigo.

196
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:21,567
-(TOGETHER) Ah!

197
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,067
-Hm.

198
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,434
Just as I suspected.

199
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:27,301
The task was as natural
as breathing in and out.

200
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,701
-Wow, Yoruichi.

201
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,134
In one try, you did something
that took us forever to learn.

202
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,134
[laughter]

203
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,834
-I can see it bothers
you, but I don't

204
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,401
know why you find
it so surprising.

205
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:38,067
You'll learn that
there are many things

206
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:39,801
I can do that are far
beyond your reach.

207
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:42,967
-Hey, Ganju.

208
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,034
Were you able to
master it as well?

209
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,401
-I think so.

210
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:52,434
-Then we'll use flower crane
cannon launch method number 2.

211
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,101
All right?

212
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,334
-Very well.

213
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:58,267
-You better not chicken
out and run away

214
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:00,334
in the middle of the
launch, you little brat.

215
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,934
-I would never do that.

216
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,001
-Huh.

217
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:04,601
Not afraid to lay
your life on the line?

218
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:05,067
-No.

219
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:05,701
No way.

220
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:12,634
-If you're all ready to go, then
the final countdown begins now.

221
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:17,134
Get inside, everyone.

222
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:25,201
The sun will be rising soon.

223
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:28,034
That will be the signal to
begin the launch ceremony.

224
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,467
-Now, listen.

225
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,167
Once we're inside
the Seireitei, it's

226
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:41,034
important we stick together.

227
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:43,767
If you should encounter any
captains, don't fight them.

228
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,134
Don't even think about it.

229
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,167
Just run.

230
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:47,467
Our goal is to save Rukia.

231
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:48,901
Do you understand?

232
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:51,367
You must avoid taking
any unnecessary risks.

233
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:13,201
-Ah!

234
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:14,534
Far away.

235
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:18,567
Copper colored green desires
the domination of 36 degrees.

236
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:19,634
-Now, it has begun.

237
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,734
Pour your spirit
energies into the center.

238
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:27,934
-72 pairs of legends.

239
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,801
13 pairs of horns.

240
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,767
The right paw of the
monkey captures a star.

241
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:51,334
Embraced by the 25 wheels of
the sun, the cradle of sand

242
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,234
will flow with blood.

243
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:00,301
Flower crane cannon number
2, Kakisaki Blossom!

244
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:09,467
-The launch is a success.

245
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:11,034
You've done it
again, Master Kukaku!

246
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:22,934
-May the fates
smile on you, Ganju.

247
00:12:45,688 --> 00:12:46,655
-Oh, wow.

248
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:52,488
Somehow I thought blast off
would be more explosive.

249
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,355
-That was only the
start, you simpleton.

250
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:00,022
-(TOGETHER) Whoa!

251
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:06,588
-Huh.

252
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:08,255
-What is that thing?

253
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,722
-These are the directions for
the next stage of the launch.

254
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:13,222
The first stage of flower
crane cannon number 2

255
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:14,822
was just the blast
off itself and

256
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,522
the initial directional setting.

257
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:18,255
Now, we go to the
secondary spell,

258
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:21,088
which controls the acceleration
and axis adjustment.

259
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:23,855
This will help with
the precision guidance.

260
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:24,655
-Ah.

261
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:25,788
-Right.

262
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:27,255
So stay out of my way if
you want to land safely.

263
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:27,888
-All right.

264
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:29,422
I will.

265
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:30,988
-Now, there's just
one more thing

266
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:33,222
I have to explain to you all.

267
00:13:33,255 --> 00:13:35,655
In order to enter the
Seireitei successfully,

268
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:38,355
we have to stabilize
this cannonball.

269
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:40,888
That requires keeping
the spirit energy output

270
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:44,388
from each one of us
at a constant level,

271
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:47,722
and to do that, keep your hands
on the crystal in the center

272
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:50,222
so that you'll be able to see
how much energy the others are

273
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:52,688
releasing and then
simply adjust your energy

274
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:53,522
release accordingly.

275
00:13:53,555 --> 00:13:55,488
-(TOGETHER) Hm.

276
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:57,088
-One mistake and that's it.

277
00:13:57,122 --> 00:13:58,255
We'll all die.

278
00:13:58,288 --> 00:13:59,255
-M-hm.

279
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:00,255
-I understand.

280
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:03,088
-I got it.

281
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:07,622
-Now, flower crane
cannon number 2 begins.

282
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:09,155
The fate of three sparrows.

283
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:10,988
The fate of four dragons.

284
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:14,155
Five sides unable to
return six leagues.

285
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:14,822
Winds of heaven.

286
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:15,255
Orangutan.

287
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:15,655
Spoon.

288
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,155
Elm.

289
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,355
Cane.

290
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:21,022
-Ichigo, I think you're
releasing too much energy.

291
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:22,488
-You really think I am?

292
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:23,155
All right, then.

293
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:25,322
I'll back off.

294
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:27,022
Whew.

295
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:29,155
-Ichigo, you've got to
lower it a little bit more.

296
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:29,822
-What?

297
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:31,022
Are you kidding me?

298
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:33,422
But I've already lowered
my output by almost half.

299
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,255
-Ichigo.

300
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:34,755
-All right.

301
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:35,388
All right.

302
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:36,288
I'm working on it.

303
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,188
-A thousand sprinkles of ashes.

304
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:39,888
-You've got to
lower your energy.

305
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:40,588
-A thousand pieces of wisdom.

306
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:41,055
-I know.

307
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:41,822
I know.

308
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:42,822
-The knowledge of the ages.

309
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:43,888
A thousand sprinkles of--

310
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:44,955
-There.

311
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:45,355
I've turned it down
almost all the way.

312
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:45,988
-Ah.

313
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:47,455
Would you shut up!

314
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:49,922
You and your big mouth made
me repeat the same line twice.

315
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,488
-Don't blame me just
because you can't

316
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,222
remember your
stupid little chant.

317
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:55,822
-That stupid little chant
might save your precious life

318
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:58,188
if you could just
shut your big yap!

319
00:14:58,222 --> 00:14:59,155
-Err.

320
00:14:59,188 --> 00:14:59,855
-Err.

321
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:01,422
-Cut it out, you two.

322
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:03,055
This is no time to
be arguing about who

323
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:04,822
did what when we're
all in danger.

324
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:05,355
-She's right.

325
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:06,922
Stop this.

326
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:09,288
They're going to upset the
balance of the spirit energy.

327
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:10,788
-I'll show you who
needs to shut up!

328
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:11,555
-Hey, look.

329
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:12,422
What's that?

330
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:13,322
-ICHIGO (OFFSCREN) Er.

331
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:17,522
-It's the Seireitei.

332
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:28,288
-What's happening?

333
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:28,822
VOICE OVER INTERCOM
(OFFSCREEN): Red.

334
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:29,322
Alert.

335
00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:30,155
Red alert.

336
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:31,622
The Seireitei has been breached.

337
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:34,222
All squads report to battle
stations immediately.

338
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:34,888
Repeat.

339
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:35,722
This is a red alert.

340
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:36,522
All squads report--

341
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:38,222
-Intruders in the Seireitei?

342
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:42,622
-Do you think it could be
those same Ryoka from before?

343
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,422
VOICE OVER INTERCOM
(OFFSCREEN): Red alert.

344
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:45,488
Red alert.

345
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:47,855
The Seireitei security
has been breached.

346
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:53,755
-Huh?

347
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,222
Wait, Kenpachi.

348
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,888
-Where are you going?

349
00:15:57,922 --> 00:16:06,855
-[chuckling] Keni, wait up.

350
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:08,888
-Yachiru.

351
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:10,155
-Eh.

352
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:13,288
So you're off to
kill the intruders?

353
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:14,822
-You've certainly
got that right.

354
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:17,022
I'm off to battle
some strange Ryoka who

355
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:19,822
went up against Ichimaru
and somehow survived.

356
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:22,522
Let's get the carving
started. [slurping]

357
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:26,522
-This is most unfortunate,
but such a major disruption

358
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:30,322
leaves me with no
choice in the matter.

359
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:32,588
This squad captain meeting
is hereby dismissed.

360
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:35,122
I shall inform you
later as to how

361
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:38,588
Ichimaru will be dealt with.

362
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,422
All squads are to heed the
alert and report immediately

363
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:42,455
to their battle stations.

364
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:00,422
-Saved by the security alert.

365
00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:03,422
Convenient timing, eh, Ichimaru?

366
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,355
Why don't you just
come out and say it?

367
00:17:06,388 --> 00:17:10,555
You're not making much sense.

368
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:14,255
You don't really think you'll
get away with this, do you?

369
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:17,588
Just remember, don't
underestimate me, Ichimaru.

370
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:40,755
-Uh.

371
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:52,455
-What the hell is that up there?

372
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,988
-Whatever it is, the Soul
Shield Membrane should stop it.

373
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:59,355
-Just in case, we probably
ought to clear the area.

374
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:00,855
-I think it's
headed right for us.

375
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:01,355
-Run!

376
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,422
-We're going to crash.

377
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,422
-The only way to
survive this is for you

378
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:14,888
to pour in all the
spirit energy you've got.

379
00:18:14,922 --> 00:18:17,355
-(TOGETHER) [grunting]

380
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:36,722
-It hit the membrane.

381
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:37,922
-Yes.

382
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:39,788
And it looks like it's
being held there somehow.

383
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:42,288
-How could it have
crashed into the membrane

384
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,955
and yet not have been destroyed?

385
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:46,822
It would take a body of
unimaginable spirit power

386
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:47,322
to survive.

387
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:53,455
-Push through!

388
00:18:58,322 --> 00:18:59,722
-(TOGETHER) Ugh.

389
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:00,222
Ah.

390
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,688
-Ah.

391
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:05,822
-Ah.

392
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:11,288
-[gasping]

393
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:12,588
-What's going on?

394
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:14,688
We blasted through the
shield, but we're not

395
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:15,588
falling to the ground.

396
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,888
We're just floating here.

397
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:19,322
-Don't get separated.

398
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:22,288
The cannonball was
destroyed by the shield,

399
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:24,322
but its residual
energy will still

400
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:25,855
hold us up until it dissolves.

401
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:28,022
-And what happens then?

402
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:29,655
-It will coalesce
into a whirlpool

403
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:31,522
then explode and vanish.

404
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:33,222
-Uh.

405
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,055
-We must stick together, because
anyone who gets separated

406
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:37,988
will be blown away
by the explosion.

407
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:38,988
-(TOGETHER) Uh!

408
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:48,855
Uh!

409
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,588
-We're in the whirlpool.

410
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:53,355
-Ooh!

411
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:53,922
No.

412
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:55,622
Not a chance.

413
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:56,988
I'm not about to get blown away.

414
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:59,955
Uh.

415
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:00,955
-Ah!

416
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:02,755
-What are you doing?

417
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:03,655
-Stay away from me.

418
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:04,655
-Get out of my way, you.

419
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:05,655
-You big luger.

420
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:06,588
Don't you to drag
me down with you.

421
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,255
-Will you too cut
it out already?

422
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,788
This is ridiculous.

423
00:20:08,822 --> 00:20:11,922
-Grab the person closest
to you and hold on tight.

424
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:13,922
Then don't let go,
no matter what.

425
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:14,955
-Great.

426
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:16,522
-What do you mean
by that, dandelion?

427
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:19,488
-Ah.

428
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:20,322
-Eh.

429
00:20:20,355 --> 00:20:21,488
I'll sit here on your shoulder.

430
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:21,988
-Sure.

431
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:23,122
No problem.

432
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:23,722
-Ah.

433
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:24,222
-Uryu.

434
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:30,988
-Ah.

435
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:31,488
-Oh.

436
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,488
Oh.

437
00:20:34,522 --> 00:20:36,288
-What are you doing?

438
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:36,788
-Ah!

439
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:41,855
Why did you do that?

440
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:42,888
-Oh, Chad, no.

441
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:43,922
-You'll be blown away.

442
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:50,855
-No need to worry.

443
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:53,522
I can almost promise you
the Chad will survive.

444
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:55,855
But if you want to be able
to reunite with him down

445
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:57,788
on the surface, I
suggest you worry

446
00:20:57,822 --> 00:20:59,855
about ensuring your
own survival first.

447
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:03,522
-C-- c-- come on!

448
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,988
-Grab on to me.

449
00:21:06,022 --> 00:21:06,488
-Brahimi!

450
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:19,055
-Damn.

451
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:22,155
The intruders have
split into four.

452
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:24,122
Which one is he?

453
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:37,688
Which one is the strongest?

454
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:42,655
That's the one I have to find.

455
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:56,093
THEME SONG: [sung in japanese]

456
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:53,981
-What's going on?

457
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:56,981
I'll go and take a look,
but my Zabimaru is gone.

458
00:22:57,015 --> 00:22:58,581
Do you know where
it is, Hinamori?

459
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:01,281
-I think I saw someone
using it to slice up

460
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:02,248
some pickled radish.

461
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,548
-Roar, my Zabimaru.

462
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:04,715
Chop up that radish.

463
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:06,848
-Your character seems to
have changed a lot lately.
