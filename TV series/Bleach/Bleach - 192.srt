was defeated

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,033
by Ichigo, who came to Hueco
Mundo to rescue Orihime.

4
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:54,766
But then Espada Number
Five, Nnoitra Gilga,

5
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,100
appeared and challenged him.

6
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,700
Although still injured
from his previous battle,

7
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,800
Ichigo was forced
back into the fight.

8
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,766
Ichigo's mobility
was greatly affected,

9
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,433
and the situation became dire.

But it's a real shame
that it only looks sharp.

I shouldn't have

with a purple ooze released
by Szayelaporro's Zanpakuto,

Uryu and Renji found
themselves facing off

against their own clones.

26
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:59,666
Mirror images of themselves
would become their opposition

I have no time this.

Someone's out there
waiting for me.

-Waiting?

33

-Who knows what's
happening to poor Nel?

34
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:16,233
We have to look
for her right away.

35
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,733
-I know we have to look for Nel!

36
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:20,300
But we can't do that until
we get out of here first.

-No, please.

38
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:22,166
Right away.

We have to find her

-I've been sensing
it for a while.

42
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,300
She's frightened.

43
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,866
Something terrible is
out there threatening her

44
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,766
and scaring her.

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,933
We have to get out of here now!

Please!

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,966
We can't let Nel get any
deeper into Las Noches.

possible reason would

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,833
you have for coming
back here again?

51
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:47,466
Did you bring her
here, Soul Reaper?

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,566
Don't bother.

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,933
I can tell from your
expression that's a yes.

54
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:52,700
Funny you've been
dragging her around

55
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,233
without ever knowing who she is.

56
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,200

00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:58,333
What do you mean?

NNOITRA: Well, if you
don't know, I'll tell you.

59
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:06,600
You only know her as Nel.

60
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:10,300
But her full name is
Nelliel Tu Odelschwank.

61
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,366
She's a former Espada.

-She was an Espada?

-Surprised, huh?

66
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:30,800
So all this time you thought
she was a helpless orphan.

67
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,033
Such ignorance.

68
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:34,833
You've all been tricked
by that little witch.

69
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:36,533
It's an absolute fact.

70
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:39,566
She's one of the Espadas.

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,633
That right, Nelliel?

72
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:45,566
-It's a lie.

73
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,866
Nel could never be an Espada.

74
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,000
It's not even possible.

75
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,400
-Oh?

76
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:54,666
Stop all this joking around
and start telling the truth.

77
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,433
Don't try to tell me you've
completely forgotten your past.

78
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,900
-Nel knows it.

79
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,933
Nel knows all her past.

80
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:04,433
Nel didn't forget.

81
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:07,333
Nel could never be an Espada.

82
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:08,466
-Heh.

83
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,033
You know I haven't seen
you in quite a while.

84
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:14,133
But to me it's obvious that
your as devious as ever.

85
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,300
-Who, Nel?

86
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,200
-You've got them all
tricked into believing

87
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,066
you really need help.

88
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,000
You've used them to bring you
this deep into Las Noches.

89
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,533
-Nel didn't trick
anybody, honest.

90
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:29,266
Not Nel.

91
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,233
-So why did you come back here?

92
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,300
You must have a reason.

93
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,100
Did you come here
looking like you

94
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:38,066
do to finally settle
things between us?

95
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,866
-No.

96
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,900
Nel doesn't have a purpose.

97
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:44,033
Everything's been-- it's
all been fun for Nel

98
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,500
until now, really.

99
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:48,433
Nel remembers it all as fun.

100
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,366
What'd we do to you?

101
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Stop picking on us, will ya?

102

-[together] Hm?

103
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,400

-We never thought our
game of eternal tag

108
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,600
would cause such a
misunderstanding.

109
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:05,933
Nel is a masochist.

110
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,200
And it's no fun for Nel, unless
Nel is chased to the point

111
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,666
where Nel starts to cry.

112
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,900
-Why are you teaching this
kid words like masochist?

113
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:15,500
-Oh, Mr. Soul Reaper,
if you're not bad guys,

114
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:16,733
then play with us.

00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:17,500
OK, here we go.

You're it!

--[laughs] Try to catch Nel,
and then try to beat Nel up

122
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:27,300

That's gross!

134
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,066
-You almost squished
me to death,

135
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,466
and now you're yelling at me!

136
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,766
I don't think you're very nice!

137
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,533
-All right, whatever you say.

138
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:51,833
Just stop crying, will ya?

139
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:52,933
Come on.

getting somewhere!

Faster, faster!

Nel still wanted to be with
Ichigo and everyone else, too.

143

It's just Nel didn't want
to say goodbye to them.

This little kid thing
you're trying isn't working.

00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:16,764
You're crushing poor Ichigo.

336
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:18,197
Nel, quit it!

337
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,130
I mean, Ms. Nel.

338
00:20:20,164 --> 00:20:21,997
His eyes have rolled
back and that's not good.

339
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,030
You're gonna kill him!

340
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:26,997
-[whimper]

341
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,997
-Oh!

342
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,664
Don't die!

343
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:33,964
-Ms. Nel, you're doing it again!

344
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:35,164
-Oh.

345
00:20:35,197 --> 00:20:37,130
-[grunt]

346
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,197
-Who the hell told you
to release the girl?

347
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,130
-Yes, sir.

348
00:20:55,164 --> 00:20:57,964
I'm sorry.

349
00:20:57,997 --> 00:21:00,130
NNOITRA: What is it?

350
00:21:00,164 --> 00:21:01,997
I thought this was going
to be over quickly,

351
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,430
but I guess not, huh, Nelliel?

352
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:07,230
After all, you hit me with
the Cero that you absorbed,

353
00:21:07,264 --> 00:21:09,097
combined with one of your own.

354
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,030
I can see in your eyes you're
asking yourself, why am I

355
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,697
still alive?

356
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,730
It had totally slipped
my mind, Cero Doble

357
00:21:16,764 --> 00:21:18,630
being a specialty of yours.

358
00:21:18,664 --> 00:21:21,197
I should have played
it more carefully.

359
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,997
But there is something
you've forgotten as well.

360
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,730
Many years have gone
by since he disappeared

361
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:27,997
from this place, my dear.

362
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,197
Don't tell me are
under the impression

363
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,930
that the Espada's
rankings are still

364
00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:38,630
the same after all
this time has passed!

365
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,030
-Ichigo, you need to rest.

366
00:21:41,064 --> 00:21:43,130
-But wait, shouldn't I--

367
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:45,597
-No, it's all right.

368
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,730
He's all mine.

369
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,930
This time, it's my turn
to protect you, Ichigo.

370
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,830
-Now I'll teach you a lesson.

371
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:04,897
You are about to learn firsthand
that the number you have

372
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,797
on your back is
totally meaningless.

373
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:21,318
[theme music]

374
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:49,018
URYU: I've sensed this
spiritual pressure for a while.

375
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:50,151
PESCHE: Yes.

376
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:51,951
You see, Master Nel is
actually a magical girl

377
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:54,818
who can transform into an
adult just by using a stick.

378
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:57,018
DONDOCHAKKA: And Pesche and
I are Nel's cute mascots,

379
00:23:57,051 --> 00:23:59,718
who also double as her
personal sidekicks.

380
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:03,251
PESCHE: Don't lie.
