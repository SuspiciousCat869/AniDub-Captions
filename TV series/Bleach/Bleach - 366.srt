1
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,415
(grunt)

2
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,598
Uh?

3
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,800
Brother, where
are you going?

4
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,302
We're returning to
the Soul Society.

5
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,370
Huh?

6
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,073
Have you forgotten,
Rukia?

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,879
We came here... To see what Ichigo
would decide, when this was over.

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,085
The Soul Society was aware that once the
next Substitute Soul Reaper appeared, he

9
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,888
would be a target. Ginjo
would set his sights

10
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,423
on that Soul Reaper
and make contact...

11
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,093
We planned to use this
Substitute Soul Reaper to

12
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,795
locate Ginjo, and when
that eventually happened,

13
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,066
we would then eliminate both of them at an
appropriate time... A vast majority of the

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,570
captains shared this view of
using Ichigo in that way...

15
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,806
But when the Soul Society
came in contact with him,

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,709
our opinions of what to
do with him changed...

17
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,912
Instead of killing him
like we had discussed,

18
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,381
we found ourselves sharing
our powers with this

19
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,083
Substitute. Captains were
dispatched to watch his

20
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,320
actions rather than stick
to plan of eliminating him.

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,589
Rukia. I'm sure you
remember how vehemently you

22
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,791
objected to the orders
you were given to keep

23
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,393
watch on Ichigo.

24
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,427
(gasp)

25
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,096
Impossible!
That can't be!

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,467
Ichigo wouldn't! He would never succumb
to the temptation of the enemy!

27
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,704
You were right
about him...

28
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,841
Now that Ichigo has learned the
truth, he's made his choice...

29
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:51,411
The Ichigo Kurosaki that
we knew, decided to

30
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,846
make the same choice
that the Ichigo Kurosaki

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,651
you believed in made... Despite all that
has happened, he has remained the same

32
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:03,456
person. Someone who fights
to protect, not destroy.

33
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,526
I can't tell you how glad
I am that the Substitute

34
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,662
Soul Reaper who appeared
after Ginjo, was Ichigo...

35
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:14,567
I agree. From the very beginning,
he has never wavered...

36
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,971
It's so amazing that the
Soul Society's centuries

37
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,040
of inflexibility were
literally transformed

38
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,711
by the iron-willed determination
of just one man...

39
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,813
Ichigo...

40
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,055
(fighting grunts)

41
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,824
(grunt)

42
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,594
(attacking grunts)

43
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,533
(powerful grunt)

44
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,307
(angry growl)

45
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,587
I don't understand...

46
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:15,862
You should know by now...That my goal is to
crush the Soul Reapers who betrayed me...

47
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:19,065
I expected you to oppose
me in the process, yet

48
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,001
you're not doing that!
This makes no sense!

49
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,970
Why wouldn't you?!

50
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,909
That look in your eyes is the look of
someone who's trying to understand me...

51
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:32,378
Someone trying to
see matters from my

52
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,314
perspective, by putting
yourself in my place...

53
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:39,986
So then, are you telling me that you plan
to consider my position, even though

54
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,522
you reject everything
that I am?!

55
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,791
Ichigo!!

56
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,914
(powerful grunt)

57
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,773
(gasp)

58
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,876
Ahh!!

59
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:54,894
Ichigo... Would our roles
have been switched

60
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,831
if you'd been the one
who appeared first?

61
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,034
Would you have
become like me?

62
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:08,074
Would something as simple as timing,
have changed our destinies completely?

63
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:14,313
Ichigo, if you'd been the first Substitute
Soul Reaper instead... Things might have

64
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:17,850
been... Very
different...

65
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,899
(gasp)

66
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,500
No!

67
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,788
Riruka...

68
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:58,057
Are you stupid?

69
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,595
Idiot! You were really going
for the kill, weren't you?

70
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,397
Outta my way!

71
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,600
Ahh!!

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,670
Don't die! Don't
die, Ginjo!

73
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,006
Ginjo!

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,575
He's dead!

75
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,476
(stunned grunt)

76
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,680
Face the facts... We couldn't
have stopped this...

77
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,750
We couldn't save Ginjo.
No matter what.

78
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,790
He was the one who saved us.
He did.

79
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,893
But the person who
saved Ginjo...

80
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,331
...Was Ichigo.

81
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:30,892
So, are you
all alone?

82
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:33,295
Ah, I see...

83
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:36,898
Well, looks like
we're the same.

84
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:42,938
All right, come with me. Starting
today, it'll be the two of us.

85
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:53,114
You were there for me, Ginjo. You taught me
how to use my powers. You taught me how to

86
00:08:53,148 --> 00:09:01,523
fight...So why? Why didn't you teach
me, what I should do when you died?!

87
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,973
Shishigawara?

88
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:26,614
Oh, I see.
I get it.

89
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:32,954
You've got a bad habit
of kicking things.

90
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:33,521
Hm?

91
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:35,323
You're worse
than Riruka.

92
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:38,126
Jackie...

93
00:09:39,494 --> 00:09:42,597
Nice to see that
you're alive.

94
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:45,133
I may as well
be dead.

95
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:49,004
Jackie, your Fullbring,
has it?

96
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:50,538
Yeah...

97
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:52,407
I see...

98
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,445
But that's a good thing... I mean you
hated all this. You said your ability

99
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,347
was a big pain.

100
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:05,253
I found Giriko. On the way here I
discovered his body and pocket watch.

101
00:10:05,286 --> 00:10:09,324
So I stopped and buried them both together.
While I am kinda relieved

102
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:13,595
that I've lost my abilities, I do slightly
envy Giriko for being able to die

103
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:15,597
with his powers...

104
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:22,070
Maybe... it's because somewhere along
the way... I've realized something

105
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,172
about our
Fullbrings...

106
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:27,409
They were the only thing
that tied us together.

107
00:10:30,912 --> 00:10:35,150
Yeah, whatever...
I'm outta here.

108
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:43,925
Ichigo.

109
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,561
Oh, you're
awake...

110
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:49,197
Ichigo... I'm still alive...

111
00:10:49,197 --> 00:10:54,402
Yeah, Kisuke showed up right
after you passed out. But...

112
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:55,670
Hm?

113
00:10:57,505 --> 00:11:00,608
We didn't find
anyone else.

114
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:05,146
Oh...

115
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:09,617
I'm glad that
you're okay.

116
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:11,086
You are?

117
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:15,123
When I heard they didn't
find anyone I was so sad.

118
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:21,229
I see...

119
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:33,074
I've been thinking through all of this.
But I couldn't do it!

120
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:38,079
In my mind, you'll always be
the strongest one around!

121
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:42,984
Mr. Tsukishima- you mustn't die!
You're too smart for this setback

122
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:46,354
to stop you! I
won't let you die!

123
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:50,592
You are invincible,
Mr. Tsukishima!

124
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:59,968
Now I see, Ginjo. You're being gone,
has forced me to finally be able to

125
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:05,340
understand something. Something important
that you might have already known...

126
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:08,376
I'm not alone...

127
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:12,213
Thank you...

128
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,216
Shishigawara...

129
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:18,586
Wha-?! You don't need
to thank me, sir! It's

130
00:12:18,586 --> 00:12:22,056
only right that I help
you, Mr Tsukishima!

131
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,161
After all sir, I
am your apprentice!

132
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:33,268
Oh, oh hey! Look, it's morning!
Ha ha! What a beautiful day!

133
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:36,237
Thank you...

134
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:41,376
I wasn't left to die
alone after all...

135
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,416
Captain!

136
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,951
Captain Ukitake!

137
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:57,590
Good news, Captain!

138
00:12:57,623 --> 00:13:02,595
Ichigo Kurosaki has successfully defeated
Kugo Ginjo in the World of the Living!

139
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:07,533
The captains dispatched to observe the
battle have also safely returned, sir!

140
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:11,604
Retrieval of Kugo Ginjo's
body has been completed.

141
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:14,874
(gasp)

142
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:17,043
I see...

143
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:19,145
(heavy coughing)

144
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:20,847
Captain!

145
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,050
I'm all right...
What about Ichigo?

146
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,121
Sir! Ichigo
Kurosaki is safe.

147
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:31,057
Huh?

148
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,160
Thank goodness!

149
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:39,932
Riruka, time
for breakfast!

150
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,036
You'll even get to taste some of
Tessai's special pickles that

151
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,739
he only makes for
visiting guests.

152
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,210
Huh?
Riruka?

153
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,146
I'm coming in...

154
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:15,134
Thank you, Ginjo, for
inviting me to join X-cution.

155
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:21,674
Thank you, Chad, For
really believing us.

156
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,116
Thank you, Orihime, for your tears
and trying to be my friend.

157
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:37,723
And Ichigo. I can say this
without any worries...

158
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:45,198
Goodbye. Try not to think
of me, you got that?

159
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:52,905
Because... No matter how I say goodbye
to you, I know that you'll never forget

160
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:56,809
about me, or
any of us.

161
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:01,480
That's the kind
of guy you are...

162
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:12,458
Reporting,
captain.

163
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:16,596
Lieutenant Kuchiki of Squad Thirteen, who'd
been involved in clearing up affairs

164
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:19,732
in the World of the Living,
has safely returned, sir.

165
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:23,436
And just why are you
reporting that to me?

166
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:25,972
Sir. Because...

167
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,107
What?

168
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,211
Huh? You
serious?

169
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:33,546
Yes, sir.

170
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,748
Ichigo Kurosaki?

171
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:37,950
We're on
our way.

172
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:41,687
I wonder why he's coming
here all of a sudden?

173
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:45,725
Ichigo!

174
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:47,860
Hey there, Renji.
How are things?

175
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,161
Uh, good...

176
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:50,730
(gasp)

177
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:55,501
Hey! Hold it a minute- willya! What
exactly brings you here anyway?!

178
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,203
Well, you see...

179
00:15:57,436 --> 00:16:00,640
Rukia! What's going on?
What's he doing here?

180
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:04,110
Ichigo has requested to speak
directly with Head Captain Yamamoto.

181
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:05,144
What?!

182
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:07,880
That's right, and he
just got permission.

183
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:09,749
Hm.

184
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,587
Hey wait! Hold
on a second!

185
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,992
What could it
be about?

186
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:25,564
He's a Substitute Soul Reaper.
Based on what

187
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:28,601
happened he must have
a lot on his mind...

188
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:33,940
It would be totally understandable
if he was furious with all of us.

189
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:38,477
That's true. Think he came
to return his Combat Pass?

190
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:41,614
Well, that I really
couldn't say.

191
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,786
But it is one
sticky situation...

192
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:59,432
What's this? Did all of you
come here to greet me?

193
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,136
Not everyone. Kurotsuchi
and Ukitake aren't here.

194
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:09,608
But you can go in.
He's waiting for you.

195
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:12,878
Kensei! You were
reinstated as Captain?!

196
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:18,551
Enough of that! I said you could go in. I'm
sure you didn't come here to chitchat.

197
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:26,859
Rukia, I think
we should...

198
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:31,030
Lieutenants Abarai and Kuchiki,
have a seat in the back.

199
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:32,465
Sir!

200
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:51,717
Ichigo Kurosaki, you fought
admirably for our cause.

201
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:56,922
Yeah, let's forget all that. I didn't
come here to be praised for my deeds.

202
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,059
Well then, why
are you here?

203
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:05,131
Well, I'm here about Ginjo's body
that you had Renji retrieve...

204
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:07,633
I want to bury him in the
World of the Living.

205
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:11,570
Ichigo?

206
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:15,608
Are you insane?

207
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:18,878
Ichigo, do you even realize
what it is that you're asking?

208
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:20,579
Shinji...

209
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,581
He's right!

210
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:25,851
That man was a cold- blooded criminal who
stole the powers of countless Soul Reapers

211
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,987
then murdered them!
How could you?

212
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,156
That's not what
I meant!

213
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:36,162
Hear me out Ichigo. Didn't Ginjo try
to harm your friends and family?

214
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:40,633
So how can you forgive,
a guy who does that?

215
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:44,770
More importantly.
Why should you?

216
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:48,107
Ichigo, asking to give
Ginjo a proper burial

217
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:51,010
is the same as asking
for his pardon.

218
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:52,745
How can you
ask that?

219
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:54,914
This isn't about
forgiveness.

220
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:59,985
All my family and friends are back to
the way they were. And I'm still alive.

221
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:05,858
And he was... just a
Substitute Soul Reaper.

222
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:12,565
Kurosaki. Can I assume, you understand
the request you've just made and the

223
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:14,767
ramifications
involved?

224
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,136
Screw the
ramifications...

225
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:21,974
As a Substitute Soul Reaper, I
feel that I owe him that respect.

226
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:27,880
So I'll do it. Especially since
I plan on continuing to be one.

227
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:29,081
Oh?

228
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:30,749
(happy growl)

229
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:32,518
(chuckle)

230
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:36,489
There it is.

231
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:45,698
I hereby grant your
rather unusual request.

232
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,601
(happy sigh)

233
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:52,138
All right, goodbye.

234
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:55,474
Oh, wait! By
the way...

235
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:56,775
Hm?

236
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:59,545
From now on, when a Soul Reaper
comes to Karakura Town...

237
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:03,115
Could you at least let them know
exactly what this thing is?

238
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,996
I knew that I'd
find you here...

239
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,164
Shunsui...

240
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,702
Guess what? Ichigo
is going back...

241
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:25,938
Hmm...
And the pass?

242
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:29,041
He's taking it
with him...

243
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:35,147
I talked to him about it and he said that
he trusts us, so he's gonna hold on to it.

244
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:41,453
I see...
Well...

245
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:46,425
That kid...
He's grown up.

246
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,560
Yeah.

247
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:52,731
Time flies. You look around and
suddenly things are different.

248
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,003
It can't be
helped.

249
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:02,908
A young person's growth happens so fast,
it takes us older folks time to adjust...

250
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:06,178
It's as though we
never saw it coming.

251
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,607
Ichigo...

252
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:36,942
See you around,
Rukia.

253
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,143
Huh?

254
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:46,719
I wonder how many times
you've said that?

255
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:51,924
This won't be the last time that I'll see
you, so who cares how many times I say it?

256
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:55,494
That's for sure.

257
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:57,062
(chuckle)

258
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,565
(friends chattering)

259
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:41,200
Huh?

260
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,202
Hey, Ichigo!

261
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:45,137
Ichigo!

262
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,072
So what took you
so long, buddy?

263
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:49,742
We're glad
you're back.

264
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:50,709
Ichigo!

265
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:52,544
Yuzu, Ichigo's
over there.

266
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:55,481
Yo Buddy! Welcome
back home, Ichigo!

267
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,761
See you, guys...
