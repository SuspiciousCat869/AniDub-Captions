00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:50,388
I just got in.

00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:53,055
I just parked the van, so
I'll be there in a minute.

No, I actually already ate.

But, uh, thanks.

00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:58,155

that over and over

isn't going to give
you the answer.

is so aggravating!

people from all over

have suddenly been disappearing.

-Does that mean--?

33
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:30,755
-The Bounts must have
something to do with this.

34
00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:34,655
Those things they release
must be attacking people.

35
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:39,255
-[sigh] And as usual, Ririn and
her little friends didn't pick

36
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:41,688
up anything with
their sensors either.

-The Bounts are behind this.

00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:47,322
But we don't even know
where they're hiding.

41
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:48,422
Hey, Renji.

42
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:49,988
What have you heard
from the soul society?

43
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,588
Do they even know
what's going on here?

44
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:53,588
-The Stealth Force
seems to be here.

45
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:55,355
But that's all I really know.

46
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:57,255
They haven't told
me anything else.

47
00:03:57,288 --> 00:03:59,022
-Then I guess that
we're just going

48
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:00,955
to have to concentrate
on finding the Bounts

49
00:04:00,988 --> 00:04:03,155
and those flying
monsters ourselves.

50
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:05,222
-Is there a way to do that?

51
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:07,288
-Right now, Urahara
is busy working

52
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:10,588
on a powerful new sensor I
asked him to make for us.

53
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:12,588
But we can't wait for it.

54
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:14,655
Until the sensor's
finished, we'll

55
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,755
just have to hit the streets
and hope we get lucky

56
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,455
and run into them.

57
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:19,222
-Poor Uryu.

58
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:23,088
I hope he'll be all right.

59
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:26,588
He seems like he's still in
shock over Yoshino's death.

60
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:28,955
I tried to get him
to talk about it,

61
00:04:28,988 --> 00:04:31,055
but he barely said
two words to me.

62
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:32,955
I'm really worried about him.

63
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:38,055
-Unfortunately,
there isn't really

64
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,122
anything we can do to help him.

65
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,122
-Uryu's fallen in love
with the Bount woman, huh?

66
00:04:43,155 --> 00:04:44,522
What an idiot.

67
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:45,822
-Don't make fun of him.

68
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:47,688
You want ought show
a little respect.

69
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:48,722
-Oh, yeah?

70
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,855
That's good.

71
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:52,255
And what would you know
about being respectful?

72
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:53,722
-What are you trying to say?

73
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:55,388
RUKIA: That's enough!

74
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:59,955
Honestly, is there anything
you two won't argue about?

75
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:02,222
This not the time to be
fighting among ourselves!

76
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:08,222
KARIYA: Gentleman, it was
several years hundred years ago

77
00:05:08,255 --> 00:05:12,888
in this very underground chamber
that we lost many dear friends.

78
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:15,788
It is for that reason that
I find it especially moving

79
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:17,922
that we will begin
our final plan here

80
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:20,288
in this hollowed place.

81
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:23,122
Our fallen allies will
lend us their fury

82
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:25,488
and give us unlimited power.

83
00:05:25,522 --> 00:05:28,522
It seems that the Soul
Society has made their move.

84
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:30,422
But we have nothing
to worry about.

85
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,955
The minerals in the rock
walls surrounding this play

86
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:35,522
shut out all spiritual pressure.

87
00:05:35,555 --> 00:05:38,488
Not only that, the bodies
of our newly-born dolls

88
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:42,288
also contain large amounts
of that same mineral.

89
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:46,588
This is the time for us
to restore our energies.

90
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:49,822
Now then, gentleman, for those
who haven't seen them here

91
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:52,455
are the products of
my recent research.

92
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:52,955
Bittos.

93
00:05:57,355 --> 00:06:00,488
These amazing creatures suck out
the souls from living humans,

94
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:03,188
and then deliver their
contents back to us.

95
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:05,322
They're the result of
new technology developed

96
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:07,155
by Ugaki and myself.

97
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:08,555
-Hm.

98
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:11,288
-Ah, so this is
what you were doing.

99
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:13,588
KARIYA: Sadly, their
creation required

100
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:16,322
us to sacrifice
one of our friends.

101
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:19,188
-What's the difference between
using the dolls, Master Kariya,

102
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:22,688
and simply sucking out
people's souls ourselves?

103
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:26,588
Is the point just to
make it less dangerous?

104
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:28,522
-The essential difference
is that the souls

105
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,022
the Bittos collect are
of extremely high purity.

106
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:33,022
They're highly concentrated.

107
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:36,222
So now we shall turn them
loose to begin sucking souls,

108
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:40,055
a practice that has long been
considered taboo by our tribe.

109
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:42,822
The energy we gain this way
will be gradually stored up

110
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:44,088
in our bodies.

111
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:46,255
And the result will be an
increase in our abilities

112
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:48,822
to more than 10 times
their current level.

113
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:50,722
-What did you say?

114
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:52,188
-More than 10 times?

115
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:54,622
Can that possibly be?

116
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:58,555
-It's true beyond a doubt.

117
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:00,722
KARIYA: With this new
power, we shall finally

118
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:03,855
be able to fulfill our
most cherished wish.

119
00:07:03,888 --> 00:07:05,422
I still go first.

120
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:07,055
Let this moment
be forever etched

121
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:10,755
in your memories, the moment
when our tribes laws fall away

122
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:12,255
and our destiny changes forever.

123
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:34,155
[grunt]

124
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:47,555
Ah!

125
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:03,455
All pain and regret
has been washed away.

126
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:06,988
I feel nothing now but
boundless joy and immense power.

127
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:08,788
How wonderful.

128
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,022
-Fascinating.

129
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:13,188
Obviously the Bittos really
do concentrate the souls

130
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:14,155
in their bodies.

131
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:16,588
It's more powerful
than I expected.

132
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:17,555
Mm.

133
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:18,522
Yes.

134
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:19,422
[sighing]

135
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,622
MABASHI: Huh?

136
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:23,055
-You can drink it if you
want to, but count me out.

137
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:24,388
-Mabashi.

138
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,655
MABASHI: Are you all really
going to go along with this?

139
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:27,755
Are you serious?

140
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:29,755
-Oh, are you afraid, Mabashi?

141
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:30,988
What a baby.

142
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:32,155
-Listen to me!

143
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:34,555
Am I the only one who's
serious about honoring

144
00:08:34,588 --> 00:08:36,255
the laws and code of our tribe.

145
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:38,588
Tell me something, Sawatari.

146
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:40,888
-What is it, Mabashi?

147
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:43,088
-Some people say that
there was a time when

148
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,455
you were known to
have sucked out

149
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:46,022
a great number of living souls.

150
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:47,422
Is that not true?

151
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:48,888
SAWATARI: Yes, that is true.

152
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:51,755
But that was a
very long time ago.

153
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:54,022
-And now look at the
results, old man!

154
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:56,888
It's aged you by 150 years.

155
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:59,255
Which is why it was
taboo, you fool.

156
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,455
-You're so annoying.

157
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:03,222
What matters is that we
are going to gain power.

158
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:05,955
It isn't like we can
ever die or anything.

159
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:07,122
-What are you talking about?

160
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:08,855
-Calm down, everyone.

161
00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:12,088
Let's not ruin Master Kariya's
moment in history here.

162
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:14,688
After all, we're on the same
side in this, aren't we?

163
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:17,555
Please allow me to take a few
seconds and explain how I--

164
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:18,288
-Shut up!

165
00:09:18,322 --> 00:09:19,722
I don't want to hear it!

166
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:21,155
This goes beyond
breaking the laws.

167
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:22,622
It's an abomination!

168
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:23,622
-Watch it, Mabashi.

169
00:09:26,355 --> 00:09:31,755
-[laughs] Controversies are
commonplace in this world.

170
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:34,688
There's nothing wrong with
expressing one's opinion.

171
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:37,088
-[gasp]

172
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:39,755
-Ordinarily.

173
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,188
-[grunts]

174
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,988
[cough] [grunt]

175
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,422
[grunt]

176
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:08,822
KARIYA: Mabashi, the next time
your opinion differs from mine,

177
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:12,888
be aware that expressing
it may cost you your life.

178
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:16,288
But by all means, say
whatever you like.

179
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:19,122
-[grunts]

180
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:27,022
-As I told you all once
before, from now on,

181
00:10:27,055 --> 00:10:29,922
I am the law of the Bount tribe.

182
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:39,555
-The Stealth Force has failed?

183
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:41,255
-Impossible.

184
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:44,288
-Not only that, several
were seriously injured.

185
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:47,788
Their bodies were pierced
by some kind of Bounts doll.

186
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:50,022
Furthermore, a
number of human souls

187
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:52,888
have been removed and stolen
by these same monsters

188
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:55,155
since the Bounts released them.

189
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,522
-How cruel of them.

190
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,988
There's nothing attractive
about what the Bounts do.

191
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:01,355
-Captain Hitsugaya,
do we have any idea

192
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:03,288
what the Bounts' plans are?

193
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:05,288
-Gathering information
about such things

194
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:07,555
is the Stealth Force's job.

195
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:09,788
That's why you're going to
the World of the Living.

196
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:10,822
-Us four?

197
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:12,088
HITSUGAYA: That's correct.

198
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:13,588
I've already given
all of your names

199
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:15,122
to the Captain's Committee.

200
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:17,888
You've all been cleared
to leave immediately.

201
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:19,622
-But why were we chosen?

202
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:23,122
-A monster has appeared, and
monsters are our specialty.

203
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:25,855
It doesn't matter that
it isn't a Hollow.

204
00:11:25,888 --> 00:11:28,622
-Then these monster dolls
are our target, right?

205
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,422
HITSUGAYA: No.

206
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,222
It's the Bounts themselves.

207
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,855
YUMICHIKA: I-- I
have a question.

208
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:34,222
-And what's that?

209
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:36,755
-This sounds like it could be
some pretty messy business,

210
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,155
Captain.

211
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:41,188
These lieutenants may not mind,
but I don't like ugly things.

212
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:45,188
How exactly did I get included
in this questionable mission?

213
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:46,955
-When I talked to
Zaraki, he told me

214
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:48,922
you were the one with
the most free time.

215
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:50,388
-He said what?

216
00:11:50,422 --> 00:11:51,255
-Is that a problem?

217
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:51,822
-No.

218
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:52,688
No, sir.

219
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:54,555
I'm happy to go.

220
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,688
-I have a feeling these
Bounts are up to something

221
00:11:56,722 --> 00:11:58,822
even worse than what
we've seen so far.

222
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:01,422
We can't afford to leave this
up to just Ichigo and Lieutenant

223
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:02,422
Abarai.

224
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,822
It's up to you.

225
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:04,788
LIEUTENANTS: Yes, sir.

226
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,144
-Hm.

227
00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:18,977
-Hm.

228
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,810
-Hm.

229
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:24,110
-It's not too bad,
considering it was a rush job.

230
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:28,010
-I think it's a
great job, Kisuke.

231
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:29,510
-Now then.

232
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:32,810
My sincere apologies for
having interrupted you earlier.

233
00:12:32,844 --> 00:12:33,644
-Yes.

234
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:35,577
URAHARA: So what did she say?

235
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,210
-Yoruichi gave me
this exact message.

236
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:39,977
"I will be investigating
some issues

237
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,877
in the Soul Society for a while.

238
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,677
And while I'm gone,
I want you to watch

239
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,077
the Bounts'
movements carefully."

240
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,610
-Oh, I see.

241
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:50,877
And how are things on
the other side now?

242
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,044
SUI-FENG: Various entities
are gathering information

243
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:54,310
on the Bounts.

244
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:57,144
But so far, there's little
that's known for certain.

245
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,177
And they have no convictions.

246
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,010
-Hm.

247
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:00,610
Fine.

248
00:13:00,644 --> 00:13:01,877
Very well, then.

249
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,544
Thank you for your help.

250
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:05,444
-I'll take my leave now.

251
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:08,677
I have to get back and make my
report to Lady Yoruichi as soon

252
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,177
as possible.

253
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,277
How curious, though.

254
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,610
-What's curious?

255
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:18,877
SUI-FENG: It's hard for me
to believe Lady Yoruichi ever

256
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,210
lived in a run-down
shack like this.

257
00:13:21,244 --> 00:13:22,210
-What did you say?

258
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:22,744
-Calm down.

259
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:23,844
Calm down.

260
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:24,844
-Huh?

261
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:26,577
-I'm sorry if it
doesn't suit you.

262
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,977
But we actually find it
quite comfortable here.

263
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,544
-I suggest you keep in mind
that if anything happens

264
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:36,044
to Lady Yoruichi, I
know where to find you.

265
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:37,210
[breaking glass]

266
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:39,377
-What horrid manners she has.

267
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,877
-Let's do what we can to avoid
angering the Punishment Force.

268
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,010
-Hey, Uryu, Jinta.

269
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:47,144
Sorry to ask you
this late, but I

270
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:49,777
need you to go out and
get something for me.

271
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,644
JINTA: All right.

272
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:52,110
I'm coming!

273
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:53,777
-Calling this a shack.

274
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,110
The nerve of her.

275
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:03,244
JINTA: Excuse me.

276
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,477
-Hm?

277
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,310
-I think you should probably
go back to your room.

278
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,644
What if someone were
to come after you?

279
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:10,944
-Thank you.

280
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:13,144
-How are you feeling, anyway?

281
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:14,044
Are you OK?

282
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:15,510
You look a little pale.

283
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:16,877
-I'm fine, really.

284
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,744
Wasn't Urahara just calling you?

285
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:19,710
JINTA: Oh, right.

286
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:29,344
RUKIA: All right, everyone.

287
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:30,644
It's all up to us.

288
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:32,377
Let's split up and
be on the lookout.

289
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,677
ICHIGO: Anyone fighting
a monster should give off

290
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,610
elevated spiritual pressure.

291
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:37,110
-Right.

292
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:38,144
Understood.

293
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,110
-Do you really think
they'll come out?

294
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:41,910
-We may not encounter
them right away,

295
00:14:41,944 --> 00:14:43,977
but they'll definitely
be coming back.

296
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,744
We have to stay on our toes.

297
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:49,077
-Hey, what are the two of
you doing back in those Gigai

298
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,044
again?

299
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,277
-That's a silly question.

300
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,877
You know it's my duty
to protect Orihime.

301
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,810
And obviously, I'd be of
no use as a stuffed animal.

302
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:58,144
-This is a dangerous mission.

303
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:59,877
-Hey, that's not fair!

304
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,710
I need to get into a Gigai, too.

305
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:02,610
If--

306
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:03,810
ICHIGO: That's
enough out of you.

307
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:04,710
Let's get going.

308
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:10,544
-Ah.

309
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:14,377
[glugging]

310
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,644
-Huh?

311
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:22,110
-Ah, what a feeling.

312
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:23,177
Such strength.

313
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,510
[sighing]

314
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:32,777
-How does it feel?

315
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,377
All right?

316
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,044
-It feels fantastic,
Master Kariya.

317
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:38,944
-It's amazing!

318
00:15:38,977 --> 00:15:43,877
-[laughs] I feel as if now
I've become at least 100 years

319
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,044
younger.

320
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,744
-It exceeds even my
own expectations.

321
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:50,510
I was hoping to humbly
advance our cause.

322
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:53,344
But now I can see by
creating these dolls, what

323
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:57,277
we have declared for the
Bounts is an entire new age!

324
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,510

was not in vain.

I request permission

to at least treat his
more series wounds.

suppose Chad and Noba find

360
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,977
to talk about when it's just
the two of them together?

-Um, it's probably
just the simple stuff.

to have for dinner?

weather we're having.

And sometimes, I bet that
they say things like,

00:18:04,677 --> 00:18:06,777
it's good to top your
noodles with chocolate.

For sure.

I felt like taking
a walk, that's all.

So then you decided to go

But you are partly
right about it.

worried about my dear Rukia

that I wanted to--

-Then let us go.

409
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:56,877
-Where exactly were
you planning to go?

410
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,310
You were thinking about
revenge, revenge for her?

411
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:03,344
-No, it isn't revenge
that I'm after.

412
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:06,044
-Whatever it is, you're going
to need to recover your Quincy

413
00:20:06,077 --> 00:20:10,744
powers first, before you can
attempt to accomplish it.

414
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:13,510
That is a thorny path.

415
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,910
Early on, the Bounts
said that they

416
00:20:15,944 --> 00:20:19,977
needed to have the powers of a
Quincy-- as I heard it anyway.

417
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,777
Then later on, they said
you were of no use to them.

418
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:28,210
And you were merely an observer
in the end, when Yoshino died.

419
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:32,210
Which one do you
think is the truth?

420
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:34,210
-What do you think?

421
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:35,510
URAHARA: Who knows?

422
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,077
But did you ever
think about what

423
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,744
would happen if you were
able to regain your powers

424
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:41,977
and about what you
might be capable of?

425
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,877
-No, what I think
about is the fact

426
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,244
that if I hadn't been
there, she might have lived.

427
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:50,010
-Do you know that for sure?

428
00:20:50,044 --> 00:20:53,410
-I have to find out
the truth for myself.

429
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:55,377
-Too preserve your
honor as a Quincy?

430
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,077
-Yes.

431

That's just the kind
of tribe we are.

But that's not such a
bad thing to be at all.

00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:47,072
It's such a drag
women have to carry

488
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:49,072
around so much stuff, huh?

489
00:24:49,106 --> 00:24:50,806
I was hoping to cut my hair.

490
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,006
But I knew if I took the
time, the captain would just

491
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,172
freak out.

492
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:56,239
I don't know why he
always has to be so fussy.

493
00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:58,039
-Oh, so I'm fussy, am I?

494
00:24:58,072 --> 00:24:59,372
-[gasp] Oh, Captain.

495
00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:02,439
-Get your butt in gear already!
