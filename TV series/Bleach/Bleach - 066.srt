1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,446
-Ever since the powers
of the Soul Reaper

2
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:10,696
were thrust upon me, my
whole world has changed.

3
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:13,411
Now I'm Ichigo Kurosaki,
Substitute Soul Reaper,

4
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:16,125
and I'm combining my
powerful spirit energy

5
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:19,778
with this blade in order
to protect my friends!

00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,649

00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:34,174

00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:59,836
[laughter]

9
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,847
-Hi there, boys!

10
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,321
My name is Ririn.

11
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:04,795
Nice to meet you, too.

12
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:05,599
-What do you want?

13
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:06,940
Why are you doing this?

14
00:02:06,974 --> 00:02:07,610
-Hah!

15
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:10,358
Do you like my game?

16
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:12,369
-Uryu, you go after the kid.

17
00:02:17,496 --> 00:02:18,869
-Aw, such silly boys.

18
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,777
I'll see ya later, boys.

19
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:32,508
-Dammit.

20
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,982
-What the hell is going on here?

21
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,077
-Ah.

22
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,149
[crash]

23
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:54,590
BOY (OFFSCREEN): Hey,
hold on a second!

24
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:55,662
MAN (OFFSCREEN): Let's go!

25
00:03:01,326 --> 00:03:02,364
-Hey!

26
00:03:02,397 --> 00:03:03,571
What did you have to
go and do that for?

27
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:04,141
-Hey.

28
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:05,413
I need a favor.

29
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:07,491
Do you mind if I leave my
body with you for awhile?

30
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:08,027
-Sure.

31
00:03:08,061 --> 00:03:08,697
No problem.

32
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:09,635
But what's going on?

33
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,613
-Now Chad's been kidnapped, too.

34
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:12,987
-Hm.

35
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,701
-It looks like they're trying
to pick us off one by one.

36
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:17,376
It's not safe to
just leave my body

37
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,851
laying around while
it's unoccupied.

38
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:19,722
-Fine.

39
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:20,728
Then what am I supposed to do?

40
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:22,269
-You're going to stick with me.

41
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,380
-Oh, so you've finally
acknowledged my abilities?

42
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,161
Well, now I don't know if I
feel like helping you or not.

43
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:29,474
-Don't worry, your body
will be safe with me.

44
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:31,249
But we'd better deal
with this situation

45
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:33,093
before someone
else gets grabbed.

46
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,365
-Damn.

47
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:36,343
How in the hell are we
supposed to get at those guys?

48
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:38,018
All my attacks were
totally useless.

49
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,660
-Just charging at
them didn't work,

50
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:41,671
so we'll have to try
a different strategy.

51
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:43,681
-You think Aizen could
be involved in this?

52
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:45,423
That would explain a lot.

53
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:46,865
-It's hard to tell.

54
00:03:46,898 --> 00:03:48,339
-Urahara, were you
able to find out

55
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:50,919
anything about the
telephone conversation?

56
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:53,231
-I was hoping that I
could get a reimon, which

57
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,309
is the spirit equivalent
of a fingerprint.

58
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:57,018
But I didn't come
up with anything.

59
00:03:57,051 --> 00:03:58,090
-So what does that mean?

60
00:03:58,124 --> 00:03:59,095
-Who knows?

61
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,134
Hard to tell.

62
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:01,676
But my guess is that
we're not dealing

63
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,854
with humans or
Soul Reapers here.

64
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:05,529
-I definitely felt
something strange

65
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:07,607
about the spiritual
presence of those three.

66
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,679
-You could feel that?

67
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:10,388
-You've never been
known for your ability

68
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,499
to sense spiritual
pressure, Ichigo.

69
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,806
-Shut your big mouth.

70
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:17,496
-It looks like the enemy's
powers are derived from Kido.

71
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,080
If I'm right about that, then a
direct attack with a zanpakuto

72
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,728
is going to have little
or no effect on them.

73
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:25,739
-What about Zangetsu's
Getsuga Tensho?

74
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:27,816
Could I cause some
damage with that?

75
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,726
-In theory, yes.

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,435
That is, if you're
able to control

77
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:34,015
the power of that technique.

78
00:04:34,048 --> 00:04:36,026
-Only Captain
Kuchiki's Senbon Zakura

79
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:37,768
has that kind of raw power.

80
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:40,583
It could just wipe out the
enemy, and us along with it.

81
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:42,493
-Well, it's not like
yours is any better.

82
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:45,509
When you use bankai, you can't
do Kido style attacks, either.

83
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:49,128
-No, I'm not confident that I
can control Zabimaru in bankai.

84
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:52,445
And Soul Reapers at my rank
are only allowed limited powers

85
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,724
while in the world
of the living.

86
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:57,137
-So what's that leaves us with?

87
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,846
Uryu, it's up to you now.

88
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,728
You're going to take those guys
out with your Quincy powers.

89
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:04,207
-I kind of figured you'd
come up with that conclusion.

90
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,754
-They targeted Chad
and Orihime first,

91
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:08,496
knowing they'd be the
easiest to take out.

92
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:10,842
So we know we're facing
an intelligent enemy.

93
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:13,389
-So far, everything's going
just the way they want it to.

94
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:14,762
[phone ringing]

95
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:16,337
-Hm?

96
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:21,296
[phone ringing]

97
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:23,374
-Thanks for calling
Urahara's shop.

98
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,882
Now, what can I do for you?

99
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:26,089
[laughter]

100
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:28,066
RIRIN (OVER PHONE): Let
me speak to the redhead.

101
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,633
-What do you want?

102
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,543
RIRIN (OVER PHONE): It
was so much fun before.

103
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:39,928
I want to continue our game
at the Karakura Museum.

104
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:41,100
Bring all your friends.

105
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:42,273
ICHIGO (OVER PHONE):
Fine, whatever.

106
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:43,949
Just tell me what happened
to Chad and Orihime.

107
00:05:43,982 --> 00:05:45,490
Are they safe?

108
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:47,702
Hey!

109
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:49,846
They want us to
come to the museum.

110
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,517
-What?

111
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,288
Again?

112
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:52,595
-All right!

113
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,940
Things are going to be
different now that I'm along.

114
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:56,515
You don't have to
worry about a thing.

115
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:57,722
Just follow me.

116
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:02,848
Huh?

117
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:03,653
Hey!

118
00:06:03,686 --> 00:06:04,892
What is the meaning of this?

119
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:07,237
-Shut your mouth
before I sew it shut.

120
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:08,612
I already explained
that we don't

121
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:10,589
know where this enemy
will attack us from,

122
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:12,600
so we need you to
watch our backs for us.

123
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,811
-But did you have to turn
me into a cutesy backpack

124
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:17,358
like the ones little kids wear?

125
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:19,100
-Would you quite
thrashing around so much?

126
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:20,507
It's hurting.

127
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,155
-I wouldn't mind riding around
on Orihime's back for a while,

128
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:25,098
but why do I have to
get stuck with this guy?

129
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,444
-If I'd know that I was going
to get stuck carrying you,

130
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:29,957
I would have made a few
extra modifications.

131
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:31,700
-It can't be helped.

132
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:35,486
Renji and I have become Soul
Reaper, so we can't be seen.

133
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,933
-If I was riding around
on Orihime's back,

134
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,273
I'd never complain.

135
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:40,781
-If we should get
into trouble, just

136
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:42,858
drop him in the
nearest gutter and run.

137
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:43,830
-I heard that!

138
00:06:43,864 --> 00:06:45,204
-Nothing would make me happier.

139
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,717
But unfortunately, I've packed
some important tools inside

140
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,956
of him.

141
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:49,493
-Huh?

142
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:50,331
What tools?

143
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:56,631
Ah.

144
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:58,104
Wha?

145
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,612
Huh?

146
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:02,059
What is this?

147
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:03,902
-I removed some stuffing
from your stomach

148
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,578
and made a pocket so
I could bring along

149
00:07:05,611 --> 00:07:07,018
a few things I needed.

150
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:07,990
-Wow.

151
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:09,330
I've never even
thought of that before.

152
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:11,642
-I bet something like this
would sell like hot cakes.

153
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:12,849
-Damn you.

154
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,893
I should report you to
the stuffed animal rights

155
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:15,429
organization.

156
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:29,939
-Should someone stay outside
and keep watch, just in case?

157
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:31,346
-If they didn't
have any hostages,

158
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:32,452
it might be different.

159
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,228
But we're going to need
every man we've got.

160
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,372
[laughter]

161
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:56,679
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM): Welcome!

162
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:59,125
We've done everything
you've asked us to do!

163
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,499
Now show yourself!

164
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:02,878
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM):
First we play hide and seek!

165
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:04,621
You guys are it!

166
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:05,458
-What the hell?

167
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:06,933
We didn't come to play games!

168
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:09,011
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM):
Don't be such spoil sports!

169
00:08:09,044 --> 00:08:11,959
If you find us, I promise
we'll return your friends.

170
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,796
-All right.

171
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:13,668
I guess we'll find you, then.

172
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,774
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM): Oh!

173
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:15,913
One other thing.

174
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:17,857
Take off your weapons
and leave them there.

175
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,862
-What?

176
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:20,135
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM):
You never know

177
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,917
what might happen to your
friends if you don't play.

178
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,223
-I hate that brat.

179
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:26,100
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM): you
can put them in those cases.

180
00:08:32,165 --> 00:08:34,545
-They even spelled it wrong.

181
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:36,354
-That little
circle's really cute.

182
00:08:36,387 --> 00:08:37,191
-Shut up!

183
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:41,012
-That's not funny!

184
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:42,720
-You two are playing
right into their hands

185
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:44,128
when you react that way.

186
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:45,736
-Just shut up!

187
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:46,742
-What can you do?

188
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,518
You might as well
reason with a brick.

189
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,223
Huh?

190
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:03,362
-What's wrong?

191
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:05,507
-I take it you don't
feel that, then?

192
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,847
-Nothing just now.

193
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,126
But I have felt a strange
spiritual pressure

194
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,868
since we got here.

195
00:09:10,901 --> 00:09:12,309
-Interesting.

196
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,616
-Kon!

197
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,028
You need to tell us if anything
unusual happens behind us.

198
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:17,503
-I got your back!

199
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:18,843
-What's with this place, anyhow?

200
00:09:18,877 --> 00:09:19,346
-Huh?

201
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:19,815
-Hm?

202
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:32,113
-It seems like the same room,
just over and over again.

203
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:35,095
-When I came here before, it
was definitely not this big.

204
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:36,101
[laughter]

205
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:37,977
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM):
We're over here.

206
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:38,949
Over here.

207
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:39,921
Over here.

208
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,831
Over here.

209
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:43,774
Over here.

210
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:44,847
-Which way?

211
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,354
-The best way out
of a labyrinth is

212
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:48,365
to advance with your hand
against the same wall.

213
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:50,041
And I suggest we
start over there.

214
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:55,301
-Doesn't seem like there's
anything out of the ordinary.

215
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:02,137
-I just noticed something.

216
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,718
We've been moving
steadily to our right,

217
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,359
so the room directly
to our right

218
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:08,236
should be the room
that we started in.

219
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:10,481
But instead, there's
another room to the right.

220
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:12,861
-It's the same room.

221
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:14,603
What's going on?

222
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:16,111
-I say we head back
the way we came.

223
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:23,751
-What's wrong?

224
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:25,761
-The entrance isn't
there anymore!

225
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:28,174
-That's impossible.

226
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:28,810
-Kon!

227
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:29,782
This is your fault.

228
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:31,223
I told you to keep
your eyes open.

229
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,032
-I've been watching
the entire time,

230
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,178
but there was nothing
out of the ordinary.

231
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:36,317
[laughter]

232
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,159
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM):
You're not doing so hot.

233
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:40,204
At this rate, you'll
never solve the puzzle.

234
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:41,477
-Dammit.

235
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:43,622
-I'm about ready to start
kicking these walls down.

236
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:44,861
-No, wait.

237
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,207
I don't think you'll
accomplish much by doing that.

238
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,983
This is obviously
some sort of game

239
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,893
they've cooked up in
order to make fun of us,

240
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:54,412
and now it's our job to figure
out how to solve this puzzle.

241
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:54,914
-Puzzle?

242
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,020
-Yes.

243
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:58,433
They must have given
us some sort of hint.

244
00:10:58,466 --> 00:10:59,572
[laughter]

245
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:01,348
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM):
The boy with the glasses

246
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:04,230
is getting warm.

247
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,040
-They're making fun of us now.

248
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:08,050
-All they're trying to
do is get into your head.

249
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,692
Once you're thinking
about them, you're

250
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:11,233
not focused on
solving the problem.

251
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:12,205
-Yeah.

252
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,545
But they're so
freaking obnoxious.

253
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,590
-They're using a strategy
which strips away our abilities

254
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:17,600
to defend ourselves
while at the same time

255
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:20,046
strengthening their position.

256
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,861
If we don't think calmly,
we haven't got a chance.

257
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:24,603
-I'll give it a try.

258
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:25,240
-Wait.

259
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:26,748
I've got an idea.

260
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:27,754
[laughter]

261
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:28,993
KON (OFFSCREEN): That tickles!

262
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:35,326
-We'll base the
investigation from here.

263
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,571
-And I'm stuck holding
this thing, huh?

264
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:38,711
-Not at all.

265
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:40,923
This is an important job
that only you can do.

266
00:11:40,956 --> 00:11:42,195
We're depending on you here.

267
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,235
-Oh.

268
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,675
Well, then, since
you put it that way,

269
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,216
I suppose I could help you out.

270
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:48,294
But you two better show
a little gratitude!

271
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:49,802
-He'll believe anything.

272
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,746
-We should start off by
moving straight ahead.

273
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,229
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN): We
haven't seen that room yet.

274
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,804
URYU (OFFSCREEN):
Let's check it out.

275
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,199
-There's something here.

276
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:09,875
-They look like display cases.

277
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:16,844
-What the--

278
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:18,385
RENJI (OFFSCREEN):
Over here, too.

279
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,290
-Uryu--

280
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:19,961
-Look!

281
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:21,469
-What?

282
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:23,379
-Orihime!

283
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:24,920
-Ichigo!

284
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,869
-Chad!

285
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:28,706
-Ichigo!

286
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,818
Renji!

287
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:31,689
-What's going on?

288
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:32,660
-Hey, guys.

289
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:33,901
I'm not liking this!

290
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:42,469
[laughter]

291
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:54,039
-I can't raise my arm.

292
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,318
My body-- this is bad.

293
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:06,572
-Hey!

294
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:07,845
Wake up!

295
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,119
Ichigo!

296
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:09,621
Wake up!

297
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:10,526
Wake up!

298
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,029
Wake up!

299
00:13:11,062 --> 00:13:12,436
Wake up!

300
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:15,519
-That hurts!

301
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:16,960
-My stuffing is coming out!

302
00:13:16,993 --> 00:13:18,669
My stuffing!

303
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:21,316
-Uryu!

304
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,019
Renji!

305
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:23,260
Wake up!

306
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:25,102
-This place is dangerous!

307
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:25,940
-Come on.

308
00:13:25,974 --> 00:13:27,548
We gotta get out of this room.

309
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:28,789
-You got that right.

310
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:29,694
Follow me, you guys!

311
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,921
-Dammit.

312
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:36,864
-All I know is the
three of you passed out

313
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:38,506
and went down like
sacks of potatoes.

314
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,839
Show the man some love
for saving you jerks.

315
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:46,414
-The mist in there
must have contained

316
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,593
a hallucinogen, or something.

317
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,033
[laughter]

318
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:52,781
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM):
You sould be careful.

319
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,255
-I really hate that laugh.

320
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:01,627
-This room appears
to be safe enough.

321
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:07,860
-Renji!

322
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,206
Wait!

323
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,250
That was close.

324
00:14:12,283 --> 00:14:15,132
-The floor just
suddenly disappeared.

325
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:16,137
[laughter]

326
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,645
-Too bad.

327
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:18,616
-Damn her.

328
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:26,457
-This doesn't make any sense.

329
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:28,971
It's like an infinite
loop, but that's impossible

330
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:31,619
considering the size
of this building.

331
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:32,925
-Well, impossible or not--

332
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,952
-You guys had better
take a look at this.

333
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:44,285
-That's the pole we tied
that line of yarn to earlier.

334
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,329
That can't be.

335
00:14:46,362 --> 00:14:48,239
-Uryu, take Kon off
your back, will ya?

336
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:51,154
-Uh, sure.

337
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:51,858
-OK.

338
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,896
Hold on tight.

339
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,634
-Huh?

340
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,941
Whatcha doin'?

341
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:55,444
Ah!

342
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,441
Oh, that-- ah!

343
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,429
-Hm?

344
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:15,348
[groaning]

345
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,905
-It's like a Mobius strip.

346
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:21,446
They've somehow
twisted this building

347
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,988
into an unending labyrinth.

348
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:25,434
-And that's why we always
end up at the same place?

349
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,573
-But wait.

350
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:28,249
That's physically
impossible for them to do.

351
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,126
-It's the only answer
I can come up with.

352
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,634
And if we're going
to win this game,

353
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,443
we've got to figure out
how they've done it.

354
00:15:36,593 --> 00:15:39,038
I'm drawing the path
we've taken so far.

355
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:41,250
It's like this.

356
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:44,366
We ran into traps in this
room, and this room here.

357
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,947
-So according to this, if we
go into the room ahead of us,

358
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,153
there's going to be a trap.

359
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:49,661
-But if we move
in an L formation,

360
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:51,437
we shouldn't hit any traps.

361
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:52,543
-You've solved the puzzle.

362
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,816
Good work, Uryu.

363
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,598
Now we can find those guys
and end this stupid game.

364
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:58,742
-Yeah!

365
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:00,049
-If only it were that easy.

366
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:18,948
-This sucks!

367
00:16:18,982 --> 00:16:20,322
-We'll find it.

368
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,763
The answer must
be here someplace.

369
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:22,903
-Man, Uryu.

370
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:25,315
How many things did you
stuff inside me, anyway?

371
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:26,924
-I can't take it anymore.

372
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:29,638
We're going in circles, and
even those voices have stopped.

373
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:31,380
-Stop running your
mouth and start

374
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,089
using your head to
figure this out.

375
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:35,670
It's hard to believe that you're
a lieutenant of the 13 Court

376
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,976
Guard Squads.

377
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,982
-What did you say?

378
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:39,154
-Stop it, both of you.

379
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:40,662
-Not to mention
that you're supposed

380
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:42,103
to be in charge of
this little town,

381
00:16:42,137 --> 00:16:43,644
and if you'd done your
job right, none of this

382
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:44,449
would have happened.

383
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:45,722
Idiot!

384
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:46,962
-Well, you should be thankful
that a lieutenant even

385
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:49,207
set foot in this
stinky little town!

386
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,078
[laughter]

387
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:51,151
-Huh?

388
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,491
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM):
They're fighting.

389
00:16:52,524 --> 00:16:53,765
-I've had enough!

390
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:56,278
Stop playing these stupid
games and show yourselves!

391
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:58,355
-When are you going to
see that this is pointless

392
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:59,829
unless we can solve this puzzle?

393
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:01,940
-If you're so smart, why
haven't you solved it?

394
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:03,180
-Why don't you shut up?

395
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:04,320
-Stop it, you two.

396
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:06,196
We're all just tired and
frustrated right now.

397
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,402
We need to calm down.

398
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:08,743
-Stay out of this!

399
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:09,849
I'm done.

400
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:11,558
From here on out, I
can handle this myself.

401
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:12,227
-Yeah?

402
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:13,635
Well, good riddance.

403
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:16,484
Because I'm tired of picking up
after your dumb ass mistakes.

404
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:17,254
-Hmph!

405
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:19,264
-Oh, give me a break.

406
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,404
[laughter]

407
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:22,147
RIRIN (OVER INTERCOM):
A split among friends!

408
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,397
-I wouldn't be his friend if
he was the last guy on Earth!

409
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:25,899
-Whatever.

410
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,886
What's happening?

411
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,695
The space is twisting.

412
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:39,102
-Is he crazy?

413
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:41,481
According to your drawing, there
should be a trap in that room.

414
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:49,658
-Advancing in an L shaped route.

415
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:51,702
Mobius strip.

416
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:54,717
Traps that block our way.

417
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:57,901
The spiritual pressure
when that gate appeared.

418
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:00,548
When Chad and
Orihime disappeared.

419
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,463
And ever since the moment
we entered this building--

420
00:18:03,497 --> 00:18:07,887
it feels like-- I've got it!

421
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,261
Ichigo!

422
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:09,763
Renji!

423
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,668
-Hm?

424
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:13,047
-I figured out the secret.

425
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:13,918
-Are you sure?

426
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:14,756
-Really?

427
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,605
-Listen closely.

428
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,542
-Wait.

429
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:19,849
Could it really
as simple as that?

430
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:21,626
-You're sure you want
to take that chance?

431
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:23,401
-I'm willing to take
that risk, but I'm

432
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,808
going to need one thing.

433
00:18:24,843 --> 00:18:26,718
Can I borrow your
substitute combat pass?

434
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:28,059
-What do you want to do with it?

435
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:29,533
-It's just in case.

436
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:33,823
Here I go.

437
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:38,078
-Uryu!

438
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:42,334
-I knew it!

439
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:51,683
[laughter]

440
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:53,091
RIRIN (OFFSCREEN): Very good!

441
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,330
-What is this?

442
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:59,323
[laughter]

443
00:18:59,357 --> 00:19:01,803
-How'd you figure out
the secret to my puzzle?

444
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:04,350
-We pieced together the hints.

445
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:06,662
Once I wrote it down,
I figured it out.

446
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:09,376
It's like a game
that children play.

447
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:12,392
There are nine rooms
placed in a 3x3 format.

448
00:19:12,425 --> 00:19:14,302
You just made them
loop infinitely.

449
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:17,686
If we were to go three spaces
either forward or horizontally,

450
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,993
we would win.

451
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,736
So, whenever you felt
like we were getting

452
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:22,847
too close to that
third room, you'd

453
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,461
create a diversion with a trap.

454
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:27,672
Your traps were
all hallucinations.

455
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:30,151
It would've been far too
difficult to set up real traps

456
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:32,564
to match our movements.

457
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:34,072
But you knew you
could lead us where

458
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,490
you wanted using hallucinations.

459
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:39,736
We discovered the traps
and avoided them unharmed,

460
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,382
but that's what you had intended
because you'd only set them up

461
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,762
as a psychological trick.

462
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:46,873
You counted on the fact
that since our friends had

463
00:19:46,906 --> 00:19:48,716
been kidnapped when
they were alone,

464
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:52,704
we'd be extra cautious, and
would stay together as a group.

465
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:55,451
It took you by surprise when we
suddenly split apart and took

466
00:19:55,484 --> 00:19:58,534
up three spaces simultaneously.

467
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,611
You probably started to
worry, because you never

468
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:02,220
expected their
pig-headed stubbornness

469
00:20:02,254 --> 00:20:05,034
to outweigh their desire
for self preservation.

470
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:07,481
And you knew the illusion
was not infinite,

471
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:10,664
because when Renji and Ichigo
were nine spaces apart,

472
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:12,407
that's when the twist
in space appeared.

473
00:20:15,154 --> 00:20:18,037
So finding that clue was
actually just a lucky break.

474
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,980
Then all we had to do
was get through the rooms

475
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:23,599
with imaginary traps,
and connect three spaces.

476
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:26,883
-That's right.

477
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,290
However--

478
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:29,429
-Uryu!

479
00:20:29,463 --> 00:20:31,641
-Solving that puzzle was
only a part of the game,

480
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:33,752
because the game's not
over until you catch us.

481
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:35,092
-Now, that's where you're wrong.

482
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,650
[groaning]

483
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:45,380
-I thought so.

484
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:47,491
You really are Mod-Souls.

485
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:49,602
-How did you know?

486
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:51,344
-When I entered the
museum, I thought

487
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:54,126
I recognized the traces of
your spiritual pressure.

488
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,667
Then I realized that
they're the same

489
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,678
as Ichigo's stuffed animal.

490
00:20:57,711 --> 00:21:00,626
Despite the embarrassment of
carrying this backpack around,

491
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,168
I learned about
the characteristics

492
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:03,944
of a Mod-Soul's
spiritual pressure.

493
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:06,994
-Are you calling me
an embarrassment?

494
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:08,836
-Renji, did you pick up on that?

495
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:09,808
-Naw.

496
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:11,550
-The one who appeared
out of nowhere

497
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:14,700
used his power to
manipulate space.

498
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:16,142
And I assume the
one who showed us

499
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,286
those hallucination
traps is you?

500
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,732
[whimpering]

501
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:24,083
-I think it's about time you
tell us exactly what you want.

502
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,619
Huh?

503
00:21:27,434 --> 00:21:28,808
[laughter]

504
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:31,153
-Wait!

505
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:31,756
Orihime!

506
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,628
Chad!

507
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:35,242
-What's going on?

508
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:35,911
-How did you--

509
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:37,252
-I don't know.

510
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:39,799
We just found ourselves
standing there.

511
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:40,502
-Huh?

512
00:21:40,536 --> 00:21:41,440
-Look out.

513
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:42,480
They're going to
use that gate again.

514
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:43,049
-No.

515
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,356
Not this time.

516
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,903
-We played hide and seek,
and you won fair and square.

517
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:49,818
So we're giving you your
friends back, like we said.

518
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,292
-You can have these back, too.

519
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:03,757
-Where are you going?

520
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,567
[laughter]

521
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:08,248
-I have to go get ready
for the next game!

522
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:12,135
[laughter] School
is about to begin.

523
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:14,581
All good students should
be in their classes.

524
00:22:14,614 --> 00:22:15,788
-What's she mean?

525
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:17,429
RIRIN (OFFSCREEN): I'd
go quickly if I were you,

526
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:19,440
or your friends may
start to disappear.

527
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:20,010
-Wait!

528
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:21,149
Come back here!

529
00:22:21,183 --> 00:22:25,606
[laughter]

530

[theme music]

532
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:06,167
URYU (OFFSCREEN): Now that we
know our enemies are Mod-Souls,

533
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,115
it'll be easier for us to
formulate a plan of attack.

534
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,188
RIRIN (OFFSCREEN): You'd
be foolish to think

535
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:11,796
that we're the same
as a certain idiot.

536
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,075
KON (OFFSCREEN): Who are
you calling an idiot?

537
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:14,913
ICHIGO (OFFSCREEN):
Apparently you,

538
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:16,320
because you responded to her.

539
00:24:16,353 --> 00:24:17,393
KON (OFFSCREEN): Uh, yeah.

540
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:23,893
[theme music]

541
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,198
KON (OFFSCREEN): Illustrated
Guide to Soul Reapers.

00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:33,041
FEMALE VOICE: Golden.

543
00:24:33,075 --> 00:24:35,420
NARRATOR: The Female
Soul Reaper Association.

544
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:37,498
An officially
sanctioned association

545
00:24:37,531 --> 00:24:40,078
of the Soul Society,
created to elevate

546
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:43,247
the status of the society
of female Soul Reapers.

547
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,547
It serves as a
shadow organization,

548
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:49,147
influential in the
management of Central 46.

549
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:50,147
-Everyone.

550
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:51,481
Thank you for waiting.

551
00:24:51,514 --> 00:24:54,647
Our chairman is
ready to address you.

552
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:56,447
Madam Chairman?

553
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:57,247
-OK!

554
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:59,547
Is everybody ready to play?
