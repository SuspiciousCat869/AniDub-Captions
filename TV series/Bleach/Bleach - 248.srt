1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,833
The Zanpakuto. Its
unique shape and
abilities are defined
by its Soul Reaper.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,400
The Soul Reaper is able
to harness the power of
the Zanpakuto by learning
its name and forming a

3
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,200
synergistic unit.

4
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:29,066
The Zanpakuto is born
with its Soul Reaper and
dies with its Soul
Reaper.

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,233
That is the existence of
a Zanpakuto.

6
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,867
Everything went according
to my plan. I would like to
thank all of you Soul Reapers.

7
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:28,900
And especially you...
Ichigo Kurosaki.

8
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,067
You bastard.

9
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:37,233
Sorry, but I'm afraid
it's time for me to go.
As far as I'm concerned,
this conversation is over.

10
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,367
Do whatever you like.

11
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:58,933
Farewell Genryusai
Yamamoto and Soul
Reapers.

12
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,400
It's too late. From now
on, you'll no longer be
getting in my way.

13
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,067
<i>Look out!</i>

14
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,033
Well, this is frustrating.
I'd say we've got ourselves
in a bit of a pickle.

15
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:33,767
Seems like Muramasa is
using these flames to
keep us trapped here.

16
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,767
He's just mocking us. But
this damn bonfire isn't
gonna stop me!

17
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,733
What the hell?!

18
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,200
[screaming]

19
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:53,267
Ichigo!

20
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,567
That was a
close one!

21
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,400
I didn't think he'd let
us leave that easily.

22
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:01,433
Damn. We need
a plan, here.

23
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:11,900
Head Captain Yamamoto,
do you have any thoughts
on where Muramasa might
be headed to next?

24
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:19,733
He has gone to an Enriched
Spirit Zone in the World of
the Living. Karakura Town.

25
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,700
He's gone where?!

26
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:29,533
What Muramasa seeks, is
hidden within Karakura
Town.

27
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:48,033
So this is the current
Enriched Spirit Zone.
Karakura Town.

28
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:54,033
Well Byakuya...

29
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,767
Without your skilled
guidance,

30
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,900
I would not have been
able to make it here to
this important place...
I thank you.

31
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:05,300
I merely chose to follow
my instinct and uphold my
self-respect. That's all.

32
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,467
An Enriched Spirit Zone
is a spiritual hotspot.

33
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,200
At this rate, countless
spiritual entities will
be drawn to this town.

34
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:24,467
There's no need for
concern. I will make certain
that nothing gets in our way.

35
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:35,333
Very well. I will save my
energy so I can relish in my
victory when this is done.

36
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,733
I will see that he
keeps his promise.

37
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,433
You do that.

38
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:48,400
Byakuya Kuchiki. What are
you really planning to do?

39
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:57,467
I don't have much
time. I must hurry.

40
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,033
Are you sure that's
where he went?!

41
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,833
What would Muramasa want
with Karakura Town?!

42
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,100
Ichigo!

43
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:15,200
Stay alert, Ichigo. You've
got to focus on getting out
of here!

44
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,867
Yoruichi!

45
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,467
Huh?

46
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,667
Think we could make
it through there?

47
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:23,333
Hmm... well, it's at
least worth a try.

48
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,733
Shunko!

49
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,267
Ichigo! Bring
the others!

50
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,600
Let's get movin'!

51
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,967
You've got to hurry!

52
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,167
What was that?!

53
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,833
It's been
blocked!

54
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:57,133
Yoruichi!

55
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,933
It's okay, I'm
fine down here!

56
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,667
Damn!

57
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:10,000
Sounds like the others
have already started
fighting.

58
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,767
I hope Ichi's doing
all right out there.

59
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,233
If Ichigo wins, I get
to fight him next.

60
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:21,200
But if he dies while he's
fighting, I guess I'll have
to take on the guy who
wipes him out.

61
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:24,500
Now then... where
were we, big guy?

62
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,667
Time for you to stop
playing with your toys!

63
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,533
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

64
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,733
I know who you are.

65
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,900
And I know you haven't
been focused on this fight,

66
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:06,133
because you were too
busy protecting your
comrade.

67
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,633
That's why I made the
decision to cut him down
first.

68
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:18,333
[laughing]
Now, it's just
me and you.

69
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:22,467
The real fun's
about to begin!

70
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:44,733
Looks like he's finally
ready to take you on, Kenny!

71
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:48,500
Yeah. And I want you
to stay back, got it?

72
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,733
All right,
have fun!

73
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,867
Bankai.

74
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:21,333
[laughing]
That's what I'm
talkin' about!

75
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:25,333
I hope you got more
power to back up that
size of yours!

76
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,267
'Cause I'm about to
come up and say, "hello"!

77
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,167
[screaming]

78
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,467
[screaming]

79
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,633
Shunko!

80
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:56,633
Hunh?!

81
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,133
All right! Go ahead
and show yourself!

82
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,567
<i>Hi!</i>

83
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:14,633
We've come here to repay
you for what you did to us.

84
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,933
You know I went easy
on you last time

85
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:21,167
because I was told not to
destroy the Zanpakuto of
another Soul Reaper.

86
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,433
Though you did escape
my Kido pretty quickly.

87
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:30,633
Hm! Well, aren't you
cocky? You have obviously
underestimated the power
we possess.

88
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:35,467
For some reason, old ladies
like yourself always seem
to be way too confident.

89
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,367
And what's with that
outfit?! Is that supposed
to look good?!

90
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,667
Little girls like
you don't understand the
allure of a real woman.

91
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,333
No! We just don't
understand really
old women!

92
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:50,900
Haineko, let's not
waste anymore time
with insults.

93
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,300
You should know the last
time we fought,

94
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,767
it was Muramasa's orders
that prevented us from
destroying you.

95
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,667
But things won't be as
easy for you this time.

96
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,300
We're gonna take
you down!

97
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,933
Wow, you girls
are full of it.

98
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:07,400
I supposed you've left
me only one choice.

99
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,267
It's time to show you
two how a real woman
can fight.

100
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,300
Getsugatensho!

101
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,333
Hado 63!

102
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:29,567
Raikoho!

103
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:41,567
Oh, great. No effect.
Our attacks aren't
working at all.

104
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,100
There must be a way
to break through all
of these flames.

105
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:46,900
Damn it!

106
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,833
We don't have much
time left here.

107
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:55,067
At this point, there isn't
much I can do force Rujinjaka
to submit.

108
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:59,133
If we cannot find a way
to escape from this place
soon,

109
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:05,000
Muramasa will have broken
through the seal. We cannot
give him the time to do that.

110
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,233
The seal?

111
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,933
What are you talking about?
Is that why Muramasa has
entered the World of the
Living?

112
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:18,700
We have to know! Tell us
what exactly Muramasa's
trying to do!

113
00:12:20,033 --> 00:12:23,733
Muramasa has plans
to release Koga.

114
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:28,033
Koga is a Soul Reaper
that was banished long ago.

115
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:31,167
At the time, he was the
master of Muramasa.

116
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,400
Muramasa is a truly
unique entity.

117
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,900
He is a Zanpakuto that
can enter another person's
inner world,

118
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:46,367
and control the Zanpakuto
that lives within it.

119
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,633
Koga, used this unusual
power he possesses

120
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:54,933
to organize and lead a
rebellion against the
Seireitei.

121
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:58,467
He exerted his control
over many Zanpakuto.

122
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,933
Everyone was caught
completely by surprise.
The Soul Reapers were not
prepared for the attacks

123
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:09,500
and without the use of
their powers, they stood
no chance to defend
themselves in battle!

124
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:13,467
The Soul Society became
a state of complete chaos!

125
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:17,567
We suffered a tremendous
amount of casualties in
those battles,

126
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,367
but finally we managed to
capture and seal Koga away
forever.

127
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,400
Muramasa's Soul Reaper
master, huh?

128
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:28,233
It all makes
sense, now.

129
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,000
He told me something else.

130
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:33,933
He said that he was the one
that cut down his master
back then.

131
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:36,933
He will stop at nothing
to reach his goal.

132
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:43,033
He has been successful thus
far and is well aware that his
master is alive within the seal.

133
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:46,467
And that seal's located
in Karakura Town?

134
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:50,333
Why have I never heard
about this incident
before now?

135
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:54,267
The incident was kept
secret for obvious reasons.

136
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:01,000
Sir. Please tell us what
exactly did Muramasa obtain
when he entered your mind?

137
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,100
He took information that
only I have. He found out
how to free Koga.

138
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:11,500
If Muramasa is able to
reunite with Koga,

139
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:16,733
They will then possess
enough power between them
to annihilate Karakura Town.

140
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:23,067
This is my fault!

141
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,698
So this is it.

142
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:43,465
Hmmmm...

143
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,931
The time has
come... Koga.

144
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:10,465
Hm?! Who's there?!

145
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:14,365
Who are you?

146
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:15,965
Why are you here?

147
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:20,765
Santenkesshun!

148
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:24,265
What's this?!

149
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,331
What is it that
you want from me?

150
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,831
What's happening?

151
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:42,698
But I'm so close!

152
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,965
You can't move yet!

153
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:10,631
Wait, you're--

154
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,498
I'm almost done...

155
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:16,398
This power.
Who are you?

156
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:24,731
Huh? Me? Uh, well, I only
came here because I was
told someone just entered
the World of the Living.

157
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:29,398
Are you one of the
Substitute Soul Reaper's
friends?

158
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:30,565
Huh?

159
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,631
Why would you
help me?

160
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:36,998
Because you were injured
and if I see someone that's
hurt, I help them.

161
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,665
But I'm an enemy
of Ichigo Kurosaki.

162
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:43,798
I kinda knew that...

163
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:48,998
But you were in really bad
shape. So I couldn't just
leave you here, could I?

164
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:50,865
And besides...

165
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:53,498
You looked like you were
in so much pain...

166
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:01,898
Foolish Girl!

167
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:10,731
This Spiritual Pressure of
his, it's just as dark as
an Arrancar's!

168
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:16,731
<i>Uryu! Chad!</i>

169
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:21,398
So... you brought
your backup.

170
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:25,665
You must be our special
guest from the Soul
Society.

171
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,698
You okay Orihime?

172
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:40,798
Getsugatensho!

173
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,831
Yes!

174
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:50,531
I'm not gonna
make it!

175
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:55,731
[screaming]

176
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:01,298
You all right, Ichigo?!

177
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,731
Damn it!

178
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:21,498
If Muramasa destroys the
seal, it'll be my fault.
I have to stop him!

179
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:24,165
I have to try to break
through the flames again!

180
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:28,665
Right. Once more
should do it!

181
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:49,931
What?!

182
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:51,931
What the hell?

183
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,998
What's that?!

184
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:12,665
Reign over the Frosted
Heavens! Hyorinmaru!

185
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:23,098
Toshiro! Hyorinmaru!

186
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:25,298
I came as fast as I
could!

187
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:32,065
Captain Hitsugaya! Have
all your wounds healed?

188
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:35,831
They have. I'm feeling
much better. Thank you.

189
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:39,665
We've been stuck here.
Thanks to Rujinjaka.

190
00:19:39,865 --> 00:19:43,831
He got to your Zanpakuto
as well, Head Captain?

191
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:45,665
Where's Muramasa?

192
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:47,265
<i>He's gone.</i>

193
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:48,565
Hm?

194
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:51,631
By now he's probably in
Karakura Town.

195
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:53,231
Karakura town?!

196
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:57,565
He's gone there with a plan
to revive this Soul Reaper
who was once his master.

197
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:00,131
His Soul Reaper master?

198
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,565
<i>Yeah. Let's just say</i>
<i>the situation is</i>
<i>terrible.</i>

199
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:05,231
Damn him.

200
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:08,165
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

201
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:14,665
At this point, our first
priority is to quickly aid
Ichigo Kurosaki in escaping
from this place.

202
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:17,131
What? Wait a
sec... why me?

203
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:21,431
If you feel responsible
for this situation,

204
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:24,998
it is your obligation to
bring Muramasa to justice.

205
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,131
And I will.

206
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:36,331
Let's go!!

207
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:37,331
Right.

208
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:39,765
Ban-kai.

209
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:44,498

Ban-kai.

00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:18,331
Ryusenka!

212
00:21:22,665 --> 00:21:24,765
Now's your chance!
Quickly!

213
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:25,765
Got it!

214

Good luck Ichigo. We're

218
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:52,598
Now then...

219
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:58,031
Since we have him on his
way, it is finally time for
me to give my sword the
punishment it deserves.

220
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:08,898
Get ready, Muramasa!
Because I'm coming for you!

221
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:50,543
Are you the Substitute
Soul Reaper's friends
too?

222
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:52,843
