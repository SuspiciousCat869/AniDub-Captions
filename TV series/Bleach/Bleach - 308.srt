Even without it being

Yes.

31
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:45,282
<i>I had already discovered</i>
<i>the answer known as the</i>

<i>However, it failed.</i>

33
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:51,548
<i>I tried to find a way to</i>
<i>make the Hogyoku work.</i>

34
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:58,115
<i>I gouged out the souls of</i>
<i>hundreds of Soul Reapers</i>
<i>and hundreds of residents</i>
<i>of the Rukon District.</i>

35
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:03,248
<i>I chose those who possessed</i>
<i>latent Soul Reaper powers</i>
<i>and gave their energy to</i>
<i>the Hogyoku.</i>

36
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:06,882
<i>But even all those lives</i>
<i>weren't enough to satisfy it.</i>

37
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:13,448
<i>In looking at the results of</i>
<i>Kisuke Urahara's experiments,</i>
<i>I knew his Hogyoku wasn't</i>
<i>completed, either.</i>

38
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:18,348
<i>That's when I decided to</i>
<i>steal his Hogyoku, and</i>
<i>give it over to mine.</i>

39
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:21,115
<i>By doing that,</i>
<i>I gained something.</i>

40
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:38,082
<i>[Gin]</i>
<i>Evolution requires fear.</i>

41
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:44,915
The fear that in one's
present state, one can die
and disappear at any moment.

42
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:47,848
Thank you, Gin.

43
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:55,648
Thanks to you, I have
finally evolved into a
being that transcends both
Hollows and Soul Reapers.

44
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,648
So what do you think
they're doing?!

45
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:07,915
Maybe the two of them
had a big falling out
and they killed each
other or something.

46
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:09,715

Hey! Is that a Soul
Reaper uniform?
Where did you get that?

54
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,470
I've made up my mind.

55
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,437

I couldn't regain what was
taken from you, Rangiku.

Thanks a lot, Dad.

Is that Ichigo?!
It really is him.
It's him!

71
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,237
Why does his hair
look so long?!

72
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:58,770
He looks different.
His hair's grown out.
And I swear, he looks
like he's taller!

73
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:18,304
That's good.

74
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:20,870
Yuzu and Karin seem okay.

From this other guy, I can
feel his overwhelming power.

91

<i>But from Ichigo,</i>
<i>I don't feel anything.</i>

What exactly do you mean?

95
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:52,204
Well if you really are him,
I'd say you're disappointing.

96
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:57,937
I don't feel a thing.
You have no Spirit Energy.

97
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,704
Even if you're suppressing
your energy, I would still
be able to sense it.

98
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,604
You have failed to evolve.
You let the final chance
that I gave you slip away.

99
00:13:09,637 --> 00:13:11,104
What a waste
of time.

100
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,037
For your own good,
You should go.

101

<i>You are at a level now...</i>

[Gin]
Where I can die and
leave the rest to you.

108
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:09,270
Regrettable, for you.

109
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:10,270
Aizen.

110
00:14:12,104 --> 00:14:15,937
Let's not do this here.
I'd rather we fought
somewhere else.

111
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,637
An impertinent
suggestion.

112
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,504
Only someone who has the
power to give me a real
challenge has the right
to make such a request.

113
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,304
There's no need to worry.

114
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,170
I will not destroy
Karakura Town.

115
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:31,904
You will--

116
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:32,804
Mmph!

117
00:14:37,904 --> 00:14:38,837
What??!

118
00:14:54,304 --> 00:14:58,304
How did he...! Impossible!
No one could've done this to me!

119
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,970
Now let's do this, Aizen.

120
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,204
I'll end this,
in an instant.

121
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:25,016
Now let's do this, Aizen.

122
00:15:26,116 --> 00:15:28,616
I'll end this,
in an instant.

123
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:31,882
"End this in an instant?"!?

124
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:41,782
Now I see.

125
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:44,516
It's all become
quite clear to me.

126
00:15:45,782 --> 00:15:48,682
I now know why I didn't
sense your energy.

127
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:55,582
You didn't lose your Spirit
energy. You discarded it.

128
00:15:56,582 --> 00:16:04,416
I don't know how you did it, but
it seems you took all of your
Spirit energy and converted into
your body's physical strength.

129
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:10,016
<i>Arm strength, leg strength,</i>
<i>your strong grip. The power</i>
<i>in your running and throwing.</i>

130
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,349
So in exchange for this drastic
improvement of every one of
your physical abilities,

131
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:18,416
<i>you chose to discard your</i>
<i>remaining Spirit energy.</i>

132
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:23,082
<i>You've given up fighting</i>
<i>against my Spirit energy</i>
<i>with your energy.</i>

133
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,716
But, that won't help.

134
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:29,249
You will learn.

135
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:35,949
That new physical strength
you're counting on is
inferior compared to the
reaches of my own power.

136
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:51,182
You done?

137
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:18,649
<i>You parried that well.</i>

138
00:17:19,582 --> 00:17:22,016
But you still must
be rather shocked.

139
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:27,849
<i>The landscape changes with</i>
<i>a single slash of my sword.</i>
<i>My power is growing.</i>

140
00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:34,482
Honestly, I didn't actually
realize my abilities had
improved so much until you
decided to show up.

141
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:39,416
<i>Thanks to you, I'm quite</i>
<i>happy right now. You see,</i>

142
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:45,682
With you here, I can test my
powers that transcend those
of Hollows and Soul Reapers
to my heart's content.

143
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,116
Heh heh heh.

144
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:03,582
Wait! I'm not finished!

145
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:08,549
[Aizen]
Did you really think I wouldn't
be able to predict your moves?

146
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:19,182
Hah!

147
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:26,616
What an odd coincidence,
it seems we have both
reached a similar evolution,

148
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:29,616
which I see as the truest
form of the Zanpakuto.

149
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:35,949
Through introspection,
our right arms have
almost completely fused
with our Zanpakuto.

150
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,749
Heh.

151
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:39,749
What's so funny?

152
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,316
You know, I just realized
something while we clashed.

153
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:47,949
It's clear your evolution
and mine are at very
different levels.

154
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:54,382
If I so decide to, I have
the power to shatter your
Zanpakuto with one swing!

155
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,282
<i>Impossible!</i>

156
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:20,782
<i>He caught it!?</i>

157
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:24,149
<i>I could understand</i>
<i>moving out of the way,</i>

158
00:19:24,182 --> 00:19:28,549
<i>Although, with my sword</i>
<i>coming at him at such a</i>
<i>speed, he shouldn't even</i>
<i>be able to do that.</i>

159
00:19:28,782 --> 00:19:32,682
By just dodging my slash,
he would've eliminated the
risk of getting hurt.

160
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:34,849
<i>But he chose to</i>
<i>do this instead!?</i>

161
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,082
<i>He caught it with</i>
<i>his bare hand!!</i>

162
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:39,382
You look surprised.

163
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:45,449
Was it really such a
mind-blowing thing to you?
Yes, I did catch your sword.

164
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:46,216
Rrgh!

165
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:51,682
Does that scare you?
That something you can't
comprehend, happened
right before your eyes?

166
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:53,449
And you couldn't stop it?

167
00:19:54,982 --> 00:19:56,282
He he he he he.

168
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:57,482
Hm?!

169
00:19:57,516 --> 00:19:59,916
Very funny,
Ichigo Kurosaki.

170
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,316
Something I can't
comprehend or stop,
you say?

171
00:20:05,349 --> 00:20:08,049
Don't talk as though
you've already won
this fight.

172
00:20:08,782 --> 00:20:13,449
What just happened was
simply a moment where your
physical strength
temporarily exceeded mine.

173
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:17,016
Miracles like that
do happen from
time to time.

174
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,849
But I'm a being
who surpasses even
the miraculous.

175
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:25,016
I will make sure that an anomaly
like that never happens again,

176
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,949
by crushing your
bones with Kido!

177
00:20:28,949 --> 00:20:33,782
The oozing crest
of corruption!
The arrogant
vessel of madness!

178
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:39,582
Deny the seething urge to
let things Stun and Flicker!
Disrupt the sleep!

179
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:44,016
The crawling princess of iron!
The eternally self-destructing
doll of mud!

180
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:48,916
Unite! Repulse!
Fill the earth,
and know your own
powerlessness!!

181
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,616
Hado Number 90:
Kurohitsugi!

182
00:20:55,149 --> 00:21:00,649
A full incantation Kurohitsugi
performed by one who transcends
both Hollow and Soul Reaper!

183
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:04,182
Its power unleashes enough
gravity to warp time and space!

184
00:21:04,216 --> 00:21:07,082
The likes of which you could
never even comprehend!

185
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:09,782
<i>Perish! Ichigo Kurosaki!!</i>

186
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:38,849
You still haven't
realized it, have you?

187
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:44,782
The power I have is greater
than the power you possess,
even right now.

188
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:51,149
That huge force
that erased that
entire mountain,

189
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,182
That was my sword.

190
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:00,249
[big gasp]

191
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:03,149
Now its my turn, Aizen.

192
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:51,682
<i>[Aizen]</i>
<i>All Humans are an</i>
<i>imitation of apes.</i>

193
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:57,349
<i>All Gods are an</i>
<i>imitation of Humans.</i>
