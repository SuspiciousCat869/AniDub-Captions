A vampire's true self is
extremely savage and cruel.

00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:52,037
However, vampire hunters
are very similar.

If you ask me.

I'm sure he's meeting

I get back, OK?

334
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:18,851
ICHIRU: Don't go, Zero.

335
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:20,784
-I'll go get it for him.

336
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:23,351
Zero, you look after Ichiru.

337
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:24,618
He really loves you, Zero.

338
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:30,718
ICHIRU: Being so
frail like this,

339
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:35,118
I'll never become a hunter.

340
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:38,618
Hey, Zero, that
vampire we saw today.

341
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:41,551
Will Father or Mother or
perhaps even some other hunter

342
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:43,184
go after her and kill her?

343
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:44,884
-Who knows?

344
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:48,251
But if it's on the list,
someone will hunt it.

345
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:50,051
-Zero, I know you
and I are both being

346
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:52,751
trained to hunt
vampires some day,

347
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:55,418
but will you be able to kill?

348
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:57,751
You're such a kind person.

349
00:19:57,784 --> 00:20:00,551
-Listen, don't worry
about me, Ichiru.

350
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:04,684
That's why the Master's
teachings are so important.

351
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:07,484
-You sound as if you think
it's your duty, Zero,

352
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:10,918
but I realize that what you're
really trying to do is make up

353
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:13,251
for me to--

354
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,418
-No, I'm not, Ichiru.

355
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:26,918
[wind blowing]

356
00:20:26,951 --> 00:20:28,218
MOTHER: Where's Ichiru?

357
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:30,684
ZERO: He should be back soon.

359
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:34,784
-Hey, Zero, what is it?

360
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:38,051
[bell ringing]

361
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:41,818
-A vampire is burying
its fangs right now.

362
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:42,951
Ichiru!

363
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:43,884
-Zero!

00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:47,584
[door opening]

365
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:48,884
-Clever boy.

366
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:52,751
You knew I was here even
before your parents noticed.

367
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,284
The twin children
of the hunters.

368
00:20:55,318 --> 00:20:57,818
It all comes down to
your sinful blood.

369
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,184
-What are you talking about?

370
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:03,451
[bell ringing]

371
00:21:03,484 --> 00:21:09,084
-I will further curse your
fate, child of the hunters.

372
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:11,051
FATHER: Zero!

373
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:11,551
Zero!

374
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:17,151
Shizuka, heel.

375
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,551
-Heel?

376
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:22,918
FATHER: What does a Pureblood
vampire want from us?

377
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:24,618
SHIZUKA: You killed him.

378
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:28,918
So now, I will punish you.

379
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,518
FATHER: No!

380
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:31,018
-Zero!

381
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:31,518
No!

382
00:21:39,218 --> 00:21:40,651
[groaning]

383
00:21:40,684 --> 00:21:42,584
ZERO: Ichiru!

384
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:43,718
Run away!

385
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:48,084
If you do anything to
Ichiru, I will kill you!

386
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:08,218
-That's a really terrible mask.

387
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:10,618
Is that her doing?

388
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:12,418
Will you take it off?

389
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:15,051
Don't wear it in front of me.

390
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,284
I thought you were dead.

391
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:20,484
[laughs]

392
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:21,018
ZERO: Ichiru.
