Did you come here to

What's the matter, Ichiru?

I'm in this body?

Why won't you just
turn me into a vampire?

-Because, if I
did that, then you

would just end up
becoming my servant.

become my servant so easily.

You want to know about him?

I thought you wouldn't want
to, so I've avoid the subject.

those old memories would

00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:24,306
-Well, if that's the
case, I might as well

00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:25,739
tell you the truth.

He and I would never
have ended up together.

84
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:32,472
I was a rare beast,
so I was locked up

85
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,572
and kept in a luxurious cage.

86
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:38,906
And he was the human they
threw into the cage as bait.

87
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,872
But this man was unlike
any of my other prey,

88
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:45,472
and he glared at
me in silent rage.

89
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:49,972
So I thought rather than devour
him, I'd make him a companion.

90
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:53,206
And for the first time,
I felt attachment.

91
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:54,672
I didn't hesitate.

92
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:58,639
I turned him into a vampire.

93
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:03,106
I think he never forgave me
for that until the very end.

94
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:05,639
However, when I
asked him to run away

95
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:08,339
with me to some faraway
place, he didn't refuse.

96
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:15,372
But after that, what was
waiting for him was--

97
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:17,172
SHIZUKA: I sought revenge.

98
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:21,872
And I couldn't stop myself
from killing your parents.

99
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:24,672
You must really
hate me, don't you?

00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:25,739
-I don't.

101
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:26,306
-Hm.

102
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:29,739
Is that right?

103
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:32,006
If that's true, you
really are sinful.

104
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,306
-What a complicated look.

105
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:41,639
Did you hate it?

106
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:44,339
-I know you don't feel
that way about me.

107
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:47,139
So please don't
tease me like that.

-I like you.

109

Especially the way you always
wear your heart on your sleeve.

110

I will pretend

111

not to notice your
feelings for me.

112
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:06,139
And this way, I will maintain
a subtle distance between us.

For every time a Pureblood
develops an attachment

I was nothing to her.

138

After all I did, she
only thought of me as a--

You're wrong.

What do you know?

You weren't by her
side this entire time.

What right do you
have to say that?

Even I-- someone like

ZERO: Yuki.

168
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,206
Don't look at me!

169
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:40,572
YUKI: Akatsuki!

170
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,072
Please!

171
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:42,439
Wait!

172
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:42,906
Akatsuki!

173
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:46,406
Akat--

174
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:51,306
-Hey.

175
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:52,906
Headmaster?

176
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:54,439
-What are you doing
here, Headmaster?

177
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:55,439
Where's Zero?

178
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:57,372
Where did he go?

179
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,506
-Uh, well, I'm
afraid he got hurt.

180
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:04,272
I asked Yagari to take him to
the association medical clinic.

181
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,939
YUKI: Was he hurt that badly?

182
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:06,806
-Don't worry.

183
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,606
It's just a precaution.

[music playing]

-The game we were playing
is finally over, Shizuka.

186
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,506
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER):
You poor thing.

187
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:29,972
How sad.

188
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:33,806
-You must be
Princess Shizuka Hio.

189
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,339
-You've become the next
leader of the Kuran family.

190
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:38,206
I pity you.

GIRL: You're taking
ample notes today.

196
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:06,622
Wait, come to
think of it, you've

197
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:08,934
been awfully studious
since the ball.

198
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:09,868
-Huh?

199
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,301
-Learn your lesson?

200
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,868
-Uh.

201
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:13,668
Yeah.

202
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:15,301
I guess I did.

203
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:19,068
That, and-- well,
Zero's absent, so I

204
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:24,301
thought I'd take
extra notes for him.

205
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:27,001
YUKI: When will
Zero be coming back?

206
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:29,834
-Oh, I don't think he
will be gone for too long.

207
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:32,401
It's just Zero's so eager to
be back that he's not getting

208
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:33,768
enough rest.

209
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,501
So I'm thinking they should
keep him there for a little bit

210
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:38,134
longer.

211
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:41,834
How about we go pay
him a visit later?

212
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:44,601
-All right.

213
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:45,734
I was wondering.

214
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:47,068
Did you know about--

215
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,368
-Hm?

216
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,868
-About Maria?

217
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:53,634
I mean, Shizuka Hio.

218
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:55,468
-I didn't.

219
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:57,068
I'm ashamed of myself.

220
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,368
A precious student of
mine was in danger,

221
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:02,801
and I wasn't able to
do a thing about it.

222
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:03,568
-That's not true.

223
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:09,934
-The disintegrated
body of Shizuka Hio

224
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:12,201
was all that remained.

225
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:16,601
And the Headmaster told
us he taken care of Zero.

226
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:17,401
That's it.

227
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:19,568
That's what I witnessed.

228
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:20,768
-I see.

229
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,501
[inaudible] had enough
reasons to kill that woman,

230
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:26,168
but I don't think he would
do something so rash.

231
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,868
However, it can't be
helped if it appears

232
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:33,768
that he had, in
fact, killed her.

233
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:36,468
What's wrong, Aido?

234
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:37,301
-No.

235
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:38,634
Nothing.

236
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:42,734
-In any case, I must report
all this to the Senate.

[ticking clock]

238
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:49,534
-It's a fact that someone has
committed the greatest taboo.

239
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,301
They have dared to
do the unspeakable

240
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:52,268
by killing a Pureblood.

241
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,634
It's tragic.

242
00:13:56,668 --> 00:14:00,968
People gave her cruel
nickname of Kuruizaki-hime.

243
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:03,434
I wonder if anyone
truly understood her.

244
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:08,268
-No one's here.

245
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:09,468
We're alone.

246
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:11,501
Not even the eye
patch is coming.

247
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:12,168
-Hm.

-Want some candy?

249
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:14,668
-No.

250
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:15,801
Thank you.

251
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,201
I have heartburn now.

00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:18,468
-Hm.

253
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:19,901
-Something's wrong.

254
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:21,101
I've got a bad feeling.

255
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:23,101
-Hm.

00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,068
-Can you smell that?

258
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:31,101
-Yes.

259
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:32,768
Even the sweetest
of smells can be

260
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:35,234
nauseating if it's
far too strong.

261
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:37,068
Like flowers that
are out of season.

262
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:38,268
Or blooming all at once.

00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:43,501
-Hm.

265
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:48,934
-I can tell by the way
you're acting Hanabusa,

266
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:51,001
that something is bothering you.

267
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,268
-Hey.

268
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:56,468
-Hm?

269
00:14:56,501 --> 00:15:00,668
-Akatsuki, how much do you
know about Shizuka Hio?

270
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,501
-She was out of control.

271
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,168
She was dangerous to
both vampires and humans.

272
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,368
She attacked the Kiryu
family after going berserk,

273
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:12,001
then she disappeared
and showed up here.

274
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:13,834
That's all I know.

275
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:16,468
-She was regarded as a
nuisance and ostracized,

276
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:19,868
but still, she was
a rare Pureblood.

277
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:22,034
-I wonder if anyone
understood her.

278
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:32,101
-I know that she had
a Pureblood fiance.

279
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:34,634
And then, for some
unknown reason,

280
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:37,668
she started keeping a
human male by her side.

281
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:40,801
To be exact, he was a
vampire who used to be human.

282
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:42,234
A servant.

283
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:45,234
And Shizuka loved him.

284
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:50,468
But-- he was put on the Vampire
Hunter's execution list.

285
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:54,901
And so the Kiryus
hunted him down.

286
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:57,334
But I've also heard that
the servant had not yet

287
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:59,268
fallen to Level E status.

288
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:01,034
AKATSUKI: Then there's
no way his name

289
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:03,701
could have been on
the execution list.

290
00:16:03,734 --> 00:16:05,334
HANABUSA: Yes, I know.

291
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:07,668
But it was.

292
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:11,701
Shizuka attached the
Kiryu family for revenge.

293
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:13,801
AKATSUKI: No matter what
the reason, a Pureblood

294
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:17,301
shouldn't have gone
after the hunters.

295
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:20,534
Most aristocrats want
peace, not conflict.

296
00:16:20,568 --> 00:16:23,434
Her actions were the same
as the one who'd gone crazy.

297
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:25,168
HANABUSA: Shizuka
Hio had proven to be

298
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,068
a high risk to the Senate.

299
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:29,934
They must have been searching
for her relentlessly.

300
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:34,201
And Shizuka was probably on the
run, fleeing from the Senate.

301
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:35,701
So why would she risk it?

302
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:37,668
Why would she come
to Cross Academy?

303
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:39,601
She knew she wouldn't
be welcome here!

304
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:40,768
-Another act of madness.

305
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:44,368
-No.

306
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:44,901
You're wrong.

307
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,934
There is something
she wanted here.

308
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,868
KANAME: The blood of
a Pureblood vampire.

309
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:54,134
The power.

310
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:57,368
I promise to find the very
thing that you hated most,

311
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,934
and I will destroy
it once and for all.

312
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,434
Those who twisted the
fate of the Purebloods.

313
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:05,601
-And I don't think she's
the only one who wanted it.

314
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:08,768
Someone else is
after it is as well.

[glass breaking]

316
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:12,534
-This new power is quite strong.

317
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:14,634
I will need to learn
how to control it.

[glass shattering]

319
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:20,434
-But I expect I'll get
used to it quickly.

320
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:22,768
One game is over.

321
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:23,834
And the next one's begun.

322
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,334
-Zero.

323
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:31,701
I wonder how he's
doing right now.

324
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:34,568
KANAME: Thank you for
patrolling the grounds.

325
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:35,868
-Kaname!

326
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:36,901
-Were you taking a break?

327
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:45,268
KANAME: I heard that
Zero was injured.

328
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:47,034
How is his recovery going?

329
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:47,534
-Oh.

330
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:48,601
Well.

331
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,034
The Headmaster said
there's nothing

332
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:53,701
to worry about, so I guess--

333
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:55,301
-That incident was
something the night

334
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:57,068
class should have taken care of.

335
00:17:57,101 --> 00:18:00,201
I'm very sorry that you
got dragged into it.

336
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:07,901
But-- No matter what I do,
you won't let me protect you.

337
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:10,001
-Well, it's just that--

338
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:10,934
-Now.

339
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,968
For Zero, the task
would be rather

340
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:15,768
difficult to do, especially
in his condition.

341
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:21,068
-Zero.

342
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,101
He saved me.

343
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:26,801
I made a promise.

344
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:28,201
I swore I'd protect him.

345
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:32,234
But in the end, I
was the one who--

346
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:32,901
-I see.

347
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:33,401
-Kaname.

348
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:35,301
Are you--

349
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:39,701
-You mustn't blame
yourself, Yuki.

350
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:40,868
He owes you.

351
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:43,168
It is the least
that he could do.

352
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:43,834
Very least.

353
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:48,234
-No.

354
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:51,034
That's not true.

355
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:52,168
You don't understand.

356
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:54,634
You're wrong, Kaname.

357
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:56,701
Zero is suffering.

358
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,268
No, it's not just Zero.

359
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:03,034
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER): He wants
to destroy himself with me.

360
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:07,201
ICHIRU (VOICEOVER): But she--
she didn't want my blood!

361
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:11,334
She never once
desired it at all!

362
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:12,801
-Everyone suffered.

363
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:16,268
Because of their entwined
destinies, and all I could do

364
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:16,801
was watch.

365
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:21,601
ZERO (VOICEOVER): It's true.

366
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:26,101
I did used to wish that I could
die along with that woman.

367
00:19:26,134 --> 00:19:27,868
But that's not what I want now.

368
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:34,068
-I believe in you.

369
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:35,768
I really do.

370
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,701
Zero.

-How's Zero?

373
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:45,168
-It's no use.

374
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:47,568
I've even administered medicine.

-Zero.

ZERO: Please.

379
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:07,868
Kill me.

-No, don't.

00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,368
Listen, Zero.

383
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:16,834
Yuki is waiting for you.

-Could The Senate have learned
about Shizuka's death already?

388
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:45,439
KANAME: It's such a shame.

389
00:20:45,472 --> 00:20:47,306
You didn't have the
opportunity to drink

00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:49,472
the blood that would
have saved you.

391
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:51,439
I left her remains
there for you, Zero.

392
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:58,039
-Yuki is very sad right you.

393
00:20:58,072 --> 00:21:00,439
-Yuki.

394
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:02,806
Yuki!

KANAME: I'm surprised.

You haven't completely

and still, you insist on
continuing to fight it.

The purest blood that
courses through my body

will prolong your life, and
force the shadows of madness

to recede.

Understand one thing.

I am not doing this for you.

406
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:46,339
It is for Yuki.

-Now.

00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:52,539
Take my blood.
