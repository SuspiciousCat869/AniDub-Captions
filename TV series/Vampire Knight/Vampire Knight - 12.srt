1
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:09,933
-So, you've decided.

2
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:12,733
-Maria, if you know
the way to save Zero,

3
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:15,533
then I want you to save him.

4
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:17,466
YUKI (VOICEOVER): If
this is the only way,

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,100
I'll offer myself in return.

6
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:25,533
-Come here, Yuki.

7
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:26,500
Good girl.

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,600
What is it?

9
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:44,833
-I just realized that for the
first time in my whole life,

10
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:50,233
I'm glad vampires find my
blood delicious 'cuz in return,

11
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:52,100
you will save Zero for me.

12
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:01,700
-It was me who drove
Zero to despair.

13
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,866
That is my real body.

14
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,600
It's easy to save Zero.

15
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:29,733
You see that boy, he only
needs to drink my blood.

16
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:41,033
[theme music]

17
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,131
-He needs to drink your blood?

18
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:24,871
-That's right, the blood
of his master, Shizuka Hio,

19
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:29,431
and then Zero cannot
fall to level E.

20
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:32,798
He will become a true
member of the night clan.

21
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:49,898
-Oh, sorry.

22
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:58,364
Rima, you're overdoing it.

23
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:01,464
-Akatsuki, come on,
why don't you join us?

24
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:02,731
-Sorry, I can't.

25
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:05,131
I have urgent
business to attend to.

26
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:05,698
-Really?

27
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:07,298
That's too bad.

28
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:11,082
-By the way, isn't it time
that we switch places.

29
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:12,049
-Um, but--

30
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:14,816
-Now, now, don't fuss.

31
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:15,649
-No fair.

32
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:17,249
We wanted to dance with Takuma.

33
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:18,716
-So do I.

34
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:20,682
-This isn't fair.

35
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,149
-Hey, no pushing.

36
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,082
-Are you all right?

37
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:30,816
You didn't sprain
your ankle, did you?

38
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:31,382
-No.

39
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:36,649
-Dorm vice-president, may
I have a minute, please?

40
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:39,549
Now you've attracted all
these girls around you,

41
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:41,749
I hope you're not planning
to eat them later.

42
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,616
-How rude.

43
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,216
I'm just being nice.

44
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:48,349
So what is this urgent business?

45
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:51,582
-I must first report to
the dorm president, Kuran.

46
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:52,882
-All right.

47
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,249
Hey, by the way, I don't see
that transfer student here

48
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:57,349
tonight.

49
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,682
Well, go on.

50
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,149
Take care of your
business matters.

51
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:01,649
I hope it's nothing
too troublesome.

52
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:13,249
-You alone?

53
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,349
-Where is President Kuran?

54
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:19,649
-I won't do it.

55
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:22,482
I won't dance with anyone
except Lord Kaname.

56
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:23,949
-Of course, you won't.

57
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,282
-Now, for your promise.

58
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:55,549
Offer your blood to me
for I am to be pitied.

59
00:05:55,582 --> 00:06:01,082
I am being hunted, and because
of that I need more power.

60
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:03,582
-Pursued by the vampire hunters?

61
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:08,882
I understand why you
would want more power,

62
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,449
but if you then decide to
attack the other students

63
00:06:11,482 --> 00:06:15,282
at the Academy, I will--

64
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:17,749
-Your blood alone is enough.

65
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:27,982
You do understand what it
means for a pureblood's fangs

66
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:30,416
to pierce you, don't you?

67
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,549
-Shizuka!

68
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:42,982
Let Yuki go.

69
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:52,249
-But, Zero, you--
Please, stay back, Zero.

70
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:53,682
I mean it.

71
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:55,282
-Move it, Yuki.

72
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:56,916
Why would you even--

73
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,016
-You don't understand.

74
00:06:58,049 --> 00:07:02,382
She's the only one who
can save you, Zero.

75
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,749
-You think she can save me?

76
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:07,716
-Yes, she and I
already made a deal.

77
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:10,616
Listen, Zero, the only way
for you to control those urges

78
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:12,849
and for you to stop
becoming a level E

79
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:15,149
is for you to drink
this woman's blood.

80
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:21,882
Yes, I'm scared, but
I'm going to be fine.

81
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,016
So please, stay back.

82
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:29,916
-Even if what Yuki says
about your blood is true,

83
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,649
I can still beat you within
an inch of your life, Shizuka.

84
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:36,149
-Zero.

85
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:50,682
-Why are you trying to
stop me, she-- Yuki.

86
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:58,949
-This girl has tamed you.

87
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:07,982
Are you happy to have finally
heard your master's voice?

88
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:11,282
You cannot help
but obey me, Zero.

89
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,982
I'm back in my own body.

90
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:17,516
Now my voice has the
power to bind you.

91
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:20,782
-The power to bind him?

92
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,382
-This is convenient.

93
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,082
Keep holding Yuki.

94
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:29,316
You do understand, don't you?

95
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:32,749
I am the one responsible
for creating you

96
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:35,682
and that means I am your master.

97
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:39,149
You simply cannot
disobey me, Zero.

98
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:40,649
-Zero, let go.

99
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:49,916
You don't have to
force Zero to do this.

100
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:53,449
I will let you
drink my blood, OK?

101
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:57,149
-For four years now, this
body has been ravenous.

102
00:08:57,182 --> 00:09:00,216
Did you truly believe that
your blood was enough?

103
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:04,616
-But you said that you
only needed my blood.

104
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:05,549
Please, stop.

105
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:12,049
You've tortured him enough.

106
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:13,049
Why are you doing this?

107
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:15,049
Why are you being
so cruel to him?

108
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:24,582
-I'm punishing him for
becoming so attached to you.

109
00:09:24,616 --> 00:09:27,949
You're being cruel yourself.

110
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:29,916
Don't you know, Yuki,
that the choices you make

111
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:33,016
are causing Zero to suffer,
even I can see that.

112
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:45,549
-I thought if I was with
Zero things would be OK.

113
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:51,716
I wonder, Zero, if you could
ever forgive me someday.

114
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,516
Zero.

115
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:59,482
-You can't do it, Zero.

116
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:03,049
Just stay being my puppet
for now, all right?

117
00:10:06,349 --> 00:10:09,816
You can't even squeeze those
fingers around my neck.

118
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:27,382
-Don't take anything
more away from me!

119
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,316
-Zero, no.

120
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:42,516
-But this is not
enough to kill me.

121
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:44,449
-I'll finish it right now.

122
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:46,182
I'll end it all.

123
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:46,682
-Zero.

124
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,382
-Those eyes say so much.

125
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,516
He doesn't even
need to think, he

126
00:10:56,549 --> 00:11:00,682
knows in his heart he wants
to destroy himself with me.

127
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:09,316
-Zero.

128
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:11,482
-Shizuka, why are
you doing this?

129
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,382
Why are you playing with him?

130
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,216
I will not allow it.

131
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:15,982
I will not have you die.

132
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:20,349
-Don't interfere.

133
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:24,516
Zero and I have
unfinished business.

134
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:28,349
Besides, you have
no need to worry.

135
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:30,716
I have things well
under control,

136
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:33,949
and I have no intention
of dying here.

137
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:34,849
-Shizuka!

138
00:11:34,882 --> 00:11:35,349
-Zero!

139
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:39,849
-Slow down.

140
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:42,249
Don't tell me you
plan to leave again?

141
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:46,016
-The only one who
left, Ichiru, was you.

142
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:46,916
-No, no.

143
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:49,349
What I meant was
the vampire blood.

144
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:53,282
-Zero.

145
00:11:53,316 --> 00:11:55,049
Who's Ichiru?

146
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,116
-Aren't you going to
introduce us, Zero?

147
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:08,982
-He's my twin brother.

148
00:12:36,444 --> 00:12:37,810
-Are you awake?

149
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:40,522
Look here, I brought you my
very own stamina packed gruel.

150
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:49,722
In vampire territory,
only vampires are allowed.

151
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:51,722
It's in Kaname's hands now.

152
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:54,355
He has control of
the night class.

153
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,122
Even I, the headmaster,
cannot interfere.

154
00:12:58,155 --> 00:13:00,722
-It may be fine
as the headmaster,

155
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:05,189
but I want to know how the
hunter inside you feels.

156
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:06,989
-I'm going to leave
the food here for you.

157
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:15,055
-That's it, huh?

158
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,789
-This is what I can say.

159
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:21,522
Yuki, as well as Zero,
are not vampires.

160
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:02,955
-Oh, it's you.

161
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:05,755
-Will you stop?

162
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:08,389
Listen, we have no idea
what dorm president Kuran

163
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:12,222
is planning right now, so
until we do there's nothing--

164
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:14,055
-You're wrong!

165
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,455
Why?

166
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,722
Why doesn't he tell
us what he's planning?

167
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:21,222
I've told President Kuran that
I'll always be on his side,

168
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,622
that no matter what
happens I'm with him.

169
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,122
-Hanabusa.

170
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,322
-If you stop me, I
won't forgive you.

171
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:38,922
-Protect yourself, Zero.

172
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:41,455
I'm no longer the old me.

173
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:45,055
The one who followed you
around and slowed you down

174
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:47,255
is long gone.

175
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:48,722
You see, Zero, I
have been allowed

176
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:52,055
to drink Shizuka's blood.

177
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,155
The flesh and blood
of a pureblood

178
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:57,089
give you special
powers and abilities.

179
00:14:57,122 --> 00:15:01,222
I know you crave it
too, just admit it.

180
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:02,689
-That's enough you two.

181
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:04,155
Will you just stop it?

182
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:07,589
No matter what happened
you two are brothers.

183
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:10,422
-If you get in the
way, I will kill you,

184
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:13,655
even if Shizuka
doesn't want me to.

185
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:14,289
-That's enough.

186
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:20,289
-I thought vampire
hunter guns are only

187
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:23,722
effective against vampires.

188
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:24,722
-I knew it.

189
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:30,055
-Zero.

190
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:31,322
-Stay back, Yuki.

191
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:42,189
-That's it, you're right, this
body is still human, Zero.

192
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:42,689
-Ichiru.

193
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:48,089
-Shizuka did let
me drink her blood,

194
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:55,222
but she-- she didn't
want my blood in return.

195
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,855
She never once
desired it at all.

196
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:09,155
-You're bleeding badly, Shizuka.

197
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:13,889
A vampire hunter's weapon can be
an incredibly dangerous thing.

198
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:18,355
Even a pureblood's extraordinary
healing power is restrained.

199
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:22,322
-Son of Kuran, why
did you come here?

200
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:25,155
-You see, this is the
first room that I ever

201
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:27,189
lived in at this academy.

202
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:30,422
-Oh, well, I really do like it.

203
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:33,255
There's no one
here to bother me.

204
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:34,622
-Yes.

205
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:38,122
-Let me rephrase
the question, why

206
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:40,989
did you choose to
come to this academy?

207
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:45,855
-To repay a debt.

208
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:49,055
It's also the perfect place
to assemble all my pieces.

209
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:59,022
You see, I think
you and I probably

210
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:02,089
have the same objective
in mind right now.

211
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,289
Shizuka, I'm just like you.

212
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:08,355
I will do anything for the
sake of the one I love.

213
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:12,989
-They wouldn't look at me.

214
00:17:13,022 --> 00:17:16,855
Not dad, not mom, the
reason our master,

215
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:20,622
the only person who
looked at me, was you.

216
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:23,789
And then finally, I met her.

217
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:28,922
She's the one who saved me
from the depths of loneliness.

218
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:32,655
It was her crimson
petals in the darkness

219
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:35,455
that brought color into my life.

220
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:43,322
And still-- still it was you
who Shizuka chose and not me.

221
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,189
Why?

222
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:45,722
Why was it you, Zero?

223
00:17:57,389 --> 00:18:00,222
But I've been by her
side this whole time,

224
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:03,422
but Shizuka still
doesn't look at me.

225
00:18:03,455 --> 00:18:07,389
I've stayed closer to
her than anyone else.

226
00:18:07,422 --> 00:18:15,122
-Even now, when she looks at
me, the only man Yuki truly

227
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:24,722
sees is-- well, you don't
seem surprised, Shizuka.

228
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:28,555
-No, you see, I intended
to take your life too.

229
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:31,289
I planned to use
Yuki as you assassin.

230
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:33,555
-She'd have been
the perfect choice.

231
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:35,055
-You foresaw this.

232
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,289
My healing powers
have been restrained

233
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:40,255
by the bullet in Zero's
gun, and you came here

234
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:44,689
to tear out my heart knowing it
would kill a pureblood like me.

235
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:52,189
I find it very strange
that in the end

236
00:18:52,222 --> 00:18:54,989
this is the way things
have turned out.

237
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:59,989
The first time I met you,
when you were a little boy,

238
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:04,422
you desired the
same thing I did.

239
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:06,489
-That is one thing
that has not changed.

240
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:19,122
-I will make sure your
life was not in vain.

241
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:22,355
I promise to find the very
thing that you hated most,

242
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:24,622
and I will destroy
it once and for all,

243
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:28,055
those who twisted our fate,
the fate of the purebloods.

244
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:33,922
-You have drunk the blood
of another pureblood.

245
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:39,589
You have gained new powers,
but now an ominous future

246
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:41,555
is what awaits you.

247
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:52,655
Only jet black darkness lies
in your path now, Kaname.

248
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:54,655
-I'm well aware of that.

249
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:08,989
-This must mean--

250
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:16,989
HANABUSA (VOICEOVER): Lord
Kaname killed Shizuka Hio.

251
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:18,955
-The smell of blood is strong.

252
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:21,922
Shizuka?

253
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:27,155
-Ichiru.

254
00:20:27,189 --> 00:20:29,455
Yuki, listen, you don't
know what's going on.

255
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:30,989
I have to kill Shizuka.

256
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,389
Let me go, Yuki.

257
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:34,122
-You haven't told me
what you're planning

258
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:36,889
to do after you've killed her.

259
00:20:36,922 --> 00:20:40,722
What if-- what if what she
said is actually true, Zero?

260
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:42,855
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER): He
doesn't even need to think.

261
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:47,922
He knows in his heart he wants
to destroy himself with me.

262
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,322
-Is that really true?

263
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:52,455
When everything is finished, do
you want to end your life too?

264
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:52,955
-Yes.

265
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,522
You see, that's why
everything you've been doing

266
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:02,722
was unnecessary, Yuki.

267
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:05,755
-I only did it because I
didn't want you to die, Zero.

268
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:15,022
-Yuki, why?

269
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:17,489
Why do you insist on doing this?

270
00:21:17,522 --> 00:21:22,022
You don't need to
care for me so much.

271
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:24,222
I'm really glad nothing
happened to you.

272
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:29,855
You stay here.

273
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:30,622
-Zero.

274
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:31,955
-It's true.

275
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:35,989
I did used to wish that I could
die along with that woman,

276
00:21:36,022 --> 00:21:40,489
but that's not what I want now.

277
00:21:40,522 --> 00:21:41,989
I'll be back, I promise.

278
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,022
It's true, Yuki.

279
00:21:50,055 --> 00:21:52,455
No matter who is in your heart.

280
00:21:52,489 --> 00:21:58,189
-No matter what, I'm still
going to stay by your side.

281
00:21:58,222 --> 00:22:01,355
Listen, Zero, you have
to promise me something.

282
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:03,489
Promise me you'll keep
fighting so that I never

283
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,455
have to use this pistol.

284
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:08,222
-My promise to you is--

285
00:22:08,255 --> 00:22:10,989
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I
believe in Zero, but--

286
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:14,755
-Disciplinary committee.

287
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,689
-Shizuka, what have they--

288
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:34,384
