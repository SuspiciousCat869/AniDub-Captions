all by yourself.

172

I'm not scared of anything!

Sorry I'm late.

His name is Zero Kiryu.

Take care of him, Yuki.

His family was killed
by a bad vampire.

It's still there.

That has to hurt!

You're talking about
that vampire who

did horrible things to
your family, aren't you?

things to you, too.

happened to your family,

here and let you kill me

either.

YUKI: Zero, I'm sorry.

I should have told
you about him sooner.

-Don't touch me!

With those hands
that touched him!

-But Kaname is
someone who rescued me

when I was about to be
eaten by a scary vampire.

240

He's a kind vampire.

wrong with both you

242
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:31,921
and the headmaster.

243
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:36,388
KAIEN: I'm going to establish
a night class at our school.

244
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:39,221
-Do you mean like an evening
class for the seniors?

245
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:40,488
No,

246
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:42,655
-It's not for the high school
or university students.

247
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,155
The classes will run at night,
and most of their studies

248
00:13:45,188 --> 00:13:46,688
will be high level
research, and they

249
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:48,488
won't receive grades either.

250
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:51,055
You see, these are
nocturnal students

251
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:52,721
who live much longer lives.

252
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:55,288
We can't treat them like us.

253
00:13:55,321 --> 00:14:00,521
Every student in the night
class is going to be a vampire.

254
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:01,888
ZERO: What are you trying to do?

255
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,921
Letting those things
in the school.

256
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:06,055
KANAME: The goal is to
promote peaceful coexistence

257
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:08,055
between vampires and humans.

258
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:10,021
And to educate young
vampires, so they

259
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:12,355
become a politically
moderate force.

260
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:13,988
That his plan.

261
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,055
-Kaname Kuran.

00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,455
-Kaname!

00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:19,988
-Good evening, Yuki.

264
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:20,555
-Huh?

265
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:23,155
-That's absurd.

266
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:24,521
There's no way
that vampires want

267
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:26,788
to peacefully
coexist with humans.

268
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:28,421
Their history is
stained with the blood

269
00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:30,055
of innocent people's lives.

270
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,655
-And it is our goal
to put an end to that.

271
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:35,121
I know how you must feel, Zero.

272
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:38,321
I, too, have lost
someone because of them.

273
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:39,788
-Then why?

274
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,821
KAIEN: There's no need to worry.

275
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:45,155
Kaname has agreed to join
the night class as well.

276
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:47,921
This will ensure that the
other vampires behave.

277
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:53,288
-But, things are over
if he double-crosses us.

278
00:14:57,988 --> 00:15:02,355
-He wasn't the one who
proved to be a traitor.

279
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:12,355
KAIEN: Kaname, it
makes me very happy

280
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:15,088
that you've chosen to
support my pacifist views.

281
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:19,155
KANAME: Yes, I hope your
views can become a reality.

282
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:21,788
And since I'll be bound
by certain restrictions,

283
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:25,621
I'll appreciate the students
who can move at my beckon call.

284
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:29,188
However, one thing
still concerns me.

285
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:35,955
-Yuki.

[music playing]

287
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:41,921
-I won't regret it,
that's what I thought.

288
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:45,521
ZERO: Your blood-- It
had that taste to it.

289
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:48,488
-Can a vampire do that?

290
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:52,421
Can they know someone's feelings
just by tasting their blood?

291
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:55,655
-When did you stop talking
to me about everything, Yuki?

292
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:02,855
-When?

293
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:06,521
Yes, it was that day.

294
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:09,121
That's when something changed.

295
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:10,921
YUKI: The teacher's dorm.

296
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:13,621
It isn't being used by
anyone right now, is it?

297
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:15,355
-It's being used
as a temporary dorm

298
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:18,321
until the entrance exams
and pledges are completed.

299
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:20,955
It's for the vampires.

300
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:25,155
Stay away from their lair, Yuki.

301
00:16:25,188 --> 00:16:26,888
-Then-- Kaname is there, too.

302
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:37,188
-Yah.

303
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,021
-Oh, it's you, Yuki.

304

-Huh?

305
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:41,755
-Did you come to see Kaname?

306
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:45,355
Unfortunately, he doesn't
happen to be in right now.

307
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:48,755
-Um, it seems you
already know who I am.

308
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:49,855
-Hm.

309
00:16:49,888 --> 00:16:51,621
You see, Yuki, I used
to live with Kaname.

310
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:54,455
And we drove over to
your place quite often.

311
00:16:54,488 --> 00:16:56,588
I stayed inside the
car, but I always

312
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:59,721
watched you hugging
Kaname tightly.

313
00:16:59,755 --> 00:17:02,521
OK, Yuki, you should
go home and go to bed.

314
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,455
You shouldn't walk around at
night, even here at the school.

315
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:09,588
YUKI: I know he
told me to go home,

316
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,155
but I'm already this close.

317
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:12,088
Just a peek.

318
00:17:16,755 --> 00:17:19,421
And it's too cold outside
for me to wait for him there.

319
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:25,221
STUDENT: What is this?

320
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:28,055
There are 1,000
questions on this survey.

321
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,021
And Headmaster Cross
wants it filled out

322
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:31,055
by the end of the night?

323
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:32,521
How twisted is that guy?

324
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:34,955
STUDENT: Stop trying to answer
them like you actually care.

325
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,055
-A vampire who takes filling
out a survey seriously?

326
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:38,921
That's kind of weird.

327
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:46,021
-Why is a human child in here?

328
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:47,488
And she's staring.

329
00:17:47,521 --> 00:17:48,921
Is she my fan?

330
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:50,721
-She's laughing at you.

331
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:53,088
Don't cause trouble
before school even starts.

332
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:55,388
I don't want my experience
here with Lord Kaname

333
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:58,288
to be ruined by some
foolish act of yours.

334
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:00,288
-She mentioned Kaname.

335
00:18:00,321 --> 00:18:02,855
I guess that means
she likes him, too.

336
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:21,755
[clock ticking]

337
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:27,721
KANAME: So then.

338
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:30,688
I see you still don't know
the rules for the night class.

339
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:31,921
-I'm sorry.

340
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:32,855
I remember them now.

341
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:40,355
-Far too trusting.

342
00:18:56,088 --> 00:19:01,055
-Yuki, you do
cruel things to me.

343
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:05,988
-Where-- where am I?

344
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:08,455
This-- this is Kaname's.

345
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:11,888
KANAME: Ruka.

346
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,755
[gasping]

347
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:19,755
RUKA: Lord Kaname!

348
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:24,188
I'm--

349
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:31,321
KANAME: Yes.

350
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,621
It's best to run away.

351
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:37,855
Yuki, you make me cruel.

352
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:38,521
-No!

353
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:40,821
That wasn't Kaname!

354
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:41,788
I'm scared!

355
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,988
There's so much blood!

356
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:45,888
WOMAN (VOICEOVER):
You know the truth.

357
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:48,255
CHILD (VOICEOVER): That
scary vampire will--

358
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:51,588
WOMAN (VOICEOVER): The
truth cannot be changed.

359
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:54,488
YUKI: Kaname wouldn't
do something like that.

360
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:58,321
This is just a bad dream!

361
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:01,155
-Listen, Yuki, when it
comes to taking human life,

362
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:02,721
they don't think twice about it.

363
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:04,188
They're beasts in human form.

364
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:05,721
Remember that.

365
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,688
And Kaname Kuran
is no different.

366
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:13,188
-Yeah, but Kaname
is the one who came

367
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,455
and saved my life that day.

368
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:18,955
Kaname is different
from the rest.

369
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:22,721
ZERO: So then, why are
you shaking, silly?

370
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:30,021
YUKI: It was that night
when my fears returned.

371
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:31,555
YUKI: I just wanted
to say thank you

372
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:35,288
for carrying me the other night.

373
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:39,721
YUKI: Kaname is so
different from me.

374
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:40,855
I finally understood that.

375
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:45,721
ZERO: Hey, are you asleep?

376
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:53,155
You'll catch a cold.

377
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:53,655
-Kaname?

378
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,421
-Let's go outside.

379
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:28,855
-Huh?

380
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:37,721
Kaname, are you-- Did
Kaname cover me up?

381
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,488
KANAME: I have
never told you why

382
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:42,655
it is that I pretend
to be unaware of what's

383
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,821
happening to you.

384
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:48,621
I realize how precarious the
peace is here at Cross Academy.

385
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:51,555
That's why I have given
a great deal of thought

386
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:56,155
to just who in this little
garden would best benefit Yuki.

387
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:58,555
I know that you would
never betray her

388
00:21:58,588 --> 00:22:01,655
because you realize
you owe her that much.

389
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:08,455
And that is why I am
allowing you to live, Zero.

390
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:13,055
YUKI: Something inside
me changed that day,

391
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:16,521
but there is one thing
that will never change.

392
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:20,255
And that's the part of me
that will always love Kaname.

393
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:34,324
