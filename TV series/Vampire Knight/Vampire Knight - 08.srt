your preference probably would
have been Kaname Kuran over me,

-I didn't do it!

Besides, if I did,
like always, he'd

have punished me in

TAKUMA: That's him.

In the human world, there's

with which his company

The Ichijo group
was founded by him.

48
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:23,171
In the vampire world, he
is the patriarch of one

Asato Ichijo.

Also known as Ichijo.

52
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:32,205
And as a member of
the Senate, he's

53
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,038
the vampire with
the most seniority.

RUKA: We have nothing to fear.

58
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:43,638
I understand the
Senate is powerful.

59
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:45,871
They are the highest
governing body in our society

60
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,405
and demand our respect.

61
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:49,605
But in the end, they are
not the ones who rule us.

-I know.

That's true.

64
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:57,405
But still, I just-- I don't
want him to come here and ruin

the relative peace this
dorm has established.

alive 12 times longer than us.

And I'm guessing that's
why everyone skipped class

Rima, but still-- I

wonder who's scarier-- Dorm

Don't worry, you don't need to
be here for this, all right?

I'm sure he's just coming here

other since the day

you refused to have me
as your legal guardian.

And that's the last
we spoke, Lord Kaname.

-Yes I just didn't
want to be coddled.

You're an odd girl.

didn't they?

00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:45,771
KANAME: It just happened
to turn out that way.

Listen.

139
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,638
There's nothing to worry about.

140
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:30,338
I'm perfectly fine.

141

-Zero.

143
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,405
-What is it?

144
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:43,171
-Nothing

145
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:44,271
-What do you mean nothing?

146
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:50,238
Seems you already know.

147
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:54,405
I asked, but Lord Kaname
didn't want to drink my blood.

148
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:56,605
I'd hoped he would.

149
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:01,505
But it-- but it
didn't come true!

150
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:04,438
The only time that Lord
Kaname wanted my blood

151
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,871
was when I first
came to this school!

152

But that-- was the last time!

153

-Seems that way.

154
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:16,071
It's what we do.

155
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:20,571
We try to fulfill our longings
by drinking each other's blood.

156
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:21,938
I am sorry.

157
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:25,438
I guess it just means that your
blood is not enough for him

158
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:26,738
right now.

159

I've tried, but no
matter what I do,

00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:35,838
I still don't
understand Lord Kaname.

162
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:37,938
I don't know what he wants.

163
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,905
I'm such a fool.

00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:45,371
[foot steps]

165
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:48,071
-Takuma, it seems
Lord Kaname has

166
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:52,138
a great deal of trust in you.

167
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:54,871
You keep serving him as
well as you have been,

168
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,271
and keep an eye on him as well.

169
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:59,138
For those are the
only reasons I'm

170
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:01,005
allowing you to stay
at this Academy.

171
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:03,071
Is that clear?

172
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:05,838
[door creaking]

173
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:09,571
TAKUMA: Grandfather, I'm
afraid you don't understand.

174
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,871
You see, I will only do
what is best for my friend.

175
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,305
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:17,838
-It is you who does
not understand.

177
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:19,405
Make no mistake.

178
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:21,505
Friendship based on
a fictitious piece

179
00:11:21,538 --> 00:11:23,238
in the small world
of this Academy--

180
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:26,638
YUKI: Cross Academy is peaceful!

181
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:27,605
TAKUMA: Yuki!

182
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:29,838
-Um, so-- the
Headmaster said he would

183
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,938
like to ask you to donate
a lot for the Academy

184
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,338
this time around as well.

185
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:36,471
Uh, hold on-- you are
actually Takuma's grandfather,

186
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:37,305
aren't you?

187
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:39,238
We are here to escort you.

188
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:40,338
-Follow us.

189
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:43,438
We'll take you to the
Headmaster's office.

190
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:44,605
-Very well.

191
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,238
KANAME: Ichijo.

192
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:49,371
YUKI: Huh?

193
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:49,871
Kaname?

194
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:52,771
What are--

195
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:54,105
-Thanks for coming.

196
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:57,105
I look forward to seeing
you again in the future.

197
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:59,238
-The same goes for me as well.

198
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:00,238
Good night.

199
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:10,071
[ticking]

200
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,438
-Yuki.

201
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:12,738
-Uh, yes?

202
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:14,071
-Good work.

203
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:15,471
-Oh, oh, no.

204
00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:16,371
I--

205
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:17,738
KANAME: Hm?

206
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:21,871
-Um, I just-- I just wanted to
say thank you for yesterday.

207
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,171
-Huh?

208
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:23,938
YUKI: Excuse me!

209
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:48,562
[giggling]

210
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:54,489
KANAME: And that is why I am
allowing you to live, Zero.

211
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:00,270
-Kaname Kuran has
nothing to do with it.

212
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:01,237
-Oh.

213
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,749
-Will you learn to knock?

214
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:05,682
-Oh, come on!

215
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:06,782
Like you're one
to say something!

216
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:08,149
You're the one
that never knocks.

217
00:13:08,182 --> 00:13:11,415
You know the lock is broken,
so hang a towel on the door.

218
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,582
Maybe if you would
have done that, then--

219
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:15,849
YUKI: What?

220
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:20,215
ZERO: I wonder what Kaname
Kuran has in mind for you.

221
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:22,082
-Huh?

222
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,349
-Nothing.

223
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:24,215
Never mind.

224
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:27,782
Just leave already.

225
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:30,482
-I just-- you're wrong.

226
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:31,982
You said that I
would have preferred

227
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:34,882
to give my blood to Kaname, but
I never wished for that at all.

228
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,049
-Is that right?

229
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,549
-Is that all you have to say?

230
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:39,715
You're the one who brought
it up in the first place.

231
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,049
Listen!

232
00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:43,382
My responsibility is to make
sure that I give you blood!

233
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:45,615
That's what I intend
to do forever!

234
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:47,582
So with that in
mind, I can't just

235
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:50,582
go around giving my blood
out to anyone who asks!

236
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:52,949
Knowing you, you
probably think that me

237
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:57,015
making sure you get blood
is just annoying and pushy.

238
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:58,382
Are you listening?

239
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:01,482
And this time, you had better
not turn me down, all right?

240
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:02,249
Hey!

241
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:03,782
You are prepared for this.

242
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:04,649
We both decided.

243
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:08,115
Right now?

244
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:16,449
[whimpering]

245
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:20,315
[music playing]

246
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:22,182
-You're an idiot.

247
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:25,015
You're the one who's not
prepared, that's obvious.

248
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:33,782
-Just go.

249
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:37,982
YUKI: I thought you
were serious, stupid!

250
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:39,649
You try to test me
like that again,

251
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:43,215
and I'll really let you have it!

252
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,482
[foot steps]

253
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:47,882
[door opening]

254
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:49,015
-What's wrong?

255
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:53,482
Yuki seemed like she was
upset about something.

256
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:56,215
It's perfect timing,
though, Zero.

257
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:59,949
I need to have a word
with you, if I could.

258
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,949
KAIEN: This is in order
from the Hunter Association.

259
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:06,249
It's a request to hunt down
a Level E serial killer.

260
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,249
And it's for you.

261
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:13,149
It'll be your first
assignment as a hunter.

262
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:14,849
It's despicable.

263
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:17,515
This is just their way of
testing you to see if you have

264
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,982
what it takes to carry
on the Kiryu name.

265
00:15:20,015 --> 00:15:22,915
I told them the other day
that you were doing fine.

266
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:23,582
-Listen.

267
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:24,982
I--

268
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:27,282
KAIEN: Unfortunately, Zero, this
is something you can't refuse.

269
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:34,115
KAIEN: Goodness.

270
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,382
It's either the Hunter
Association or the Senate.

271
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:39,515
I wish they would leave
my poor students alone.

272
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:45,749
I only hope that there
aren't any consequences.

273
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:55,682
YUKI: I know I left Zero in
kind of a weird way yesterday,

274
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:58,149
but-- that was really
the best answer

275
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:02,782
I could give him about
Zero, me, and Kaname.

276
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:09,182
-Huh?

277
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:12,315
YUKI: Zero?

278
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,382
[talking and laughing]

279
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:27,382
-Where is he going?

280
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:30,115
And why is he skipping
class to do it?

281
00:16:36,782 --> 00:16:39,682
[foot steps]

282
00:16:47,582 --> 00:16:49,549
[bell ringing]

283
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:51,115
-This is it.

284
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:53,615
-Hey, Senri, you're
gonna get a sunburn

285
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,215
without using an umbrella.

286
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,582
-I want you both to hurry
up and finish your business,

287
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:00,549
or you're going to be
late for the photo shoot.

288
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:03,182
And Senri, you get
sunburns easily.

289
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:05,015
And you didn't
bring an umbrella.

290
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:06,849
So you get under Rima's, too.

291
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:08,115
-Huh?

292
00:17:08,149 --> 00:17:10,549
-You need to remember that
you're a professional model.

293
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:11,049
-Fine.

294
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:17,915
SENRI: Why do we have to hunt
a former human during the day?

295
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:19,649
-It's an order from the Senate.

296
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:23,549
They don't want the Hunter
Association to beat us to it.

297
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:26,282
It seems the Vice Dorm
President got an earful

298
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:27,415
from his grandfather.

299
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:29,649
-So then-- it's a race, is it?

300
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,315
-From what I was
told, our target

301
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,515
only became a Level
E rather recently.

302
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:36,015
So he may have
some intelligence.

303
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:37,982
Still, I doubt he'll
be any different.

304
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,249
-Hm?

305
00:17:39,282 --> 00:17:40,615
Oh.

306
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:42,915
It's the disciplinary committee.

307
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:43,749
-Huh?

308
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:45,915
If you, Senri, and Rima, too.

309
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:55,882
-Who are you?

310
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:58,282
-Four teenage girls
have wound up dead.

311
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,682
You wouldn't happen to
know anything about that?

312
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,049
-Come on.

313
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,949
You're supposed to shoot me
with no questions asked, Hunter.

314
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:08,149
But still, I'm in a good mood,
so I'll answer your question.

315
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:08,649
Yes!

316
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:10,349
I did it!

317
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,049
I couldn't help myself!

318
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:13,449
It felt so good!

319
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:16,249
One just wasn't enough!

320
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:19,515
You have no idea how good it
feels when your fangs piece

321
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:23,615
the skin of a young
girl's neck-- then,

322
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:28,549
you bite down hard, losing
yourself in a trance.

323
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:33,482
And then-- climax!

324
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:35,482
[laughing]

325
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:36,949

00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:42,815
-(LAUGHING) I don't understand.

327
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,815
Why are vampires like this?

328
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:48,515
Each and every one of them.

329
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:51,549
They don't deserve any sympathy.

330
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:54,749
I will-- I'll end it all.

331
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:55,482
SENRI: Was that--

332
00:18:55,515 --> 00:18:56,849
YUKI: A gunshot?

333
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:57,349
Zero!

334
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:04,215
YUKI: A vampire?

335
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:07,915
-Well now, a friend of
the Hunter, are you?

336
00:19:07,949 --> 00:19:09,282
YUKI: A Level E.

337
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,582
-Tell me, are you going to try
to steal my dessert from me,

338
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:13,082
too?

339
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:17,149
-You're in the way.

SENRI: Huh?

342
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:34,315
Did he get away?

343
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,115
You're taking forever.

344
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:37,449
Hurry up.

345
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:39,182
-I really do hate playing chase.

346
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:40,082
-So?

347
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:42,582
Just go get him.

348
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,515
-Zero must be somewhere
in this place.

00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,482
-My luck keeps getting better.

353
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:09,482
You're number two today.

354
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,982
-Now, now, don't be scared.

355
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,615
I promise I'll do my
best to be gentle.

[gun shot]

357
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:23,782
ZERO: Get your filthy
hands off of her now!

358
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:24,282
-Zero!

359
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:29,849
-How dare you!

360
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:35,249
ZERO: This ridiculous
chase ends here.

361
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:35,815
-Zero!

362
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,649
What are you--

363
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:41,015
ZERO: I'm carrying out an
order as a vampire hunter.

364
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,549
-Your desire for
blood has turned you

365
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:47,815
into a serial killer.

366
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:51,482
I will purge you of your sin.

367
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:54,115
-So then, it's over, huh?

368
00:20:54,149 --> 00:21:00,207
I guess-- this means I will
finally stop killing people.

[music playing]

371
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:16,792
-Zero.

372
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:18,758
-Hey, disciplinary committee.

373
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:21,812
We picked up a girl
in another room.

374
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:22,912
You want her?

375
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:23,845
She's still alive.

376
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,479
-That's great, Zero.

377
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:31,579
You hear that?

378
00:21:31,612 --> 00:21:34,145
She's still alive.

379
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:37,012
You rescued me as well.

380
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,045
So thank you.

381
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,845
KANAME: I know that you
would never betray her.

-I found Zero!

386
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:02,712
His eyes are so sad.

387
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:03,879
They're wonderful.

388
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:09,045
I'm so glad he's becoming
such a handsome boy!

389
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,745
And then there's that yummy
looking girl with him!

390
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,845
I've made up my mind!

391
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:19,512
I will be going to
Cross Academy, too!
