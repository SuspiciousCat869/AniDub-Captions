YOUNG ZERO: It was
my fault-- your eye.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,700
I'm sorry, Master.

3
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,000
You told me to
run, and I didn't.

4
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,633
-Huh?

5
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,700
[sighs] Keep looking
at me like that,

6
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:20,966
and I'm going to regret the
fact that I risked my life

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,333
to save your neck.

8
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,333
Now, come on, I
didn't save your life

9
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:29,066
just so you could
look at me like that.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,166
-Master, why do
vampires do that?

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,266
Why do they try and hurt people?

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,933
-Because they are pitiful beings
who live only by instinct.

13
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:43,933
Then it is for that simple
reason why we hunt them.

14
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:47,966
That's why hunters, like the
Kiryu family and I, exist.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,533
Zero, do you understand now?

YAGARI: Even if
it's just a graze,

22
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:44,345
it probably hurts like hell.

23

A spell was put on that
bullet to kill vampires.

for blood, do you still

26
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,665
have a reason to brace yourself?

27
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:03,598
-Huh?

28
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:08,031
-Humph.

29
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:13,365
-Mr. Yagari, listen.

30
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:14,865
It's clear to me
that you and Zero

31
00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:16,231
have a connection
with each other

32
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:18,231
that I don't know
anything about.

33
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,165
But I will not let you
decide Zero's fate for him.

34
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:23,065
I will not let you kill him!

35
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:25,998
-Are you saying he
isn't a Level E yet?

36
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:34,198
-Yuki, it's OK.

37

-Uhh.

38
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,731
-You pushed things too far!

39
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:48,465
I thought there might
be a problem, and look!

40
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:52,465
This is a perfect example
why I hate vampire hunters.

41
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,131
And how much longer
are you going

42
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:56,865
to keep a girl in cold water?

43
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,598
You must be freezing.

Who are you?

48
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:12,498
-When Zero was training
to be a vampire hunter,

49
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:14,665
I was his mentor.

50
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:15,731
Right, Zero?

51
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:19,465
-It's true.

daughter of that silly twit.

54
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:27,731
Zero was about to attack
you, yet you consider me

55
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:29,831
as your enemy.

56
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:30,331

take over from here.

00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:38,198
Yuki, go back to the dorm.

59
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:47,765
YUKI (VOICEOVER): The
headmaster told me

60
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,865
that I didn't need to worry.

61
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:53,998
But if Zero's body keeps
rejecting the tablets,

62
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:59,765
then his thirst for blood
will just continue to grow.

63
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:02,331
And his mind is
being eaten away.

64
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:08,765
If things continue
like this, then Zero

65
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:11,598
will devolve into a Level E.

66

I'm sorry.

me to help you with something,

you just have to ask.

Whatever it is that's
been bothering you lately,

-What happened to Zero?

89
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:45,265
Did you do something to him?

90
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:48,265
-We quarantined him, of course.

91
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:49,831
-Quarantine?

-He's at a point where
he can attack somebody

at any given moment now.

94

This way, I can at
least deal with him

95

properly without the risk
of there being more victims.

Is he all right?

I want to know where he is!

I have more pressing
matters to attend.

Your idiot headmaster keeps
making my life miserable.

He has me teaching Ethics
to the Night Class now.

reconsider your request.

There's no need to worry.

122

Today, I'm fully
qualified and certified

123
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,398
to be a legitimate
teacher for this class.

to spy on the Night Class,

have you?

126
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:38,298
Or maybe the real
reason you're here

127
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:43,598
is so that you can try and
kill one of us, Mr. Yagari?

Regrettably, my execution list
is completely empty right now.

But if you find my lecture
boring and you fall asleep,

I may very well add
your name to it.

that to Lord Kaname?

careful, Teacher.

You know, I think I'll just keep
this as a memento from the time

like you can do for him now.

But if you still insist on
seeing him, go right ahead.

staying in this room

just because that
guy told you to?

Zero, there's no
lock on this door,

160
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,240
so why don't you just leave?

hunters for many generations.

00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:20,206
Even my parents were
vampire hunters.

166
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,206
When I was a kid, there would
be long stretches of time

167
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,906
when my parents would go away.

168
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,840
That man would look
after my brother and me

169
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:29,006
as both our teacher
and our guardian.

170
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,773
And that was when
it happened, when

171
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:36,040
I saw what they call a Level
E vampire for the first time.

172
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:38,006
The head nurse at
our grade school

173
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,840
was a kind and beautiful woman.

174
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:46,340
But in truth, she was a vampire
that was formerly a human.

175
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,873
One day, she
suddenly transformed

176
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,740
into a ferocious vampire
right in front of us.

177
00:11:53,673 --> 00:11:54,873
-No, don't!

178
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:56,273
She's a good person.

179
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:57,640
She doesn't deserve this!

180
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:58,206
-Aargh!

181
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:08,240
-At that moment, even
when her neck was smashed,

182
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:12,206
she continued to bare her fangs
until the moment she died.

183
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,606
And I became afraid of vampires
for the first time ever.

184
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,273
My master risked his life
to teach me that lesson.

185
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:25,140
And so if he says that he
has to kill me, then I--

186
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,373
-No!

187
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:28,406
The truth is, the only
thing you're doing right now

188
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,940
is choosing to hide in this
room and give up on yourself!

189
00:12:31,973 --> 00:12:34,573
You're the one who made
me take that gun even

190
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:35,940
though I said I didn't want it.

191
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,806
So don't run away from me!

192
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,373
Let me in.

193
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:53,440
-Yuki, what are you--

194
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,073
-No one will notice us in here.

195
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:00,640
Let's continue where
we left off last night.

196
00:13:00,673 --> 00:13:01,140
-Uhh.

197
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:12,640
-Since Yuki has
such a kind heart--

198
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:18,740
-I realize now that this is the
only thing I can do for you.

199
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:23,373
-Yuki, what are you saying?

200
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,606
-This is the best way.

201
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,906
Zero, drink my blood.

202
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,773
You'll feel better, even
if only for a little while.

203
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:42,740
-Please don't.

204
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:43,606
I can't.

205
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,340
I would never forgive myself.

206
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,440
-Yes, I know.

207
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:57,706
-[gasping]

208
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,673
-I'm sorry, Zero.

209
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:06,273
We'll do the most
forbidden act of all.

210
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,973
LITTLE GIRL (VOICEOVER): Scared.

211
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:21,406
I'm scared.

212
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,206
That vampire is going to eat me.

213
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,706
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I'm afraid.

214
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:46,606
-Zero, are you all right?

215
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,673
-This being I've
become is despicable.

216
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:58,106
Even if I loathe vampires, even
if I don't want to hurt anyone,

217
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,940
I can't stop myself
from lusting for blood.

218
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:07,006
Yuki, just give up on me.

219
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,506
You know it, too.

220
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,506
This is just like
the blood tablets.

221
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,040
This doesn't solve anything.

222
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:15,306
It's simply a temporary measure.

223
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,373
Please!

224
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:18,606
Before I acquire a
taste for your blood.

225
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,240
-Just give up on you?

226
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:21,873
How could you ask me to do that?

227
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:23,273
I made a promise to you.

228
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:24,773
And I'll keep it,
no matter what.

229
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:27,806
I promised you that
I would stop you.

230
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,740
And I don't care if you refuse
or even if you hate me, Zero.

231
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:35,173
I will tame the beast in you
as many times as necessary.

232
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:36,573
You are not a Level E!

233
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,773
And I'm not going
to let you die!

234
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:42,606
If you want, you can hate
me along with the vampires!

235
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,540
But the one thing
I won't let you do

236
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:48,406
is give up on everything!

237
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,540
-How could I ever hate you?

238
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:51,040
-Huh?

239
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:55,940
-Are you all right?

240
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:57,873
-Huh?

241
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:00,373
-Uh, yeah, I feel fine.

242
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,473
I don't even think I
feel faint this time.

243
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:03,373
Don't worry about me.

244
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:05,006
I'm fine, as usual.

245
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,340
And I won't have any problems
going to school tomorrow

246
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:09,940
either.

247
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:12,173
Nothing has changed, Zero.

248
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:14,740
And tomorrow, come
back to class.

249
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,573
Do it for me, please.

250
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:17,806
Do it for both of us!

251
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,473
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Both of us
understand, but neither of us

252
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:25,606
will say it.

253
00:16:28,873 --> 00:16:33,573
It's a sin to keep a
vampire alive by offering

254
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:37,373
my own blood as bait.

255
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:41,740
We are doing
something forbidden.

256
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:44,473
No one must find out about this.

257
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,940
-So what have you been
doing this evening, Yuki?

258
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:51,473
-Uh, why isn't Night Class
in session right now?

259
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:52,540
-They're finished.

260
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,506
I sent everyone
back to the dorm.

261
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,873
I have business with
the headmaster now.

262
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:57,573
-Oh, I see.

263
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,706
-The ends of your
hair, they're wet.

264

Of course, he knows.

267
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,406
He realizes what's happened.

268
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,940
Don't look.

269
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,706
Don't look at Zero's
bite marks, please.

270

-Kaname, what are you--

271
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:26,640
-When did this happen to us?

272
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:29,806
Just when did you stop talking
to me about everything, Yuki?

273
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,306
-Uhh.

274
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,640
-I hope that what
you're trying to protect

275
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:38,506
doesn't end up only
causing you more pain.

276
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,273
You should go to bed now, Yuki.

myself I would never

279
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:48,173
regret what I did for Zero.

280
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:51,440
But what I don't
understand is why

281
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:54,340
that makes my
heart hurt so much.

MALE SPEAKER: A vampire that
gently holds a young girl, huh?

283
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:06,740
I don't really give
a damn why you've

284
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:10,373
chosen to give that
girl special treatment.

285
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:13,873
But no matter what your
feelings for her are, of course,

286
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,473
you realize what she's done.

287
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:21,140
And I bet, inside, you're
burning with rage right now.

288
00:18:21,173 --> 00:18:24,340
Yet somehow, you still behave
like a perfect honor student.

289
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:26,506
And I don't like it.

290
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,640
Well, what's your motive?

291
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:30,540
Why won't you tear
Zero to shreds?

292
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,773
-It's so that I
won't lose my girl.

293
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:42,273
-Hm.

I want to know that
you're all right, Zero.

-Why are the curtains
still closed?

299
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,140
So how's your right shoulder?

I know it just grazed you.

But a vampire gun can
do a lot of damage.

302

Although vampires heal quickly,
it will take quite some time.

That is, unless you drink the
blood from a living human.

remember that day?

make me regret losing my
eye to save your life.

That was a solemn oath
you made to me that day

and promised you
would always uphold.

00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:35,440
only wants to take
the easy way out.

325
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:38,340
Struggle till you
can struggle no more.

326
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:44,540
It's your life, even if it
will be covered in blood.

327
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:46,573
Don't run away, Zero.

328
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:51,873
Now, girl--

329
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:53,740
-What-- what do
you want from me?

330
00:20:53,773 --> 00:20:57,640
-If he starts going berserk
again, I want you to stop him.

331
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,006
But you'll get hurt if
you treat him gently.

332
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,706
Listen, he won't stop unless
you put a bullet in him.

333
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,973
Otherwise, he's just
going to keep coming.

334
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:07,540
A bullet is probably
the best thing for him.

335
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:11,140
What you choose to do
after that is up to you.

336
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:14,273
-So then you shot Zero
at the pool because you--

337
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,106
-I could have taken him in
one shot, if I wanted it.

338
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,206
I wouldn't miss at that range.

339
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,440
Are you kidding?

340
00:21:20,473 --> 00:21:22,673
Wouldn't happen.

341
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:28,173
Zero, that woman, seems
she's still alive.

342
00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:29,140
[gasps]

343
00:21:33,173 --> 00:21:35,640
YUKI (VOICEOVER): That woman?

344
00:21:35,673 --> 00:21:37,040
Uh.

345
00:21:37,073 --> 00:21:37,573
-Uhh.

346
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:45,606
-Zero, I really thought
you were going to die.

347
00:21:52,173 --> 00:22:02,373
-Yuki, hmm.

348
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,973
Stop crying, OK?

349
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:08,740
I promise, I won't
run away anymore.

350
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:12,606
-[sobs]

351
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,373
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I will
not regret my decision.

352
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,891
