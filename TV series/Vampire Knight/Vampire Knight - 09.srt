I hope you grow up quickly
by feeding off your hatred.

You do want to
kill me, don't you?

I hope to always
keep you in my sight.

this Academy scares me a bit.

I know that's hard
to believe, but I'm

afraid the other
vampires aren't going

to accept someone
as frail as I am.

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,727
Frowning like that will
only give you wrinkles.

168
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,360
-You know what, mind
your own business!

169
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:40,693
[foot steps]

170
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:43,293
-Hey-- Hanabusa.

171
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:46,260
[door slamming]

172
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:51,560
-Zero.

173
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:58,160
-Stop standing around!

174
00:09:58,193 --> 00:09:59,527
You're still on duty!

175
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,793
-Hey, what is your--

176
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:04,393
YUKI: By the way, the Headmaster
gave me some good news.

177
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:06,027
Remember that girl
you saved yesterday?

178
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,127
Well, they were able to erase
the whole event from memory,

179
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,860
and she's doing just fine now.

180
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,160
Isn't that a huge relief?

181
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:14,827
-Not really.

182
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,793
I didn't agree to go out
and hunt down that Level

183
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:19,260
E just so that I could
save somebody else.

184
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:23,027
What I wanted had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

185
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,327
It was just work.

186
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,527
-A duty of a hunter.

187
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,793
-Well, if that's the
way you feel, Zero,

188
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,727
than I guess that's how it is.

189
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,527
But it seems to me you're only
interested in doing whatever it

190
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,927
is you want to do. .

191
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,593
I mean, that's how you
act toward your studies.

192
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:42,960
And that's why you went to do
that job by yourself, isn't it?

193
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:45,893
Hunting a vampire is
a pretty big deal.

194
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:47,427
So when you suddenly
leave campus

195
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,260
to do something like that
without telling anyone,

196
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:52,493
who do you think
worries the most?

197
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,960
For a second there, I
thought you'd run away.

198
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:59,160
It's just that--
I'm afraid someday

199
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,727
you'll decide to take your
revenge on that vampire who

200
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,460
killed your family and not
tell me anything when you do.

201
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:07,493
-If I wanted to do that,
I have no obligation

202
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:08,560
to tell you about it.

203
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:12,660
YUKI: Yes, you do.

204
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:16,927
If you lose control, it's my
job to kill you, isn't it?

205
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,593
You gave me a gun for
that very purpose.

206
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:23,027
It's in my desk drawer right
now, ready and waiting,

207
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,993
to remind me of the
promise I made to you.

208
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:28,260
-That's true.

209
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:30,560
I guess you'll have trouble
keeping your promise if I

210
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:33,660
go and disappear
without telling you.

211
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,493
But this means you're assuming
I'll be beaten at my own game,

212
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:37,760
doesn't it?

213
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:38,993
That's kind of rude.

214
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:42,060
-Don't you accuse
me of being rude!

215
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:44,593
But I do believe in you, K?

216
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:45,827
-That hurt.

217
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,827
(COUGHING) Huh?

218
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,660
-Oh, hey Maria.

219
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:03,393
Something wrong?

220
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:06,893
-I think I may have taken
my little prank too far.

221
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,660
Everyone hates me now.

222
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:10,827
-Zero?

223
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,227
What are you--

224
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,060
[chain rattling]

225
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:26,128
YUKI: No!

226
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:30,241
-You pulled that gun
on her for no reason.

227
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:32,641
Why would you do that?

228
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:33,141
-No!

229
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:40,008
ZERO: Who-- are you?

230
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,908
-How do you do?

231
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:43,375
I'm Maria Kurenai.

232
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:47,941
-I' sorry if he
scared you, Maria.

233
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,408
He's a guardian here at
the Academy like I am.

234
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:51,708
His name is Zero.

235
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:52,808
He's my partner.

236
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:56,508
But he generally doesn't
take things this far.

237
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,108
Well, not usually.

238
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:02,008
-Yes, but I shouldn't be
wandering the grounds so late

239
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:02,575
at night.

240
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:03,808
I apologize.

241
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:08,475
And-- thank you so much
for protecting me, Yuki.

242
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:09,708
You're nice.

243
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:11,541
I like girls like you.

244
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:13,908
You see, good girls
like you happens

245
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:17,375
to taste especially
delicious, Yuki.

246
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:19,875
(LAUGHING) Now, don't fight!

247
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,475
[girls talking loudly]

248
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:27,075
YUKI: It's time for
the day class students

249
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:28,275
to return to their dorms!

250
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,341
-Oh no.

251
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,875
This is worse than
Saint Chocolatal's Day.

252
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:35,441
-What's this?

253
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:38,475
"Will you please ask me
to be your dance partner?

254
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:39,541
Thank you."

255
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:41,875
-Well, I'll pass.

256
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,908
You can have it, Rima.

257
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:45,208
-Huh?

258
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,841
-I heard from that others
that you're a model, Senri.

259
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,941
(GIGGLING) You're quite popular.

260
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,908
-Hey.

261
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:55,108
-Oh, sorry.

262
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,075
[giggling]

[door opening and closing]

264
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,875
TEACHER: Why aren't
you all in your seats?

265
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,775
Class has already begun.

266
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,808
This isn't a day care, you know.

267
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:14,275
-Now, let's begin.

268
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:17,775
[music playing]

269
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:29,641
[knocking]

270
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:30,808
TAKUMA: Kaname?

271
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:32,575
-Come in.

272
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:33,941
-Sorry.

273
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:36,608
But Maria here says that she
can't sleep well in our dorms

274
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,675
because she's too nervous.

275
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:42,408
MARIA: If I could, I'd like
to leave the dorm for a while.

276
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:44,275
To keep things peaceful
in the night class.

277
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:45,941
I heard there was
a building used

278
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,541
as a temporary dorm for the

279
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:48,741
night class in the beginning.

280
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:52,575
If possible, I'd
like to stay there.

281
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,641
-Very well.

282
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,975
I will speak to the
Headmaster about it.

283
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:56,741
-Huh?

284
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,108
You're allowing it?

285
00:14:58,141 --> 00:14:59,575
-I'm so happy!

286
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,575
Thank you so much!

287
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,341
-It seems Maria Kurenai
transferred here officially

288
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,241
and took the same vows we did.

289
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:10,975
Other than that, it says she was
born with a weak constitution,

290
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:13,641
and she's never
attended a soiree.

291
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:16,308
That's about it.

292
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:19,175
There's nothing particularly
strange about her.

293
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,841
Well, other than the
fact that she's fearless.

294
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:27,975
-Hey, Akatsuki-- did you happen
to meet that woman before?

295
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:29,708
-What woman?

296
00:15:29,741 --> 00:15:31,841
-The Pureblood
vampire whose lineage

297
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,975
is on par with the Kuran family.

298
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:36,308
She disappeared
after going crazy.

299
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:38,841
Her name is Shizuka Hio.

300
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,975
-She went missing after the
incident involving the Kiryus.

301
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,408
Some say she died after that.

302
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:48,108
But, no, I've never met her.

303
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:50,475
Is there a reason you're asking?

304
00:15:50,508 --> 00:15:51,341
-No.

305
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,308
It's nothing.

306
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:55,141
All right, let's stop.

307
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:57,841
Talking about that
woman is unlucky.

308
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,241
[wind blowing]

309
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:01,708
GIRL: You seem tired, Yuki.

310
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,975
YUKI: Well, it's getting
harder to control the fan

311
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:05,575
girls outside.

312
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,475
Right, Zero?

313
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:07,908
-Huh?

314
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:09,641
Yeah.

315
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:12,541
-That's because it's
almost time for the ball.

316
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:15,275
YUKI: Yes, but I'm more worried
about the upcoming school

317
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,675
exams than the ball.

318
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,408
BOY: And you're the
problem, Yuki Cross!

319
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,908
The ball is a Cross
Academy tradition.

320
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,408
And the class which scores
the lowest on the exams

321
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:29,908
is the class who has to
work the ball that year!

322
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:30,908
YUKI: Huh?

323
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:32,608
-I am very worried, Yuki.

324
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:35,041
You alone are the one
responsible for bringing down

325
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:37,408
our class average
every single year.

326
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:40,975
-You realize that's a rather
mean way to put it, class rep.

327
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:43,341
-The ball is a
precious official event

00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,375
in which both the day class
and the night class attend.

329
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:49,775
And if I don't get a chance
to dance with Ruka this year--

330
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,975
(GROANING) I'll hold a
grudge against you for life!

331
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,341
-Oh no!

332
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,008
It looks like I'll have to study
as if my life depends on it.

333
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:59,341
If not, then I'm going
to fail for sure!

334
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,441
-Yuki, you can always
ask your father

335
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:05,241
to get a good tutor for you.

336
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,175
Hey, what's wrong?

337
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,841
TAKUMA: You can't go that way!

338
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,141
The day class is
still in session!

339
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:12,075
Oh no.

340
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:14,175
This could get dangerous.

341
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,375
Maria!

342
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:16,608
-Don't worry!

343
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:19,275
I just want to look
at the cafe terrace.

344
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:22,008
(GIGGLING) This is fun.

345
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:26,775
-Hey!

346
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:29,041
That's far enough!

347
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:31,275
-What are night class
students doing out here?

348
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:36,241
-Stay away from that
transfer student.

349
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:40,008
The Vice Dorm President can
handle her on his own, K?

350
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,775
-Zero?

351
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:43,041
OK.

352
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:43,508
-Yuki.

353
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:47,741
Good afternoon.

354
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,741
This is the second time
we've met during the day.

355
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:53,041
GIRL: Aido is here!

356
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:53,708
-Aido!

357
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:54,841
What are you doing?

358
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,675
[girls screaming]

359
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,375
GIRL: No!

360
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,075
Now he's hugging her!

361
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:00,175
-The jealous girls
will go mad with envy,

362
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,408
and bully you from
now on, Yuki Cross.

363
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:04,608
-Huh?

364
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:06,808
ZERO: Hanabusa.

365
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:11,841
If you have a moment, I'd
like to have a word with you.

366
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,308
-Oh, all right.

367
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:16,008
I actually wanted
to talk to you, too.

368
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:16,475
-Huh?

369
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:18,375
Hey, Zero?

370
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:22,541
-Yuki, be careful
around Maria Kurenai.

371
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:25,175
-And don't you two go
getting into a fight either!

372
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,441
-I'm worried.

373
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:28,575
-Oh, he'll be OK.

374
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,675
I think.

375
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:34,975
-No, I'm worried about you.

376
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:36,675
[girls yelling]

377
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,375
-GIRL: All right,
disciplinary committee,

378
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,608
you need to explain yourself.

379
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:43,741
[girls running and yelling]

380
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:52,841
-It looks like you're having
a hard time being chased, too.

381
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,875
-Ichijo.

382
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:54,975
Where's Maria?

383
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,508
Did you ever catch her?

384
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,941
-Well, it seems that while the
day class girls were chasing

385
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:01,808
me, she managed to slip away.

386
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:04,675
And I haven't seen her since.

387
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,341
-You have a hard job being
the Vice Dorm President,

388
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,608
having to deal with
things like this.

389
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:13,341
-(LAUGHING) Well,
I, uh-- you see,

390
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,941
I think if Kaname were to ask
everyone in the night class

391
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:18,275
to bear the same
responsibilities as me,

392
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:20,575
then they would
probably do it, too.

393
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:23,708
A Pureblood vampire
has countless powers.

394
00:19:23,741 --> 00:19:26,208
One of those abilities is
to make other vampires who

395
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,475
aren't pureblood obey them.

396
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:31,041
But even though Kaname
may seem a little pompous,

397
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:34,975
he refuses to use his
power in that way.

398
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,641
So that's why when
it's needed, I

399
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,708
offer to take on
tasks of this nature.

400
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:41,075
-That's so nice of you.

401
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:44,908
-Hm.

402
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,275
It seems that when
you're with me,

403
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:49,508
the girls are all too scared
to come any closer than this.

404
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,075
That's rather convenient.

405
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,508
But a bit lonely.

406
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,575
So?

407
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,241
-I want to know something.

408
00:19:57,275 --> 00:20:01,441
Is Maria Kurenai somehow
related to that woman?

409
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:03,608
-That woman?

410
00:20:03,641 --> 00:20:04,175
-Shizuka Hio.

411
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,141
-Such insolence.

412
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,041
You do realize you just
referred to a Pureblood

413
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:15,841
without using the
proper honorific.

414
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,241
But I understand.

415
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:22,375
After all, she is the one
who butchered your family.

416
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:23,941
All right.

417
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:27,375
The Kurenai and Hio lines
had a shared ancestry a long,

418
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:28,541
long time ago.

419
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:29,908
But that's it.

420
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:32,141
-One more question .

421
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:35,041
No one has been able to track
that woman down for four years.

422
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:36,941
And that's because her
appearance has changed,

423
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:38,941
hasn't it?

424
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:41,575
-I don't know
anything about that.

425
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:47,241
Only Purebloods themselves know
all the powers they possess.

426
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:51,875
But what's more important
is what you sense about her.

427
00:20:51,908 --> 00:20:54,908
And I want to hear
that from you.

428
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:56,475
-Why is that?

429
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:59,708
-So as to keep peace
in the night class?

430
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:01,508
-Don't joke.

431
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,208
-You are the only
one who would know.

432
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:08,808
Because you have a
blood bond with her.

433
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:22,575
TAKUMA: Kaname, what's to
be done with that transfer

434
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:24,541
student?

435
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,441
-Well, I suppose you can
take care of her, Takuma.

436
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:28,808
-Huh?

437
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:32,408
-It'd be a problem if I
were to do anything openly.

438
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:37,208
This Academy has all the pieces
that she desires in one place.

439
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:38,641
-Pieces?

440
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:41,741
Well, I suppose that is
a good way of putting it.

441
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:46,675
But, is it a coincidence
they are all here?

442
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,475
-No.

443
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:51,908
I arranged things this way.

444
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:54,708
MARIA: Looking at me
with those sad eyes.

445
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:56,675
Zero is so cute.

446
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,908
-You realize jealousy
doesn't suit you at all.

447
00:22:17,975 --> 00:22:21,708
-(LAUGHING) This is so much fun.

448
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:34,351
