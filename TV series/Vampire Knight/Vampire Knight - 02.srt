who want to peacefully coexist.

children of such vampires.

But Zero never said a word.

-Kaname!

332
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:46,191
It was on the ground.

333
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:47,691
YUKI: Zero!

334
00:15:47,724 --> 00:15:48,724
-Glad to accept it.

335
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:51,024
Thank you, Yuki.

336
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:52,957
-Uh, yes, sure!

337
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:57,457
Ooh!

338
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,657
Why did you give it to
him without asking me?

339
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,224
You were so angry about it, too!

340
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:02,057
-I was watching you.

341
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,191
It got me so irritated.

342
00:16:03,224 --> 00:16:04,924
Why didn't you hand
it to him yourself?

343
00:16:04,957 --> 00:16:05,791
Ouch!

344
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:07,057
-I didn't know what to do.

345
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,357
I thought it might be
awkward if I gave him a gift.

346
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:11,357
-Why would you think that?

347
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:14,124
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Because
he's so different from me.

350

YUKI (VOICEOVER): 10 years
ago, Kaname did something huge.

351
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,324
He saved my life.

352
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,791
But I don't know.

353
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,657
Maybe that was no
big deal to him.

354
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:37,491
To him, it must have
been a small incident.

355
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:38,724
-Lord Kaname.

356
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:40,924
Those must be a bother.

357
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:42,624
May I hold them?

358
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:45,457
-You can have them
all if you want.

359
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:47,091
This is the only one I want.

360
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,324
-All right!

361
00:16:54,357 --> 00:16:56,524
Now, it's back to patrol, Zero!

362
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,824
Uh, Zero?

Whoever's hiding
there, show yourself!

00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:14,224
-Oh, um, it's just me.

366
00:17:14,257 --> 00:17:16,591
I wanted to thank
you for yesterday.

367
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:19,224
So I made you this.

368
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:19,824
ZERO: Go away.

369
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:20,757
-Uh!

370
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,191
Um, but I--

371
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,591
-Just go!

372
00:17:23,624 --> 00:17:26,024
-[gasps] Um, I'm so sorry.

373
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:31,391
-Aw, come on.

374
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:37,824
Don't look at me like that.

375
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:43,124
-Jeez, is Zero
playing hooky again?

-Hm?

00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:53,091
Oh, right.

380
00:17:53,124 --> 00:17:55,124
No one else is here, are they?

381
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,324
I wonder where they went?

382

-[sighs]

383
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:08,057
Hello, Night Class.

384
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:09,524
What do you want?

385
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:13,791
-You know, you're a
little cocky, Zero Kiryu.

386
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:15,391
-You're just a human!

387
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:17,791
And the way you
treat Lord Kaname--

388
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:19,524
-We're really doing this?

389
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,391
-Yeah, but Takuma said
we should leave it alone.

390
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:23,724
-Look, he's right.

391
00:18:23,757 --> 00:18:27,224
Hanabusa, Ruka, if
Lord Kaname finds out,

392
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:28,991
he'll tear you apart.

393
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:29,857
Zero, come on.

394
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:30,891
Just put that thing--

395
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,891
-(IN UNISON) So uncool.

396
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:38,124
-Shut up.

397
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:38,891
-Humph.

398
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:41,257
Interesting.

399
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,891
Come on then, vampires.

400
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:44,824
Go ahead.

401
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,691
I'm in a bad mood anyway.

402
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:47,724
-See?

403
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:51,057
It's that kind of
attitude that makes

404
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:53,424
people think you're cocky.

405
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:57,991
-Well, I did the best I could
to play the good guy here.

406
00:18:58,024 --> 00:18:59,757
I'm not to blame
for what's next.

407
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,691
-Hold it right there!

408
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:08,291
Fighting is forbidden.

409
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:11,357
Didn't any of you read
the Student Handbook?

410
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:14,224
If you refuse to back down, then
as a member of the Disciplinary

411
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:16,257
Committee, you'll have
to come through me first.

412
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:21,757
-Now, that she's here--

413
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,224
-I'm over it.

414
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:26,291
-Yes, the mood is
completely ruined.

415
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:27,324
Let's go back to class.

416
00:19:30,257 --> 00:19:31,957
-What are you doing, Zero?

417
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:33,157
This isn't like you.

418
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:34,157
Why would you do this?

419
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:39,357
Zero?

420
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:43,591

YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero.

It's like his heart
is impenetrable.

424
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:01,391
It's always been like this.

425
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:03,857
And maybe it always will be.

-Oh, found you.

427
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:14,591
What are you doing?

428
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:15,824
You're going to catch a cold.

429
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:19,724
You need to dry yourself
up a little better.

430
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:23,257
Here, you've got to
wear your top, too.

431
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,857
I guess this is something about
you that may never change.

432
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:32,391
You know, I wish you would
talk to me, even a little.

433
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:37,024
Oh, I almost forgot.

434
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:41,191
It's for you.

00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:43,257
It's a chocolate.

436
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,191
And don't say it's like
grade school either.

437
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:46,357
This one's different.

438
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:54,624
This is the only one I
made that turned out right.

439

It's the only one of its
kind in the whole world!

giving it to you.

you ate something awful?

-Well, it seems that
everyone is truly repentant.

00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:57,957
But I have to say it was
pretty gutsy of Zero to take up

453
00:21:57,991 --> 00:22:00,091
Aidou's challenge like he did.

454

Something must really
be eating at that boy.

ago changed his life forever.
