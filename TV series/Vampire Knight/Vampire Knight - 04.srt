Uh, is that you, Kaname?

-You have been reduced to a
bloodthirsty beast, Zero Kiryu.

-You devoured her
mercilessly, didn't you, Zero?

24
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:43,498
So much that she
can't even stand up.

25
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:46,632
How was Yuki's blood?

26
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:47,798
Was it delicious?

KANAME: The bleeding
has finally stopped.

But he bit into
you rather deeply.

-Um.

YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero.

[knocks on door]

-Kaname, would you mind
heading back to class?

39
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:37,298
The smell of blood seems
to have gotten the Night

41

-Yes, of course.

42
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:54,598
-I took Zero to his dorm
room and got him settled.

43
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:57,498
He seems to have
calmed down a bit.

44
00:03:57,532 --> 00:04:00,798
Yuki, finding this out
after all these years

45
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:02,865
must be quite a shock for you.

46
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:05,232
This isn't how I had
hoped to tell you.

47
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:07,665
I'm sorry, Yuki.

48
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:09,098
-Uhh.

49
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:10,465
But how?

50
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:13,198
I never once thought Zero
could possibly be a vampire.

51
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,632
HEADMASTER: Before,
he was a human.

52
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:17,465
-Uh, before?

53
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:19,032
So then--

54
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:20,432
HEADMASTER: When
the Kiryu family

55
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:23,432
was attacked by that
vampire four years ago,

56
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:26,698
his parents and his twin
brother were all killed.

57
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:30,698
Only Zero managed to
survive that attack.

58
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:33,632
But he didn't come out
entirely unscathed.

59
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:36,165
When he was found, they
discovered deep fang marks

60
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:38,065
on his neck.

61
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:39,332
YUKI (VOICEOVER): What?

62
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:40,965
Zero was bitten by a vampire?

63
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:49,198
-So then he changed from
a human into a vampire

64
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:50,665
because he was bitten?

65
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:53,865
-Yuki, I know you think
vampire bites don't really

66
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:55,265
transform humans.

67
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:57,532
To you, it must sound
a bit like folklore.

68
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,098
However, it does happen.

69
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:02,865
There are vampires out
there who can turn humans

70
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:04,598
into their own kind.

71
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:06,098
But just a handful can.

72
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:07,698
And they're known as Purebloods.

73
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:08,198
-Purebloods?

74
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,032
-You don't have to worry, Yuki.

75
00:05:18,065 --> 00:05:22,198
Zero is obviously
not a Pureblood.

76
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:26,265
His bite doesn't have the power
to turn you into a vampire.

77
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:29,432
-So Zero drank my blood.

78
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:38,165
-The smell of blood
earlier, what was the cause?

79
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:41,798
We weren't even given an
explanation for it at all.

80
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:42,998
-[sighs]

81
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:45,232
To be honest, I don't care.

82
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:54,565
-That blood was the
smell of Yuki's blood.

83
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:05,632
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I never knew.

84
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,832
I never knew anything.

85
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:14,065
For four years, Zero had been
suffering all by himself.

86
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:15,965
What was he thinking?

87
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:17,798
He had to feel so alone.

88
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:30,765
Zero.

89
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:37,165
KANAME: So how
long do you intend

90
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:38,432
to keep him in the Day Class?

91
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:43,998
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Kaname?

92
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:48,332
-Well, never before in
the history of this school

93
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:50,465
has a student been
transferred from the Day Class

94
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:51,565
to the Night Class.

95
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,032
-I don't see why that
is even relevant.

96
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:57,398
In this instance, Zero must
be transferred to our class.

97
00:06:57,432 --> 00:06:58,865
You have no choice.

98
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:01,332

put Zero in the Night Class.

I understand what
Kaname is saying.

102
00:07:16,232 --> 00:07:18,532
Now that Zero has
become a vampire,

103
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:21,732
it makes perfect sense for
him to join the Night Class.

104
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:23,798
But how would Zero handle that?

105
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:25,465
He hates vampires
so much, he wants

106
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:29,098
to kill them every
time he sees them!

107
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:34,198
Zero had to have hated himself
for what he was becoming.

108
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:37,832
And I never once-- it was more.

109
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:42,832
It was like a beast
in human form.

110
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:44,832
I can't believe I said that.

111
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,798

-Yeah, I know.

I wasn't paying attention
while doing patrols last night.

And I got scratched

to come so early in the morning.

00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:49,232
BUSINESSMAN: Would you
please hear us out!

168
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:49,765
Oh, whoa!

169
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:55,665
-Aah, it's so bright.

170
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:57,565
And now, I'm tired and cranky.

171
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,765
And it's their fault.

172
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,432
-I'm sorry to
barge in like this.

173
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:04,232
-[yawns]

174
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:06,398
I'm not annoyed
with you, just them.

175
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:07,832
But why are you here?

176
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:09,798
Everyone is still asleep.

177
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:11,532
Ah, I know!

178
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:12,865
You want me to drink your blood.

179
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:13,932
-Um, no thanks.

180
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:16,198
I came because I
wanted to see Kaname.

181
00:10:16,232 --> 00:10:18,865
-Oh, well, follow me.

182
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:23,632
-So then, you're going
to take me to him?

183
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,365
-You're the only one that
Lord Kaname is nice to.

184
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:30,165
The rest of us are just
following his lead.

185
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:33,865
So, Yuki, whose bite
marks are those?

186
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:36,698
-[gasps]

187
00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:37,632
-[chuckles]

188
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:43,698
Last night, out of the
blue, the smell of blood

189
00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:45,398
wafted into our classroom.

190
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:47,665
It was a bit shocking
to all of us.

191
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:49,732
Only I knew whose blood it was.

192
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:53,132
The blood I smelled
was your blood, Yuki.

193
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:56,365
Lord Kaname told us all to
ignore it, which we did.

194
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:58,198
And the excitement died down.

195
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:00,298
-That's what Kaname said?

196
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:01,232
Hm.

197
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:03,698
I didn't realize.

198
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,165
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
He obviously wants

199
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,765
Zero transferred
to the Night Class

200
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,732
because he asked the
Headmaster to do it.

201
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:11,398
But he's keeping the
secret to himself.

202
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:13,865
He's not letting anyone
else know about it.

203
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:14,365
-Hm.

204
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:21,198
-[gasps]

205
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:24,765
-Do you know how
annoying this is, Yuki?

206
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:26,465
Just what are you
to Lord Kaname?

207
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:46,427
YUKI (VOICEOVER): My foot
is frozen to the floor.

208
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:47,961
This is one of
the special powers

209
00:11:47,994 --> 00:11:50,746
only vampire aristocrats have.

210
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,246
-Come on, tell me, Yuki.

211
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,146
He likes you, but why?

212
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,613
-I wouldn't be here today
if it weren't for Kaname.

213
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:04,379
10 years ago, I was
about to be murdered

214
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:05,813
by a bloodthirsty vampire.

215
00:12:05,846 --> 00:12:06,979
And he saved my life.

216
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:09,613
-Well, now, I knew
nothing about that.

217
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,179
So then, if Lord Kaname
is your savior, then

218
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:14,479
the best way for you to
show your gratitude would

219
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:16,646
be to let him drink
every drop of blood

220
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,246
your body has to offer.

221
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,179
-Do what?

222
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:20,779
-Now, I understand.

223
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:23,113
Your blood belongs
to Lord Kaname.

224
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:25,179
But what doesn't make
sense is that bite

225
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:28,779
mark because it's not his.

226
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:31,313
Don't give your blood
to anyone else, Yuki,

227
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:36,279
and that includes me,
because one day, your neck

228
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:39,779
we'll be graced by the lips
of Lord Kaname himself.

229
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:42,879
He's fangs will slowly
pierce your flesh.

230
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:45,046
And when the sound of
him drinking your blood

231
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:48,213
finds its way into
your ears, your body

232
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:49,979
will tremble with ecstasy.

233
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:51,913
-[gasps]

234
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:54,746
-You know, why not offer
yourself to him now?

235
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,679
You should plead with
him to drink your blood.

236
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:57,313
-Ugh!

237
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:58,413
That's enough, OK?

238
00:12:58,446 --> 00:12:59,346
-What?

239
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,446
Did I embarrass you?

240
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:00,946
Hm?

241
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,313
-Aido, stop it!

242
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:08,779
That's enough!

243
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:10,746
Uh!

244
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,713
Huh?

245
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:16,713
-Please stop, Yuki.

246
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:20,213
-Kaname, how did you?

247
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:21,646
-Uh, Lord Kaname.

248
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:25,946
Uhh.

249
00:13:30,746 --> 00:13:32,913
-Did someone ask you to do this?

250
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,913
-No, I was out of line.

251
00:13:34,946 --> 00:13:36,079
I apologize.

252
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:38,546
Will you please forgive
me, Lord Kaname?

253
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:39,513
-Leave.

254
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:40,013
-Yes.

255
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:48,979
-That was entirely uncalled for.

256
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:50,346
I'm sorry, Yuki.

257
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:51,246
-No, no, no.

258
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,679
It's fine.

259
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:53,613
Really.

260
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:55,013
Uh, uhh.

261
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,613
-It's all right, Yuki.

262
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:59,813
All that I ask is that
you just be yourself.

263
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:02,346
You're so different from
all the other people

264
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,079
I have surrounding me.

265
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:06,313
-Uhh.

266
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,146
-Yuki, you're a
warm-hearted girl.

267
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:11,679
And that is
something I treasure.

268
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:13,879
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
I don't know why,

269
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:18,479
but he seems so
lonely right now.

270
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:20,546
-Now then, you should go.

271
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,913
I believe that you
have class right now.

272
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,313
In the future, don't
come here alone.

273
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:28,613
This place is far too dangerous.

274
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:31,013
However, if you do wish
to come here again,

275
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:33,646
I suggest you have
Zero accompany you.

276
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,013
Considering what
he took from you,

277
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:38,113
he owes you at least that much.

278
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:39,246
-That isn't fair to him.

279
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,079
Why are you saying
things like that?

280
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:47,879
KANAME: You really
want to know why?

281
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:51,079
The answer is quite simple.

282
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:52,746
He bit someone I hold dear.

283
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:54,513
And I'm sorry, but
I just can't ignore

284
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:56,846
that you got bitten
by someone else.

285
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,879
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Kaname?

286
00:15:01,613 --> 00:15:02,646
-Hm.

287
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:05,013
Kaname, I came here
today for a reason.

288
00:15:05,046 --> 00:15:06,279
I have a request.

289
00:15:06,313 --> 00:15:07,546
-Hm?

290
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:10,379
-Please don't put Zero
in the Night Class!

291
00:15:10,413 --> 00:15:12,779
-And why not?

292
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:15,913
-Zero has been fighting
this battle all by himself.

293
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:19,713
And for four years, I didn't
know anything about it.

294
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:23,079
I was so close to
him the whole time.

295
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:27,579
And yet I didn't even
see it happening.

296
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:28,813
-You have a kind heart.

297
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,446
But, Yuki, with
this, there's no use

298
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:32,846
beating yourself up over it.

299
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,813
-I should have known!

300
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:35,313
-Huh?

301
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:39,913
-When I found out Zero was a
vampire, I was totally shocked.

302
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:49,046
But then, well, yesterday,
I-- I-- I really hurt Zero.

303
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:56,479
-Yuki, I'm sorry.

304
00:15:56,513 --> 00:15:59,179
If I could, I'd do what you ask.

305
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:01,579
But I'm afraid I can't.

306
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:04,613
Any human who becomes a
vampire will eventually

307
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:05,946
fall to a Level E.

308
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:07,113
-[gasps]

309
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:09,313
-Yuki, Zero cares about you.

310
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:11,446
And it's obvious,
he wouldn't want

311
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:13,413
you to see him in that state.

312
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:21,213
-So that's-- [sobs]

313
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,346
-Listen, I have no
idea why you are

314
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,846
so attached to that
girl, Lord Kaname.

315
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,213
As it is, you're the
only remaining member

316
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:39,479
of the Kuran family.

317
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:42,579
And that girl you care for
lives under the same roof

318
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:45,379
as that vampire hunter
Zero Kiryu does.

319
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:47,479
We're all a little
confused by it.

320
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,813
-You want to know why?

321
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:59,913
That girl is the only thing
that I truly care about.

322
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:01,279
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
Any human who

323
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:06,713
becomes a vampire will
eventually evolve to a Level E.

324
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:09,813
YUKI (VOICEOVER): So is that
what's going to happen to Zero?

325
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:19,513
Seems like Zero is still awake.

326
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:22,546
I haven't seen him all day.

327
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,779
I wonder how he's feeling?

331
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,279
-As a member of the
Disciplinary Committee,

332
00:18:02,313 --> 00:18:03,479
I would like you have this.

333
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:06,179
But use it only when necessary.

334
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:09,546
This gun will have absolutely
no effect on normal humans.

335
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:14,146
But it will do serious
harm to vampires.

336
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:15,346
-Zero!

337
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:16,013
Huh!

338
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:17,279
What are you doing?

339
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:28,979
-Shoot me before I turn into
a Level E. I want to die.

340
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:30,746
And I want you to kill me.

341
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:39,013
You heard it, too.

342
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:44,546
I know you did-- the sound
of me drinking your blood.

343
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:47,979
You can't pretend
like everything's OK.

344
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:51,913
But after going through
something as awful as that--

345
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:55,913
-Zero, listen.

346
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:58,646
-I tried, but I can no
longer control the part of me

347
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,813
that wanted your blood.

348
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:03,379
I'm afraid this is
going to happen again.

349
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:06,979
And when it does, I'll end
up killing that person.

350
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:08,246
So shoot me!

351
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,246
Admit it, you're afraid of
me right now, aren't you?

352
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,113
-I can't do it.

353
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:19,313
I just can't.

354
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:28,379
-Fine.

355
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:29,546
Then leave me alone.

Zero!

360
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:08,979
Look, it's going to be OK.

361
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:30,079
YOUNG YUKI (VOICEOVER): Stop!

362
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:32,013
It's going to be OK.

363
00:20:35,413 --> 00:20:37,779
-Yuki.

364
00:20:37,813 --> 00:20:41,679
-For the past four years,
I've stayed by your side.

365
00:20:41,713 --> 00:20:45,479
And I had absolutely no idea
what you were going through.

366
00:20:45,513 --> 00:20:48,646
I am not afraid of you.

367
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,813
No matter what, I'm still
going to stay by your side.

368
00:20:58,679 --> 00:20:59,146
-Yuki.

369
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,846
-Kaname might never
forgive me for this,

370
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:07,446
but I won't leave you, Zero.

371
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:18,579
-To be honest, I
didn't think you

372
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:23,846
would accept my invitation,
Headmaster Cross.

373
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,546
How is the Kiryu boy these days?

374
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:30,046
I have to think, by know,
he's becoming quite a handful.

375
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,246
-Actually, no.

376
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,413
Kiryu has remained quite stable.

377
00:21:33,446 --> 00:21:38,179
The Hunter Association has
nothing at all to worry about.

378
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,679
I'm disappointed
you assumed there

379
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:41,913
would be a disturbance
at Cross Academy.

380
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:44,346
-I think I'll wait for
someone else's report

381
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:48,613
to determine whether
or not that's true.

382
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:51,113
I've sent him to
check on things.

383
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:53,746
If he senses any
danger at all, he

384
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,646
will show no mercy
towards the person

385
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,079
responsible for
creating such peril.
