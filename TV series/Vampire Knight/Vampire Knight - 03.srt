00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,133
HEADMASTER: Here's
my own Tuna Carpaccio

2
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:10,233
with marinated tomatoes
and a pinch of parsley.

3
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,800
I've also made my Beef
Fillet and vegetables

4
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,733
in a lovely cream sauce.

5
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:17,566
These are all dishes
of my own creation.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,933
My very own!

7
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:21,166
-Are you telling me he called
us here at the crack of dawn

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,933
for this?

9
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:24,033
-Hm-mm.

10
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,500
Yeah, calling it his
very own is a bit much.

11
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,900
-That isn't what I
was talking about.

12
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:29,533
-Huh?

13
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:30,433
What do you mean?

14
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:31,400
HEADMASTER: Say cheese!

15
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:33,966
-Hm?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
-What's with you today?

17
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,933
-Commemorative photo.

18
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:38,266
Today is special.

19
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,733
You'll perform your
duties not as Guardians

20
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:43,766
but as full-fledged members
of the Disciplinary Committee,

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,566
making it a day to commemorate.

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,366
YUKI AND ZERO: Huh?

23
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:53,233
[theme music]

24
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,471
AIDO: Surprise dorm inspection?

25
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:31,538
-Very well, then.

26
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:33,838
Thank you so much, Seiren.

27
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:35,238
-What a pain!

28
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:38,071
There's no predicting what the
headmaster is going to do next.

29
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:39,071
-I don't mind.

30
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,471
It's not like I've
got something here

31
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:42,805
that I don't want them to see.

32
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:43,738
-True.

33
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:45,305
But when it's spur
of the moment,

34
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:47,671
you can see what the norm
for a place is really like.

35
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:50,071
-Do you mean like the pair of
briefs you haven't picked up

36
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:52,071
and are still lying
on the floor, Takuma?

37
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:52,871
-[chuckles]

38
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:54,205
Those are fine.

39
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:56,271
They're made from the finest
silk you can buy and sewn

40
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:58,238
by the best tailor around.

41
00:02:58,271 --> 00:02:59,738
Those briefs could
be left anywhere,

42
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,571
and I still wouldn't
be embarrassed.

43
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,738
-That's not the point.

44
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:05,671
-Hey, Hanabusa.

45
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:08,505
-Hm?

46
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:09,938
What is it Akatsuki?

47
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:13,838
I'm really tired and
over this already.

48
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:18,471
-Hanabusa, I won't tell
anyone, but they go.

49
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:19,138
-What goes?

50
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,205
AKATSUKI: Even junk
can look menacing

51
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,671
when it's all
lined up like this.

52
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:27,438
-Hey!

53
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:28,638
What are you calling junk?

54
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:30,538
Those are my most
precious collection

55
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:33,138
of items that were sacrificed
when our brilliant dorm

56
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,305
president reveals
his amazing powers!

57
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:37,771
-You even got a
fork that he used.

58
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:40,505
Hanabusa, if the dorm
president finds these things--

59
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:41,871
-Humph!

60
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,205
My collection only mirrors the
respect that I have for him.

61
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:46,505
Wait, you want it for
yourself, don't you?

62
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:47,038
Forget it!

63
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:47,871
Uh!

64
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:50,171
-I don't want your crap. [gasps]

65
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:52,471
-Dorm President Kuran.

66
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:55,405
-Aido, I'd like to speak
to you now about our dorm's

67
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:56,905
regulations.

68
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:59,338
It seems that you need
to be reminded of them.

69
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:00,471
-No!

70
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:01,671
It's not what it looks
like, Dorm President.

71
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:03,671
These are just--

72

[glass shatters]

I can add these to
my collection, too.

-These are confiscated.

GIRL: Haah?

78
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,705
What's wrong with those?

79
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:24,905
They're just photos!

80
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:26,871
-I'm guessing they're
taken without permission.

81
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:28,171
And that's not allowed!

82
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:30,538
-You don't understand, Yuki!

83
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,705
BOY: She's right, Yuki.

84

It's you who needs
to understand.

-Uh, what-- the class rep?

86
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:38,638
-You're abusing your position
as a Disciplinary Committee

member!

Walking around these halls
with your nose in the air,

acting all cozy with
the Night Class!

00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:43,771
-Uhh.

91
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,338
-Do you have any idea how
that makes us feel, do you?

92
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:46,771
-Uh!

93
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:49,571
-Confiscated.

YUKI: And confiscated.

-What a haul!

00:05:07,705 --> 00:05:10,271
I understand why they would
want to snap secret photos

00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:12,905
of the Night Class
whenever they can.

-You're from the
Disciplinary Committee.

your lineage is rare
among vampires now.

You're the vampire of
vampires-- a Pureblood vampire.

311
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,223
The powers of your ancestors
have been passed on to you.

And it is for that reason
your existence strikes fear

up this issue in the past.

Regardless, the steps you have
taken are only minimal at best.

Why do you continue to treat
Zero like an ordinary student?

Stay this course, and Zero will
destroy the pacifist ideology

00:19:26,056 --> 00:19:27,390
[sighs]

340
00:19:27,423 --> 00:19:29,523
-You, of all
people, should know.

341
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:32,090
In your day, you saw
many a human life end

342
00:19:32,123 --> 00:19:36,690
in a miserable wretched way
back when you, Kaien Cross,

343
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:38,090
were a vampire hunter.

344
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:39,923
-[sighs]

345
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:41,823
YUKI: You know, I
think I'm finally

346
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:43,790
beginning to
understand what you've

347
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:45,756
been telling me all along.

348
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,956
There definitely are some
bad vampires out there.

349
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,056
I mean, that thing
wasn't even a vampire.

350
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,656
It was like-- it was like
a beast in human form.

351
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,923
-It will happen.

352
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:03,256
Zero's fate is truly horrible.

353
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,823
But it's something
he can't avoid.

354
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:06,723
-Get back!

355
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:08,556
-[gasps]

356
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,456
But-- but why?

357
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,423
Zero?

358
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:15,323
I want to keep talking to you.

359
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:18,490
I want you to open up and
share your thoughts with me.

360
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:20,556
After all, we are both
exactly the same--

361
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,956
-No!

362
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,890
We aren't.

363
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,256
-I'm sorry.

364
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,923
Maybe I've been a bit
self-absorbed lately,

365
00:20:30,956 --> 00:20:32,456
thinking you and
I were struggling

366
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,156
with the same pain and
the same fears, too.

367
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,323
I guess I was only
seeing myself.

368
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:42,190
-No!

369
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:42,690
-Huh!

370
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,456
-Any human who's bitten
by a Pureblood's fangs

371
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,090
and survives--

372

-[gasping]

373
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:54,623
Zero!

374
00:20:58,956 --> 00:20:59,923
---becomes a vampire.

375
00:21:04,423 --> 00:21:05,856
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
What's happening?

376
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:15,256
-Zero, stop.

377
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,223
Stop!

378
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:19,223
No!

379
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:21,956
Uh!

380
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,923
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Eyes with
a blood-colored luster.

381
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:29,056
Fangs protruding
obscenely from his lips.

382
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,090
A beast in human form.

383
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,023
This his true self.

384
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,456
KANAME (VOICEOVER):
A human who is

385
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,256
bitten by a Pureblood will
suffer one of two fates--

386
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,590
die from the loss of blood
or unfavorably surviving

387
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:46,723
and suffering the pain, slowly
transforming into a vampire.

388
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:49,256
Other vampires don't
possess this dark power

389
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,623
that Purebloods have.

390
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:54,156
He was only a human, yet he
resisted the powerful vampire

391
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,890
instincts for four years.

392
00:21:56,923 --> 00:21:59,390
I respect the strength of will.

393
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:01,090
However--

394
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:02,590
-Why did you--

395
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:10,056
-[gasps]

396
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:15,828
Yuki, I-- I'm sorry.

397
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,490
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero.

398
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:19,923
Zero is a vampire!

399
00:22:29,897 --> 00:22:33,397
