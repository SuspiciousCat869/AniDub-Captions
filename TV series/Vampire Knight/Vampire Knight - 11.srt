1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,933
-I thought you
were dead, Ichiru.

2
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:18,633
-So my big brother remembers me.

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,666
Don't look at me like that.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,500
We were so close back
then, weren't we, Zero?

5
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:31,433
-However, If you're interested,
there is a way to save him.

6
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,300
Let's make a deal.

7
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:42,400
I want you to do something
that only you can do.

8
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:46,866
[theme music]

9
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,818
[knocking]

10
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:38,672
-You look awfully pale, Zero.

11
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:41,311
How unsightly.

12
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:45,071
They had such high
hopes for you back then.

13
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:49,637
Now, you can barely resist the
beast that lives within you.

14
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:53,437
In time, that beast will
completely control you.

15
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,837
Soon, you'll lose
all sense of self

16
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,704
and devolve completely
to a level E.

17
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:01,237
-Is that all you wanted to say?

18
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,371
-Not quite.

19
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:04,271
It's been years since
I've seen my other half.

20
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:06,871
I'd hoped that we'd
have a nice long chat.

21
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:10,071
Don't you want to
know about that night?

22
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:21,871
-Hey, she's oga--
If you don't leave,

23
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:24,037
you'll be captured by those
people from the hunter's

24
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:24,537
association.

25
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:34,804
-Maybe, you have known
this all along, Zero.

26
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:39,771
What had grown inside my
heart was a deep darkness.

27
00:03:42,637 --> 00:03:45,704
-Zeto and Ichiru,
a weak body can

28
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:48,571
be fatal to a vampire hunter.

29
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,471
-You're right.

30
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:53,837
-Ultimately, Ichiru won't
be able to stay with Zero,

31
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:58,404
even though they are so close.

32
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:00,771
-Thank you for always
being nice to me.

33
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:05,804
It made me happy to the
point of hating you.

34
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:08,171
-Ichiru.

35
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:10,471
-I know you pitied me.

36
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:13,171
You still don't
understand, do you?

37
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:17,404
What it's like to be born a
twin, always being compared,

38
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,071
pitied.

39
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:20,437
You can't imagine
to know what it

40
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:23,904
feels like to know
you're not wanted.

41
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:27,804
Still, why that woman?

42
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:30,237
Huh, I wonder why.

43
00:04:39,004 --> 00:04:40,804
-We meet again.

44
00:04:40,837 --> 00:04:42,104
-What's the matter?

45
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:44,271
What are you crying for?

46
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:47,904
Did something sad happen?

47
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,471
-What about you?

48
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:50,704
Why are you crying?

49
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:14,871
-This is the room where Zero
suffered all by himself.

50
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:19,737
I have a chance to save Zero.

51
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:21,604
-It's all right, Yuki.

52
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:25,804
All that I ask is that
you just be yourself.

53
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:26,304
-Kaname.

54
00:05:32,637 --> 00:05:35,971
-Well, you see, I
slowly began to realize

55
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,771
that our dear parents
had become people

56
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:41,637
I didn't care for at all.

57
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:49,171
And you, Zero, my favorite,
well, I've always hated you.

58
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:52,271
By the way, you should thank me.

59
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:56,504
I was the one who asked
Shizuka to keep you alive.

60
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:04,304
-So you could make
me suffer, and then

61
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:06,237
kill me by your own hand?

62
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:08,437
-Exactly.

63
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:11,737
Did you suffer having your
fate twisted by Shizuka?

64
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,137
Have you suffered as much as I?

65
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:23,004
Shizuka changed my fate too.

66
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:29,337
All the purebloods are
godlike in their powers.

67
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,271
-You think that woman's godlike?

68
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:32,737
-I'm afraid you
don't know anything

69
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:35,437
at all about Shizuka, Zero.

70
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:37,571
She made a promise
to me and kept it.

71
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:40,104
She promised to make
me healthy and she did.

72
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:47,471
I want to kill you,
but I might forgive you

73
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:50,471
if you come with me.

74
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:55,704
However, you must
agree to serve Shizuka.

75
00:06:55,737 --> 00:06:57,004
-Sorry, no.

76
00:06:57,037 --> 00:07:01,704
Not with somebody like you
who covets becoming a vampire.

77
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:02,637
Are you?

78
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:09,837
-You really don't
understand anything, Zero.

79
00:07:24,137 --> 00:07:25,537
I see.

80
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,837
You're falling to level
E. I won't kill you.

81
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:32,071
I think I'll let
you suffer instead,

82
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:35,004
resent the corruption
coursing through you

83
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,937
and degenerate into
a senseless beast.

84
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:47,537
-Zero!

85
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:49,471
Ichiru.

86
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:51,571
-It's been quite a
long time, master.

87
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:56,704
-Zero.

88
00:07:56,737 --> 00:08:00,171
Are you--

89
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:05,304
-Oh right, you're only
real student was Zero.

90
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:08,037
But I'm not the
same person I was.

91
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,671
Chances are that I could even
hold my own against you now.

92
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:20,937
-Ichiru, stop this.

93
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:23,371
-Why won't you fight?

94
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:26,271
-Regardless of what
you think, I always

95
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:27,604
considered you my student.

96
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:43,571
-Master.

97
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:48,571
Master.

98
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:53,604
-So dramatic.

99
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:57,371
-Ichiru!

100
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:07,037
-Zero.

101
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,671
What happened?

102
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:10,871
-Take care of my master.

103
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:12,404
-Zero, hold on.

104
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:12,904
Zero.

105
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,137
-So, what happened?

106
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:26,904
-It was nothing,
just an accident.

107
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:29,837
I ran into Ichiru.

108
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:32,537
-You mean, that wound is from--

109
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:35,604
-I think that anything
is possible now.

110
00:09:35,637 --> 00:09:38,304
Tell me, do you still
intend to stay a bystander?

111
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:42,504
-Is it curfew already?

112
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:43,637
-Don't you know?

113
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:45,904
During the ball, curfews
are pretty much lifted.

114
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:48,904
Let's finish our work so
we can practice dancing.

115
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:50,304
This is our only
chance this year

116
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:52,004
to dance with the
night class students.

117
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:54,404
-I hope I get to
dance with Aido.

118
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:56,637
-I want Takuma.

119
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:59,837
You there, stop chattering
and get to work right now.

120
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:05,704
Yuki, would you stop
sitting around in a daze?

121
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:07,371
I don't what is wrong with you.

122
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:09,671
I mean, really,
it's because of you

123
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:12,304
that our class has to work
the ball in the first place.

124
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:13,671
Why?

125
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:15,837
From what I heard from when you
turned in your answer sheet,

126
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:17,537
all you'd written on
there was your name.

127
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:23,671
If I can't dance with Ruka,
it will be all your fault!

128
00:10:23,704 --> 00:10:26,671
-Hey, isn't that blood?

129
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:27,771
-Was there a fight?

130
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:30,471
-What happened to Zero?

131
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:30,971
-Zero.

132
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:37,071
Hey, what's going on?

133
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,304
-You seen that transfer
student anywhere?

134
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:41,771
-Zero, you're bleeding.

135
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:42,937
What happened?

136
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:44,337
-It's nothing.

137
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:47,371
I'm all right now.

138
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:51,637
-OK, but you don't look
like you're all right, Zero.

139
00:10:55,937 --> 00:10:59,704
You should just do what
you need to do, Zero.

140
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:00,971
Right here.

141
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:01,471
Go on.

142
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:02,671
Go ahead.

143
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,271
Just don't spill too much, OK?

144
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,771
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero
isn't hesitating like usual.

145
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,304
He's that desperate.

146
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:30,537
-Zero, what does my
blood taste like?

147
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:36,904
-Why do you want to know?

148
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:42,304
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Zero.

149
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:44,004
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER):
Let's make a deal.

150
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:49,671
If you want to save Zero
offer yourself to me,

151
00:11:49,704 --> 00:11:57,522
or give me Kaname
Kuran's corpse as a gift.

152
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:15,902
-You are my faithful servant.

153
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,135
You can't kill me.

154
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:21,035
ICHIRU (VOICEOVER): Resent the
corruption coursing through you

155
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:24,668
and degenerate into
a senseless beast.

156
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,802
ZERO (VOICEOVER): !

157
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:31,902
Only calmed down after
I devoured Yuki's blood.

158
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:32,935
It's disgusting.

159
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:40,635
-Where are you going, Zero?

160
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:42,435
That's not the way
to the ballroom.

161
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:46,702
I wanted to have
a word with you.

162
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:48,668
I need you to really
be on your toes tonight

163
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,035
while guarding the ball, OK?

164
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,302
I'm serious.

165
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:56,068
That's an order from
me, the headmaster.

166
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:09,102
[knocking]

167
00:13:12,068 --> 00:13:15,002
-Yuki, are you ready?

168
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:16,168
What?

169
00:13:16,202 --> 00:13:18,835
You're going to wear
your uniform to the ball?

170
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:20,735
You know that even
as staff, we're

171
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,268
allowed to take turns dancing.

172
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,202
-Yes, but the headmaster has
reminded me of my duties.

173
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:29,402
He asked me to be extra
sharp on security tonight.

174
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:31,035
-What a mean father.

175
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:32,735
He doesn't want you to have fun?

176
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:35,268
-He's not mean, but--

177
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:36,002
-Here.

178
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:38,102
This is for you, Yuki.

179
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:38,968
-Who's it from?

180
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:44,102
It says it's from Kaname.

181
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:52,568
Kaname.

182
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:54,035
I can't believe--

183
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:08,868
-Zero, thank you so much
for working tonight.

184
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:10,535
-Seeing how you told
me it was an order,

185
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:13,202
I really didn't have much
of a choice, now did I?

186
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:17,368
-Oh my, Zero, you're
so scary, and I'd

187
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:19,968
say, as of late, you're
rather moody, too.

188
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:22,435
It's like you've
taken it upon yourself

189
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:26,402
to shoulder anything bad
that goes on around here.

190
00:14:26,435 --> 00:14:30,935
It's not so much an order,
but more of a request really.

191
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:33,702
I want to protect our students
right to a peaceful campus

192
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:35,468
life.

193
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:40,435
And then, as for you, I want you
to enjoy the moment rather than

194
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:44,035
fear a future that
you cannot see.

195
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:44,935
What'd you think?

196
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:48,168
Did I sound cool now or what?

197
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:49,568
YUKI: Oh Zero.

198
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:50,568
-Huh?

199
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:54,402
-I didn't know you
were here already.

200
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,302
-Ah, my sweet Yuki
is all dressed up.

201
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:01,068
Please tell me you'll dance
with Daddy later, my daughter.

202
00:15:01,102 --> 00:15:02,535
-All right, sure.

203
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,502
Later then, a short dance.

204
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:06,368
-Yah.

205
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:08,635
I'll come find you later.

206
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:10,102
-Let's go on in.

207
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:12,602
We're on duty and we
should take it seriously,

208
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:15,468
but we should also have fun too.

209
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:16,668
-Really?

210
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:18,068
I thought you told me you
weren't looking forward

211
00:15:18,102 --> 00:15:19,702
to the ball.

212
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:20,635
-I wasn't.

213
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:22,102
Come on, let's get to work.

214
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:32,835
This looks good.

215
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:37,302
Seems like everything's under
control and running smoothly.

216
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,335
Come here, Zero.

217
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:44,035
A guy should wear his clothes
properly, at least for tonight.

218
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,168
What now?

219
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:48,968
No arguing, disciplinary
committee member.

220
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:50,802
Good.

221
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:56,135
And now, a rose in the
pocket for the men.

222
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:57,168
There.

223
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:59,102
You'd look so good
if you only smiled.

224
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:04,802
-I don't get it.

225
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:09,368
How can you keep on
smiling like that?

226
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:13,702
-Well, that's because
I-- because what I want

227
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:15,502
is for you to smile too, Zero.

228
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:22,802
-This way, please.

229
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:33,835
-Um, excuse me, Akatsuki,
I was looking for Kaname

230
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:34,635
but didn't see him.

231
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:36,268
Is he here?

232
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:39,602
-I believe the dorm president is
alone on the terrace right now.

233
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:43,435
-Great, thank you so much.

234
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:44,268
-What?

235
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:45,602
You didn't want me to tell her?

236
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:48,068
-It's fine.

237
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:49,535
-Ruka.

238
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:52,835
Ruka, I finished
up all the work I

239
00:16:52,868 --> 00:16:55,902
had so I could attend the
ball and dance tonight.

240
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:58,468
Would you do me the
privilege of dancing with me?

241
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:02,035
-Do it to promote goodwill,
like the headmaster told us to.

242
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:03,535
-I won't dance with
some strange boy.

243
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:06,868
-Ruka.

244
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:13,568
-Kaname.

245
00:17:13,602 --> 00:17:15,002
-Good evening, Yuki.

246
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,702
I'm happy you wore the dress.

247
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:22,802
-Yes, I just wanted to thank
you for giving me the dress.

248
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:26,535
Thank you very much.

249
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:27,868
-What's wrong, Yuki?

250
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:31,068
Why the strange
look on your face?

251
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:33,268
-Huh?

252
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,602
-Just a joke.

253
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:35,735
You're lovely.

254
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:37,602
That dress suits
you quite nicely.

255
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:44,568
Do me the honor of
dancing with me in return.

256
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,268
-Kaname, why aren't we dancing
in time to the music now?

257
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:14,135
-Because I wasn't
paying attention to it.

258
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:16,968
Let's dance slowly, shall we?

259
00:18:17,002 --> 00:18:18,935
Like we did in the old days.

260
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:20,402
-I remember.

261
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:22,802
YUKI (VOICEOVER):
Back then, I didn't

262
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:28,302
know if I'd ever be able
to dance with him again.

263
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:31,335
It was the time that I'd
just learned the waltz,

264
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:33,168
and I could only
dance it slowly.

265
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:39,235
-Yuki.

266
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:40,302
-This is cruel.

267
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:42,635
When will you stop
treating me like a child?

268
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,668
-That was never my intention.

269
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:46,235
-Oh, really?

270
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:48,335
The tell me why the
other night when

271
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:50,735
you put me to sleep, Kaname,
you erased all my memories

272
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:52,202
from that evening?

273
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:54,302
You took me away
from that place,

274
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,668
as if-- as if you
were trying to stop

275
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,768
a small child from
meddling in things.

276
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:01,068
-That's not it.

277
00:19:04,002 --> 00:19:06,602
I don't think of you as a child.

278
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:09,635
I only wanted to protect you.

279
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:12,902
I thought that it was
the best thing to do.

280
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:23,768
-And where have you been?

281
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:26,002
-Have you seen that
transfer student?

282
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:27,202
-No, not yet.

283
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:28,535
I don't think she's here.

284
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,035
-Do you have a minute?

285
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:36,035
-Zero?

286
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:44,902
SHIZUKA (VOICEOVER):
Yuki, let's make a deal.

287
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:53,768
If you want to save Zero,
kill Kaname Kuran for me.

288
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:57,802
Kaname Kuran only let's his
guard down in front of you.

289
00:19:57,835 --> 00:20:00,902
It's something only you can do.

290
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:03,268
But, if you don't
want to do that--

291
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:10,002
KANAME (VOICEOVER): All that I
is that you just be yourself.

292
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:15,535
-I'm so sorry.

293
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:23,868
YUKI (VOICEOVER): I have no idea
why she wants Kaname's life,

294
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:27,768
but my choice is made.

295
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:30,702
-Um, will you dance
with me, Zero?

296
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:33,202
-Wow, Shindo is so brave.

297
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:36,702
-I know, it's too bad Zero
always looks so scary.

298
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,602
He's pretty good-looking
if you take a closer look.

299
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:42,002
-After all, you
did rescue me once.

300
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:45,468
Or we-- we could just talk?

301
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:48,702
-I'm sorry, but I can't
dance and I'm busy.

302
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:49,535
Excuse me.

303
00:20:55,402 --> 00:21:00,468
-Kaname, have you seen
Yuki around lately?

304
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:03,568
-I told you what your role is.

305
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:05,768
You are to be her shield.

306
00:21:05,802 --> 00:21:07,235
It upsets me that
you've forgotten.

307
00:21:15,468 --> 00:21:16,835
-What is is, Kaname?

308
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:17,735
You lost your temper?

309
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:19,668
What happened?

310
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:23,668
-I want someone to tie me down,
so I don't do anything rash.

311
00:21:29,102 --> 00:21:30,335
-It's cold in here.

312
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:33,102
This must be the place.

313
00:21:33,135 --> 00:21:35,435
-Hm, down here.

314
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:38,002
-Are you going to
believe me now, Akatsuki?

315
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:48,402
-Kuruizaki-hime, she was a Hio.

316
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:52,835
-You're right, she
did cast off her body.

317
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:54,502
-Why would she go
to all that trouble?

318
00:21:57,035 --> 00:22:00,635
-You mustn't go any further.

319
00:22:00,668 --> 00:22:01,635
-Why not?

320
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:04,002
What's going on?

321
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:04,902
Hey!

322

-Let's stop here, Hanabusa.

323
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,402
If Seiren here's and
telling us what to do,

324
00:22:10,435 --> 00:22:13,668
then the dorm president
probably has some sort of plan.

325
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:16,535
Besides, there's
nothing the two of us

326
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,268
can do against a
pureblood anyway.
