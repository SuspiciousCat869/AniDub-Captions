up killing that person.

I'll protect him.

You've simply immobilized
him for a bit.

Yuki, if Zero tries to
bite anyone ever again,

please use that

00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,127
-Why am I here?

171
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,027
You didn't need me.

172
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,694
-Uh, why are you two
outside doing this?

173
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,727
-If you want to know, stop by
the Moon Dormitory tonight.

174
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,127
-Huh?

175
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:12,294
-Then we'll discuss the reason
why we came for that Level E.

176
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:19,427
YUKI (VOICEOVER): Maybe I really
didn't understand anything

177
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,027
about the long
tragic history that

178
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,060
binds humans and
vampires together.

179
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,827
MALE SPEAKER: I knew it.

-[gasps]

181
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:36,494
Zero!

182
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:39,294
You-- you can't stop me.

183
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:41,127
-No, I'll go, too.

184
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,994
-Huh?

185
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:46,360
-I borrowed this anti-vampire
gun from the headmaster.

186
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:47,760
-Why are you
bringing a gun here?

187
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:49,460
The Night Class students
are good people.

188
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:50,560
Put that away.

189
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:51,427
-You've got it wrong.

190
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,127
-Uh?

191
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,794
-If at any time I lose
the human part of me

192
00:10:57,827 --> 00:11:01,594
and go out of control, use this.

193
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,527
-[gasps]

194
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,394
I could never do that.

195
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:07,327
Besides, if I need
to stop you, I

196
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,627
can always use the spell
the headmaster taught me.

197
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,660
-There will come a day when
that spell will not work on me.

198
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:13,460
You know this.

199
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:15,394
You saw that Level E today.

200
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:18,427
That is eventually
what I will become.

201
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,460
When it does, Yuki, I want
you to be the one to kill me.

202
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:31,127
-All right, I'll agree
to what you want.

203
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,794
But the reason is
because I don't

204
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,327
think that day is ever
going to come, Zero.

205
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,327
Humph, I just won't let it.

206
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,894
Zero, you have to
promise me something.

207
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:45,827
Promise me you'll keep
fighting so that I never

208
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,994
have to use this pistol.

209
00:12:00,527 --> 00:12:02,394
-You two are awfully rough.

210
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:05,827
-Why are you here,
Hanabusa, Akatsuki?

211
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,660
-The vice president of our
dorm told us to escort you.

212
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,294
Now, you put that thing away.

213
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:10,960
It's dangerous.

214
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,594
-Welcome to the Moon Dormitory.

215
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:19,094
The two of us will
be your escorts.

216
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,227
Please, after you.

217
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,659
-Look at that.

218
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:45,125
They came.

219
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,559
-But what for?

220
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:49,592
-Put that away.

221
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:54,559
YUKI (VOICEOVER): The true
face of the vampire lives here.

222
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:55,325
AKATSUKI: This way.

223
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:03,259
-[gasps]

224
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,892
-Yuki and Zero, please
make yourselves at home.

225
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:08,759
I'm throwing a little party
tonight for my birthday.

226
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:10,092
Please enjoy yourselves.

227
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,225
YUKI: We came here on business.

228
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,959
I want to know more about
what happened today.

229
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:15,959
-Oh.

230
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:17,359
-I want to know
why you thought it

231
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:19,759
was OK to destroy
that Level E. I mean

232
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,959
he's a vampire,
just like you are!

233
00:13:21,992 --> 00:13:24,459
-Actually, we are
not like them at all.

234
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:25,759
-Huh?

235
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:28,725
-Yuki, you must understand
that the Society of Vampires

236
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:31,559
is ruled entirely by a
few Purebloods and only

237
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:33,159
a handful of aristocrats.

238
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,025
Every student in the
Night Class is at least

239
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:37,059
an aristocrat or higher.

240
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,325
Below us are the
average vampires.

241
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,959
And in the ranks below
them are the vampires

242
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,159
who were once human.

243
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:45,692
-And then there
are those vampires

244
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,225
who don't even
make the rankings.

245
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,059
And they're known as Level E.

246
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:52,192
-Due to a number of
reasons, vampires

247
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:55,725
who began their lives as humans
will slowly lose their sanity,

248
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,325
falling into Level E. The
E standing for the "End."

249
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:02,525
Complete degeneration
and destruction.

250
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,825
We are no way
similar to vampires

251
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:06,925
who are originally human.

252
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,492
Please don't lump
us together again.

253
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:11,259
-Why do you have to
look down on them?

254
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,925
None of them wanted to become
a Level E in the first place.

255
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,525
It was your kind
that made them what--

256
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,759
-Exactly right.

257
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,592
And that's why it is our
duty to keep an eye on them

258
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,925
before they're so consumed
by their thirst for blood,

259
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,925
they'd grab any
human they can find.

260
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,759
MALE SPEAKER: They were
following my orders.

261
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,092
-Huh?

262
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,492
-I did it.

263
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:32,359
I'm the one who told Takuma and
Senri to hunt down the Level E

264
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:33,359
today.

265
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:35,092
-It was you, Kaname?

266
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,692
-Yuki, I'm surprised you would
come to such a dangerous place

267
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:41,659
simply because
Takuma asked you to.

268
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:44,992
-I wanted to find
out for myself.

269
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,392
-[sighs]

270
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:49,559
Did you now?

271
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:52,592
Come over here, Yuki, Zero.

272
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,725
Yuki, sit beside me.

273
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,692
-Huh?

274
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:06,525
-[sighs] It's all right.

275
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:12,259
-I'm fine here.

276
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,425
-Yuki.

277
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:13,925
-OK.

278
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:20,392
-[gasps]

279
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:22,859
-Beside me is the safest
place for you to be.

280
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,559
-You know, actually, I've been
meaning to thank you for the--

281
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:34,625
-To be honest, vampires
that were formerly humans

282
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:37,625
shouldn't really exist at all.

283
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:41,092
But centuries ago, in the
dark annals of history,

284
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,959
lies a time when the battle
between vampires and vampire

285
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:46,059
hunters was most violent.

286
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:50,125
Many humans were forcibly turned
into vampires at that time.

287
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,659
It was done to bolster
our numbers in battle.

288
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,825
Ever since that
wrong was committed,

289
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:57,825
it has been the duty
of the aristocrats

290
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:01,625
to oversee the vampires
who were once human.

291
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,625
And sometimes, that
duty means ending

292
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,292
their lives for
another's safety.

293
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:12,692
-It's the hunter's duty to
kill vampires, not yours.

294
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:15,159
KANAME: Then tell
me, why didn't you

295
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:17,025
kill that Level E when
you had the chance?

296
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:22,825
This must be your
injury from today.

297
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,059
Hold still.

298
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:25,459
I'll ease the pain.

299
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:25,959
-Huh?

300
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:32,259
[gasps]

301
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,159
Kaname.

302
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:38,859
KANAME: Perhaps, Zero,
you sympathize with him.

[group gasping]

304
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:48,759
-It's OK, Seiren.

305
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:49,825
It's my fault.

306
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:52,859
I said something that
I shouldn't have.

307
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:55,259
-How do you point a
gun at Lord Kaname?

308
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,859
Tearing you to shreds right
here wouldn't be enough!

309
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,792
However, I will restrain myself
while attending this academy.

310
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:05,425
I don't want to hinder the
headmaster's pacifist ideology.

311
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,725
But never forget, our
respect for one person

312
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,459
is what keeps us at this school.

313
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:13,025
And he's Lord
Kaname, a Pureblood.

314
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,892
-A Pureblood?

315
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:17,225
Is that true, Kaname?

To tell you the truth,
I guess I've always

00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:40,992
been a little bit afraid of you.

Even now, I'm still
a little bit afraid.

this is my birthday party.

You've all got to celebrate.

I never thought
he'd still be alive.

00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,392
-The girl in the photograph
would be my lovely Yuki.

331
00:18:08,425 --> 00:18:10,325
She's a very good girl.

332
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,125
Yuki and Zero keep an
eye on the Night Class.

333
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,059
-Did you hear?

334
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,892
A Level E wandered
into town today.

335
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:18,559
-So did you do your job?

336
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:19,425
-No.

337
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:20,959
Someone beat me to it.

338
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:23,425
-I wonder who it was-- the
hero who saved the town today.

339
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,025
-Don't play dumb.

340
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:28,492
I know for a fact that it was
done by a Night Class student.

341
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:32,359
They call it their duty, but
they simply enjoy hunting.

342
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:36,092
The only ones to hunt
vampires are vampire hunters

343
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,292
like myself.

344
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,559
-That may very well be.

345
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,425
But it is forbidden
for anyone to kill them

346
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,359
without good reason.

347
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:43,859
What's this all about?

348
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:46,459
What are you doing here anyway?

349
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,392
You're not the type to
blindly follow orders

350
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:50,559
from the Hunter Association.

351
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:52,459
-I made an oath.

352
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:59,259
-The solemn oath that was made
only between the two of us.

353
00:18:59,292 --> 00:18:59,959

YUKI (VOICEOVER): It
doesn't hurt anymore.

Does Kaname really have
the power to do that?

360
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:29,292
He's just so different from me.

361
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:30,559
He's from a different world.

362

The air out here is--

-Sure.

00:19:42,992 --> 00:19:44,659
Hold the key for me, Ichijo.

I'm sorry, but I--

you dance with me?

YUKI (VOICEOVER): I didn't
like that atmosphere.

You're not taking them?
