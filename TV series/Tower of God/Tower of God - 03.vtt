00:11:49.743 --> 00:11:51.912 position:64% line:77% align:start
Princess?
Since you've been hurt,

00:11:51.946 --> 00:11:54.114 position:10% line:83% align:start
you trust nothing
and no one.

00:11:54.148 --> 00:11:56.917 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't do anything without
complete certainty first.

00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:58.285 position:47% line:83% align:start
So?
Why does that matter?

00:11:58.319 --> 00:12:02.223 position:5% line:83% align:start
The world will never wait
for your certainty.

00:12:02.256 --> 00:12:05.793 position:5% line:83% align:start
You need companions who will
open doors without hesitation

00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:08.062 position:5% line:83% align:start
and don't second guess
every choice.

00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:09.163 position:13% line:89% align:start
Furthermore...

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:10.397 position:24% line:89% align:start
Khun, are you okay?

00:12:10.431 --> 00:12:13.467 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't you wish to protect
those innocent eyes

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.369 position:13% line:83% align:start
which don't yet
know doubt?

Rak: Yo, turtles, less talking
and more walking!

00:12:22.843 --> 00:12:24.679 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, Bam,
let's go.

00:12:24.713 --> 00:12:26.080 position:55% line:89% align:start
Oh, okay.

00:12:26.113 --> 00:12:28.550 position:5% line:83% align:start
Wherever this journey
may lead you, take care.

00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:30.217 position:13% line:83% align:start
You seem to be
dragging around

00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:32.820 position:5% line:83% align:start
quite a heavy burden with you,
Khun.

00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:35.089 position:27% line:89% align:start
What an asshole.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.302 position:44% line:71% align:start

beauty sleep!
Shut up, you --

00:12:48.335 --> 00:12:50.605 position:44% line:89% align:start
Don't you say it.

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:52.840 position:13% line:83% align:start
Find the answer in one minute
or else!

00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:56.443 position:44% line:83% align:start
Ahh.
Divination will lead the way.

00:12:56.477 --> 00:12:58.279 position:30% line:83% align:start
Mm.
You've passed the test.

00:12:58.312 --> 00:13:00.649 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let me get this straight.
That clock doesn't measure

00:13:00.682 --> 00:13:01.982 position:24% line:89% align:start
the 10-minute time limit.

00:13:02.016 --> 00:13:03.984 position:41% line:83% align:start
It makes a rotation
in five.

00:13:04.018 --> 00:13:06.755 position:27% line:83% align:start
All the teams that spend
more than five minutes in here

00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:08.856 position:41% line:83% align:start
wound up screaming
their lungs out.

00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:11.025 position:27% line:83% align:start
And that's the only clue
we had.

00:13:11.058 --> 00:13:12.527 position:44% line:83% align:start
I would say that
pretty much told us we better

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.731 position:30% line:83% align:start
open one of those doors
before the five-minute mark.

00:13:16.765 --> 00:13:18.465 position:5% line:89% align:start
Impressive deduction.

00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:19.933 position:55% line:83% align:start
That's kind of
infuriating.

00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:23.170 position:21% line:77% align:start
Right there with you.
And why is that?

00:13:23.203 --> 00:13:27.941 position:33% line:77% align:start
Mr. Neonbag:
As you instructed, I gave
those teams hints to the test,

00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:30.344 position:19% line:83% align:start
but why did you want me
to do it?

[ Chuckles ]

All hail Rak.
He's the great...

00:13:35.382 --> 00:13:37.284 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess I wanted to do
a little experiment

00:13:37.318 --> 00:13:41.155 position:7% line:83% align:start
to see if the hint would hinder
or help them in their trial.

00:13:41.188 --> 00:13:43.023 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's all.

00:13:43.057 --> 00:13:45.159 position:24% line:83% align:start
Can I ask you a question?
Hmm?

00:13:45.192 --> 00:13:47.428 position:50% line:83% align:start
The princess

00:13:47.461 --> 00:13:49.698 position:44% line:77% align:start
I was wondering --
Sorry, but I don't really

00:13:49.731 --> 00:13:51.498 position:5% line:89% align:start
want to talk about it.

00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:54.703 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, yeah. I understand.

00:13:54.736 --> 00:13:56.070 position:50% line:89% align:start
Sorry to ask.

00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:58.238 position:5% line:77% align:start
You know what, Bam?
What is it?

00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:01.810 position:5% line:83% align:start
I hope that one day you get
to see real stars

Are you sure you did a proper
job administering it, Quant?

00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:32.807 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course!
I just figured it'd be better

00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:34.576 position:24% line:83% align:start
to get it over with
quickly.

00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:36.009 position:80% line:83% align:start
And?
So get this.

00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:37.679 position:21% line:83% align:start
I had the great idea
of administering the first

00:14:37.712 --> 00:14:41.816 position:7% line:83% align:start
and second test simultaneously
as an untimed deathmatch.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.017 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm to believe those three
killed all the other

regulars off
in the span of only 30 minutes?

That's pretty much it,
yeah.

00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:49.957 position:21% line:83% align:start

there wasn't an irregular

or a Princess of Jahad
hidden among them?

No.
Or I don't think so.

00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:58.399 position:24% line:83% align:start

administered testing

00:15:00.535 --> 00:15:03.103 position:19% line:83% align:start

both of our heads.

You did? Really?
Indeed.

00:16:45.372 --> 00:16:48.075 position:30% line:83% align:start
You've all been granted
the very exciting opportunity

00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:50.244 position:44% line:83% align:start
of participating
in a bonus test.

00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:52.680 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, uh, no offense,
but taking more tests

00:16:52.714 --> 00:16:55.817 position:5% line:83% align:start
isn't exactly wonderful news
for us -- like at all.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.118 position:58% line:83% align:start
Maybe,
but this is no ordinary test.

00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:00.254 position:58% line:83% align:start
First,
participation is voluntary.

00:17:00.287 --> 00:17:03.357 position:13% line:83% align:start
Declining to participate will
not put you at any disadvantage.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.627 position:35% line:83% align:start
Secondly, if you pass
this optional round,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.696 position:24% line:83% align:start
it will be considered the
equivalent of passing all tests,

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.365 position:24% line:89% align:start
moving your team forward.

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:12.499 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:12.534 --> 00:17:14.268 position:7% line:89% align:start
What? You mean it?

00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:15.937 position:47% line:83% align:start
I mean exactly
what I just said.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.172 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you win, you'll be granted
permission to climb the tower.

00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:20.440 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's quite
an opportunity.

No way we're going
to pass this up.

Man: Yeah, let's do it.

00:17:24.612 --> 00:17:26.581 position:41% line:89% align:start
So then, I take it

00:17:26.614 --> 00:17:30.450 position:35% line:83% align:start
everyone here will be
participating in this challenge?

The next test you'll be playing
is called the Crown Game.

How do we play?

00:17:40.862 --> 00:17:44.264 position:7% line:83% align:start
Simply put, you'll be stealing
a crown from each other.

Five teams will participate
simultaneously,

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.739 position:13% line:83% align:start

into five rounds.

00:17:51.773 --> 00:17:54.709 position:5% line:83% align:start
The goal is to acquire the crown
and hold onto it.

00:17:54.742 --> 00:17:57.077 position:10% line:83% align:start
Whichever member of the team
gets their hands on it

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.681 position:10% line:83% align:start

00:18:04.586 --> 00:18:06.320 position:21% line:83% align:start
the other four teams
will be defeated.

00:18:06.353 --> 00:18:08.756 position:30% line:83% align:start
At that point,
four new teams will enter,

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.490 position:5% line:89% align:start
and the second round will begin.

00:18:10.525 --> 00:18:13.460 position:19% line:83% align:start
The game ends instantly
should the person with the crown

00:18:13.493 --> 00:18:15.495 position:7% line:89% align:start
leave the chair for any reason.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.432 position:7% line:83% align:start
If that happens, all five teams
will be swapped out

00:18:18.465 --> 00:18:20.702 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the game will resume
as originally planned.

00:18:25.339 --> 00:18:26.574 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, in this challenge,

00:18:26.608 --> 00:18:28.576 position:16% line:83% align:start
winning early
will only hurt you.

jumping in because of the risks,

ever having participated.

Impressive.

the first round will now begin.
