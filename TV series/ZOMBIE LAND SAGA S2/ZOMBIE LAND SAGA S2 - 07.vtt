00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.055 position:50% align:center
Owwie! I'm fine,
it's not broken!

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
[AI]
One more time.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:54.349 position:50% align:center
--[MAIMAI] Oof!
--[AI] And again.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
--[MAIMAI] D'oh!
--[AI] Again.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.644 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI]
Fail!

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.562 position:50% align:center
That's enough,
let's call it a day for now.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI]
I don't want to stop!

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
I want to be a real
member of Franchouchou

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.651 position:50% align:center
as soon as possible!

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.825 position:50% align:center
[AI] Make sure to practice
what we did today, okay?

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:14.160 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI]
Right-o! I'll see you tomorrow!

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
[SAKI gasps]
Dude. You're kidding me.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.375 position:50% align:center
[SAKI gasps]
It's in color!

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
Sakura, look,
this thing's in color!

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, that is cool!

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
Does it have Oyajitchi?

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he's there!

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:29.259 position:50% align:center
It's the 20th
anniversary edition!

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
Wicked! I'd be pissed if
he wasn't! Love that guy!

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
You worked really hard today!

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:38.977 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI]
I've got a lot to learn.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] You impressed Ai
with the energy you brought.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:44.482 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI] I just want
everyone to accept me.

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:48.194 position:50% align:center
So, how long have you been
a Franchouchou superfan?

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:51.239 position:50% align:center
Well, I was beginning
to give up on Saga.

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:55.952 position:50% align:center
Then I realized, this place
has a lot of potential.

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.954 position:50% align:center
But nobody knows that!

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
Guess that's just part of
Saga's thing, I figure.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.335 position:50% align:center
Like, if Saga were Fukuoka,
everyone would think of it as

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.420 position:50% align:center
a lively place with
active residents.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:06.921 position:50% align:center
And then, people
would probably care

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:08.465 position:50% align:center
about it a whole lot more!

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Yeah, Saga is
kind of its own thing.

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
Anyway, one day I was
flipping through Sagazine.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
And I was like,
"Whoa! Idols in Saga?"

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:18.516 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.893 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI]
I saw that you were doing a show

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
at the end of the year.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center
Y'liked it that much?

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.422 position:50% align:center
It was totally mindblowing!

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:51.216 position:50% align:center
Oh gosh, thank you.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.009 position:50% align:center
I don't know how to
say it, but I'm amazed

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
at your expression
whenever you sing.

00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
The way you're able to
shine so brightly!

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:58.932 position:50% align:center
It got me thinking
more and more about

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
how I wanted to be just like you

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.352 position:50% align:center
and live a super-cool
life in Saga

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
the same way you
and your friends do!

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
You are just like me.

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.279 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI] But the EFS
show was a real mess.

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:15.573 position:50% align:center
Trust me, we felt it
in the crowd, too.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.575 position:50% align:center
I have never wished
that I could make my voice

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.244 position:50% align:center
ring out louder than
I did that day

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.955 position:50% align:center
watching my favs
up on that stage.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:27.419 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI]
But. When you played Saga Arena,

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:31.131 position:50% align:center
I realized how amazing
you guys truly are!

00:10:31.214 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
You may be zombies, but you're
just as alive as anyone!

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:36.928 position:50% align:center
So, I don't think you
need to worry too much

00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:39.764 position:50% align:center
about makeup and
superficial stuff like that!

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:41.558 position:50% align:center
Because being able to
perform the way you do

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
is loads more special!

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.646 position:50% align:center
I know that I can't
contribute much yet.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:51.026 position:50% align:center
But I am willing to do whatever
I can for Franchouchou!

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.030 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
We'll work hard together!

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI]
Yeah!

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
[CLASS PRESIDENT 7A]
We're pathetic!

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:01.244 position:50% align:center
We put all our heads together
and this is the best we can do?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE 7C] Let's just go
with the beauty pageant again

00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:04.247 position:50% align:center
and be done with it.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50% align:center
But that's a cop-out!

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.126 position:50% align:center
Not that any of these
plans are better!

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.462 position:50% align:center
Can't we eke out
one decent idea--

00:11:10.545 --> 00:11:13.882 position:50% align:center
Ca-ching!

00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
A school festival show?

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
If we get popular with
high-school students,

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:19.846 position:50% align:center
it'll really help
with visibility!

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.390 position:50% align:center
The crowds will be
so crazy! Trust me!

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.309 position:50% align:center
Ei-yah! Chouchou!

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
Ei-yah! Chouchou! See?

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
Ei-yah! Chouchou!

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.523 position:50% align:center
High-schoolers, huh?

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
Sounds like fun!

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.235 position:50% align:center
A worthwhile endeavor,
I would say!

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.029 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:41.659 position:50% align:center
[SAKI] Wipe that stupid smile
off or I will!

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.203 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] The crowd
you girls tend to attract

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
is a hodgepodge of
losers and freaks.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50% align:center
Let's take aim at
the demographic

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center
that'll shape Saga's future.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.669 position:50% align:center
'Kay, what about Maimai?

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.546 position:50% align:center
She can't get through a routine
without hurting herself.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50% align:center
Then get it together quick,
'cause she's the star.

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:58.051 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] This concert marks
the rebirth of Franchouchou

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:03.598 position:50% align:center
as a group of eight,
and the debut of Number Seven!

00:12:03.682 --> 00:12:04.641 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
Do you think you're
ready for this?

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
Huh? As long as my body
doesn't betray me, yes!

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.439 position:50% align:center
Then all you gotta do
is practice your butt off

00:12:11.523 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
until the show!

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
Now let me see your game face!

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
Okay! Come on, mind and body,
please be in sync for once!

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
The new Franchouchou is
gonna rock all their socks off!

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Great! You've got it!

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:47.600 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Awesome!

00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:50.311 position:50% align:center
I see you managed to
remain upright this time.

00:12:50.395 --> 00:12:52.939 position:50% align:center
Two days 'til the show.
That was close!

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:56.860 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Thanks for
supporting me!

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:59.237 position:50% align:center
Hey, this calls for
a group outing!

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.239 position:50% align:center
Let's hit the public bath!

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:02.741 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.576 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI] It's kinda my thing!
I know some great spots--

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
I hate to say it, Maimai,

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
but we're gonna have to
pass on that one.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:10.999 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO]
Not that we don't like baths.

00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.209 position:50% align:center
But they're kinda
a dead giveaway.

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:16.296 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh my gosh!
I'm so sorry, I forgot!

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.131 position:50% align:center
[LILY] It's fine! Actually,
it might be fun to

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
go and check out
your school instead!

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.427 position:50% align:center
Nice! That way we can
take over their turf!

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.304 position:50% align:center
Whoa, chill!

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:27.057 position:50% align:center
I don't have a lot of memories
from high school, actually.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.266 position:50% align:center
Yeah, neither do I.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
I'd be interested to see
how the young people

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
of today spend their youth.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
Great, let's do it!

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
I can get permission
from my teacher!

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
Oh, boy!

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:40.779 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 7A] Hurry up,
the festival's tomorrow!

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.825 position:50% align:center
That was such a drag,
right? [gasps]

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:48.661 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] I'm sorry.
The others kind of took off.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI]
No worries!

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:51.539 position:50% align:center
Everyone's pumped about
the cultural festival tomorrow,

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
so they're sure to run into

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
excited students
wherever they go!

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:58.129 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] You're right, the prep
always was half the fun.

00:13:58.213 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI]
So, what were you like

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:01.257 position:50% align:center
in your high school
days, Sakura?

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Mm... Kinda dead on the inside.

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:05.095 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
Well ya see...

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:08.807 position:50% align:center
Some disappointing
stuff happened.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.851 position:50% align:center
So I had trouble
taking anything seriously.

00:14:11.935 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
Are you saying that
you'd lost all hope?

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Mm-hm.
But then I saw Iron Frill,

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
and I was so inspired by Ai
and the rest of the group

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:23.738 position:50% align:center
that I built up the strength
to keep moving forward!

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center
Around that time,
you could always

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
find me practicing in
a corner of the classroom,

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
so I was super happy
when I found out

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center
they were auditioning
new members!

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] But then I died
before I got to apply.

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
Being a zombie isn't
all bad though.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
Because now I get
another chance.

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:42.340 position:50% align:center
After meeting the
rest of the group,

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center
I feel like I can
take on any challenge!

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:48.054 position:50% align:center
Even an EFS do-over show!

Nobody told you that?

Definitely not!

for you, remember?

do that to yourself again?

Look, I know.

00:15:05.864 --> 00:15:07.907 position:50% align:center
EFS was a total mistake.

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:09.659 position:50% align:center
We ended up in debt
and we couldn't even

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:12.370 position:50% align:center
do idol stuff for
a pretty long time.

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:14.122 position:50% align:center

like that could happen again,

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:20.253 position:50% align:center
but if we're together,
we can face anything!

00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:24.257 position:50% align:center
And I mean, if we ever
gave up trying, that'd be worse.

00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:27.010 position:50% align:center
We'd be wandering lost
with the rest of the dead.

okay there, Maimai?

00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:28.520 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

00:20:28.603 --> 00:20:31.022 position:50% align:center
ever since I had that talk
with Sakura yesterday.

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center
And my mind's made up.

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:34.859 position:50% align:center
I thought I was
the same as you guys

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:37.987 position:50% align:center
despite being alive,
but I was wrong.

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
It's not your cold skin

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
or lack of heartbeat, either.

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
None of you were
alive for very long,

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:44.202 position:50% align:center
but I think each
of you lived out

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.913 position:50% align:center
your short lives with
everything you had.

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.207 position:50% align:center
The reason you shine
so bright is because,

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
even after dying,
you keep rising again.

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:53.169 position:50% align:center
It's like you're
dead-set on living

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:55.588 position:50% align:center
your afterlife to the fullest!

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:58.258 position:50% align:center
I think, if I want to
shine like that,

00:20:58.341 --> 00:21:01.845 position:50% align:center
the first step is making the
most of my life here in Saga.

00:21:01.928 --> 00:21:05.682 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm gonna graduate
from Franchouchou and live!

Here and now, in the Reiwa era!

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
[MAIMAI] Okay! That was
all I wanted to say!

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center

[MAIMAI]
Oh, no!

00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:25.303 position:50% align:center
This entire whirlwind happened
because of a mix-up I caused.

00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:28.390 position:50% align:center
And it led me on
an incredible adventure.

00:22:28.473 --> 00:22:29.683 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
I see.

00:22:29.766 --> 00:22:31.518 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I will keep
everything a secret,

as long as I live!

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:35.689 position:50% align:center

lose my heroes, after all.
