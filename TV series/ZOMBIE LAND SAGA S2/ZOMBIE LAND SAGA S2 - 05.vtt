[SAKURA] Previously on
<i>Zombie Land Saga Revenge</i> ,

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:10.844 position:50% align:center
we were set to open
for Iron Frill,

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:12.929 position:50% align:center
but while we focused
on making a big impact,

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.305 position:50% align:center
Shiori, the leader
of Iron Frill,

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:15.473 position:50% align:center
threw us all for a loop

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:17.475 position:50% align:center
by trying to recruit Ai
to join her group!

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
No way, sister!

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.395 position:50% align:center
Ai's staying with us
and that's all there is to it!

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:21.980 position:50% align:center
We totally nailed
our performance,

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:24.858 position:50% align:center
and then Shiori had the nerve
to declare us rivals on live TV!

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.318 position:50% align:center
If that's how she wants to play
it, then we're game for revenge!

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
Let's go, go, go!

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:32.949 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:38.788 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] Good morning,
my little mudskippers!

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.875 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
Hello, good morning, everyone!

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.464 position:50% align:center
[ALL] Uh. And a good
morning to you, Lily?

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.883 position:50% align:center
I'm happy to see
all your smiling faces.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.801 position:50% align:center
Although, one of you
looks a little bit

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.678 position:50% align:center
on the frowny side today.

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.764 position:50% align:center
Me? This is just
the way my face looks.

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:59.142 position:50% align:center
Speak up, Kotaro!
And remember to enunciate.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.227 position:50% align:center
Enunciate?

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.897 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is her deal?

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.066 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what's up, Lily?

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
Here's the 'sitch.
I wanna shine bright!

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.445 position:50% align:center
Time for me to step up my game.

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:12.155 position:50% align:center
We're already hosting
a radio show,

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.990 position:50% align:center
the Saga Arena
concert was a hit,

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.160 position:50% align:center
and Iron Frill declared us
to be their rivals.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.995 position:50% align:center
You've all been working
hard to take revenge,

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.121 position:50% align:center
which is awesome!

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
But I wanna show up
those girls, too!

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.750 position:50% align:center
I thought if I did
something extra amazing

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
to showcase my magicalness,

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.170 position:50% align:center
it would take Franchouchou
to the next level!

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.422 position:50% align:center
[SAKI chuckles]
For a tiny l'il thing

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.216 position:50% align:center
you've got plenty of moxie.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.677 position:50% align:center
So that's it. I've noticed
that Lily has had

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.262 position:50% align:center
something pressing
on her mind lately.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:37.847 position:50% align:center
She's been plotting.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.974 position:50% align:center
You've got my full support!

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.685 position:50% align:center
Do you have something
fun planned?

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.479 position:50% align:center
You know it! Check this out!

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:46.481 position:50% align:center
For the first time ever,
Franchouchou is gonna

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:48.650 position:50% align:center
move away from the
local Saga TV spotlight

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.319 position:50% align:center
and onto a national
television network program!

00:01:51.403 --> 00:01:53.071 position:50% align:center
Wait, national TV?

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:55.990 position:50% align:center
Now this is what
I'm talkin' about!

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:57.409 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
I'll be entering as a contestant

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.202 position:50% align:center
on Japan's Got Performance!

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.288 position:50% align:center
It's a freestyle-type audition
show where anything goes!

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.165 position:50% align:center
First, competitors from
all over the country

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.584 position:50% align:center
compete in the
regional preliminaries.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.003 position:50% align:center
If you win there,
then you get to enter

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.880 position:50% align:center
the national finals
held in Tokyo!

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.674 position:50% align:center
Franchouchou will
finally have a chance

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:15.260 position:50% align:center
to make our big national
debut on television!

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:16.636 position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.389 position:50% align:center
Lily is an expert when
it comes to this sort of stuff.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.266 position:50% align:center
Yeah! You're gonna win
that thing for sure!

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.767 position:50% align:center
I'm crazy stoked!

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.353 position:50% align:center
So when does the
show start filming?

00:02:25.437 --> 00:02:27.522 position:50% align:center
It's starting right now!

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:31.026 position:50% align:center
[SAKI, TAE cheer]

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.541 position:50% align:center
[LILY] Papa, this'll be
the first time in a while

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
that I'll be on national TV.
Hope you watch!

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.087 position:50% align:center
You can count on us!

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
We're gonna cheer with
everything we've got!

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
Ai, your banner is
looking a little limp.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
You gotta hold it up
like this! With pride!

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.471 position:50% align:center
But we're not even inside yet.

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:25.890 position:50% align:center
It's important that
everybody makes it out!

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.934 position:50% align:center
And then of course
there are the pen lights.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
I know the trick
to get them to work.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
Sakura's a natural.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.274 position:50% align:center
I bet she cheered
like this for Ai.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:37.485 position:50% align:center
She certainly was a
lucky girl with all those fans.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
[COMEDIAN 5A] Oh, wow.
You're one of the girls

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
from Franchouchou, aren't you?

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50% align:center
That Saga Arena
show was intense!

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you!

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.378 position:50% align:center
And hopefully I'll do
a great job tonight, too!

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:59.215 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER 5A] Excusez moi!
Clear a path for the talent.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
Thank you ever so much.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
I'm Light Oozora!

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:10.935 position:50% align:center
I am honored to be performing
alongside each of you today.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
No freakin' way!
The famous child actor?

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.023 position:50% align:center
What a cutie!

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
Never heard of 'im. Who is he?

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:20.362 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. That's boy's
an excellent television actor.

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:21.988 position:50% align:center
Pretty famous, too.

00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
Kind of reminds me of Lily
before she died and came back.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.117 position:50% align:center
[AI] What's a famous
child actor doing

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.244 position:50% align:center
in a regional
competition in Saga?

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey!

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.290 position:50% align:center
You're all members of the idol
group Franchouchou, right?

00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center
You've heard of us?

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
I saw that Iron Frill
called you out as rivals,

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
so you must be amazing onstage!

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
I just knew I'd run into you if
I came to Saga! This is great!

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.514 position:50% align:center
So are you competing
as a team today?

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:50.475 position:50% align:center
Just me. The rest
came by for moral support.

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center
It's a pleasure. Let's have fun!

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
Back at you.
The pleasure is all mine.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.609 position:50% align:center
[LIGHT] What the hell
were you thinking?

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:02.070 position:50% align:center
How dare you put me in
the same room as those peons!

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
They're beneath me!

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
This is not how
you treat a star!

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.158 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry! This is my fault.

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
I'll speak with the stage
manager right away--

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.871 position:50% align:center
[LIGHT]
Not good enough!

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50% align:center
What am I even
paying you for, moron?

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
What the hell is this crap?

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
My social media profile
clearly states that

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50% align:center
I'll only eat the pudding
roll cakes from Semplice!

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.762 position:50% align:center
Saga doesn't have Semplice.

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:30.306 position:50% align:center
Then Saga can kiss my ass!

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
But. I guess that's why I came

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:36.396 position:50% align:center
to this dumb town
in the first place.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
None of these yokels have
enough talent to outperform me.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:40.734 position:50% align:center
Just watch.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
All I have to do
is go on that stage

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:45.155 position:50% align:center
and I'll guarantee myself
a trip to the finals.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
What about that one girl?

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
She's a member of Franchouchou

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.534 position:50% align:center
and they're pretty
hot right now.

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:51.161 position:50% align:center
Ishimura!

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.620 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir?

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
Do you honestly think
I'm worried about

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.793 position:50% align:center
some hick pop group?

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
Did that stupid brain
of yours stop working?

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.715 position:50% align:center
My plan to win is fail-proof.

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:05.759 position:50% align:center
I'll have those judges
in the palm of my hands,

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
crying their eyes out!

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
He is mean!

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the show!

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center
We're on the hunt,
searching high and low

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
for Saga's diamonds
in the rough!

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.691 position:50% align:center
Let's get things started
by welcoming our judges!

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheer]

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:29.074 position:50% align:center
Whoa, dang. This is
way different than local TV!

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
Everything is so glamorous

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
and over-the-top
on the bigger stage.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
Light said all that?

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:38.917 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I mean, like,
he's a total brat!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.252 position:50% align:center
And he's got some
sort of plan to win!

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:43.046 position:50% align:center
The only reason
he came here is because

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
he thinks he's above everyone
so he's sure to move on!

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.634 position:50% align:center
Oh, well!

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.219 position:50% align:center
I'm not worried about him.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna do great!

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
I'm off, wish me luck!

00:08:02.065 --> 00:08:03.483 position:50% align:center
Finally!

00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
We've been waiting on you
to start our cheering section!

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
We got held up. I'm sorry.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50% align:center
[HOST 5A] Please welcome entry
number 13, Kotaro Tatsumi!

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.786 position:50% align:center
So what type of performance

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
do you plan to
share with us today?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
Well, it's an impersonation?

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
I love a good impersonation!

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
It's, um, a mudskipper

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.653 position:50% align:center
The singing sensation
from Franchouchou.

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:49.654 position:50% align:center

Hello! Before I start,
I would like to thank everybody

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.544 position:50% align:center

to join us today

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.922 position:50% align:center

The world is ever-changing,

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
but the ties that
bind families together,

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:14.387 position:50% align:center
and the love they share
for one another

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.723 position:50% align:center
will always stay the same.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
My story today begins
with such a family.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.269 position:50% align:center
A skilled craftsman named Kuma,

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
his wife, and their
son Kamaykichi.

"It's no bother,
go on keep the change,

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center
it'll be our little secret."

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:29.402 position:50% align:center
"Are you sure about that?
I've always known you to be

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
a little bit of
a penny-pincher."

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.573 position:50% align:center
"I've gotten better with age."

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
"You mean he didn't drink
at all last night?"

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.119 position:50% align:center
"Yeah, Mom! Pa's trying
hard to overcome

00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
his bad habits and
he's doing much better!

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center
And he's always asking
about you and everything.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.711 position:50% align:center
I think he still...
He still loves you!"

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
"You keep this family together.
Just like a nail!"

00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.050 position:50% align:center
"So that must be
the reason you worked me

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.636 position:50% align:center
over good with that
hammer yesterday!"

00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.641 position:50% align:center
Dangit, the pip-squeak's
got me teary-eyed

00:09:59.724 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
and cryin' like a baby.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
She's such a talented actor.

You know him, you love him:

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:22.330 position:50% align:center

right after these messages!

They're both singing
for the final round.

I bet that Light
has it in the bag, then.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.529 position:50% align:center
Man, it seems like
everyone's convinced

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:20.281 position:50% align:center

take the win and advance.

all the time with my Papa.

Mommy's favorites, too.

Sizing up your competition?

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
[LILY gasps] No, I actually
thought you did a great job,

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:53.398 position:50% align:center
but I'm not gonna
give up, either!

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.400 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna sparkle!

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.695 position:50% align:center
[sighs] That little
show you put on?

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
It was so lame and outdated
I'm almost embarrassed for you.

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
I could say the same
about your act.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:06.661 position:50% align:center
Yeah right!

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:09.414 position:50% align:center
You know, I could
be on Broadway someday!

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:10.790 position:50% align:center
Wait, on Broadway?

00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:13.626 position:50% align:center
[LIGHT] Oh, are you surprised
by that? Whatever.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
Most child actors don't
think about their futures,

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:19.507 position:50% align:center
they only think about how "cute"
and "tiny" they are right now.

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:20.759 position:50% align:center
But no one gives a rat's ass

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
about that stuff
when you get older.

00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
And you're gonna grow up
whether you like it or not,

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
so you better have a plan!

00:13:29.684 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
[LIGHT]
That's why I'll succeed.

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:34.439 position:50% align:center
My acting skills are impeccable.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.358 position:50% align:center
And I've got the drive
that it takes.

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50% align:center
I won't fade away as I age.

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
I'm going to be a
legendary actor someday.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna prove that
to this crowd.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
So, keep up your pathetic
little act while you can

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:49.329 position:50% align:center
and watch me
blow you out of the water.

00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:58.880 position:50% align:center
Hey, Lily. Are you okay?

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
[LILY gasps]
Yeah. I'm fine!

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:04.302 position:50% align:center
They're just words,
so they don't hurt me.

00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna win this
for Franchouchou

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
and then we'll finally
get our revenge!

were outstanding.

this time around.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:37.293 position:50% align:center

stole Lily's song!

'Kay, but why is that
such a bad thing?

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
If Lily sings
the exact same song,

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center
the audience will think
she's trying to copy him.

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:01.484 position:50% align:center
If that happens, her chances
of winning are slim to none.

I will sparkle!

anyone could follow that!

Stellar job! Did you
improvise that song?

I'm floored by your
whole performance!

00:18:17.097 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
What did you think
when you found out

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:20.475 position:50% align:center
you were both going to
sing the same song?

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
I remembered my very best
friends in Franchouchou.

00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
We've been through a lot.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.398 position:50% align:center
And there were times we

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:28.316 position:50% align:center
didn't think we
could keep going.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
But during those bad times,

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
we were always
there for each other.

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center
Because of that, we knew
we could never give up!

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:39.411 position:50% align:center
It reminded me that
I couldn't give up, either.

00:18:39.494 --> 00:18:41.371 position:50% align:center
I knew I had to put on
an amazing performance

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:42.956 position:50% align:center
and shine brightly.

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.082 position:50% align:center
That way everyone knows

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
how amazing
Franchouchou is, too!

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:54.467 position:50% align:center
You should both be proud of
your performances today!

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
But the rules of
the show state that

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:59.097 position:50% align:center
only one of you can be
selected as the winner.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
So let's get right
to it then, shall we?

[gasps]

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.402 position:50% align:center
[JUDGE 5A] This performer proved
they had the most star power

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.154 position:50% align:center
and moved us all to tears,

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
the accomplished
child actor, Light Oozora!

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:20.160 position:50% align:center
Congratulations!
You're the winner!

00:19:21.369 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
Well done. Way to go, Light!

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:26.458 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER 5A]
Light, where are you?

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.352 position:50% align:center
This isn't funny, come out now!

00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
We're gonna miss our flight
if we don't hurry!

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.699 position:50% align:center
[LIGHT] No way I could've
done that. I'm a loser.

00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:03.620 position:50% align:center
I might've won the contest,
but I failed as a performer.

00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.414 position:50% align:center
[LILY] You should be
proud of yourself, Light.

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:07.665 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
Didja come to mock me?

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
I didn't win the contest,
why would I mock you?

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
The judges liked your
performance better.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.969 position:50% align:center
That's showbiz for ya.

00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:23.223 position:50% align:center
Besides, I thought you were
gonna make a splash on Broadway.

00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:26.476 position:50% align:center
And you're the one that said
to never give up, right?

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
Hey, this is the boy's bathroom.

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
[LILY] It's no big deal,
it's only the two of us in here.

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
No matter what,

00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:39.280 position:50% align:center
I'm always going to
twinkle and sparkle.

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
The girls in
Franchouchou will, too.

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:44.577 position:50% align:center
We're going to shine
like stars forever.

00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm here today.

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:47.664 position:50% align:center
I thought if I won the contest

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
that it would help the group
stand out even more.

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:54.629 position:50% align:center
But Light, you have something
I could never have.

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:55.797 position:50% align:center
Cheer up!

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
You have a dream,
and it will come true!

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the pep talk.

00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:10.603 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:20.488 position:50% align:center
You should drop by
Tokyo sometime.

00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:24.743 position:50% align:center
Maybe we'll be able to work on
something together. See ya.

00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:34.205 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
Lily, here!

00:23:34.289 --> 00:23:36.249 position:50% align:center
I hope we can make our
dreams come true one day!

00:23:36.332 --> 00:23:37.584 position:50% align:center
All you have to do is work hard

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:40.211 position:50% align:center
and do your best and
you'll twinkle like a star!

00:23:40.295 --> 00:23:43.631 position:50% align:center

<i>Zombie Land Saga Revenge</i> .
