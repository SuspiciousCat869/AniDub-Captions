00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.718 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Last time on
<i>Zombie Land Saga Revenge</i> ,

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.845 position:50% align:center
we were still bummed about
the show we bombed!

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:13.596 position:50% align:center
All we could do was
work our part-time jobs

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.973 position:50% align:center
and wait for our manager
to get a haircut

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:16.224 position:50% align:center
and pull it together,

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:17.892 position:50% align:center
but he wouldn't
come out of his funk!

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.811 position:50% align:center
He did show up to our comeback
performance at Geil's,

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:21.938 position:50% align:center
only to get his butt kicked,
but either way,

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.357 position:50% align:center
he still inspired us to
keep moving forward!

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.776 position:50% align:center
Now it's time for our revenge
to begin for real!

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.029 position:50% align:center
We may just be seven girls
who died in Saga,

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.406 position:50% align:center
but we got a second chance
and we're not gonna waste it!

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center
Even if they say
it can't be done,

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
we'll sing and dance
our way to the top!

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.454 position:50% align:center
Because we're Franchouchou!

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
[SAKI grunting]

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.797 position:50% align:center
Sakura. Is everything okay?

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.924 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I was just
thinking about how

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.968 position:50% align:center
we're gonna be active
as idols in the future.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.762 position:50% align:center
It made me kinda nervous.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's okay.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.892 position:50% align:center
Comfort's important but it isn't
good to be too relaxed, either.

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:01.686 position:50% align:center
Uh, what are you doing, Saki?

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.566 position:50% align:center
Well, you do need a lot of power
to sing and dance, don't ya?

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.902 position:50% align:center
And we're tryin' to take over
the whole country!

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:11.654 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure that exercise
matters for zombies though.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:14.949 position:50% align:center
Sure it does! Saganship Z
worked, didn't it?

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.452 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be ripped
in no time flat!

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:21.706 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Okay.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.041 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI]
Go!

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.169 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO] Saki has a real
talent for getting people

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.754 position:50% align:center
to follow her lead.

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:31.091 position:50% align:center
[AI] Yeah, something about
her passion is infectious.

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.062 position:50% align:center
And now, girls, the news.

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:11.107 position:50% align:center
Japan is ringing in
the Reiwa era,

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.568 position:50% align:center
but for a handful of people
living here in Saga,

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.612 position:50% align:center
the return of Franchouchou
is an equally

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.572 position:50% align:center
important event, Camera two!

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
So, Miss Four,
do you have any comments

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
about getting back to work soon?

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.828 position:50% align:center
Well. I think it's important
for us to catch up

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center
after being away
for a solid month.

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
And Miss Three,
what will you girls do

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.753 position:50% align:center
to make up for sitting
on your butts huh?

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Well. We already
have part-time jobs,

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.926 position:50% align:center
but I'm guessing you want us
to do more, don't you?

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:42.055 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Exactly! Think you
can read my mind?

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
What's next?

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.141 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Ow! Beats me!

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
Maybe acting or something?

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:50.730 position:50% align:center
Or not?

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center
I know! Doing stand-up comedy!

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
TV, you dummy!

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
Listen, ladies.
The obvious strat

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
is to broadcast your return
to a wide audience,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.121 position:50% align:center
with as much production
value as possible!

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.372 position:50% align:center
Bottom line is,

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:09.124 position:50% align:center
television is your only
hope to achieve that!

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center
Ya buncha braindead
zombies! [cackles]

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO groans]

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:17.090 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
Shut your hole!

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
You're the one who
screwed up, remember?

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
[whimpers] You're in violation
of zombie etiquette, y'know.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.931 position:50% align:center
Are you ever gonna explain
what that was all about, or no?

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
Look, as the only
non-zom in the room,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.101 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling unsafe here.

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.520 position:50% align:center
I could sue you all!
Perhaps I will!

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
So, if you want to
avoid uncivil court,

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.774 position:50% align:center
you'd better pull off
this big important job

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:36.026 position:50% align:center
that I landed for you!

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50% align:center
Ta-da!

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50% align:center
It's a segment to showcase
a popular tourist locale,

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
the beautiful
Yutoku Inari Shrine!

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.703 position:50% align:center
Y'mean we get to be on TV?

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center
Perhaps your father will have
a chance to see you onscreen.

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:51.958 position:50% align:center
Oh, and you're undead-wrong
if you think that's all.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:53.293 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50% align:center
There's going to be
another guest at the taping.

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
And that man is the
one and only White Ryu!

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.799 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
Um, who is that?

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.763 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
White Ryu!

00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:08.016 position:50% align:center
Not only is he a rock star,
he also hosts a radio program

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.851 position:50% align:center
called "So Saga Can Be Saga!"

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:11.269 position:50% align:center
The show started in 1992

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.730 position:50% align:center
and still has faithful listeners
all over the country!

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.816 position:50% align:center
He's Saga's beloved
homegrown celebrity!

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
All the answers that
you're looking for

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
can always be found
here in Saga.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
You're talkin' about
the White Ryu!

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
Dat's right.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.160 position:50% align:center
His debut was 30 years ago now,

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
but he still brings
his positive message

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.997 position:50% align:center
to the youth of
our great nation!

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:34.000 position:50% align:center
[squeals] Dude,
he's the best ever!

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:37.003 position:50% align:center
I had no idea Saga had
big celebrities like that.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.505 position:50% align:center
Moron. I'll kill ya!

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:39.798 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I'm sorry!

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.216 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
Enough chit-chat!

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
You have to become Saga's
next big super stars!

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
So go rub some rotting
elbows with this hotshot!

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.181 position:50% align:center
When are we meeting him?

00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center
--How 'bout now?!
--Right now!

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50% align:center
[PA 2A] If you take a stroll
through the shopping district,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
you'll end up getting a very
nice view of the shrine.

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:03.822 position:50% align:center
We have some handy cue
cards here to help you out.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
We hope you ladies
do a great job!

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center
Thanks. We're so glad
to be here!

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:09.786 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm?

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.502 position:50% align:center
[SAKI gasps]

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:26.636 position:50% align:center
That's weird.
He looks kinda different.

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
Sorry I'm late.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
I felt the wind off Kyogatake
and it spoke to me.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:47.323 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Yeah,
this is definitely him!

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
Wow, great.

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:53.121 position:50% align:center
Uh hello there, everybody!

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50% align:center
It's time for another adventure

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
with your favorite pop idols,
Franchouchou!

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:58.668 position:50% align:center
Today, we're visiting
the Yutoku Inari Shrine

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50% align:center
with none other than
the famous singer, White Ryu!

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
Let's see. Uh, so, do you
come to these things a lot?

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
If that question was
meant for me, yes.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:13.350 position:50% align:center
That said, if you are asking
the winds of Saga, then yes.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:14.893 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah!

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:15.727 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Uh...

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Sakura! Cue card!

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
Oh! Okay. Uh, what should I--

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
These vendors are famous for
their one-of-a-kind merchandise!

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.952 position:50% align:center
Every shop on this strip
carries signature items!

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.830 position:50% align:center
[LILY] All right!
Shall we go shopping?

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.798 position:50% align:center
What are you
looking at? Some fish?

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:46.341 position:50% align:center
[RYU]
Mudskippers.

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:49.177 position:50% align:center
Trapped in the society
that is their tank.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
Held back from the world,
just like you girls.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.598 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
Exactly! We are like that!

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:59.229 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna set those
critters free.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
How much?

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:01.940 position:50% align:center
Sorry, they're my pets.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.192 position:50% align:center
But I do have these
replicas here.

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.985 position:50% align:center
Five hundred yen.

00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:13.618 position:50% align:center
Now they're free!

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:15.995 position:50% align:center
Do you think we're gonna
get what we need from this?

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
Well, they seem to be
having a good time.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
It'll work.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.918 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Wow! That's such
a colorful shrine!

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
So fancy, like a dollhouse!

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's quite different from
the shrines we had in Yoshiwara.

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
Um. Check it out, Number Four!

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:33.471 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What's up?

00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] That's a shrine
to the god of marriage!

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:36.599 position:50% align:center
Let's go look!

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:39.019 position:50% align:center
To what? I'm not ready for that.

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:40.311 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA gasps]

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.777 position:50% align:center
Do you think the gods hear
prayers from zombies, too?

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.821 position:50% align:center
Bet they're surprised
that we're here.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA giggles, gasps]

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.536 position:50% align:center
That's it for today.
Thank you for watching.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
It's true. The light does shine
on this part of Yutoku Inari.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
But if you let yourself be
too dazzled by it,

00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
you'll never reach the
destination that awaits

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
those who struggle
through darkness.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:13.928 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, man?

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.306 position:50% align:center
[RYU] These days,
the glamour of the big city

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
tends to conceal the truth.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.728 position:50% align:center
If you're willing to
crawl toward that truth,

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.021 position:50% align:center
then I'll show you the way.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center

[RYU]
To the inner temple!

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.112 position:50% align:center
He's so deep!

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.447 position:50% align:center
[PRODUCER 2A]
Um, the inner temple might be

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.115 position:50% align:center
kind of a tricky shoot.

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
Please let us go!

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center
[PRODUCER 2A gasps]

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:40.455 position:50% align:center
We're free now,
aren't we? Let's do it!

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
Oh poopsies.

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
There sure are a lot of steps.

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:51.132 position:50% align:center
This would've been rough
when we were still alive.

00:09:51.216 --> 00:09:53.593 position:50% align:center
Inner temple, here we come!

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:59.307 position:50% align:center

[SAKI]
Oh, man! You okay?

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:19.661 position:50% align:center
Grasping hold of
something that's real

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
is not an easy thing to do.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:28.128 position:50% align:center
[SAKI gasps]
So deep!

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center

Those girls are pros.

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.553 position:50% align:center
I don't know how they manage
to keep up with that geezer.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
[PA 2A] Right? I have no idea
what he's saying,

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center
even if I pay attention.

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Wait, Saki!
Please don't get angry!

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.229 position:50% align:center
Damn!

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
Ryu's words are like
fists full of hard wisdom!

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:54.571 position:50% align:center
And to hear 'em,
you gotta listen in here!

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
[SAKI gasps]
I gotta go!

00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:00.076 position:50% align:center
Saki!

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.329 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
Hey! Um.

00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:06.374 position:50% align:center
Meeting you today
was uh really great!

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
Thank you, sir.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.460 position:50% align:center
You're so awesome!

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.712 position:50% align:center
We appreciate it.

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Yeah, we had
a nice wind blowing out here.

00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:17.844 position:50% align:center
I haven't caught your
radio show in a long time,

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
but I'll listen soon!

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
It'll be waiting, kid.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.266 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
Thanks!

00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:25.977 position:50% align:center
[RYU]
But as for me...

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:27.896 position:50% align:center
I won't be on the
airwaves much longer.

00:11:27.979 --> 00:11:29.314 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
[RYU]
Winds of change, and all that.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.818 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
Wait! You're kidding me!

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
You can't leave the show!

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.906 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry.

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
The answers you're looking for

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
can always be
found here in Saga!

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] She's been like that
ever since we came home.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:06.059 position:50% align:center
Do you guys think Saki
liked that old man?

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO gasps]
Wait. You don't mean?

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
Romantically?

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
I dunno, it's not
that weird, right?

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.317 position:50% align:center
Whether you're
living or a zombie,

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
the heart beats the same.

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.946 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO] The zombie thing's
not the issue!

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.989 position:50% align:center
We're idols, remember?

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
[LILY] Idols aren't allowed
to like somebody?

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.744 position:50% align:center
Isn't that a rule?

00:12:24.828 --> 00:12:26.788 position:50% align:center
Well, it does make you
more passionate,

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.498 position:50% align:center
and I think that
can be a good thing!

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
Yeah? You think so?

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:32.752 position:50% align:center
Well it is a bit of a gray area.

00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:34.337 position:50% align:center
How is that, Ai?

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:38.383 position:50% align:center
I mean, being in a relationship
publicly is kind of a big no-no.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:40.051 position:50% align:center
But even in your day,
idols would have

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.345 position:50% align:center
secret rendezvous
and stuff like that.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
[gasps] So it's okay?

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.933 position:50% align:center
Whoa, did you have
a crush on somebody?

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
Of course not, don't be silly!

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
Well, I love everybody in
the whole wide world.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:54.274 position:50% align:center
Because everybody in
the world loves me, too!

00:12:54.357 --> 00:12:57.777 position:50% align:center
That includes me,
dearest Lady Lily.

00:12:57.861 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
Saki will be okay.
Just give her space.

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:08.288 position:50% align:center
[RYU] This one comes from
"Saga P.D.'s Dirty Harry."

00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
Back for more, eh?

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.624 position:50% align:center
"Good evening, Ryu."

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.461 position:50% align:center
"My favorite bar just hired
this cute new bartender,

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
a classy lady who's got an
old-fashioned way about her."

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:19.341 position:50% align:center
"She's giving me strong signals.

00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:23.928 position:50% align:center
I think maybe she's kinda
into me." Enough of that crap!

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:25.096 position:50% align:center
Time for a song!

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.391 position:50% align:center
White Ryu with
"Do You Hate Windy Days?"

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Hey, Saki.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:33.188 position:50% align:center
Sorry that I got you guys
all freaked out.

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:38.234 position:50% align:center
The first time I heard about
Ryu, I was a middle schooler.

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.738 position:50% align:center
[SAKI] Back then, I used to feel
like the whole damn world

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
was out to get me.

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
[SAKI] Teachers, classmates,
if I wouldn't take their crap,

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.287 position:50% align:center
they made my life worse.

00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:51.873 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:54.417 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
So I fought with all I had.

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.336 position:50% align:center
Trying to make them see me.

00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:00.674 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
And then it happened.

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:12.644 position:50% align:center
[RYU] Not knowing where you
belong is rough on anyone.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.189 position:50% align:center
[RYU] But it's times
like that you gotta

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.316 position:50% align:center
keep your eyes and ears open.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.570 position:50% align:center
One day you'll find somebody
who feels the same way you do.

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:25.240 position:50% align:center
I'm talking to you
right now, aren't I?

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.867 position:50% align:center
That means you're not alone.

00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:30.495 position:50% align:center
You might forget
all about me after tonight.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
But, still. Connecting with
you over the airwaves

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
is something I'll
remember for life.

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:38.670 position:50% align:center
And the next time
you start to feel like

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:40.630 position:50% align:center
you're alone in the world,

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.925 position:50% align:center
you'll have this place
to come back to.

00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
[FISHERMAN 2A]
Uh, miss? That's mine.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:47.178 position:50% align:center
[GANG yelling]

00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.563 position:50% align:center
Eat this! [yells]

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:57.731 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:57.814 --> 00:14:59.441 position:50% align:center
[RYU]
One day you'll find somebody

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
who feels the same way you do.

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:06.614 position:50% align:center
[SAKI] Those words are
what led me to Reiko.

00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:08.575 position:50% align:center
Then one day I kicked the bucket

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.953 position:50% align:center
and started hanging out
with dancing zombies.

00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
If it wasn't for Ryu,
where would I be now?

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
No. I won't let it end this way!

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:27.302 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that is so many
kinds of illegal!

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.230 position:50% align:center
[SAKI yelling]

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:40.231 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA screams]

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:43.777 position:50% align:center
Hey! Slow down!
No riding double!

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.532 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.785 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but it's
an emergency.

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.872 position:50% align:center
Please don't
lock us up! I'm sorry!

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:04.923 position:50% align:center
And now for an encore
by special request.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.007 position:50% align:center
I am White Ryu.

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:08.426 position:50% align:center
And here's "Do You
Hate Windy Days?"

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
'Scuse us!

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:20.772 position:50% align:center
Two little kittens.

00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:23.733 position:50% align:center
But they don't
look lost, at all.

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
By the way, did you hear
Franchouchou came back recently?

00:16:28.363 --> 00:16:31.491 position:50% align:center
Of course, I saw they
made a post about it.

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
That's really gross, you know.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.579 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.374 position:50% align:center
Seems like we've got
a warm breeze blowing today.

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:41.584 position:50% align:center
Let's talk to our guests.

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
We're with Franchouchou!
I'm Number Two!

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
And my name is Number One, sir.

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:48.383 position:50% align:center
We're very sorry
to barge in like this!

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.552 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:52.345 position:50% align:center
Well? What is it, then?

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:55.473 position:50% align:center
I came here to say I'm
not letting you quit the show!

00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:58.810 position:50% align:center
In Saga, people feel
lost and alone!

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
Hell, Saga is lost and alone!

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
And if you don't
do your show anymore.

If you leave, what's gonna
happen to Saga's burning soul?

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
Listen, the only reason
that I'm an idol today

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.824 position:50% align:center
is because of things
you've said.

00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
And there are tons of people
like me all over Saga!

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:18.830 position:50% align:center
No. All over Japan, even!

00:17:18.913 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
That's why I beg you.
Do not stop the show!

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.628 position:50% align:center
Your listeners need
a place to turn to!

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.130 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.841 position:50% align:center
They need a home they can
turn to, not this old codger.

[SAKI gasps]

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:33.595 position:50% align:center
You thought I was
just gonna split?

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
No, I'd rather leave
this place to someone

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:38.141 position:50% align:center
who has the passion to run it.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.060 position:50% align:center
I mean, hell,
even my pompadour's

00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:41.561 position:50% align:center
starting to give up the ghost.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
Who are you gonna--

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
The answer, kiddo,
is always in Saga!

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
I'm thinking you gals
should take over.

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
Uh, wha?

00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:56.368 position:50% align:center
Wait, you can't just--!

00:17:56.451 --> 00:18:00.914 position:50% align:center
You're here and you're perfect.
So why waste time deciding?

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:02.499 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.752 position:50% align:center
[RYU] You've got the kinda spark
that lights a fire in others.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:07.962 position:50% align:center
You won't just
lead Franchouchou,

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:09.798 position:50% align:center
you'll be a leader
to all of Saga!

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
I'm Franchouchou's
leader, Number Two!

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna honor Ryu by
taking over this radio show!

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:25.605 position:50% align:center
Wow. A heads-up would've
been preferred, but okay.

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:29.609 position:50% align:center
This is huge, man. And if
you blink, you'll miss history!

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:34.698 position:50% align:center
From now on,
Saga is in your hands.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
So, uh, wh-what are
you gonna do next?

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.539 position:50% align:center
[RYU]
The old wind from Kyogatake

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:44.749 position:50% align:center
is pushing me forward now!

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.335 position:50% align:center
To tell the world
about this place.

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
Look, Ryu. Truth is...

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
I love you, okay?

[SAKURA gasps]

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
Don't be stupid.

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
I'm not the person who truly
needs your passion right now.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.939 position:50% align:center
It's all those wandering
souls out there.

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:10.734 position:50% align:center
No, it's Saga who
needs you most.

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:12.902 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.991 position:50% align:center
Look me up after you've
grown into fine women.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
You're both way too young
to be my old lady.

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
He was really something.

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:42.390 position:50% align:center
That's for sure.

00:19:42.474 --> 00:19:45.518 position:50% align:center
Reiko probably found
a cool guy like him.

00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] He said we'd
see him again, right?

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
Not until we grow up,
technically.

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
Oh, true.

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
Problem is, no matter
how many years pass,

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
we're never gonna get older.

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:01.409 position:50% align:center
Because we're zombies!

Huh? That's weird. I'm crying.

[chuckles]

00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
Aw, Saki!

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.420 position:50% align:center
Uh. What should I do?

00:20:12.504 --> 00:20:15.048 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry! There, there!

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:19.469 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I just
don't get it, man.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you crying for, Sakura?

00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:51.668 position:50% align:center
I can't help it. I'm just
sad because you're sad!

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
Fine, then I'm not sad!
Now stop crying! Please?

Aw, gross! You're drying up!

supposed to shed tears!

This is how you
turn into a mummy!

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
We heard the radio show,
and we love you ladies!

You can do it,
we're rootin' for ya!

00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
Since I've been leader
of Franchouchou,

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
I have let my soul
burn like a flame.

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:19.738 position:50% align:center
And from now on,

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna let it
burn even brighter,

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:24.659 position:50% align:center
and light the way for not just
my group, but all of Saga!

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
Because then,
if anybody feels lost,

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:29.789 position:50% align:center
my light can show 'em
where to go!

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
Just like Lake Imari's
lighthouse over in Uranosaki.

Here's our next song!
