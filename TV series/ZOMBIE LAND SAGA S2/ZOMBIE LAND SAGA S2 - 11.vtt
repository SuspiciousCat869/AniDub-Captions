Dead or alive,
Franchouchou are idols.

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.903 position:50% align:center
Take away all
the bells and whistles.

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
Look at the pure remains
and the bare bones.

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center
And what's left is
what an idol truly is.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.205 position:50% align:center
So, Okoba. If you would,

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
I'd like for you to help us out.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.961 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I thought we were done for.

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
We faked our way through.

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:51.589 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Those kids really saved the day.

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:54.843 position:50% align:center
It truly is a blessing to
have the crowd's admiration.

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
What about tomorrow, though?

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.973 position:50% align:center
The masks should be more durable
if we bake them for longer.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.766 position:50% align:center
That's not what she meant.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.351 position:50% align:center
[AI]
What else can we do?

00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:04.436 position:50% align:center
Don't cry!

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.938 position:50% align:center
Forget about the
creepy masks, already!

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
Where'd you come from?

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
What the hell, man?
So now you show up?

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:13.820 position:50% align:center
Do you have any idea what we've
been through without you here?

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
Because of your absence,
we were forced to

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
rush the delicate
process of dollmaking!

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Again, you're missing the point.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:20.410 position:50% align:center
You're so late!

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
[TAE grunts]

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
Eh, you'll get over it!

00:19:24.372 --> 00:19:27.083 position:50% align:center
Now line up single-file
for your makeup jobs!

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:30.128 position:50% align:center
You zombies are looking
seriously crusty.

00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:34.799 position:50% align:center
I haven't given up
on you, by the way.

00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:38.803 position:50% align:center
On the 8th of March, you are
still doing your revenge show.

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:40.388 position:50% align:center
Even after all this?

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:43.683 position:50% align:center
To me, this is all the
more reason we need to.

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
Your performance tonight
made me realize that fact.

00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
What Saga needs most right now
is to see you girls singing.

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50% align:center
The adults are waiting.

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
The children are waiting, too.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.788 position:50% align:center
You are idols, after all.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
You brought smiles to people
in this difficult time,

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
so I know you can do it.

00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:16.883 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
That said, we're obviously

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
working at a disadvantage.

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
And we won't have time
to rehearse on concert day.

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
So you'll have to
come in cold. Is that--

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
--[SAKURA] It's fine.
--[ALL gasp]

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
It'll be tough,

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
but we'd do anything
to help the people of Saga.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
And if it came to it,
we would risk our lives!

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:37.529 position:50% align:center
I mean, you're dead,
but that's cool.

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
Anyway, the show's in 16 days.

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
Call time is ten AM sharp.

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:45.787 position:50% align:center
I'll do everything
humanly possible to help.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center
And you do everything
zombie-ly possible. Got it?

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:54.254 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Mr. Kotaro!

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What is it?

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.140 position:50% align:center
I just realized
there's something

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
that I've never said to you.

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:10.645 position:50% align:center
In spite of everything,
you never gave up on us.

00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean, except
that one time, I guess.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
What I mean is,
we only made it this far

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:18.820 position:50% align:center
because we had you
to keep pulling us along.

00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
Back when I was alive,
I was so moved by watching Ai,

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:24.159 position:50% align:center
and then I got to meet Maimai,

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:25.577 position:50% align:center
who said that she
felt the same way

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
because she saw my performances.

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I know everything's
been a total mess

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:32.876 position:50% align:center
ever since that crazy
rainstorm hit Saga,

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:36.212 position:50% align:center
but entertaining people
at the shelter's been...

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:38.131 position:50% align:center
Well for the first time,
it feels like

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
I have a real reason
to sing, y'know?

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
I mean, since turning
into a zombie.

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:50.268 position:50% align:center
And I guess.
I just wanted to say...

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:55.148 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad that
you made me an idol!

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.484 position:50% align:center
I owe you so much for that!

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:06.493 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Oh, Inui, thank you!

00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:26.346 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:28.264 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Hm?

00:22:28.348 --> 00:22:29.474 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
I...

00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:32.394 position:50% align:center
Could you speak up?

00:22:32.477 --> 00:22:36.606 position:50% align:center
I've got what it takes,
and don't you ever forget that!

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:37.857 position:50% align:center
Look, Sakura.

00:22:37.941 --> 00:22:41.319 position:50% align:center
I lied when I said
that you didn't have it.

00:22:41.403 --> 00:22:43.905 position:50% align:center
And for as long as
Franchouchou exists,

00:22:43.988 --> 00:22:47.200 position:50% align:center
I promise, I'll be someone
who has it, too!

00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:52.163 position:50% align:center
And Sakura, the truth is,
EFS is just the start!

00:22:52.247 --> 00:22:54.124 position:50% align:center
'Cause your dream,

00:22:54.207 --> 00:22:57.002 position:50% align:center
Franchouchou's dream,
it is bigger!

00:22:57.085 --> 00:22:59.421 position:50% align:center
One day you'll be loved
by the whole world!

00:22:59.504 --> 00:23:03.174 position:50% align:center
Until then,
I give my undying word.

00:23:04.092 --> 00:23:07.512 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
I... I will...

00:23:10.223 --> 00:23:13.184 position:50% align:center
I'll eternally have
whatever it takes.

00:23:32.787 --> 00:23:34.664 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Sakura here! If Saga needs us,

00:23:34.748 --> 00:23:36.666 position:50% align:center
then we'll sing with
everything we've got!

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.586 position:50% align:center
Nothing can stop us from
standing up for our home!
