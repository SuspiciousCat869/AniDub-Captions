[SAKURA] Last time on
<i>Zombie Land Saga Revenge</i> ,

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.553 position:50% align:center
we somehow got back into
doing the idol thing!

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:13.596 position:50% align:center
It started with a TV appearance
where we co-hosted

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.725 position:50% align:center
a segment with Saga's
very own rock star, White Ryu!

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:18.143 position:50% align:center
Can you believe?

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
Saki is a longtime fan of his,
so she kinda went nuts!

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.856 position:50% align:center
It might even be love,
oh my gosh!

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:23.773 position:50% align:center
Then, Saki found out that

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
Ryu's radio show
might be ending,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
and she went even more nuts!

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.445 position:50% align:center
She confessed
her feelings to him,

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.239 position:50% align:center
and he opened up to her, too!
It was super touching!

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.574 position:50% align:center
And now, Franchouchou
is in charge of

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:35.243 position:50% align:center
his radio show,
"So Saga Can Be Saga"!

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
We're gonna light the way
for Saga's burning soul!

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:43.668 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.603 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Such super-tight choreography.

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.855 position:50% align:center
We're probably not
at that level.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:14.324 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.578 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Hey, Ai!

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:21.414 position:50% align:center
I think Kotaro's getting
out of the bath now, so.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:22.624 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:25.794 position:50% align:center
Uh, there's nothing
wrong at all! I'm done.

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:28.129 position:50% align:center
So what kind of stuff
were you looking up?

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:31.925 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Just random things.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.386 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] Hey, don't eat that!
It's not a snack!

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.806 position:50% align:center
That's for--I swear
to crap, Tae. Drop it!

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.943 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] A show at Six-Five-Six!
And we're on the radio!

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
We hope you'll
be there! Thank you!

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.659 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] It feels like we're
starting to make real progress!

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.914 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] The schedule
sure is filling up, huh?

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center
Half of these dates are for
our part-time jobs, but yeah.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
Hell, if we're
payin' off our debt

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
and doin' idol stuff
at the same time,

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.588 position:50% align:center
we're on our way to easy street!

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.757 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Nope, not even close.

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.970 position:50% align:center
If we start thinking
we can relax now,

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center
then all we'll ever be known for
is the time we bombed.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.362 position:50% align:center
[AI] We need to put
the past behind us.

00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.657 position:50% align:center
Find a way to rise above
everyone's expectations.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
And if we can't, then we might
as well be dead and buried.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
She's got a point.
The entertainment industry's

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
always been a
cutthroat competition.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.877 position:50% align:center
And to fall behind is to die.

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.088 position:50% align:center
[AI gasps]

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.848 position:50% align:center
Ha! I can't say no
to a challenge!

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.725 position:50% align:center
Right! Let's advance!

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
Better count me in, too!

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.688 position:50% align:center
Come on, Tae!

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.316 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Ai's exactly right.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.111 position:50% align:center
We have to keep growing
and moving forward.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
Thank you for
supporting the group!

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:42.157 position:50% align:center
Number Three is
so inspirational!

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.160 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you can tell
she puts her all into it!

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:47.912 position:50% align:center
Question. Which one
looks better? Watch.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.707 position:50% align:center
Arm pointed out to the side
or kind of downward?

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.916 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
Real quick.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
I put together the intro
for tomorrow's show,

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
could you look over it for me?

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
[LILY] I can't decide
which one of these hairpieces

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
would make me cuter!

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
Let me see here.

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
Huh?

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Either, both, doesn't matter.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
Ai, can you please
tell me what to do?

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
Ai, can I ask you
for something?

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center
Ai, do you have just a second?

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
Ai, help!

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.902 position:50% align:center
[TAE grunts]

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Sakura, center.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.405 position:50% align:center
Junko and Lily,
you'll be on the right side,

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:25.367 position:50% align:center
and Saki and Yugiri,
you go on the left.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
Back a bit more.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.376 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
Iron Frill is coming here!

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.212 position:50% align:center
Iron Frill is coming here!

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:41.007 position:50% align:center
So get your zombie
butts in gear!

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center
Let's go! It's a raid!

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.969 position:50% align:center
An ambush! They're coming!

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.471 position:50% align:center
You little--!

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.557 position:50% align:center
[LILY gasps]

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
Denied! You are to respond
with a "sir, yes, sir"!

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.941 position:50% align:center
Uh, sir! Yes si--!

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
You're just a
bunch of wet corpses

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50% align:center
wallowing around in muck!

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50% align:center
No, you're the maggots
that eat the corpses!

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:08.576 position:50% align:center
Would you calm down?
Get back to Iron Frill!

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.579 position:50% align:center
Get the (bleep) out of
your ears and listen up,

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.540 position:50% align:center
you shambling sacks of bones.

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
There's about to be
another landmark added

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
to the fierce battlefield
that is Saga--

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.171 position:50% align:center
the new Saga Arena!

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:21.339 position:50% align:center
Wait, the what now?

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.425 position:50% align:center
And guess who's
breaking it in first?

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.343 position:50% align:center
Iron Frill, obviously!

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:26.761 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:28.638 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] Now, why is a big-time
idol group from Tokyo

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center
being brought in for
the inaugural performance

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:32.517 position:50% align:center
at a venue in little
old Saga, you may ask?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.228 position:50% align:center
And to that I say,
who freakin' knows?

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:36.855 position:50% align:center
The important takeaway
is that I found a way

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.857 position:50% align:center
to weasel you maggots
in as the opening act!

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
You little (bleep) are gonna
be so (bleep) awesome

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
that those (bleep) Tokyo (bleep)
will leave here in utter shame!

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.323 position:50% align:center
It's the perfect plan!
So memorize it!

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.575 position:50% align:center
You're kidding.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
Good!

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:57.709 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:03.340 position:50% align:center
[AI]
We can handle this. I know it.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:05.633 position:50% align:center
You're right!

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50% align:center
Yeah, lovely parade and all,
but here comes the rain.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.349 position:50% align:center
Number Three's not performing.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
What? Why?

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:17.312 position:50% align:center
Oh? Did all your brains
finally leak out?

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.189 position:50% align:center
Iron Frill's famously
deceased leader

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50% align:center
wants to flaunt her undeadliness
right in front of her old group?

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
We've been up in Saga's
grill for months

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.113 position:50% align:center
and we never worried about
getting recognized before!

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and we performed
on the same stage

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:30.492 position:50% align:center
as them back at Saga Rock!

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:33.119 position:50% align:center
Please, we can't go on without
Ai after coming this far!

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.747 position:50% align:center
Franchouchou isn't Franchouchou
if we're not singing together!

Respect my authority
or you'll run laps

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
'til your legs fall off again!

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.045 position:50% align:center
As for you, we've got
some solo gigs lined up.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:45.799 position:50% align:center
You'll be starting first
thing tomorrow. At ease!

00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center
That didn't go too well.

[AI sighs]

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
So, what now?

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
There's no reasoning
with that guy.

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:00.563 position:50% align:center
I'm sure one of us would
have had to sit out eventually

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.816 position:50% align:center
due to an injury or
something like that.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.984 position:50% align:center
Maybe this is an
opportunity for each member

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:07.195 position:50% align:center
of Franchouchou to get
a bit stronger.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
But it'll make me sad if you're
the only person who's left out!

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.908 position:50% align:center
It's just this once.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.284 position:50% align:center
We want revenge, right?

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
So we'll do whatever
it takes to get it!

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Junko.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
I'm counting on you
to take charge.

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
After me, you're the most
experienced idol we've got.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
All right, today's
special guest is

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:43.023 position:50% align:center
Number Three from
Franchouchou! Yay!

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:47.027 position:50% align:center
Whoo! Hey! I'm so
happy to be here!

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.405 position:50% align:center
[BULK]
Huh? I guess Number Three's

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.282 position:50% align:center
doing solo stuff these days.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
I hope she's not
breaking away from the gang.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.286 position:50% align:center
So I have to ask.

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.955 position:50% align:center
Has anyone ever told you that
you bear a striking resemblance

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center
to the late Ai Mizuno
from Iron Frill?

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
[AI gasps] Yes, I do get that
from time to time, actually.

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:08.173 position:50% align:center
She was a legendary idol
who people still admire.

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50% align:center
So, I always consider
it a compliment!

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] They want you in
Fukuoka for a live event.

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:21.978 position:50% align:center
Plus the Nagasaki
Hydrangea Festival.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.064 position:50% align:center
And Beppu Hot Springs Hell, too.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
Now let me see here.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.693 position:50% align:center
Why don't you take those offers
and shove 'em up your butts?

00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.028 position:50% align:center
Whoa, what are you doing?

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:33.239 position:50% align:center
Franchouchou was created
for Saga and Saga alone.

00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
Anyone else who wants you

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.952 position:50% align:center
is merely trying to
capitalize on Saga's glory.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.746 position:50% align:center
So trust no one.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:42.540 position:50% align:center
I've never heard
you say that before.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:46.002 position:50% align:center
Are you plotting something?

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:52.133 position:50% align:center
[AI] Why would you want to split
us up at such an important time?

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:55.637 position:50% align:center
We can't afford to fail
this next performance.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.140 position:50% align:center
Just think about it.
If it turns out like EFS did--

00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.101 position:50% align:center
Oh, honey,
Franchouchou can get along

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
perfectly well without you.

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.814 position:50% align:center
Besides, you left Junko
in charge, right?

00:10:05.897 --> 00:10:08.191 position:50% align:center
What's wrong,
you don't trust her?

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
Junko made it as a solo
idol back in the eighties,

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.779 position:50% align:center
when that was almost
impossible to do!

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center
And they've all
been working hard

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.533 position:50% align:center
to get over the EFS disaster!

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.451 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that
they can pull through.

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.662 position:50% align:center
It sounds like to me
everything's peachy!

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:23.498 position:50% align:center
So if you'd just unclench your
undead jaw for five minutes

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:26.001 position:50% align:center
to focus on your solo career
and paying off this debt,

00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:27.544 position:50% align:center
we'd live happily ever after!

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.504 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to do any
of that if you keep on

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
turning down offers
for dumb reasons?

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.967 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.593 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're on now.

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:38.680 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
We'll be right there, sir!

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO] Everyone's been working
so hard to learn the new choreo.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.893 position:50% align:center
But we're nowhere near
the level we should be

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:47.564 position:50% align:center
if we want to impress the fans
coming to see Iron Frill.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center
We just have to push ourselves.

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.779 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO] The concert will
be here before we know it.

00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
If we don't nail
this performance,

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.742 position:50% align:center
we're gonna bomb again.

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Junko! Uh, Junko?

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:02.412 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:03.913 position:50% align:center
Did we do better that time?

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:07.125 position:50% align:center
I feel like we're still a
little too stiff in some parts.

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
We should definitely
go over it a couple more times,

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center
but you guys are
doing a great job!

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:12.714 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah. Rock!

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.507 position:50% align:center
You just stared at us all
creepy with your mouth open,

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:17.177 position:50% align:center
so I wasn't sure
how you felt about it.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
[SAKI] This concert is
a big deal for Franchouchou.

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:23.141 position:50% align:center
We've got this, man!
We've got this by the ass!

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50% align:center
Let's focus on one thing
at a time before

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.645 position:50% align:center
we start getting
too excited, okay, ladies?

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:29.939 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I keep flailing
my arms too much

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
and it's knockin' my mic loose.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
That's because you're
forgetting the choreo

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
and making up
your own dance moves.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center
[BOSS 3A]
You seem troubled by something.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
[BOSS 3A] I don't think you
should be doing this right now.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.037 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, sir.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should call it a day.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO]
I'm back.

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey there, Tae.

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:12.524 position:50% align:center
Is everyone else
still off at work?

00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.442 position:50% align:center
[HOST 3A] Up next is
Franchouchou's Number Three

00:12:14.526 --> 00:12:16.945 position:50% align:center
singing "Awaken Returner"!

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO] If she'd been alive
during my time in the '80s,

00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center
I bet she could've
become a top idol,

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:41.386 position:50% align:center
maybe even as a solo artist.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.641 position:50% align:center
I have got to
get out of this funk.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
[FANS cheering]

00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
Would you like to
share your thoughts on

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:02.323 position:50% align:center
the Saga Arena concert that's
coming up this weekend?

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
We think it's gonna be
a super incredible show!

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
[PRESS 3A] Your national tour
has generated a lot of buzz.

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.373 position:50% align:center
People call you
the top idol queens!

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:12.208 position:50% align:center
Do you think you
live up to the hype?

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
I mean...

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
It would be conceited to say
we're the best idols.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:19.007 position:50% align:center
But we're trend-setters,
so we have a responsibility

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.675 position:50% align:center
to keep evolving musically.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:21.718 position:50% align:center
Shiori.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
Saga's a big deal to us.

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.388 position:50% align:center
And we're gonna bring it on.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:27.140 position:50% align:center
Iron Frill is gonna
prove to everyone

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.851 position:50% align:center
that we're one of a kind
and beyond compare.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
We're better than ever,
so get ready to see

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center
an amazing performance!

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
[INUBASHIRI]
Now, that's a star right there.

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:41.780 position:50% align:center
It seems like the
top idols from Tokyo

00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:43.073 position:50% align:center
really know what
they're doing, huh?

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
Isn't Franchouchou
performing with them

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:47.077 position:50% align:center
over at the new Saga Arena?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they're the opening act.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:52.290 position:50% align:center
It'd be amazing if they managed
to outperform Iron Frill.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't place bets
on that happening.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
Hold on, did she just say

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50% align:center
they're one of a kind
and beyond compare?

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:02.008 position:50% align:center
So, she's basically
insulting the opening act

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
as a declaration of war!

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.470 position:50% align:center
I'll make her
choke on those words!

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:07.347 position:50% align:center
Kinda doubt she knows us.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
Iron Frill is an absurdly
famous idol group.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.852 position:50% align:center
It's natural for them
to be confident.

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO] If Iron Frill brings
their A-game as promised,

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
and if they perform
on another level,

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
people will think we're nothing
more than third-rate wannabes,

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.530 position:50% align:center
and we'll never be able
to get our revenge.

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:30.787 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO]
This... is...

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.542 position:50% align:center
...how... you... type.

00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO] Huh? That's
not right. What do I do?

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:53.810 position:50% align:center
Sorry, guys!

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:57.272 position:50% align:center
I had to work late
today and uh... Huh?

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:26.593 position:50% align:center
Saga!

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.388 position:50% align:center
Didya like that?

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.557 position:50% align:center
Did I like what?

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.641 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
I thought our routine could use

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
a little somethin' extra,

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
so we can go out with
a bang at the Saga Arena.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Junko, check it out!

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:41.775 position:50% align:center
Even Tae's getting
into the groove!

00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
Whoa, okay, but we should
probably be focusing

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.449 position:50% align:center
on the song and
dance moves first.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.868 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course
we'll do that, too!

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
But there's not a whole lot of
time left before the concert,

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.414 position:50% align:center
so we thought we'd
try something fresh

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:58.708 position:50% align:center
to leave a big impression
on the audience.

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
It's bad enough
without Ai being here.

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
So we gotta dig ourselves
outta this grave

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
or we'll have another
disaster on our hands.

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.468 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
What's wrong?

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
Does the routine
need something extra?

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:13.181 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO]
It's not that, exactly.

00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
Awesome, so you want in
on this party?

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
Uh... I just need some more
time to think about it.

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
You do that.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:26.277 position:50% align:center
Okay, we'll try it again,
but this time do it way louder.

00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.530 position:50% align:center
[LILY] Yeah! I'm gonna
shake these maracas

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
like there's no tomorrow!

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
That's the spirit!

00:17:46.024 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:50.779 position:50% align:center
Junko, that was beautiful!
Did you write--

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:54.115 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:55.075 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA gasps]

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:56.618 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:08.046 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I've heard that song used

00:18:08.129 --> 00:18:10.131 position:50% align:center
in a bunch of
commercials before,

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:12.092 position:50% align:center
but I didn't know
it was one of yours.

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:15.637 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO] Mm-hmm. It was
the first one of my songs

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.473 position:50% align:center
that managed to reach
the top of the charts.

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
It kept growing in popularity
and before long,

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:24.104 position:50% align:center
everyone knew
the name Junko Konno.

00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
I like to sing it when
I'm trying to cheer myself up.

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:29.651 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry, Junko.

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:31.152 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center
I think maybe we're all in
a state of panic right now.

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:37.033 position:50% align:center
We're just too focused
on having an impact.

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:40.453 position:50% align:center
Agreed. I feel the same way.

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
We're all having anxiety
about this show,

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
but I thought it was only me
that was feeling it.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:49.295 position:50% align:center
I love being a part
of this group.

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:53.550 position:50% align:center
And I want us to put on a great
performance at the Saga Arena.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
I'm so used to
doing my own thing,

00:18:57.512 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
performing as
a solo idol, y'know?

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:04.936 position:50% align:center
Performing with others is a
totally different experience.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
You have to stand out and
blend in at the same time.

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:11.234 position:50% align:center
On top of that,
I'm failing everybody

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.528 position:50% align:center
as a substitute idol leader.

00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:18.241 position:50% align:center
Not true. I happen to like
your teaching methods

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
because they're
easy to understand,

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
and you're super
considerate of all of us.

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:25.248 position:50% align:center
You've schooled us on
what it takes to be real idols!

00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:26.916 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:32.047 position:50% align:center
Let's talk to Ai about this.
She might have some good advice,

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.758 position:50% align:center
even if she won't be able
to be on stage with us.

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:36.134 position:50% align:center
I know she's gone,

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:39.054 position:50% align:center
but Kotaro never said we
couldn't reach out to her.

00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
We'll tell her about
our new ideas and then

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
we can pick her brain
for some keen insight.

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] You're Franchouchou's
Number Three, right?

00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:00.325 position:50% align:center
And you're from Iron Frill.

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
Wow, you really do
look like her.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
Hold on? Is that Ai?
And isn't that--?

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:16.758 position:50% align:center
I've been keeping
a close eye on Franchouchou

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.093 position:50% align:center
for a good while now.

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
So I know what happened
at the EFS show.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] But you've been
doing solo gigs lately.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:27.268 position:50% align:center
I guess you finally
figured it out.

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
Just drop the dumb act.

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:34.109 position:50% align:center
You know you're more talented
than those other girls are.

00:20:34.192 --> 00:20:36.277 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:38.988 position:50% align:center
I can tell by the way
that you perform.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
You would rather be a part of
a group as good as Iron Frill.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:44.411 position:50% align:center
I mean, why wouldn't
you want to be?

00:20:44.494 --> 00:20:47.747 position:50% align:center
We're the ultimate,
the top idol queens.

00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
You may not want to admit it,
but I see right through you.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.838 position:50% align:center
Because I was also
in a similar situation.

00:20:54.921 --> 00:20:58.383 position:50% align:center
Ai Mizuno was an absolute
legend as number one.

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:01.011 position:50% align:center
It hasn't been easy, but I've
done everything in my power

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.847 position:50% align:center
to shine brighter than
she ever had the chance to.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.641 position:50% align:center
I'm just--

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
Listen up, Number Three!

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:10.770 position:50% align:center
You should join Iron Frill.

00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:12.313 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:15.650 position:50% align:center
I think you've got
what it takes.

00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:17.402 position:50% align:center
And you'll be doing
yourself a disservice

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
if you don't leave a backwards
place like Saga soon.

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
You know Iron Frill
is unbeatable.

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
Plus, we have the talent
and the determination

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.495 position:50% align:center
to stay on top, too.

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
You belong with our group, Ai.

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
You're leagues ahead
of Franchouchou.

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:33.960 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:36.921 position:50% align:center
Just think about it. Okay?

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:39.758 position:50% align:center
We'll talk again after
the show this weekend.

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
But you'll see.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.347 position:50% align:center
Once you get a real taste of
what we can do on stage,

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
it'll be clear who
the better group is.

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:48.808 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:52.854 --> 00:21:54.189 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:23:32.746 --> 00:23:34.122 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO]
It's me, Junko.

00:23:34.205 --> 00:23:35.957 position:50% align:center
Is someone better off
with another team

00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.710 position:50% align:center
if it meant that they could
shine a little bit brighter?

00:23:38.793 --> 00:23:42.380 position:50% align:center

<i>Saga Revenge</i> , Episode 4:
