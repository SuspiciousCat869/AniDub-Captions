Good Morning, you guys.

--[CLERK 1A] Morning.
--[CLERK 1B] Hey there, San!

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:40.999 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE 1A]
Great weather today.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE 1C]
San, dear?

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
You do eat more than
just lunch, don't you?

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:46.796 position:50% align:center
[AI]
Yes.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.758 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEE 1C] Well, you always
look so sickly, it concerns me.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.009 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, honey.

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:53.053 position:50% align:center
I'll bring you some nori
the next chance I get.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.430 position:50% align:center
Saga's nori is so nutritious!

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.515 position:50% align:center
Thank you. I appreciate it.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.606 position:50% align:center
Good morning to all of you!

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:05.940 position:50% align:center
[EMPLOYEES]
Morning, sir!

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.650 position:50% align:center
Ah. Look at that.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.819 position:50% align:center
Imari Bay's sparkling today!

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.489 position:50% align:center
Horseshoe crabs looking lively!

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.616 position:50% align:center
I want you ladies
to cook, slice, and dry

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:16.701 position:50% align:center
with the kind of pride
that the best,

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:20.455 position:50% align:center
and only dried squid maker
in Kyushu ought to have!

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:22.499 position:50% align:center
Time for the company song!

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:25.877 position:50% align:center
Let's see, today our
leader is you!

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.545 position:50% align:center
Get up here, Tatsumi!

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:28.755 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.682 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:43.770 position:50% align:center
[singing in Japanese]

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.065 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I'm home.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:11.316 position:50% align:center
Good to see ya!

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:12.692 position:50% align:center
Hey, welcome back, Ai.

00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.319 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're home.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.863 position:50% align:center
[AI] Brought you a treat.
Dried squid.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
[TAE grunts]

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:19.949 position:50% align:center
[LILY screams]

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Tae, stop it!

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.953 position:50% align:center
That squid is for
everybody! Calm down!

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:24.954 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're back.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50% align:center
The water's yours
if you want it.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:28.667 position:50% align:center
Thanks. That sounds good.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50% align:center
Isn't it great that nobody
figured out we're zombies today?

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
It's easier to hide it
than I expected.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.426 position:50% align:center
We've all been working
for a whole month now.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.553 position:50% align:center
If we play it cool,
we'll be fine.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
Which is why I'm so worried
about the two of you.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
Uh. But I can
play it cool, you guys.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.561 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
Chew with your mouth closed!

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
Still, though,
if you think about it.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.067 position:50% align:center
Yugiri has a service job,
so that's the riskiest.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.528 position:50% align:center
But I'm positive
she can handle it.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Yeah, she took to it so easily!

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
It's a great fit for her.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.868 position:50% align:center
And if we keep up the
hard work for a while,

00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.995 position:50% align:center
one day, we'll be out of debt!

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.918 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] In the last winter
of the Heisei era,

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
Franchouchou pulled off
an awesome show

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
at Arpino in front
of 500 people!

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.342 position:50% align:center
After that, our reputation
totally skyrocketed!

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.803 position:50% align:center
Our first CD sold like hotcakes!

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:24.139 position:50% align:center
It was so exciting,
getting to perform our music

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.598 position:50% align:center
at a bunch of new venues!

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.350 position:50% align:center
Then, a month later.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:29.644 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] Behold! We're charging
straight into our next show

00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center
at Ekimae Fudosan Stadium,
EFS if you're nasty!

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:34.858 position:50% align:center
Here's the plan!

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.359 position:50% align:center
Get the crowd all fired up,

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:40.905 position:50% align:center
and encore with that
new number! Yeah!

00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
This bomb is still lit!

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:46.411 position:50% align:center
Soon, everyone will
know Franchouchou!

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] And so, we took to
the stage at EFS! Sadly...

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] We sold 500 tickets
in a 30,000-seat stadium.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
That's like barely
over one percent!

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
Which means we stopped
blowing up, and just bombed!

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.137 position:50% align:center
It would've been weird
to do an encore after that,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
so we put the new
song on the shelf.

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.725 position:50% align:center
Plus, the unsold tickets
put us in debt, big time!

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:12.228 position:50% align:center
It stunk, even for zombies!

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.564 position:50% align:center
Could this be the end?

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.655 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] The EFS show
was a huge disaster,

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
but we still want to get
on stage together again!

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
That's why we each
picked up part-time jobs

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:30.246 position:50% align:center
to try and bring ourselves
out of the red!

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
We're not going to
give up! Oh, yeah.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:37.671 position:50% align:center
And as for our fearless
producer, Mr. Kotaro.

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.090 position:50% align:center
[laughs] What the!

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
Pope's Nose!

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
Why is it called that?

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:48.598 position:50% align:center
Oh, you want me to save Saga,
Your Holiness? Huh? [giggling]

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
Sorry, it ain't happening!

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
This is the Sagapocalypse!
No, it's Sagageddon!

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.732 position:50% align:center
I knew that.

00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:00.652 position:50% align:center
Which is why I was
hoping that I could.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
This stuff's named
after a nose!

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:05.824 position:50% align:center
Pope's Nose! Man,
that's gotta feel bad!

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:12.205 position:50% align:center
[LILY] Morning, sir! I'm Saga's
new milk delivery girl!

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:18.003 position:50% align:center
Don't move!
This stuff is tricky!

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:20.714 position:50% align:center
I can never seem to
master the blend.

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
[SAKI] It just doesn't look,
I dunno, lively enough.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO]
Well, we are dead.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
I knew it.
The color is still off.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.474 position:50% align:center
I sure wish Kotaro was here.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:34.394 position:50% align:center
[SAKI] What the hell's
the matter with that guy?

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.730 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] I'll go check
on him one more time.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.483 position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50% align:center
Is he here?

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.785 position:50% align:center
It's me, sir. Sakura.

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.704 position:50% align:center
You okay?

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh no!

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.623 position:50% align:center
Why's it so dark?

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
Because you're way
overdue for a haircut.

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
Oh, great. It's you again.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] I don't think this
is good for your health.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
Hey, guess what?

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
We worked really
hard this month,

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.888 position:50% align:center
and we brought in
some extra money!

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
Listen, sir. Yes,
that show was practically

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:20.190 position:50% align:center
a second death
sentence for us, but...

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
We rose from the dead once and
I know that we can do it again!

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.321 position:50% align:center
And when we do,
we'll be even stronger--

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
It's over, and that's that!

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.699 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
No, it isn't!

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:32.994 position:50% align:center
Now I'm not sure when, exactly,
but we will pay off that debt!

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.871 position:50% align:center
No matter how long
it might take us,

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
we'll keep on giving
it all we've got!

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:41.878 position:50% align:center
I'm done. Just go.

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
But, sir, we're supposed to be
performing at Geil's soon.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
The metal spot where we debuted.

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
We thought if we
went back there,

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:53.390 position:50% align:center
maybe Franchouchou
could get a fresh start.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.975 position:50% align:center
We never sang that
last song you wrote us,

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.311 position:50% align:center
so we're gonna do it
on that stage!

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:01.022 position:50% align:center
And I want you to
be there, Mr. Kotaro.

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:12.617 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Hey, What's
your problem? Ya nerd!

00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:15.078 position:50% align:center
You're all scrunched up
like a Pope's Nose!

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
Look at yourself!

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sakura, say, "I'm a
chicken butt!" Come on!

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
Do it! It'll be funny!

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] I wish I knew
how to get him back

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
to his old self again.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.757 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it sounds like
he's been on a bender

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.300 position:50% align:center
for a solid month now.

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
He may be a little
out there, but I think

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:35.390 position:50% align:center
it'll be hard to operate
without him, if not impossible.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:37.475 position:50% align:center
Hey, girls, I'm just
spit balling here.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.727 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm?

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center
[AI] But, what if this
isn't about the money?

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:44.649 position:50% align:center
And perhaps there's something
he's been hiding from all of us.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:46.192 position:50% align:center
[AI]
I mean, think about it.

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:49.904 position:50% align:center
Why did he choose that time
for us to perform at EFS?

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO]
Good point.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
He couldn't have thought
the event would sell out.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:55.577 position:50% align:center
So, like, he was
in a rush maybe?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.578 position:50% align:center
Why, though?

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:58.538 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I don't know.

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.874 position:50% align:center
Well then,
if Lady Ai is correct,

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:02.584 position:50% align:center
I think we should
try to assist him,

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.170 position:50% align:center
though, we'd need to discern
what the trouble is.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.629 position:50% align:center
I bet we could figure it out

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.798 position:50% align:center
if we went snooping
around in his office.

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.175 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:16.765 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO]
It's open.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.476 position:50% align:center
Hell yeah!

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
