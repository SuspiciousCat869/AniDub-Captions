[SAKURA] Previously on
<i>Zombie Land Saga Revenge</i> :

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.970 position:50% align:center
The top idol group Iron Frill
came to our town!

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.972 position:50% align:center
They'll be packing seats
with fans for sure!

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:15.265 position:50% align:center
I still can't believe
we were picked

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.392 position:50% align:center
to be their opening act
at Saga Arena!

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.269 position:50% align:center
Kotaro isn't taking
chances and is keeping Ai

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.062 position:50% align:center
from performing so
no one recognizes her

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:23.189 position:50% align:center
as Iron Frill's original leader!

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, Ai's been
doing solo gigs

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
while we prepare
for the concert.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.777 position:50% align:center
Franchouchou feels
weird without her.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.612 position:50% align:center
We can't mess up again
like we did at the EFS.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.072 position:50% align:center
The anxiety is real!

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.283 position:50% align:center
To make matters worse,
Iron Frill's new leader, Shiori,

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.951 position:50% align:center
tried to get Ai
to join their group!

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.495 position:50% align:center
We won't let that happen,
no matter what!

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:53.219 position:50% align:center
Listen up, Number Three!
You should join Iron Frill.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:56.389 position:50% align:center
Everything's just fine.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:57.932 position:50% align:center
Ai is not going to abandon us

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.935 position:50% align:center
and she's not gonna join
those girls in Iron Frill.

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.021 position:50% align:center
I mean, aside from the whole
being a zombie thing,

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:04.314 position:50% align:center
she's a part of our group!

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.774 position:50% align:center
One of us.

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:09.611 position:50% align:center
I sure hope you're
right about that.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.573 position:50% align:center
If she were here,
she'd probably yell at me

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.409 position:50% align:center
for being so nervous
about the show.

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:19.996 position:50% align:center
No kidding--Ai would be
in full on rage mode about it.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50% align:center
She's like "I don't wanna
hear that kinda talk.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.668 position:50% align:center
Stop worrying and zombie up!"

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.128 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't tell
the other girls

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:28.338 position:50% align:center
about what we just saw.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:29.964 position:50% align:center
It would only worry them.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:33.843 position:50% align:center
After all, the Saga Arena
show is coming up fast.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.804 position:50% align:center
And we're gonna rock it!

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
That was sick!
You're really bringin' it, Tae!

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.036 position:50% align:center
We've totally got
this show in the bag!

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:24.371 position:50% align:center
[TAE grunts]

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
Junko? Are you in there? Junko!

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.002 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
You okay? You look
a little wobbly.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:34.714 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO]
Huh?

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:39.719 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO gasps]

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.639 position:50% align:center
I thought we were
doing a better job.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50% align:center
Or maybe you just
need a calming nap?

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:48.895 position:50% align:center
I'm fine, really.
Sorry about that.

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:52.524 position:50% align:center
I'm just gonna step outside for
a minute and get some fresh air.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.572 position:50% align:center
So, that was weird.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
She's been acting
strange lately.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
Have you guys noticed?

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50% align:center
I wonder what's up.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.287 position:50% align:center
Junko must be going through
something rough.

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:08.665 position:50% align:center
Ever since Ai started
doing solo performances,

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50% align:center
she's had this super
haunted look in her eyes.

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.294 position:50% align:center
Well, that new arena
ain't gonna rock itself!

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
Hear me? Let's crank
this mother to 11!

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
[LILY, YUGIRI]
Right!

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.426 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Junko must
still be super worried

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
about Ai leaving the group.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50% align:center
I wish there was
something I could do.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
Maybe I could go ask Ai.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.185 position:50% align:center
Man, this sucks!

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
What am I gonna do?

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Ah! What smells so good?

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:39.070 position:50% align:center
One of the customers
from the bar last night

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:41.364 position:50% align:center
offered us a ton of food.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:45.952 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Ahh. And it's
everything Junko loves, too!

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
Ooh, is that beef?

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50% align:center
Yes, but it's reserved for
Ai's packed lunch today.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
Oh yeah.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.461 position:50% align:center
I forgot that she's
recording solo tonight.

00:04:56.796 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
One should never enter a battle
on an empty stomach.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
If the body's not strong,
then the mind will shut down.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
And if all else fails,
remember to smile.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:11.519 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You can count
on me for lunch help!

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
Would you mind setting
the table for me?

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
Make sure that Ai gets some
rice in her lunch box, as well.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Mm-hm! That rice scoop
is around here somewhere.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.574 position:50% align:center
[STAGEHAND 4A]
Yeah, that looks great!

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.534 position:50% align:center
[STAGEHAND 4B] Spots are
all set. Coming through!

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
[STAGEHAND 4A]
Right! Check the bulbs.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.872 position:50% align:center
Would you just look at this?

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.127 position:50% align:center
We'll go over our routines
once everyone is ready. Huh?

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI] We have to put on
our best show tonight.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.802 position:50% align:center
Then she'll finally
see how strong we are.

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
Shiori, got a sec?

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
What's up, Yui?

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:51.059 position:50% align:center
I heard you tried to recruit
a new member to the team

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.687 position:50% align:center
without talking to
the rest of us in advance.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.731 position:50% align:center
Someone from that local Saga
group with the weird name.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:05:58.775 position:50% align:center
[SHIORI]
Yes, I did.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.152 position:50% align:center
She might be working
in obscurity out here,

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.321 position:50% align:center
but don't doubt
her skills for a second.

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:04.739 position:50% align:center
Just think how much
stronger we'd be

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
if we had more talent
to add to our shows.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.869 position:50% align:center
Iron Frill has to
continue evolving.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
That's what makes us top idols.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
That's not the problem, Shiori.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:14.874 position:50% align:center
I'm worried about you.

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.585 position:50% align:center
Uh-- What'd I do?

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.045 position:50% align:center
[YUI]
I know you want her to join us,

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center
but haven't you noticed
the resemblance?

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.008 position:50% align:center
She's like Ai Mizuno's twin.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
[YUI] Sure, she was legendary,
the best center we ever had.

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.183 position:50% align:center
Her name will forever be
attached to Iron Frill,

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:33.685 position:50% align:center
and for good reason.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.855 position:50% align:center
I know that Ai Mizuno
was a big deal once.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
Before. But we've moved on.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.278 position:50% align:center
Look, I want her to
join Iron Frill

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
because I can see her potential.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.949 position:50% align:center
I have no other
motive behind doing it.

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
Okay, girls. Let's run
through the whole set.

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.287 position:50% align:center
[IRON FRILL]
Okay!

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.504 position:50% align:center
Where does Ai belong?

00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:04.132 position:50% align:center
What if she's better off
with Iron Frill?

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:08.720 position:50% align:center
[AI] Junko? Why are you sitting
out here all by yourself?

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.555 position:50% align:center
Don't you have practice?

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.266 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO]
I should get back.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:23.818 position:50% align:center
Is everything okay?

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:26.404 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. I just needed
to take a break.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:28.406 position:50% align:center
It's nothing to worry about.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.492 position:50% align:center
[AI] Wait, was there
a fight or something?

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.327 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO]
No, it's nothing like that.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.037 position:50% align:center
I know you have another
solo gig coming up,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.747 position:50% align:center
so don't worry about us.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.999 position:50% align:center
You should focus
on your own thing.

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:41.127 position:50% align:center
Something is wrong.
Please talk to me.

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO] Okay, fine. Did you like
being the center of Iron Frill

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.884 position:50% align:center
more than being in Franchouchou?

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.552 position:50% align:center
And tell me the truth.

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.055 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.306 position:50% align:center
You're out here
worrying about me

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.183 position:50% align:center
at a crucial time like this?

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:56.685 position:50% align:center
You have to let that question go

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.937 position:50% align:center
before you get
everyone else upset.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
Do you want another EFS
disaster on your hands?

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:04.025 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
But you didn't say no.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.781 position:50% align:center
You didn't answer my question.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
[AI gasps]

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
Hey! What's up,
Ai? Welcome back.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:21.876 position:50% align:center
Was Junko out there with you?

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
Dinner's almost ready so we
should prob'ly tell her--

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:32.429 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Uh. Did she just
give me the brushoff?

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.557 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] She probably
didn't hear me.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.100 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's it.

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:58.538 position:50% align:center
Why, Ai? Why're you so stupid?

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.331 position:50% align:center
[DIRTY HARRY]
Hey there, lonely girl!

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
I thought I was the only one
that cried on this beach!

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
Did you get your heart broken
or somethin' like that?

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:07.505 position:50% align:center
I've been there
m'self a few times.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
Love's a real bummer.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
I can't even count how
often I've been rejected.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
I just keep on fallin' for
the wrong kind of lady.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
I got you, boo.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.683 position:50% align:center
Oh dang, you're
kinda young, huh?

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:19.934 position:50% align:center
Sorry about that.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.562 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't be out here
chatting up someone so--

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
[screams]

Yeah, I guess.

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:32.757 position:50% align:center
But Ai might leave the group
and join Iron Frill!

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
Their leader Shiori
is trying to recruit her.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:36.636 position:50% align:center
She had the nerve
to tell Ai that

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.723 position:50% align:center
Franchouchou wasn't
good enough for her.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50% align:center
I don't know what we'd
do without her with us.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50% align:center
And yet at the same time, I...

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.813 position:50% align:center
I think Ai is more
talented than we are.

Blah, blah, blah,

Franchouchou isn't
good enough for Ai?

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
This isn't about her, baby!
This is actually about you!

00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:58.950 position:50% align:center
A member's gonna pack and leave?

00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
And you're totes cool
with her bailing?

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.496 position:50% align:center
You mean just gonna sit by
and let that happen?

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center

You some kinda chump?

you're sayin' to me!

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:14.132 position:50% align:center
That you're a loser who can't
hack it in the big leagues.

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center
You can't even stop
your friends from leaving.

Poor Junko, letting the world
slip through her stupid fingers.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
Well, I think that is pathetic!

If this mamacita keeps

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center
then I can greet another day.

When people stand in my way,

rock-blockin' me
with logic and rules,

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:53.505 position:50% align:center
I just take up my weapon
and thrash that trash! Uhn!

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.173 position:50% align:center
That's my sweet mantra.

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center

I thought that you were super
depressed just the other day--

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50% align:center
Baby, listen to your soul!

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
That thing's cryin' out
to you, to smash it!

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
And shred it!

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.734 position:50% align:center
Shred those excuses!

Wow, I'm impressed.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.147 position:50% align:center
Kotaro has a magic touch

and contouring cheekbones.

everything worked out.

Anyway, I thought
you should know.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
The only reason we came here was

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:55.061 position:50% align:center
so that you could see
how amazing we are!

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.981 position:50% align:center

a bunch of losers without you!

underestimate Franchouchou.

They've been getting
better every day.

And even I should try harder
if I'm gonna stay in the group.

00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.454 position:50% align:center
Watch them perform.

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:14.873 position:50% align:center

I'm talking about.
