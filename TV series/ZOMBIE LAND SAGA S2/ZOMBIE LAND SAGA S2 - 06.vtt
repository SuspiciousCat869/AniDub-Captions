[SAKURA] Previously on
<i>Zombie Land Saga Revenge</i> .

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.834
A few months have passed since

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:13.667
our epic fail at EFS and
we're still not quite over it.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.041
But it seems like
a lot of good things

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:16.917
are on the horizon
for Franchouchou!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.750
Our Saga Arena concert
filled our spirits,

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:21.250
and Lily landed a spot on
a national TV talent show!

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.750
It's no surprise she
made it to the finals,

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:24.458
but she was up against
a child acting prodigy

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:26.500
who sang the same song
Lily had planned,

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:28.542
which is like, the worst thing
that could ever happen!

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:30.083
But Lily was such a genius

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.500
that she improvised a scat
arrangement at the last minute!

00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:33.083
It was so amazing
that everyone was going

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.000
"skeebity bop bop beep boot do!"

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:38.542
[LILY singing]

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:49.500
What's with the thousand-yard
stare? A new story?

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:52.333
In a few years, you'll have
the same look in your eyes.

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:54.417
Everyone has been
talking about her online.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.000
That girl looks exactly
like Lily Hoshikawa.

00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:58.000
They're also picking up on

00:00:58.083 --> 00:00:59.417
Number Three and
Four's likenesses.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.417
[OKOBA] After that
radio show and Iron Frill

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.041
calling them rivals,
they're trending like crazy.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:05.583
Yeah, but most of
the posts are jokes

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:08.041
about the group being a
collection of doppelgängers.

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:09.083
The more famous you get,

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.625
the more trolls
start to come out.

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:13.375
You were the first one who
made the connection between

00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.417
Number Four and Junko Konno.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.458
You should've started
an exposé that second.

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:20.959
I write the facts,
not a gossip column.

00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:22.542
[INUBASHIRI] The only theory
I've heard that tracks

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:23.625
is that their producer is

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:25.583
intentionally
collecting lookalikes.

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:26.709
Wouldn't be surprised if

00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:28.208
the rest of them
were lookalikes, too.

00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:30.000
Hey, maybe he raised
them from the dead

00:01:30.083 --> 00:01:31.208
like a bunch of zombies!

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.875
Take that trash talk
to Mu, the occult mag.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.375
[INUBASHIRI] Yes sir,
on my way right now!

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:38.125
Just kiddin'.
It's my lunch break.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:43.500
As for "the rest of them." Hmm.

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:21.959
[ALL]
Hm?

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.667
Goood morning!

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.792
--Hello, good morning.
--Morning, Mr. Kotaro.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:31.333
Good morning, sir.

00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:32.959
How are my rotten rockettes?

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:34.625
Gold stars all around
for performing

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.208
the most basic functions
of your jobs lately!

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:38.750
Sure, I guess so.

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:41.083
But I've been thinking about it.
We need to aim even higher.

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:42.959
Aw, yeah! That's more like it!

00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:45.792
And people outside of Saga are
starting to talk about us more.

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:48.834
We've gotta strike while the
iron is hot and get our revenge!

00:03:48.917 --> 00:03:50.542
I like your attitude, Saki!

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.750
[SAKURA] Yeah, we should!
Let's try new stuff!

00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:55.667
All right, let's get down to
business and talk strategy!

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.083
Oh, but wait, we can't do that!

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:01.667
You undead dumbasses
have gotten us

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.667
almost 20 million yen in debt!

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.125
Do you think I just
have wads of cash

00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:06.333
comin' outta my butt?

00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:07.625
We've only gotten
the gigs that we have

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.792
because they were free.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:10.250
This isn't some
Very Special Episode

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.917
where we learn that
money isn't everything--

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.083
this is real life!

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:14.500
There's not gonna be any revenge

00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:16.917
or anything else without
the ducats, you ding-dongs!

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.250
But you're the reason
that we're in debt, you idiot!

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.792
And quit acting like a child!

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.208
Here's the takeaway.

00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:26.625
Get off your tails and go
earn some of that bread!

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:31.000
I hope you've been
paying close attention, Tae!

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:32.458
[SAKURA]
This is actually her day off,

00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:34.125
so she's allowed to take a nap!

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:36.000
I'm sorry, is she
getting paid to sleep?

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:37.083
Come on, ladies!

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.625
Put in a little
more effort. Please?

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:41.875
I didn't raise the walking debt!

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:45.709
Sakura. I sincerely hope
you never think that

00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:47.375
you're a ding-dong.

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.000
I won't?

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:51.834
[LILY]
Have a good day!

--[SAKURA] See ya, Lily!
--[AI] Bye! See you later!

00:04:57.291 --> 00:04:59.125
[YUGIRI]
Mm-hm. Done.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.000
All right, here's today's list.

00:05:04.083 --> 00:05:06.000
Are you sure you
can handle this?

00:05:06.083 --> 00:05:07.959
[TAE grumbles]

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:10.000
Of course, just be
careful out there!

00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:11.917
[TAE grunts]

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.125
[YUGIRI] You look after
her for me, Romero.

[barks]

00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:17.792
[TAE grunts]

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.375
I act like I'm
a big shot writer,

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:56.667
yet I can't land a good story.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.208
Not like I'm in
Tokyo anymore, but...

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.166
It's Zero.

00:06:23.041 --> 00:06:24.709
[OKOBA]
Franchouchou's Number Zero.

00:06:24.792 --> 00:06:25.917
With all the girls
in that group,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.291
she still manages to stand out.

00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:30.792
For one thing, she doesn't sing.
And when she dances,

00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:32.917
it's to the beat of
her own drummer.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.792
She sometimes has
these weird outbursts

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:36.250
and acts a little nutty.

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:38.500
But the other members
act like that's totally normal,

00:06:38.583 --> 00:06:41.667
and rather than get angry,
they seem to find it endearing.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.458
Even weirder,
her mysterious behavior

00:06:43.542 --> 00:06:45.959
has earned her a lot of
love amongst their fans.

00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:48.625
They think she's adorable.

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.166
There's something
peculiar about Zero

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.083
that sets her apart from
the rest of those idols.

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:54.250
[ROMERO barks]

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:56.792
Hello, Zero! Are you
out shopping today?

[TAE grunts]

00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:01.458
I saw that Number Six
on television recently!

00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:04.959
She's so talented. I swear!

00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:07.375
Ah! You're smelling
my fish croquettes.

00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:09.500
Do you want one?

00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:11.166
Remember not to
eat the plastic bag

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.792
like you did last time.

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:14.083
[ROMERO barks]

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:16.792

Oh, you're doing some
grocery shopping today?

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:29.125
Then here. These cookies'll
keep you going.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.208
Not even the kids
are fazed by her.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:40.625
Taking a shortcut?

in quite some time.

00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:29.125
[MARIA]
Thank you for shopping!

00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:33.250
Oh, I didn't see
it was you, Zero!

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:35.625
I saved up enough to get
Mommy a new scooter!

00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:37.750
No, not Mommy. My mom.

00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:39.458
I needed to get her
a replacement,

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:42.875
'cause, her old bike
kinda exploded.

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:44.250
Since then, we've been trying

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:47.250
to think up new ways
to rebrand our team.

00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:48.792
What do you think of this?

00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:52.625
Our name is Dance Team Dorami!

00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:55.959
Could ya throw me a bone here?

00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:58.291
If you're wondering why
we went with a dance team,

00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:00.625
watching Number Two
perform with Franchouchou

00:09:00.709 --> 00:09:04.250
inspired us to try something
different to shake things up.

00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:06.500
All the members got together
to talk through our ideas,

00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:09.041
and decided dancing
was our best bet.

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:10.417
Plus. Mommy won't...

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.542
I mean Mom will have less
to worry about this way.

00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:17.875
Sorry I always start rambling
when you come around.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.250
[MARIA] Did you hear
anything I've said?

00:09:22.542 --> 00:09:24.875
[MARIA] Anyway. Our team
has some big plans.

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:26.375
One day we're gonna
get crazy famous

and perform on the
same stage as you!

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:29.959
I can't wait!

you do that! Ow! Stop!

I see she's chompin'
your buns again.

Are you ready to go yet?

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:46.208
Is it that time already?

Ow! C'mon, stop, Zero!

She's one of the people who
made this tournament possible.

00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:05.625
You know her from Saganship Z.

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:08.709

That's right!

00:10:14.208 --> 00:10:16.208
Let's rock this joint!

00:11:14.166 --> 00:11:19.875
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:24.333
[gasps]

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:27.458
Entering the stage,
our five-time grand champion.

00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:28.625
Representing Saga.

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:31.709
Put your hands
together for Cocco!

00:11:50.792 --> 00:11:55.834
[AUDIENCE screams]

00:11:55.917 --> 00:11:56.917
[COCCO gasps]

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.959
[MC 5A]
Who is that? What a surprise!

00:11:59.041 --> 00:12:01.125
Number Zero from Franchouchou!

00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:03.250
[TAE coos]

00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:04.083
What the--?

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:05.750
Get it, Zero!

00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:08.125
I'm sorry, but the sign-ups
for the competition

00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:10.208
are already closed.

00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:16.500
[MC 5A] Cocco wants
to take her on anyway!

00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:19.625
Our grand champion's
always up for a challenge!

00:12:36.709 --> 00:12:38.291
Oh my goodness!

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:52.917
So fast. Must be causing
some kinda optical illusion.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.542
[OKOBA gasps]

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:03.375
[MC 5A] Aw. Cocco is
down for the count!

00:13:03.458 --> 00:13:05.709
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:13:05.792 --> 00:13:09.291
[TAE coos]

00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:21.583
[MARIA]
Number Zero!

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.208
I can't believe
you won the contest!

00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:24.500
And that breakdance
number looked like

00:13:24.583 --> 00:13:26.291
your head wasn't even spinning!

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:28.417
You looked like The Exorcist
but like in reverse!

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.417
You've got skills!

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.166
And you won the
grand prize money!

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.000
I bet the girls in your
group are gonna be stoked

00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:34.750
to hear about this!

00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:38.166
[MARIA] Whoa, don't
throw it in the trash!

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.041
It's yours!
You earned this cash!

00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:45.083
Don't give it to me!

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:47.959
Give me that bag
of onions instead!

00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:49.041
Why not?

00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:50.834
Whoa, what's the
commotion, kiddoes?

00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:52.083
You've got five seconds

00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:53.583
to tell me what
this is all about.

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.417
Ha? I'm just
trying to get her to

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.792
take her own
money back, officer.

00:13:57.875 --> 00:13:59.083
But she's just acting
like she couldn't

00:13:59.166 --> 00:14:00.875
care less even
though she won it.

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:01.917
You're tellin' me you don't know

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.917
what to do with
some cash winnings?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.250
I guess?

00:14:05.333 --> 00:14:07.500
Well, well, well,
it's your lucky day, ladies,

00:14:07.583 --> 00:14:10.542
'cause I know exactly
what you should do with it.

00:14:13.583 --> 00:14:17.000
So. Is gambling with minors
a normal part of your job?

00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:21.250
This policeman's duty is to
assist all citizens of Saga!

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:28.583
Seems a little sketchy.

00:14:33.834 --> 00:14:36.458
[UKAWA]
Maria, look, it's Korosuke!

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:38.375
Crap, they saw us!

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.875
Keep it civil, girls,

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:43.750
or I'll cart your butts
back to the station!

00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:45.083
[KOROSUKE 9A]
Don't worry, officer.

00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:47.291
We're not gonna start
a fight or anything.

00:14:47.375 --> 00:14:49.041
What's the matter,
are you afraid?

00:14:49.125 --> 00:14:52.500
[KOROSUKE 9C] Zip it, idiot!
We're here for Misa, not you!

00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:53.750
Misa.

00:14:53.834 --> 00:14:55.000
[KOROSUKE 9A] Oh yeah,
you might not have heard

00:14:55.083 --> 00:14:58.375
since you stopped racing bikes.

00:14:58.458 --> 00:15:00.625
After that game of chicken
with Number Two,

00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:02.917
Misa realized she
loved the adrenaline.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.458
Since then, she's been
thirsty to catch

00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:06.000
that ultimate rush again

00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:08.834
and she finally found it
in boat racing.

00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:14.417
I see. So, she's
rebranding, like us.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.125
[KOROSUKE 9C] The sad thing is,
she hasn't won a single race!

00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:20.000
Misa keeps screwing it up!

00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:21.333
It's always the same:

00:15:21.417 --> 00:15:24.083
she accelerates at
the wrong time and wipes out.

00:15:24.166 --> 00:15:25.250
When she first started,

00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:27.417
people called her
the runaway princess.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.834
Then they changed their tune
and started cracking jokes,

00:15:29.917 --> 00:15:31.709
saying she was a total loser!

00:15:31.792 --> 00:15:34.375
Now everyone calls her
Misa the Warthog!

00:15:34.458 --> 00:15:36.625
Try not to crash
and burn out there.

00:15:44.709 --> 00:15:45.750
That's pathetic.

00:15:45.834 --> 00:15:46.917
[KOROSUKE 9A]
What'd you say?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.500
[KOROSUKE 9C]
You wanna eat those words?

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:51.166
If Misa makes some dumb mistake
in this race while I'm watching,

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.291
I'll kill her myself.

00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:53.625
[KOROSUKES gasp]

00:15:53.709 --> 00:15:54.875
Let's head to the bookie.

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:57.458
We've got a round
that we can bet on.

00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:00.875
[DIRTY HARRY]
All right.

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:03.166

cut me in!

Well. I've been, uh,
doing real police stuff.

00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:19.667

[POLICE CHIEF 6A]
Are you at the horse track?

00:16:23.792 --> 00:16:29.250
No, it's definitely not
that track... exactly.

She eats everything!

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.667
Maybe I'm just tired.

Sure, horses are
magical beasts!

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.417
But I'm not anywhere
near one now! I swear!

[VETERAN 6A] I wonder how Misa
the Warthog is gonna do today.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.125
[VETERAN 6B]
She's got a lot of guts,

00:17:28.208 --> 00:17:30.709
but whoo those turns of hers.

That was amazing!

Holy crap! She did it! Wow!

00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:49.500
She pulled off the
legendary eel goby turn!

00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:50.875
I can't believe it.

00:18:50.959 --> 00:18:52.875
It's been forever
since I've seen one.

00:18:52.959 --> 00:18:55.959

returned to Karatsu!

That was a damn fine race.

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:12.625
I couldn't take
my eyes off of it.

00:19:12.709 --> 00:19:14.291
It might not've been
the horse track,

00:19:14.375 --> 00:19:16.375
but that was still
an awesome throw down!

00:19:16.458 --> 00:19:18.583
Why didn't I bet on it?

00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:29.583

bet on, Number Zero?

getting any answers,

I have even more questions
and nothing to show for it.

Whoa, 20 million yen.

That's some serious

What does this mean
for us, you guys?

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.417
So if she actually won
that money and it's ours...

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.208
Then we can pay off our debt.

[INUBASHIRI] Hey, maybe he
raised them from the dead

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.333
like a bunch of zombies!

[SAKURA]
It's me, Sakura!

00:23:35.208 --> 00:23:37.000
You never can tell which way
things will turn out, huh?

00:23:37.083 --> 00:23:39.000
Just like I never thought
I'd be a zombie!

00:23:39.083 --> 00:23:41.750
