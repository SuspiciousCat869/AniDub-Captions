00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:36.678 position:50% align:center
If I'm right, she's the
legendary courtesan

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:38.888 position:50% align:center
who moved to Saga
at the end of last year.

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.640 position:50% align:center
"Legendary"?

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
Come on. You mean you
haven't heard of her?

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.855 position:50% align:center
Pay more attention
to town gossip.

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
She's a renowned
courtesan named Yugiri.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
Her performances were unlike

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:53.570 position:50% align:center
anything anyone in Edo
had ever seen.

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
Men and women alike revered her.

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
Yugiri was in high demand,

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.700 position:50% align:center
to the point that her
prices skyrocketed

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:00.285 position:50% align:center
to an obscene amount.

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:03.204 position:50% align:center
No one could afford her
entertainment anymore.

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
Leaders of the restoration
fought over her,

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
and it's rumored
that the Meiji court

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:09.210 position:50% align:center
almost fell apart because of it.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:12.339 position:50% align:center
And now she lives in Saga?

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
Don't fall in love.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
I'm not in love!

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:19.512 position:50% align:center
You couldn't possibly
handle a woman like that.

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.681 position:50% align:center
She's from a different world.

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:27.729 position:50% align:center
Maybe I could learn
more about her world.

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center
[sneezes]

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.599 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI]
Hello again.

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI gasps]

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:15.360 position:50% align:center
You didn't need to go through
such trouble just for me.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
I know it's not much,

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
but I wanted to say
thank you for, uh...

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.241 position:50% align:center
I am touched that you
thought of me though.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
Thank you. But you should
run along home, now.

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
The people in town
might get the wrong idea.

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:35.547 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI] But. I don't care
what they think.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:41.219 position:50% align:center
See. All this talk about you
being from a different world.

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
The complicated details about
your history don't matter to me!

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
In our Saga. It'll be...

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:56.359 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI]
Pardon me!

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:20.175 position:50% align:center
Does a man by the name of
Kiichi Momozaki live here?

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:27.974 position:50% align:center
It's Saga!

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
I am Saga!

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
No. Saga is me!

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
Oh my. Are you
all right, my lord?

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
Grampa, did you wander off?

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:47.535 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI gasps]

00:13:47.619 --> 00:13:50.372 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI] This is a remedy for
colds and other illnesses.

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.707 position:50% align:center
A very nourishing
collection of herbs.

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:55.418 position:50% align:center
I asked an old acquaintance
to send it to me.

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
That's so kind
of you. Thank you.

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
I was feeling a little guilty.

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
You braved that
blazing sun just to

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
bring me a simple
gift of gratitude.

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:05.512 position:50% align:center
Aw, it's nothing.

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:08.139 position:50% align:center
Besides, I wanted to do it.

00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
It was so thoughtful.

00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
Since I arrived in Saga, you're
the first one to come calling.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:16.147 position:50% align:center
Other than my dance students.

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI] I must apologize
for my grandpa earlier.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.571 position:50% align:center
He's a little unwell.

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:26.199 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI] He seemed like
an interesting man to me.

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.868 position:50% align:center
He was already on the decline,

00:14:28.952 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
but I think when Saga lost
its name, he got even worse.

00:14:32.914 --> 00:14:35.041 position:50% align:center
He started ranting
some nonsense about

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:36.710 position:50% align:center
how he'd be able
to raise the dead

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:39.629 position:50% align:center
if only he had
his old powers back.

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:42.799 position:50% align:center
About eight years ago,

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:46.052 position:50% align:center
a big battle took place
right here in Saga.

00:14:46.136 --> 00:14:48.388 position:50% align:center
And my father was killed.

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
After that,
I had no place to go.

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center
I spent my days
cowering in the wilderness.

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:56.980 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
would've happened

00:14:57.063 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
if Gramps hadn't found me.

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
I owe him more than
I could ever give him.

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
The only thing he cares about,

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:08.116 position:50% align:center
the only thing
he wants in return,

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:10.160 position:50% align:center
is for me to save Saga.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:13.455 position:50% align:center
At first, I was confused
by what that meant.

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:16.207 position:50% align:center
But then, when Saga
lost its name,

00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:18.168 position:50% align:center
it felt like everything
my father died

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
trying to protect slipped away.

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:23.715 position:50% align:center
And Saga might vanish
from people's hearts, too.

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
But I couldn't let that happen.

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.386 position:50% align:center
I think that fate
is responsible for

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.513 position:50% align:center
bringing my grampa
and I together.

00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
So that I could find
my purpose in life.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:39.189 position:50% align:center
[HIBIYA]
Yugiri, from this day forward,

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:41.649 position:50% align:center
this is where you'll be living.

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.736 position:50% align:center
[ROMERO barking]

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.906 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI] Finally. I have
a clear vision for the future.

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:51.201 position:50% align:center
I know in my heart
what I want to do now.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.787 position:50% align:center
I want to create a new Saga.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
A place where it doesn't matter

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
what your status is or
who you were before.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
A place where anyone can choose
their own paths in life!

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
And they can stay
true to themselves!

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
I see. That sounds like
a beautiful place to live.

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:16.976 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI]
Take one! Please, take one, sir!

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.772 position:50% align:center
[ITOU] You, there!
You wanna get arrested?

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.191 position:50% align:center
Very funny.

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.860 position:50% align:center
You never give up, do you?

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
Um. Yugiri helped me out some,

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.494 position:50% align:center
fixing the composition
and stuff.

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:42.168 position:50% align:center
[SAKI chuckles] There there.
It's okay, don't cry.

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
[ITOU]
I'm here with our dinner.

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:06.359 position:50% align:center
Do forgive me, sir.

00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:09.738 position:50% align:center
I felt an eerie presence and
perhaps I'm a little unnerved.

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:13.700 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI] I'm so sorry!
I know, I'm running late.

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:17.328 position:50% align:center
Itou? You came early.

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:21.041 position:50% align:center
I guess I couldn't wait to meet
the legendary courtesan, Yugiri.

00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:23.501 position:50% align:center
Look. This big one is for you.

00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:26.254 position:50% align:center
So huge! You actually
caught that thing

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:29.049 position:50% align:center
in the Fukushoe River? Wow.

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
Tasty. I see your
exceptional skills

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
extend to cooking as well.

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
The man who arranged
my freedom for me

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
taught me all kinds
of new talents.

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:59.788 position:50% align:center
They've helped me to live
in the outside world since.

00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
I bet he did.

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you should do the same.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI]
Same what?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.050 position:50% align:center
I mean it's never a bad
idea to learn new skills.

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.260 position:50% align:center
You could become
a scholar, or a doctor.

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:15.804 position:50% align:center
If you really want
to help people,

00:18:15.887 --> 00:18:18.139 position:50% align:center
you should focus
on realistic goals.

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:19.557 position:50% align:center
Instead of wasting
your time trying to

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:22.310 position:50% align:center
bring back the
glory days of Saga.

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
[ITOU] You happened upon this
nice lady, maybe it was a sign.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.118 position:50% align:center
You know, maybe it's time
for you to start a family?

00:18:38.201 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
Being the head of a household

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:41.746 position:50% align:center
gives a man a feeling
of responsibility.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.623 position:50% align:center
Don't you want that?

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
[sputtering] No way!
Are you stupid?

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:52.674 position:50% align:center
Seriously, what are you saying?

00:18:52.757 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
What on earth made you
say something so crazy--

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.893 position:50% align:center
Oh, my! [gasps]

00:19:03.977 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
A-Are you all right?
Lord Kiichi?

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:11.067 position:50% align:center
[laughs] He's always been
such a lightweight.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
[ITOU]
That's all right.

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.119 position:50% align:center
Have one with me.

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
No. I'm fine.

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:31.963 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI]
Tell me, Lord Itou.

00:19:32.047 --> 00:19:35.300 position:50% align:center
Just how long have you and
Lord Kiichi known each other?

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
We only met two years ago.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
I heard about some
oddball who was

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
passing out strange
pamphlets in the streets.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:44.601 position:50% align:center
I was amused at first.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.603 position:50% align:center
People seemed to ignore him.

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
Walking right past him
as if he weren't there.

00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
Yet he never gave up.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.443 position:50% align:center
He was so determined.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.446 position:50% align:center
There had to be better ways
to get the word out, but...

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:59.240 position:50% align:center
To be honest, he's a fool.

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:04.746 position:50% align:center
This country's changed.

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:07.582 position:50% align:center
And it's going to
keep changing fast.

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
Nothing good will ever come
of clinging to history.

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.171 position:50% align:center
I don't think Kiichi
has any interest

00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
in bringing back the past.

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
He wants to create
a more progressive Saga.

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:23.515 position:50% align:center
It might be nothing more
than a fantasy right now.

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center
But he wants it, and I
think that I want it, too.

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
To live in that Saga.

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
Sooner or later,
reality will set in

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:42.325 position:50% align:center
