[SAKURA] Why's it so important
for me to be an idol?

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:12.345 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] Welcome to the Zombie
Land Saga Project, baby!

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.805 position:50% align:center
[AI] We're gonna do
the local idol thing?

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:15.181 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
We needed a new name.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.641 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
What do I do?

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.435 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO] Don't freak out.
I'll be there to back you up.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.936 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] Whether or not
you have what it takes...

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.730 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI] Then I would much
rather the seven of us fail...

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.606 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] Could we go back
to the way things were?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.109 position:50% align:center
[XU FU] It was a crazy idea
in the first place.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:28.778 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] This project
has a crucial deadline!

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.157 position:50% align:center
[OKOBA] No doubt about it.
All those girls are dead.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
[INUBASHIRI] Hey, maybe he
raised them from the dead

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:35.910 position:50% align:center
like a bunch of zombies!

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:14.092 position:50% align:center
[SAKI] Damn! This article
makes us look so awesome!

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:15.552 position:50% align:center
Well, that proves it then.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.555 position:50% align:center
We're just not Franchouchou
unless we're together!

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:22.225 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and they even
talked about our first album!

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.643 position:50% align:center
How it came out
after the concert

00:02:23.727 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center
and took the Saga
idol scene by storm!

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.564 position:50% align:center
I would've used
the word "magical,"

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.024 position:50% align:center
but this is fine, too!

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:31.276 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA] This writer
always covers us.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.445 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and he usually
gives us fair criticism,

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:35.572 position:50% align:center
so we can trust his opinion.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.866 position:50% align:center
We should listen to him!

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.617 position:50% align:center
I betcha we can bring in
a thousand people

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:40.618 position:50% align:center
for the next show!

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:41.953 position:50% align:center
If we start getting cocky,

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.371 position:50% align:center
then we're sure to
make a mistake.

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50% align:center
We should focus.
Work calmly and steadily.

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.960 position:50% align:center
Cool! So I say we
do that nerdy crap

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:52.005 position:50% align:center
Junko just said and
bring in that thousand!

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:54.466 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:56.843 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] If the movies
have taught me anything,

00:02:56.926 --> 00:03:01.765 position:50% align:center
it's that zombies with big, fat
heads are way easier to kill!

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.183 position:50% align:center
Look, if you
brain-rotted suckers

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.976 position:50% align:center
keep on riding
the high from Arpino,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.020 position:50% align:center
then it's boom! Headshot!

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:10.231 position:50% align:center
Next show will be at
Ekimae Fudosan Stadium!

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
EFS if you're nasty!

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.986 position:50% align:center
Wait, I'm confused.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.863 position:50% align:center
Where'd you say again?

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.909 position:50% align:center
[LILY] Yeah, I don't think I've
ever heard of that venue before.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
Eh, not like I care
what they call the place.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.288 position:50% align:center
Point is, we're puttin'
a thousand butts

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.706 position:50% align:center
in the seats this time!

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.960 position:50% align:center
Actually, the name won't be
changed until February.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
I see somebody's
done their homework.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:35.590 position:50% align:center
Oh, no wonder it
doesn't ring a bell.

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:38.218 position:50% align:center
So what's it called now?

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
The Best Amenity Stadium.
The huge one in Tosu.

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
Isn't that?

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50% align:center
I promise, I'll be okay.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:53.316 position:50% align:center
The biggest issue is
the size of the place.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
I think the capacity
is around...

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
Twenty-five thousand.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.824 position:50% align:center
Twenty-five thousand?

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
That's like fifty Arpinos!

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center
And with the field, there's
standing room for even more.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.330 position:50% align:center
If this thing goes south,

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
could I take out
that many people?

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:10.500 position:50% align:center
This is a really big deal--

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center
There's no way
we'll pull it off!

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
The concert is scheduled
for March 8th.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.465 position:50% align:center
Don't be an idiot!

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
A whole stadium?
Here in Saga?

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:21.511 position:50% align:center
We could never fill it up!

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:22.762 position:50% align:center
Iron Frill did it
back then, but--

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
So, that was them then
and this is you now!

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
Do you knuckleheads
honestly believe Iron Frill

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:32.897 position:50% align:center
was better ten years ago
than you are today,

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
because that is idiotic!

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center

All except one of you, that is.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
Don't single me out or anything.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.955 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] I hand-selected
you girls to come back to life

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
and bring Saga to life, too!

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
You can accomplish anything!

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
So on March 8th, EFS will be
jam-packed with your fans!

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.006 position:50% align:center
I say. Get the crowd
all fired up

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.924 position:50% align:center
and encore with that new number!

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
This bomb is still lit!

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:08.767 position:50% align:center
Soon, everyone will
know Franchouchou!

[SAKI] Shades is always
drinkin' the dumbass juice,

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.982 position:50% align:center
but even I can tell he chugged
the whole bottle this time.

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.233 position:50% align:center
Is this really gonna work?

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.486 position:50% align:center
Normally, I'd say
it's impossible.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
You're right,
it's just not realistic.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but...

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:26.326 position:50% align:center
I know. We're long past
considering what's realistic.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:27.535 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
Good point.

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
If Mr. Kotaro's really
this dead-set on it,

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:33.333 position:50% align:center
maybe he's got a good reason
we don't know about yet.

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
[LILY] Doesn't he just
pull stuff out of his butt?

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
I say we try!

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.176 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

a big risk this is?

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.263 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I dunno if we'll be successful,

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.933 position:50% align:center
but if it's a chance for all of
us to sing and dance together,

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.851 position:50% align:center
then I'm more than up for it!

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:55.939 position:50% align:center
What matters to me is
performing with you guys!

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
You're on.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
You're right, the show
at Arpino was terrible,

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.194 position:50% align:center
and we made it through that!

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center
Besides, everything that
we do is bold and brazen.

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I mean,
we're already zombies.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
So it's not like this is
gonna kill us, am I right?

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.287 position:50% align:center
Just listening to
each of you talk

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.998 position:50% align:center

we can actually do this.

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of shocked.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:20.922 position:50% align:center
[AI sighs] What am I
gonna do with you crazies?

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
For this to work out,

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
we need the show to be
even better than Arpino.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.594 position:50% align:center
If we do anything
less than our best,

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
then we're certain to fail.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.515 position:50% align:center
Okay. Now whip us
into shape, Ai!

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
No problem!

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.394 position:50% align:center

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:17.727 position:50% align:center
Because of your heroic act,
Saga will be forever changed!

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
Even if Saga itself is plunged
into darkness and despair,

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:23.650 position:50% align:center
the seven of you
will still remain,

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:29.155 position:50% align:center
a bright light shining eternally
throughout that pit of oblivion!

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
Never forget!

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.867 position:50% align:center
I hand-selected each of you
to come back from the dead!

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:35.495 position:50% align:center
To become the
new heroes of Saga!

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:37.872 position:50% align:center
And when your revenge
is set into motion,

00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:44.462 position:50% align:center
that's the signal for Saga's
counterattack to begin!

[sneezes]

00:16:47.424 --> 00:16:48.758 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
What's with the sneeze?

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:49.676 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
Little cold.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:50.719 position:50% align:center
[LILY]
I thought it was cute.

00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
That killed the whole thing!

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.847 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
Uh, shut up!

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
[OKOBA]
Kotaro Tatsumi, isn't it?

00:17:05.483 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
I'm Arata Okoba.
I write for Sagazine.

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:12.699 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I read your
articles pretty often.

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
It's a shame what
happened a year ago,

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:16.578 position:50% align:center
but it seems like
your girls have been

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:19.414 position:50% align:center
really outdoing
themselves recently.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
Are you here to reflect
on past mistakes?

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.462 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'm not doing
personal interviews--

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
[OKOBA] You stay in my
line of work long enough

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
and you end up
with acquaintances

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.425 position:50% align:center
all over the place.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
That said, it took me a while
to connect the dots this time.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:36.556 position:50% align:center
[OKOBA]
Sakura Minamoto.

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
Saki Nikaido.

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:39.017 position:50% align:center
Ai Mizuno.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
Miss Junko Konno.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
Lily Hoshikawa-slash-Masao Go.

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
And Tae Yamada.

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
All of those people are dead.

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:51.821 position:50% align:center
Sadly, I wasn't able to dig up
any intel about Number Five.

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
Heh. Y'ready to talk?

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:58.286 position:50% align:center
What exactly are these women?

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.081 position:50% align:center
These pictures beg
a lot of questions.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
[OKOBA] I can have their
graves exhumed, you know.

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
Why write something like this?

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
[OKOBA] Because I feel
compelled to stop you

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:11.299 position:50% align:center
from trying to profit
off these poor,

00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:12.967 position:50% align:center
deceased girls by
turning them into

00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
singing and dancing clowns.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
Is that reason enough for you?

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:19.724 position:50% align:center
Feel free to stay silent,

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
but after the article
is published,

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
your big secret will be out.

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:25.188 position:50% align:center
It's shocking news.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.565 position:50% align:center
I wonder what
the public will think.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
They'll be here next month.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
Performing in a big concert.

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:32.779 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
It's their revenge.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
You're insane!

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.951 position:50% align:center
Why would you want to
recreate such a disaster?

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center
How dare you turn the dead
into cheap entertainment!

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
You can publish
anything you like.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
But you'll never
stop Franchouchou.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:52.048 position:50% align:center
[OKOBA] I'll make sure
they don't take that stage.

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:02.517 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN 10A gasps]

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
[CREWMAN 10B]
You okay down there?

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.442 position:50% align:center
[XU FU] The high school girl
kept her mouth shut,

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
but I doubt it'll work out
that way this time.

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
Though, if I'm being honest,

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
I was a little surprised that
the word didn't get out sooner.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:20.952 position:50% align:center
And the reporter's
not your only problem.

00:19:21.036 --> 00:19:22.537 position:50% align:center
Things have been rough lately,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.832 position:50% align:center
but this'll be worse than some
scratches and stolen clothes.

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
I don't care about that crap.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
This show is gonna be
a roaring success.

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
I won't screw up again.

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:34.382 position:50% align:center
[XU FU]
Twelve years ago.

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:36.885 position:50% align:center
When I first ran into that
gloomy, half-crazed kid,

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
I never thought he could
make all of this happen.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.890 position:50% align:center
If I wasn't gloomy
and half-crazed,

00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:44.309 position:50% align:center
then I doubt I would
have believed you.

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.436 position:50% align:center
That you're immortal,
fighting a curse

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.314 position:50% align:center
that's been at work
in Saga for centuries.

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
And that part about how
you can revive the dead.

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center
But you got what you wanted.

00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:57.697 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] Not yet.
I still have to find a way

00:19:57.781 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
to stop your prophecy
from coming true.

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:02.994 position:50% align:center
As the Reiwa era starts,

00:20:03.078 --> 00:20:05.330 position:50% align:center
Saga will face
a cataclysmic threat.

00:20:05.413 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
A powerful phenomenon will cause
thoughts of Saga to disappear.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
And even memories of Saga's
past will be lost forever.

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.964 position:50% align:center
Of course, things were
already looking dire enough

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center
with the population decreasing.

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.760 position:50% align:center
Exactly. So the obvious solution

00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:22.055 position:50% align:center
was to create something in Saga
that's impossible to forget.

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:24.140 position:50% align:center
[XU FU] Gathering young women
killed by the curse

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
who otherwise would have
brought glory to this region,

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
and making them into
a popular idol group

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
that the people of Saga
can be proud of?

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.315 position:50% align:center
I admit, it's a great idea,

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
this Mount Mifuneyama
Rakuen Project of yours--

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:37.904 position:50% align:center
It's called the
Zombie Land Saga Project.

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:40.532 position:50% align:center
That's what I meant.

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:43.952 position:50% align:center
This world is shaped
by the actions of men.

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
You're wrong there.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.498 position:50% align:center
Men and zombies.

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
It's both. Hand in hand.

I wonder if Kotaro's okay.

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:07.142 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
Eh, he'll be fine.

00:21:07.225 --> 00:21:08.435 position:50% align:center
[SAKURA]
I sure hope so.

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:09.894 position:50% align:center
[SAKI] When he gets back,
we oughtta blast him

00:21:09.978 --> 00:21:11.855 position:50% align:center

Tomorrow's when our badass
revenge officially starts!

We should probably
get some rest.

Yeah!

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:28.163 position:50% align:center

a hell of an article to write.

the dead like that!

I'll show him.

There's still a lot
to be anxious about,

but it would take
a total catastrophe

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.753 position:50% align:center
