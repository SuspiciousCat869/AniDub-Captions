[REBEL 9A] We must inspire
the people of Saga

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.225 position:50% align:center
to rise up and resist as one!

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:18.685 position:50% align:center
We can rid this country
of the crooks

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.145 position:50% align:center
who've taken over everything!

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
This time, the samurai
of Saga will prevail!

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.274 position:50% align:center
Yugiri!

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:27.986 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI]
Thanks for the medicine.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.821 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to trouble you for it.

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.615 position:50% align:center
Has your grandfather's condition
improved recently?

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.409 position:50% align:center
There hasn't been much change.

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:36.703 position:50% align:center
He mostly stays in his bed.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:38.079 position:50% align:center
Even though I've
finally figured out

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
a way for us to reclaim Saga.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.460 position:50% align:center
You seem to have plenty of
comrades on your side now.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.462 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do!
And as a matter of fact,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:47.964 position:50% align:center
we've all been putting
together a petition!

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
See, look at it!

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
We're taking this straight to
the prefectural magistrate!

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.720 position:50% align:center
We're also going to
talk to as many

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:56.139 position:50% align:center
of the elders around
here as possible.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.559 position:50% align:center
I'm sure that'll make
a sizable difference.

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:00.727 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.770 position:50% align:center
[REBEL 9A]
How can we accomplish anything

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:03.438 position:50% align:center
with you acting like
such a coward?

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:04.939 position:50% align:center
You're no samurai!

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.191 position:50% align:center
[REBEL 9B]
Step outside!

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:07.859 position:50% align:center
It's time someone
beat some sense into you!

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:10.278 position:50% align:center
It sounds like they're
getting kind of worked up.

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.655 position:50% align:center
I should go in and intervene.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.033 position:50% align:center
[REBEL 9B]
How dare you?

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:16.868 position:50% align:center
[REBEL 9A] I don't care
if it's disrespectful.

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.620 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you the truth!

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
Dammit all.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center
How did I get myself
roped into this?

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
It's all in fun!

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.443 position:50% align:center
He offered to take a photograph
of us at no cost.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.237 position:50% align:center
Right. If this sample
picture is enough

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.406 position:50% align:center
to attract more customers,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.160 position:50% align:center
then that's one step on the
journey to revitalizing Saga.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
Lord Itou, is there
a reason that you

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center
don't want your
photograph taken?

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:31.211 position:50% align:center
W-Wait a minute, I think
I know what's happening!

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.962 position:50% align:center
Are you afraid it's
going to steal your soul?

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center
[ITOU]
Of course not!

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.340 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI]
You don't need to be scared,

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.591 position:50% align:center
that's only a superstition!

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
[ITOU]
I told you, that's not it!

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
I'm about to
take the picture now.

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:41.930 position:50% align:center
You need to hold still, please.

00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI chuckles]

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.183 position:50% align:center
[PHOTOGRAPHER 9A]
Get ready.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI] Either way,
it'll be nice to have.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI]
Heh! Sure will!

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:49.646 position:50% align:center
[ITOU sighs]

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
I know it's a bit early,

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
but let's go get
a drink, shall we?

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.903 position:50% align:center
Actually, there's something
else I need take care of--

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:58.571 position:50% align:center
[REBEL 9A]
Sir Momozaki!

00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
But there's always next time!

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.451 position:50% align:center
Bye, Yugiri.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
Saga's old ruling class.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center
I'm assuming those men
must be survivors of the war.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center
You should be careful.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.799 position:50% align:center
What makes you say that, milord?

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
[REBEL 9C] Those damned
merchants finally came around.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.231 position:50% align:center
This should keep us
afloat for a while.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
[REBEL 9B]
And Sir Momozaki.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50% align:center
Should we let him
in on this, too?

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
Don't bother with that.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
Let's concentrate
on the weapons.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
Those cannons Nabeshima

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center
is bringing from Tsukiji
will be in place

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
to target the main road
to Nagasaki, right?

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
[REBEL 9B] Yes, one of the
merchants gave me his word.

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
[XU FU]
For better or for worse,

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
Kiichi is the one who
accepted them as comrades

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
in his efforts to save Saga.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.466 position:50% align:center
I suppose what will be, will be.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
This world will always be shaped
by the actions of men.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
That's karma for you.

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:11.561 position:50% align:center
[XU FU coughs]

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.313 position:50% align:center
Lord Kiichi says
you haven't been

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.190 position:50% align:center
taking the medicine I sent you.

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
Can you explain to me
why that is?

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:18.693 position:50% align:center
[XU FU]
It's pointless.

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:22.322 position:50% align:center
I am Saga-- No, Saga is me.

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
If this land is to
fade from existence,

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
then there'll be nothing
left of me, either.

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:31.081 position:50% align:center
So, despite Lord Kiichi's
efforts to bring change,

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
you believe that Saga's
fate is set in stone?

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
Kiichi is special.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.545 position:50% align:center
Even in these dark times.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
I can see that the star
of Saga's salvation

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
shines over him.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.385 position:50% align:center
But this is life and death now!

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:46.554 position:50% align:center
And only the hands of men
control such things.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
With the state I'm in,

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
I don't have enough strength
to offer him any real help.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.311 position:50% align:center
Here, drink this, sir.

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center
That terrible medicine?
But I just told you--

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
[XU FU screams]

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI] It may be unpleasant,
but take it every day,

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
until the box is empty.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
Wait. Just hang on a second!

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.675 position:50% align:center
All this anger we're feeling,

00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.720 position:50% align:center
and you think a measly petition
will solve everything?

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.346 position:50% align:center
B-But you don't understand!

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.639 position:50% align:center
Please hear me out,
it's not like

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50% align:center
we're trying to
start a war here--!

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center
Forget about that,
what we need now,

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
more than anything
else, is action!

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.313 position:50% align:center
If everyone could give me
a little more time to work then,

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:40.150 position:50% align:center
I swear, we'll be able
to get our Saga back!

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:44.946 position:50% align:center
[REBEL 9A] Nothing!
You could never understand

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.575 position:50% align:center
how it felt for us to watch
Saga die, eight years ago.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.543 position:50% align:center
[ITOU]
Had enough yet?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center
You did everything
that you could do.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
But the only path ahead
of you now is destruction.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
The Saga War survivors
are arming themselves.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.891 position:50% align:center
The army won't ignore that.

I can't believe
you still haven't

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:26.112 position:50% align:center
wrapped your head
around that fact.

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:28.448 position:50% align:center
But what's going to happen
to the place we love

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
if I just give up now?

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:34.287 position:50% align:center
If I lose hope,
then so will everybody else!

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
They'll think
Saga's a lost cause.

And they'll stop trying forever!

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.794 position:50% align:center
It can't end that way!

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.382 position:50% align:center

what we need now,

more than anything
else, is action!

Itou. Why would you...?

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
How could you do this?

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:20.782 position:50% align:center
I don't understand--

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
Tell me, Kiichi.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.702 position:50% align:center
Will you give up now?

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
Does this change your mind?

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:30.166 position:50% align:center
My job is to keep an eye out
for rebels lurking within Saga.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
It would've been fine if you'd
kept to your childish campaign.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
But now you've taken it
a step too far.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center

Itou, no.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.636 position:50% align:center
[ITOU]
This is all that I have.

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:47.267 position:50% align:center
[ITOU] I told you,
this place is barbaric.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.894 position:50% align:center
It's full of people
who are like me,

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
the kind of people who don't
know any other way to live.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
Well, say something!

00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.988 position:50% align:center

[ROMERO barking]

[YUGIRI] They're not
going to stop searching.

00:13:40.987 --> 00:13:43.907 position:50% align:center
You must leave Saga,
at least for now.

00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.787 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI]
Why did this happen?

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
I never fully understood
the situation.

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:55.335 position:50% align:center
But, now... Itou...

00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:57.128 position:50% align:center
And my comrades!

00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:59.547 position:50% align:center
It's my fault! All mine!

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
I stirred this whole thing up
and now everyone is dead!

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:03.885 position:50% align:center
I'm a fool!

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:07.263 position:50% align:center
I can't create a new Saga!

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI]
Please, just go.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI] They're only after me
and I don't care anymore.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.150 position:50% align:center
You don't have to die.

[gasps]

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI] I've heard enough
whining, Lord Kiichi!

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:25.865 position:50% align:center
While it may be true that

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
this dream you've
been chasing after

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:30.036 position:50% align:center
is childish at best
and impossible at worst,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.205 position:50% align:center
that dream was
the catalyst that finally

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.082 position:50% align:center
began to bring actual change!

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
And now you have
a responsibility

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.127 position:50% align:center
to see it through to the end!

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.253 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:39.587 position:50% align:center

Many of the hearts you inspired

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.923 position:50% align:center
are no longer beating.

00:14:42.007 --> 00:14:44.676 position:50% align:center
So you must ensure that
your dream comes true,

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:48.263 position:50% align:center
or their lives will have
been lost for nothing!

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
You truly believe
that a new Saga

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:52.809 position:50% align:center
would bring back the way of life
we long for, don't you?

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.102 position:50% align:center
Even when you were
mocked for it,

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:56.021 position:50% align:center
you had faith and pressed on.

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:59.566 position:50% align:center
If you turn your back on that,
your efforts will be wasted!

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI]
Go through Mitsuse Pass,

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:13.079 position:50% align:center
then take a boat from
Hakata to Nagasaki.

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:17.417 position:50% align:center
After that, read the letter,
and then you'll know what to do.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
I've asked a few of my
oldest friends to assist you.

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
Trust me, if you have
their support,

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.216 position:50% align:center
then no one will ever harm you.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.761 position:50% align:center
Even the government
can't touch you.

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center
It's not much,
but it's all that I can offer.

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:37.729 position:50% align:center
After you survive this,
the next step will be up to you.

00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
Milord. I long to see the Saga
that only you can create.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.401 position:50% align:center
Make me proud.

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:57.624 position:50% align:center
[KIICHI]
I swear, on my very life.

00:15:57.707 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
I'll establish a new Saga!

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center
It'll be everything
we dreamed of!

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:07.634 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:19.562 position:50% align:center
This is a surprise,

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:22.691 position:50% align:center
even from the
legendary courtesan.

00:16:22.774 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
Who was it that
set you free, Yugiri?

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:29.489 position:50% align:center
There's something known as
the Sheathed Kichiemon.

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.241 position:50% align:center
Have you ever
heard of it, milord?

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.952 position:50% align:center
[gasps] The Demon of Hibiya!

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
I'd better take this
seriously, then.

[gasps]

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

I guess you're stuck with
the short end of the stick.

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.260 position:50% align:center
A place the people can be free

00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:35.764 position:50% align:center
to live out the lives
that they desire.

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
[YUGIRI] By the time this letter
finds its way into your hands,

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:21.434 position:50% align:center
it's more than probable
I am no longer alive.

00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
A few of my old
acquaintances have

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.856 position:50% align:center
agreed to look after
Lord Kiichi going forward.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
However, after the
blood that's been spilled,

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
and with the increasing signs
of rebellion in Saga,

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:36.324 position:50% align:center
someone must accept the
responsibility and be punished.

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:38.993 position:50% align:center
In the end,
this entire incident,

00:18:39.077 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
as well as my own
involvement in it,

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
will be treated as though
it never happened.

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
If Lord Kiichi
inquires about me,

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:50.422 position:50% align:center
please tell him that I was able
to depart from Saga safely.

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
As for you, if you
truly are Saga itself,

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
I trust that you will be
a courageous guide

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
for the new land that
Lord Kiichi creates.

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center

How are you liking this era?

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.530 position:50% align:center
It's wonderful so far,
and surprisingly,

00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:45.990 position:50% align:center
entertaining such
a large audience is fun.

00:22:46.074 --> 00:22:47.784 position:50% align:center
More so than I thought.

00:22:49.536 --> 00:22:51.413 position:50% align:center
What are they called?
The Sagaettes--

00:22:51.496 --> 00:22:53.498 position:50% align:center
We call ourselves Franchouchou.

00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:55.792 position:50% align:center
Ah! That was it!

00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:58.420 position:50% align:center
That young man
certainly created a fuss,

00:22:58.503 --> 00:23:01.589 position:50% align:center
but it turns out it amounted
to something, after all.

00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:03.299 position:50% align:center
Yes it did, indeed.

00:23:03.383 --> 00:23:04.884 position:50% align:center
Who would've thought?

00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:07.095 position:50% align:center
And I'm truly grateful.

00:23:09.681 --> 00:23:12.392 position:50% align:center
It's my turn to
carry the torch now.

00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:13.935 position:50% align:center
In present-day Saga.

00:23:14.019 --> 00:23:16.187 position:50% align:center
I plan to choose
a path for myself,

00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:18.106 position:50% align:center
and walk bravely.

00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:22.944 position:50% align:center
Luckily, I have comrades
who share that goal.

[SAKI] Saki here!
If there's anyone I can't beat,

it's Big Sis, but if our
big comeback is at stake,

00:23:38.418 --> 00:23:39.919 position:50% align:center
