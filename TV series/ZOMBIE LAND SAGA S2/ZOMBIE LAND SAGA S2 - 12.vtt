00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:11.011 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 12A] We've been
working with the power

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:12.345 position:50% align:center
and communications companies,

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.680 position:50% align:center
and they've got
cell phone service

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.974 position:50% align:center
and web access
restored in certain areas.

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.434 position:50% align:center
And how long do
we think it will take

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:18.852 position:50% align:center
for the whole prefecture?

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50% align:center
There's still no way
for us to tell.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.230 position:50% align:center
With transportation
being so limited

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:24.983 position:50% align:center
at this juncture,
repairs are slow-going.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.609 position:50% align:center
Do we have an idea
of the damage yet?

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
Seems we've still
only heard from a few areas,

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
but those that can
are beginning to report

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.741 position:50% align:center
their casualties and
evacuation status,

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.118 position:50% align:center
as well as the damages to
homes and infrastructure.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.078 position:50% align:center
We need to obtain
those numbers quickly.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.164 position:50% align:center
There's been flooding throughout
the entire prefecture,

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:40.707 position:50% align:center
but it appears
as though the north

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
and the Sajiro and Sanshin areas
were hit the hardest of all.

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.795 position:50% align:center
The water is gradually
beginning to recede,

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.131 position:50% align:center
but it's far too early
to know much.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.467 position:50% align:center
The initial damage could
still prove quite risky.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.761 position:50% align:center
Right, I'll be sure to stay
in touch with fire services,

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.221 position:50% align:center
the JSDF, and the
Social Welfare Council, sir.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:56.681 position:50% align:center
Thank you, please do that.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:58.308 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.602 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] Governor!
I need to speak with you!

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:03.271 position:50% align:center
You should put a rush on
repairs in the Tosu area!

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.524 position:50% align:center
Please, sir! Tosu's a critical
intersection in Kyushu!

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:07.734 position:50% align:center
We should move you
out of this room.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:09.069 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] If we get
transportation running,

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.237 position:50% align:center
that means everything
else will go faster, too!

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.281 position:50% align:center
We're fully aware
of that fact, sir.

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
We need civilians
to be patient for now.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.411 position:50% align:center
But Saga's future's
depending on this!

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:19.871 position:50% align:center
Get him out of here.

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:22.707 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] You have to let
Franchouchou perform!

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.168 position:50% align:center
Governor?

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.712 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] Please believe me,
this concert will help Saga!

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.673 position:50% align:center
'Cause if Franchouchou
gets to sing,

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.549 position:50% align:center
then Saga will be revived!

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.802 position:50% align:center
But the people need a way
to get over there!

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:36.471 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm begging you
to fix the Tosu area!

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:38.932 position:50% align:center
Please, you have to!

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.266 position:50% align:center
[ITOU]
Look, sir, I think we've heard--

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.185 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
I'm not talking to you!

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:48.650 position:50% align:center
What these residents
need right now

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.653 position:50% align:center
is to know that everything's
going to work out okay.

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:53.446 position:50% align:center
Just one thing to unify us

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.574 position:50% align:center
so we can face
this tragedy together!

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:59.035 position:50% align:center
And Franchouchou
can give them that.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.913 position:50% align:center
So please. Make the call, sir.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.672 position:50% align:center
[DIRTY HARRY]
Dude, what were you thinking?

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:14.551 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.012 position:50% align:center
Tatsumi here.

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.931 position:50% align:center
It's Okoba.
I finally got through.

00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:21.266 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
Any luck yet?

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.601 position:50% align:center
You're demanding results
right from the get-go?

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:25.603 position:50% align:center
You've got no idea
the hoops I had to jump through

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.939 position:50% align:center
to score a chopper ride up here!

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:32.444 position:50% align:center
[sighs] This is tricky.

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
Yeah, a charity concert
sounds real nice in theory,

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:38.033 position:50% align:center
but then, who's gonna
jump on board

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.035 position:50% align:center
with an event that
might not happen?

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.078 position:50% align:center
There's just no guarantee!

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.496 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
You've got what it takes.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.873 position:50% align:center
Don't be so sure!

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.542 position:50% align:center
It's been a full decade
since I ran with this crowd.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.252 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO]
I believe in you.

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.921 position:50% align:center
Just so you understand,
it's way too early

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.883 position:50% align:center
for me to say
the same thing about you.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.426 position:50% align:center
But I figure.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:05.352 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best, and let the
gods sort out the rest of it.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:09.105 position:50% align:center
[KOTARO] I'm not leaving
a damn thing up to a god.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.316 position:50% align:center
Not after everything
that's happened.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:16.654 position:50% align:center
I guess he's got a point.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
[JUNKO] There's only a week
to go until the concert.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.838 position:50% align:center
I know! I'm getting some
butterflies, aren't you?

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:36.132 position:50% align:center
This is a good kind of
tension, though.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center
I mean, we've been totally in
the zone over the last few days.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
I don't think we've
ever been this focused!

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.181 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're right.
I noticed the same thing!

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me, too! I wonder why?

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
Guess what my Tamagotchi did!

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.020 position:50% align:center
Oyajitchi and Memetchi
got together

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:51.064 position:50% align:center
and they mixed into
a Memeoyajitchi!

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.440 position:50% align:center
What's that got to do with this?

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:55.652 position:50% align:center
I'm just saying,
we've all been on a roll lately.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
[TAE roars]

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.826 position:50% align:center
It's strange.
I can't help but wonder

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.286 position:50% align:center
if he's watching over us
from the heavens, even now.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.747 position:50% align:center
Who do you mean?

00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:11.501 position:50% align:center
Oh, someone who was precious
to me when I was alive.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:16.172 position:50% align:center
I bet he's up there,
cheering us on!

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
Just like Mommy is.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
--[ROMERO howls]
--[YUGIRI] Yes.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:23.847 position:50% align:center
We've worked hard
to make it this far,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
and now we just
have to give them

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
a great performance
on the day of the show!

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
I hope a lot of people
will be able to make it there!

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
Damn it!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50% align:center
If it weren't for that stupid
storm screwing up everything,

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
we would be passing out
flyers and building up

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:37.068 position:50% align:center
a buzz on the radio
right about now.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
Hang on. What day is it today?

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.365 position:50% align:center
Like the day of the week?

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.492 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it, we have
been paying a lot more

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
attention to the dates
than what day it is lately.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.748 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure,
but I think it's Friday?

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.083 position:50% align:center
Huh? But that's the day
we go on our show!

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50% align:center
Crap, this sucks!
I gotta get ready, fast!

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
Um, but with everything
that's going on.

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.090 position:50% align:center
I know things are bad,
but I want to!

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
And besides, we already
missed out on one show!

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
Nobody's going to blame you.
All of Saga's in crisis.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.057 position:50% align:center
Are you really gonna go?

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.266 position:50% align:center
Damn right, I am!

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
Because if we don't
do everything we can,

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.270 position:50% align:center
then Saga's gonna lose itself!

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
Um, you're here
on the wrong day.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.190 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.025 position:50% align:center
Today's actually Sunday.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.152 position:50% align:center
Oh. We're sorry, sir.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.613 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna kill you.
You're double-dead.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
The whole group?
How'd you all get mixed up?

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
You know what,
I have a great idea!

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50% align:center
Since you're here, why don't
you go on the air now?

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
Is that okay?

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
Of course! We're all
set to broadcast,

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.626 position:50% align:center
but none of our regular
personalities are

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
able to get over here
at the moment

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
with the way the
roads have been.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
It's only fair to
tell you, though,

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.841 position:50% align:center
there's no way to know how many
people are gonna tune in.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.218 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's totally fine!

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, sir!

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:47.180 position:50% align:center
All right, let's go!

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:48.431 position:50% align:center
[STAFF 2A] We'll continue
to bring you updates

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
regarding the affected areas.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.143 position:50% align:center
Please feel free to contact us

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
with any relevant
information, as well.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
Now, for today's show,
we have some

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.567 position:50% align:center
wonderful guests
with us in the studio.

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
[FRANCHOUCHOU] Good evening!
We're Franchouchou!

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center
Ca-ching!

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.406 position:50% align:center
What's wrong, Maimai?

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center
Your Franchouchou
sense is tingling, huh?

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
Well, she is a super-fan
and a former member.

00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:13.581 position:50% align:center
[SAKI]
So, uh, listen, Saga.

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:16.459 position:50% align:center
With the whole disaster, it's
pretty freakin' rough out there

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.211 position:50% align:center
for everybody right now.

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.547 position:50% align:center
And, uh, I dunno where you're

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.466 position:50% align:center
hearing this from
or if you're okay,

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.510 position:50% align:center
but I'm sure you're
probably scared,

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
and maybe kinda lonely, too.

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:29.889 position:50% align:center
Hell, you might just
be super pissed off

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
about everything that's
happened here in Saga lately.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
But. How do I say this?

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.857 position:50% align:center
I just want you to
know that right now,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.608 position:50% align:center
people are doing
what they can to help,

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.444 position:50% align:center

the shelter we stayed in.

do if they work together.

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50% align:center

important thing to remember.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
That's why Franchouchou's been
thinking about what we can do.

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:04.090 position:50% align:center
You know, to help Saga.

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
So we talked it over and
to connect to all of you,

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:12.766 position:50% align:center
we figured that the best way
is through our music.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.101 position:50% align:center
We wanna bring some cheer!

00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:19.147 position:50% align:center
Which is why we'll be
doing a live concert soon!

It'll be March 8th at
the Ekimae Fudosan Stadium!

we performed a show

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center
at that same spot
and we stunk out loud.

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50% align:center
The crowd was tiny,
we freaked out.

00:07:32.327 --> 00:07:34.329 position:50% align:center
Everything about it sucked.

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:37.415 position:50% align:center
And, just like last time--

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.626 position:50% align:center
Actually, scratch that.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center
This time,
it could be even worse.

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.964 position:50% align:center
But still, we're gonna
give you guys

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
the greatest performance ever!

And after that big storm,

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
I'm sure some people will say
that we shouldn't do this.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.806 position:50% align:center
But music can help!

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:56.101 position:50% align:center

all we have to offer you!

I dunno if we'll really be able
to make people feel better, but.
