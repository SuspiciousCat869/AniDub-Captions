I'm very sorry!

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.612 position:50% align:center
I--why did she suddenly
run away from me?

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
Ehh. Maybe she thought
your face was disgusting.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:13.201 position:50% align:center
You were flirting with
her when you said she 

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
was adorable, right?

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.621 position:50% align:center
Also, she's tiny.

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
Uh. I think you misread
the situation, Roko.

Hmph.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.963 position:50% align:center

Is that what this is?

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.339 position:50% align:center
Are you jealous, Roko?

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
What? No! Let's just get
ready for the show, okay?

[ROKO]
It's a basic need!

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center
Didn't she say to wear
underwear that's fit to be seen.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
But I'm not entirely sure what
"fit to be seen" actually means.

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
--[ROKO, HAYU] Huh?
--[INO] No! That can't be it!

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:18.850 position:50% align:center
Did you know that there
are people out there who 

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:21.728 position:50% align:center
have a fetish about school
swimming uniforms?

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.022 position:50% align:center
--You into that?
--Huh? No! I'm not!

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:25.648 position:50% align:center
How could you think that?

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:26.983 position:50% align:center
This is what happened.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.860 position:50% align:center
I went to Hayu and asked
her what kind of underwear

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:30.820 position:50% align:center
was fit to be seen.

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
Hoho said that, "it should
be a little bit sexy."

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
Sexy... Like a swimsuit?

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! Those are
made to be seen!

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:42.457 position:50% align:center
But I'd be too shy to wear
something with a pattern.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.376 position:50% align:center
So that means it
should be one color.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]
And that's how you wound up

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:47.295 position:50% align:center
with the school swimsuits?

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:48.755 position:50% align:center
Hey! Wait a minute!

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.882 position:50% align:center
Why are you looking
at me like that?

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.134 position:50% align:center
I guess the two of us aren't
going to figure it out,

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.887 position:50% align:center
so why don't we ask our
resident clothing professional?

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
So, what are your thoughts?

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
What? My thoughts?

So, what's the answer?

I'd like to see
what you wore, Nina!

Well I, uh...

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.485 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
I... wore this.

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
[INO, ROKO, HAYU]
A b-bikini?

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:14.698 position:50% align:center
[gasps] As a model, you've gotta
have a strong self-image

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:15.782 position:50% align:center
to wear something like that!

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.909 position:50% align:center
No! It's not like that, at all!

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
You've got it wrong!

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.788 position:50% align:center
Someone gave this
swimsuit to me as a sample!

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:24.374 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I'm big
in certain places,

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
so I can't wear cute
ones like you guys.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.837 position:50% align:center
I'm shy about my body.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.088 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on.

--Right.

Whatever. What'd you
end up wearing, Ino?

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50% align:center
Me? I went with something
plain, nothing special.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.389 position:50% align:center
But I did wear thicker
tights than usual!

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
That way, you can't
see my underwear!

Oh, no! What'd I do?

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.774 position:50% align:center
Well, it's true we can't
see your underwear.

00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:52.027 position:50% align:center
But the tights accentuate
your panty lines, 

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.279 position:50% align:center
which kind of makes it
even more noticeable.

00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.364 position:50% align:center

Huh? Oh, no!

00:10:56.448 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center

were sexy like that.

What now?

Hey! Would you calm down
and get ahold of yourself?

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:06.207 position:50% align:center
Uh. If I can't wear dark tights,

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
how am I going to
cover up my thighs?

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:11.296 position:50% align:center
