What do you mean, Inocchi?

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
Well, we just did first concert,
so they're probably

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.013 position:50% align:center
going to act differently
around us, don't you think?

of writing "I love you"
over and over like that!

good hand-writing too, so...

solve for vertex D...

what would Inocchi do?

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:43.570 position:50% align:center
They could start as a fan,

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.321 position:50% align:center
but try to get closer
to her later on.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
Okay. Repeat after me,
everyone...

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.202 position:50% align:center

would I be in the way?

my distance from Inocchi.

I want to say is...

see you tomorrow then!

Miss Tone!

00:08:22.711 --> 00:08:24.629 position:50% align:center

I, uh, meant to go this way.

This is so cool, Inocchi!

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.220 position:50% align:center
I don't think I've ever been
this happy in my whole life!

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Me too, Hayu!

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.225 position:50% align:center
Who knew a little fan support
could make you feel this way?

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
I'm so filled with
emotion I could cry.

You don't suppose she's the one
who sent the letter, do you?

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.774 position:50% align:center
Uh! I've no clue.

--[HAYU sighs]
--[INO gasps]

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
[HAYU] It doesn't really give
off the same vibes as her.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Vibes?

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.870 position:50% align:center
[HAYU] Yeah. The letter
seems darker.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.163 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Darker?

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:05.045 position:50% align:center
Did you hear that Ino got a fan
letter from somebody at school?

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50% align:center
Really? Well, that's the power
of some TV exposure for you!

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.009 position:50% align:center
Ino seemed pretty happy
about receiving it.

[INO whimpers]

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.264 position:50% align:center
[INO giggles]
They wrote me so many letters!

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.224 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy!

[NINA] I'm Nina Maehara.

[INO] How did I wind up
in this situation?

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
I was reading fan
letters all night long

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:11.695 position:50% align:center
and I must've fallen asleep.

Good morning, Inocchi!

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.537 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Ino snuck strange
girl into her bedroom

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
in the middle of the night!

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.748 position:50% align:center
[INO]
I knew this would happen!

You're Hemo Midori, aren't you?

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:30.547 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.465 position:50% align:center
What are you doing over
here at Rat Productions?

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.718 position:50% align:center
I mean, the Cat Productions
dorm is all the way over

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:35.802 position:50% align:center
in the city center, isn't it?

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Oh, yes, that's right,

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.806 position:50% align:center
but there's been
a little situation.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:40.807 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NINA, HAYU]
Hm?

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:41.975 position:50% align:center
A situation?

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. But before
we get into that,

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
is it okay if we let Ino go?

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:48.356 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Absolutely not!

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.858 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Uh?!

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:51.860 position:50% align:center
She's still hasn't been cleared
of any funny business yet.

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:54.070 position:50% align:center
And unauthorized visitors
are strictly prohibited

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.405 position:50% align:center

[INO gasps]

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.575 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] And if Ino violated
one of the few rules

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.368 position:50% align:center
of the Mouse House, well then--!

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center
No! She wouldn't violate a rule!

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.957 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NINA, HAYU grumble]

00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:07.584 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
Uh, so what do we do?

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
No one has ever brought
anyone over before.

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.964 position:50% align:center
[HEMO] Uh. I'm so sorry for
causing all this trouble.

00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:15.425 position:50% align:center
I promise you guys,
Ino did nothing wrong.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:16.676 position:50% align:center
It was all my fault.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.095 position:50% align:center
I was half-asleep and
made an honest mistake!

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.472 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Half-asleep?

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:21.723 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Mistake?

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:24.142 position:50% align:center
[HEMO gasps]
Yeah.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:28.480 position:50% align:center
So that's why I should be
punished just like Ino is.

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:29.606 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
What do you mean?

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
Whatever you do to her,

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.776 position:50% align:center
I deserve to be treated
in the same way!

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Are you kidding?

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:35.904 position:50% align:center
Please do what you must!

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:38.198 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Nothing coming out of
this girl's mouth makes sense!

00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.492 position:50% align:center
Can somebody please explain
what's going on here?

00:11:40.575 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
[HOHO laughs]

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
Your talented manager
has the answers you seek.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.122 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NINA, HAYU]
Oh, Hoho!

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
That's right! There's actually
a very good reason

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.335 position:50% align:center
why Hemo is here at
the Mouse House!

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
[INO whimpers]

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:52.754 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Ino...

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
[HOHO yelps] Sorry, was I
interrupting something

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.424 position:50% align:center
between you two?

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center
[INO]
No! Nothing's going on!

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
Aw... That's what I've
been trying to explain.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:04.099 position:50% align:center
I found Hemo already in my bed
when I woke up this morning.

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.101 position:50% align:center
I really am very sorry.

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
Last night was my first
time at the Mouse House

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:09.437 position:50% align:center
and I was so sleepy,

00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.940 position:50% align:center
I accidentally wound up
in the wrong room.

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:14.484 position:50% align:center
It was odd that the
bed was already warm,

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.695 position:50% align:center
but it was so soft
and smelled so nice,

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
that I just fell asleep.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
It's a relief to hear
that it was just

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center
an honest to goodness
sleepy mistake.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
I was worried I'd done
something improper.

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50% align:center
[HEMO] Mm. I can be
really clumsy at times.

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.916 position:50% align:center
Something still isn't
adding up here!

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.919 position:50% align:center
Wait, why does Hemo even have
her own room in the Mouse House?

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
Why indeed!

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:35.422 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's super sus!

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
That's my cue to,
"Hu, hu, hu"!

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
[NINA, HAYU, ROKO]
Huh?

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.301 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
I have an announcement to make.

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:43.471 position:50% align:center
Starting today, Hemo Midori
will be officially joining us

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:45.640 position:50% align:center
as Rat Productions'
newest idol member!

[IDOLS gasp]

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
I still have a lot to learn,
so please bear with me, okay?

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] From now on,
Fruit Tart will operate

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.108 position:50% align:center
as a five-member unit.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.484 position:50% align:center
[cackles]

00:12:56.568 --> 00:12:58.111 position:50% align:center
Now that we've recruited
Cat Productions'

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.864 position:50% align:center
first place auditioner, Fruit
Tart should be unstoppable!

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
Looking pretty evil, Hoho.

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] So, you're basically
saying you poached her away

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.120 position:50% align:center
from Cat Productions.
Is that even legal?

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.039 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry. It's all good.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center
I worked everything
out with them already.

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
Are you telling the truth?

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Ugh, you're so rude.
Don't look at me like that.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] You see,
I invited Riri out to dinner.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.968 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Sorry! Were you waiting long?

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
Just two hours.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.889 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] And I made sure
to get her really drunk.

00:13:25.972 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
Please, drink as
much as you like!

00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] Now, Hoho,
I'm entrusting you with Hemo,

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
so you take good care of her!

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.023 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh!

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.816 position:50% align:center
So what lesson did
we learn today?

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
You're a terrible role model,

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.944 position:50% align:center
and not to follow your example.

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.155 position:50% align:center
Being here at the Mouse
House and working with us

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
is what Hemo's wants, too!

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:44.699 position:50% align:center
--[INO gasps]
--[HEMO giggles]

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center

a part of Fruit Tart!

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
What? Seriously?

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.287 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah!

00:13:49.371 --> 00:13:51.915 position:50% align:center
I was so moved by show,
it made me wish

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
that I could get up on stage
and sing right along with you!

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Aw...

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:58.421 position:50% align:center
That's so great!

00:13:58.505 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] What's going on?
Let me guess.

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.549 position:50% align:center
Hoho kidnapped you, didn't she?

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
You being blackmailed?

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
Money. Is this about money?

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center
--[HEMO] Huh?!
--[HOHO] Hey!

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:08.348 position:50% align:center
Hemo says this is
where she wants to be,

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:09.933 position:50% align:center
so it's where she's wants to be!

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
If any of you have an
objection to this, speak now!

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
Nah, it's fine.
I'm good with it.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.314 position:50% align:center
The more the merrier
in the House, I say!

00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
I think we need to
have a welcome party!

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
Life at the Mouse House is
about to get a lot more fun.

[HEMO giggles]

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:23.738 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Now that
that's out of the way,

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
we already have Hemo's
costume ready to go.

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
It's time to change
and get to work!

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.744 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Yeah!

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:37.836 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Mh-mm! A five-member
unit is more balanced.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.964 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha, ha! All I gotta do is
keep on recruiting members

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
like this, and I'll eventually
become a famous producer!

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
--Yes! Money, money!
--[ROKO] Wow, she's greedy!

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:48.847 position:50% align:center
If we're all changing
into our uniforms,

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.266 position:50% align:center
does that mean we're about to
do something for the idol show?

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:54.602 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Of course! Let's get
on with today's segment!

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:55.603 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
What?!

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.272 position:50% align:center
We're doing a photo shoot?

00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:00.025 position:50% align:center
You better believe it!
We need a whole slew of photos

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:03.111 position:50% align:center
and videos to use for ads and
other promotional purposes.

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.238 position:50% align:center
But, why do we need
to wear swimsuits?

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Relax! It's going to be great!

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.451 position:50% align:center
There's no reason to
worry about your body,

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
since there's an audience
for every shape!

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
[INO, ROKO]
What?

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:13.997 position:50% align:center
Everything is a
fetish these days!

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50% align:center
That doesn't make us feel
less self-conscious!

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
Plus, it still doesn't
answer our question...!

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
Swimsuit...

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.754 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Hemo, are you okay?

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.088 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Huh?

00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:24.090 position:50% align:center
Swimsuits are kind of
intimidating, aren't they?

00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Oh, yes, um...

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.345 position:50% align:center
I'm not too confident
about my figure.

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
But I'm really looking forward
to my first shoot as an idol!

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:32.807 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Plus...

00:15:32.891 --> 00:15:34.976 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Hm? Plus, what?

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.520 position:50% align:center
Plus, I'll finally get to
see what Ino looks like

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:38.730 position:50% align:center
in a swimsuit!

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
--[INO] Huh?
--[ROKO gasps]

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.484 position:50% align:center
Uh! I'm glad to
hear you're okay.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.361 position:50% align:center
I guess was just
misreading things.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:45.737 position:50% align:center
You seemed so uncomfortable,

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.614 position:50% align:center
that I wanted to make sure
you weren't too scared.

00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:50.450 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Ah... Thank you, Ino!

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:51.659 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Now that that's cleared up,

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:53.995 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to
working with you, Hemo.

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
[HEMO giggles]
Yeah! I look forward to it too!

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.249 position:50% align:center
Great! Let's do it together!

00:15:58.333 --> 00:15:59.292 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Okay!

00:15:59.376 --> 00:16:00.960 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Ino is so nice!

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:02.462 position:50% align:center
She's always smiling at me,

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:05.590 position:50% align:center
even though I'm pretty much
a complete stranger to her.

00:16:05.674 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:16.685 position:50% align:center
Hmph!

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:18.478 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:24.109 position:50% align:center
I could probably fill
this out better.

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:25.443 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:28.988 position:50% align:center
[HEMO grunts]

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
[gasps, giggles]

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.870 position:50% align:center
I just love how
unique all of us are!

00:16:35.954 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.292 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:16:44.421 --> 00:16:45.880 position:50% align:center
This is my first shoot!

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
I hope I don't do anything
to ruin it for my seniors!

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
Hey, Roko, Hayu, what do we
need to do next to get ready?

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, HAYU grunt]

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:59.060 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, HAYU]
C! C! C! C! C! C...!

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
[HEMO yells]

00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
[INO] Come on!
We're beautiful at any size!

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
Geez, you were so dramatic
that you scared Hemo.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.778 position:50% align:center
Please be nice to our
new member, okay?

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:11.197 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I got a little
too worked up.

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.199 position:50% align:center
Guess I was jealous...

00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:15.201 position:50% align:center
And honestly impressed.

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:16.786 position:50% align:center
So, what are we doing now?

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
Should we change
into our swimsuits?

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:21.624 position:50% align:center
Good call. I hope they don't
end up being too revealing.

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.335 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
I wonder what kind of swimsuits

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
they're sticking us with?

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.381 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
What are these supposed to be?

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:30.550 position:50% align:center
[INO] What? You expect
us to wear these?

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
What the heck?!

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.470 position:50% align:center
Uh... Well, you see.

00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:35.847 position:50% align:center
When we were budgeting the
segment, we may or may not have

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.391 position:50% align:center
overlooked leaving money
for the actual swimsuits.

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:39.642 position:50% align:center
[INO, ROKO]
What?

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
Uh... That's whatever
fabric I had on hand.

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.522 position:50% align:center
Wait, so you made
these yourself!

00:17:44.606 --> 00:17:46.024 position:50% align:center
Hold it, right there!

00:17:46.107 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
Are you or are you not a bunch
pretty high school girls?

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me none of
you have swimsuits

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:52.572 position:50% align:center
of your own, for goodness sakes!

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
A swimsuit...

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:55.950 position:50% align:center
The beach...

00:17:56.034 --> 00:17:57.327 position:50% align:center
Pools...

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.703 position:50% align:center
Barbecues...

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.205 position:50% align:center
The summer festival...

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.707 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess I've got
my one from school.

00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.460 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, school swimsuits
can be perfectly cute too!

00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
[HEMO, INO]
Huh?

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Never mind those three.

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
Ino, Hemo, you two must have
your own swimsuits, right?

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
You both seem like you
have a good sense of style.

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
I'm sure whatever you
have is super cute!

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.304 position:50% align:center
[HEMO, INO]
Oh?

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:19.432 position:50% align:center
Well, I had one not
too long ago, I guess.

00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
What? You really do
have a cute suit?

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
Except I forgot it back at home.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:24.479 position:50% align:center
Aw...

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
Um. Well, then I
forgot mine too.

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Oh?

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:30.860 position:50% align:center
[HEMO] If have you to wear these
suits, Then I'll wear them too!

00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
Huh?! What are you
talking about, Hemo?

00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:35.281 position:50% align:center
[ROKO gasps]
I just thought of something!

00:18:35.365 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
Nina! Remember that swimsuit
you wore for the concert?

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:40.620 position:50% align:center
The kinda sexy one that
wasn't a school uniform.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
Didn't you say you got it
as a sample from a brand?

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
Do you happen to have
any other ones?

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
[NINA] Um, I do. But that
might not the best idea.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, HAYU gasp]

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:57.887 position:50% align:center
I'm just not sure
they would fit.

00:18:57.971 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, HAYU gasp]

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Let's prove her wrong!

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
There's gotta be something
in here that fits!

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
We just gotta keep looking!

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.105 position:50% align:center
[HEMO gasps]

00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
Come on Hemo! You better
get in her and search, too,

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:11.776 position:50% align:center
or all the good ones
will be taken.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.653 position:50% align:center
I can look for one, too?

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:14.821 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, HAYU]
Well, duh!

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
You're part of our
team now, aren't you?

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:17.615 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Team?

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
[INO, NINA]
Team Big!

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:24.122 position:50% align:center
[NINA sighs]

00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, HAYU, HEMO]
Team Small...

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:34.049 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, HAYU, HEMO sigh]

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:36.468 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Nice, girls!
Looking good, everyone!

00:19:36.551 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
I'd say you're all ready
to start the shoot now!

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Bleh.

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
But I'm amazed that you
found something that fit.

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
I mean these samples were
meant for Nina, weren't they?

00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:46.061 position:50% align:center
--[ROKO] Ah. No! Stop!
--[HOHO] What brand is it?

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:48.063 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Why does it matter?

00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:50.357 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Uh...

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Don't say a word.

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
Right! Okay! Let's start
shooting then, shall we?

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:56.946 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Nice. Very nice!

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:06.331 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Good. So good!

00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Woo-hoo!
Yes, that's it! That's perfect!

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:13.296 position:50% align:center
[HOHO laughs] Yes, like that!
That's adorable!

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
Hey. How come you're not
taking any pictures of us?

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.051 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Eh! Oops.

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:19.552 position:50% align:center
Miss Hoho!

00:20:19.636 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
Would it be okay if I tried
taking everyone's pictures?

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:23.515 position:50% align:center
--What?
--You wanna try?

00:20:23.598 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
Okay, sure. I didn't know
you were into photography.

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:30.855 position:50% align:center
--[HAYU] Oh?
--[INO] Cheese!

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
[INO, HEMO giggle]

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.986 position:50% align:center
Knock it off! Personal space!

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Hmm. I really
like the idea of idols

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
taking pictures of other idols.

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
Ah! Then I can be a
photographer, too?
