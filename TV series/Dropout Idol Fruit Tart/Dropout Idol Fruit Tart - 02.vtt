But we haven't even
released a CD, yet.

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.159 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER]
All right, who's next?

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:15.078 position:50% align:center
Oh, I am!

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.956 position:50% align:center
R-Roll call number seven,
I'm Ino Sakura.

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:19.833 position:50% align:center
I'm working hard to
pay back all my debts.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:21.084 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER, STUDENTS]
What?

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
[INO whines] I totally
bombed that, didn't I?

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.007 position:50% align:center
Everyone in class probably
thinks I'm a weirdo, now!

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Inocchi!

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Huh?

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.427 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Hayu?

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
Oh, please tell me she's about
to rescue me from this tragedy!

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Me next!

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.975 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
Hey everybody, I'm Hayu Nukui!

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:42.981 position:50% align:center
Like Inocchi Sakura, I'm working
to pay off a bunch of debt too!

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER, STUDENTS gasp]

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.109 position:50% align:center
Wait, no, it's not like that!

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
This is a misunderstanding!
It's not just about debt!

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.697 position:50% align:center
Well, Hayu and I are in debt,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50% align:center
but there's more
to it than that!

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:53.742 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Shoot, this is bad.

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
I have no choice but
to tell the truth.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.164 position:50% align:center
[INO] Hayu and I are
in a relationship!

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:00.665 position:50% align:center
But I promise
it's totally innocent!

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50% align:center
[HAYU, TEACHER, STUDENTS]
Huh?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.878 position:50% align:center
[INO groans]
Now thanks to me,

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:07.881 position:50% align:center
we've officially become
the weirdos of our class.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.632 position:50% align:center
There goes my high school debut.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean debut?

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
Ya see, when I was back
at home attending school

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center
in the countryside,

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:17.640 position:50% align:center
there weren't a
whole lot of students.

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.934 position:50% align:center
I was hoping when I
started school out here,

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
I would be able to make
some friends in my grade.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.440 position:50% align:center
But Inocchi, you forgot!
You already have me, right?

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:26.941 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
I count as your classmate,
just like everybody else here!

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
So, hopefully it won't be
a total let down, but maybe

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
would it be ok if I were your
first friend in your grade?

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]

00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50% align:center
It's more than okay!

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:41.456 position:50% align:center
You're right,
we are classmates, Hayu!

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:44.751 position:50% align:center
So I wanna officially be friends
with you at school, and at home!

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
Great, sounds good
to me, Inocchi!

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.756 position:50% align:center
Let's work together from here
on out and make that money!

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
--[INO] Yeah!
--[FEMALE STUDENTS] What?

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.805 position:50% align:center
[INO] So, this is school life
in the city. It's so impressive!

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:58.431 position:50% align:center
Huh? What do you mean?

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
Well, look at 'em all,
they're stylish and pretty.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.019 position:50% align:center
Everyone here looks
like a celebrity.

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.479 position:50% align:center
If these are normal kids,

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:05.855 position:50% align:center
then what are real
celebrities like?

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.900 position:50% align:center
[HAYU] Aw, come on,
don't think about it that way!

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:10.819 position:50% align:center
[INO] That's easy for
you to say, Hayu!

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center
[INO]
You're cute, and cool, and cute!

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
Was there anything special
you used to do in junior high?

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.535 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
I guess so.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.954 position:50% align:center
But I was more interested
in music, not sports.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
I had no friends, there wasn't
a band club at school,

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.167 position:50% align:center
and I couldn't get gigs,
so I'd just jam by the river.

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:27.877 position:50% align:center
--[INO] Oh!
--[HAYU] Huh? What's going on?

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
[INO] Don't worry,
you have me now, Hayu!

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
It's all going to be okay!

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.591 position:50% align:center
That's what I was
just telling you!

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.677 position:50% align:center
[INO] You know, there was
one thing I was wondering.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
There are so many
girls at our school,

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
but isn't it supposed
to be co-ed?

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.307 position:50% align:center
It is now, but it was
an all-girls school

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
up until last year.

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:45.729 position:50% align:center
When changes like that happen,
boys tend to be a minority.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
Oh, that makes sense!

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
And you know, I bet there's
some girls who like girls here

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.525 position:50% align:center
the same way you do, Innochi!

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:51.609 position:50% align:center
[INO]
What?

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
Huh? W-Wait! Why would you?

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:55.488 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU]
We're home!

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:56.823 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NINA]
Welcome back.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.616 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
How was school today?

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.077 position:50% align:center
Nobody recognized us at all.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:03.038 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
We totally get how you feel.

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
No one at our school knew
who we were, either.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:07.751 position:50% align:center
[NINA] I got myself all
worked up for nothing.

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:11.296 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I've already got
10 years of experience

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
under my belt.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Roko! Don't be sad!

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.677 position:50% align:center
Alright everyone, we need to
do something about this!

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:20.013 position:50% align:center
Come on! We gotta put
our heads together!

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.140 position:50% align:center
Isn't it a little late in
the game to think of a plan?

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.267 position:50% align:center
[INO] But there's gotta
be a way to make the show

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center
more entertaining!

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:26.394 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:28.271 position:50% align:center
Boobies'll do the trick!

00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
Is that all you
ever think about?

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.817 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Coming up with
genius episode ideas

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
is what I'm here for!

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.907 position:50% align:center
You're butting in like always,
aren't you, Hoho?

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Let's see what we get!

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS groan]

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:44.913 position:50% align:center
You could at least try to
put in a little effort.

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
Why don't we at least
try rolling it, anyway?

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
I know I'm curious to see
what it says, aren't you?

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:50.752 position:50% align:center
Whatever...

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.045 position:50% align:center
Let's go!

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:56.883 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS gasp]

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.176 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:06.976 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
There's nothing else on here!

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.396 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
What?

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
I'm Roko Sekino.

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:12.482 position:50% align:center
A former child actor,
a 2nd year in high school,

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.817 position:50% align:center
and my birthday is May 5th.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
My blood type is B,
and my height's 14--

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
You don't need to know that!

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.905 position:50% align:center
I like to watch period dramas!

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
<i>Dropout Idol Fruit Tart</i> !

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.502 position:50% align:center
We've been told we
have to write a song,

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
but who here even knows how we
should go about getting started?

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
I don't have a clue.

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:38.466 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS sigh]

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
--Wait! I got it!
--[ROKO, NINA, HAYU] Huh?

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.387 position:50% align:center
What kind of music do
you all listen to?

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
For the most part,
I like to listen to pop

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.640 position:50% align:center
and cheerful songs.

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.684 position:50% align:center
Rock has always been my go-to.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
Ballads are my favorite!

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
Spoken word.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
Spoken word?

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.190 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Well--yeah! Is that a problem?

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.943 position:50% align:center
It shouldn't matter what stuff
I like to listen to, anyway!

00:12:57.027 --> 00:13:00.447 position:50% align:center
No, there's no problem!
I just wasn't expecting it!

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
But what genre of music does
spoken word even fall in?

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
Roko performing spoken word.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center
Yes, Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear,
and Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
It would be so cute!

00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
Do you need your head checked?

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
Despite the way she looks,

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:19.049 position:50% align:center
Roko sure does have
grumpy old man tastes.

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:21.801 position:50% align:center
You're so touchy.

00:13:21.885 --> 00:13:25.055 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Beside spoken word,
I love period dramas,

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
kabuki theater, enka,
bonsai and painting.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.810 position:50% align:center
How could anyone not appreciate
such forms of culture?

00:13:30.894 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
You're really interested in
traditional stuff, aren't you?

00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center
Yes, she really is!

00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I catch her practicing
sword fighting in her room.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Enough already!

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:42.280 position:50% align:center
Ah-ha! Now that we know
all of our favorite things,

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.407 position:50% align:center
let's use them as
inspiration for a song!

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:45.700 position:50% align:center
Well, that makes sense.

00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:47.410 position:50% align:center
[HAYU] Not only will we
complete the challenge,

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center
we have the chance to get
to know each other better!

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:52.290 position:50% align:center
Roko is into Japanese culture.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
And I like anything to
do with rock 'n' roll,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50% align:center
and I'm into super heroes!

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:58.797 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and I think Roko
is the cutest thing ever!

00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.923 position:50% align:center
[HAYU chuckles nervously]

00:14:00.006 --> 00:14:01.049 position:50% align:center

Who, me? Well, I really
enjoy feminine smells.

[INO, ROKO, HAYU gasp]

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
No! That wasn't what
I meant at all!

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
I like the way things
like flowers and herbs smell.

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.896 position:50% align:center
I don't mean anything strange
by what I said, I promise!

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.482 position:50% align:center
Oh! Well, now that you
mention scent, Nina,

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
you always seem to smell nice!

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's very distinct,
a little sweet and so calming!

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Yup. The way you
smell reminds me of my mom.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
So comfy.

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
Aw! It's just the smell
of my detergent!

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:33.957 position:50% align:center
And, I'm not the only one,
we all have unique scents here!

--What?
--[NINA] Yeah, Ino!

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
Your smell is fresh and green!

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
Is this your way of telling
me that I'm still green

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
and inexperienced?

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
Roko, you smell...
Like, um well...

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
He, he... Well, you're...

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
You don't have to sugar coat it,

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:50.557 position:50% align:center
I know exactly what you're
trying to tell me.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
And next, Hayu smells like...

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.185 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
I know I'm super clumsy and
not great at the girly stuff.

00:14:57.105 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. You don't understand,
that's where you're wrong, Hayu.

a wonderful smell

that's all your own.

to do with the song.

think we're crazy!

be something we all like!

Hmm.

Is there something...

...that all four
of us are fans of?

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.926 position:50% align:center

Hm?

[ROKO] Don't you think
it's a good idea?

00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:32.098 position:50% align:center
A song about curry was
not what I had in mind.

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:33.683 position:50% align:center
That's not our fault!

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:35.560 position:50% align:center
Well, it is lunch time already.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.688 position:50% align:center
What do you say we help
ourselves to some curry?

No way!

[ROKO] The only good
thing about Mouse House!

You think Curry is the
only good thing?

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:49.115 position:50% align:center
[ROKO sighs] Now we have
to go grocery shopping

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
since we don't have
anything to eat.

Um...

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:55.246 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
All we've got is 520 yen?

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.334 position:50% align:center
[NINA] We could probably afford
to get a lot of bread crusts.

Wait, where did Ino get off to?

have these, too!

didn't have any money,

gave us some food!

on food for a while now.

think about singing a song

about Mouse House for our Debut?

[ROKO, NINA, HAYU]
What?

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.711 position:50% align:center
A song about Mouse House?

00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
[INO] Yeah! If listeners can
know us better through our song,

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:49.217 position:50% align:center
I bet that we could make
friends with more even people!

That's not a bad idea!

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.515 position:50% align:center
We definitely need people
to get to know us better!

and work on the song!

[sighs] I actually wasn't
expecting writing a song

about ourselves to
be this difficult.

00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:08.570 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:10.947 position:50% align:center
And you can't be too literal
or else it's not gonna work.

underwear and socks

with holes in them.

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:16.745 position:50% align:center

We can't be literal at all!

00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
[INO] Hayu, you've gotta take
better care of things like that!

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
We're idols now!

Why? I don't see a problem,
they're still totally wearable!

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's a whole thousand
yen for a pack of three!

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
Wait, does the price really
bother you that much?

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:32.010 position:50% align:center
Inocchi, how could you
say something like that?

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:33.887 position:50% align:center
It's way more sensible
to spend that much cash

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.347 position:50% align:center
on ten loaves of bread!

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
At least you can eat bread,
but can you eat underwear?

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.142 position:50% align:center
Spoiler alert: No, you cannot!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.852 position:50% align:center

Oh, she's hopeless.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
[INO] Th-Then how about we stop
by the cute lingerie store

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
by the station next time?

raise our standards!

Are you talking about that store
with all those frilly things?

never been there before?

[HAYU gasps]

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
[HAYU] It's embarrassing
to go into those stores.

Nina, explain to me why
I'm the choreographer again?

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:14.260 position:50% align:center

[NINA] Um. I wonder if Roko's
still feeling a little unsure

00:18:20.642 --> 00:18:22.352 position:50% align:center
about doing this idol thing.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
you're really good
at making clothes.

Well of course, I mean you've
made a lot of your own,

haven't you?

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:44.624 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, my love of clothes

00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:47.419 position:50% align:center
is what got me into this
industry in the first place!

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:49.754 position:50% align:center
When I was a little girl,
I would make clothes with my

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
mom and we would
do fashion shows.

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
But since I would grow
so fast, the clothes we made

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
together would never
last very long for me.

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Shoot. I think I might've
touched on a sensitive topic.

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:07.313 position:50% align:center
But I get it. I mean, I'm still
concerned about my height,

00:19:07.397 --> 00:19:09.899 position:50% align:center
so I'm sure Nina
worries about hers.

[ROKO]
Hm! It's okay, Nina.

to be ashamed of!

me depressed sometimes!

filled out like yours have.

voice and I can still wear

much progress on the song.

I apologize for the delay.
On top of everything else,

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:38.386 position:50% align:center
