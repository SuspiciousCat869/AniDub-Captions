But the main reason
for the cancelation

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
is that your sponsor backed out.

O-Okay.

Oh, Hayu, you're so cute!

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.011 position:50% align:center

meet the sponsor?

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center

What are you doing?

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:11.199 position:50% align:center
It's a perfectly normal

Yes, my Master.

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
This is wrong on so many levels!

Now that you mention it,

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.124 position:50% align:center
I don't really know how to
"entertain" special guests.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.501 position:50% align:center
Roko, have you ever done
anything like that before?

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:22.419 position:50% align:center
Lemme see...

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.753 position:50% align:center
Hmmm.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess you
could call it that.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
But it was way back
when I was a little kid.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.467 position:50% align:center
Adults are so easy to please.

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.553 position:50% align:center
I just used the
goody-two-shoes act.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:34.305 position:50% align:center
I promise I will work hard
and do my very best!

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.307 position:50% align:center
What an inspiring
little girl she is!

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
If by "inspiring" you mean
"conniving" then, you're right!

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
So, Roko, are you saying

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
I should also try to put
on a good girl persona?

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.191 position:50% align:center
Dunno. That act
might not work for you.

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50% align:center
You're cute,
but we need to find a way

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.778 position:50% align:center
to make you a little
more interesting.

00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:50.321 position:50% align:center
Based on the feedback
we've gathered,

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:53.199 position:50% align:center
the fans seem to like the
girly side of your personality.

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] So, let's try to play
that up a bit more.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.870 position:50% align:center
G-Girly?

00:08:56.953 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
This entire time I thought I was
embodying the "cool idol" image!

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
You know, like
the edgy rocker type.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.961 position:50% align:center
I can't take you seriously
with that outfit on.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.714 position:50% align:center
Relax, Hayu. There's no
reason for you to be scared.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:11.843 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it'll be fine. Your new
sponsor is very kind and gentle.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:14.012 position:50% align:center
You don't need to pretend
to be someone you're not.

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.181 position:50% align:center
This person will accept you,
no matter what.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
That's right, just like
any devoted mother would.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.978 position:50% align:center
Did she say "mother"? Why do
I suddenly have a bad feeling?

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:24.856 position:50% align:center

couldn't be...

Aw! That's your welcome?

I decided to become
your new sponsor,

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:08.108 position:50% align:center
so my darling Hayu can
keep pursuing her dream!

M-My dream?

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50% align:center
That's right. To become
an idol, make tons of money,

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center
and buy lots of those grown-up
panties you love so much!

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:19.202 position:50% align:center
Ah! Someday I'm gonna have
lots and lots of these!

That's how it was.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.372 position:50% align:center
No! That's not how it was!

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.749 position:50% align:center
That's odd.
Why are you acting so shy?

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.168 position:50% align:center
Isn't the show supposed
to be a little bit sexy?

Mom! Stop!
You're embarrassing me!

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.882 position:50% align:center
It's not any different
from your typical idol show.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.509 position:50% align:center

the panties you had on

You don't get me, Daddy!

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
[HAYO] Well, she didn't
actually leave that time

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.477 position:50% align:center
since she couldn't find
her way out of the front yard.

I find my way out of here?

pretty mad at her after that.

So, she left and that's how she
ended up at the Mouse House.

I get it.

Basically, this
whole situation arose

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
out of a little family
disagreement.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
Ever since her
father disowned her,

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:04.891 position:50% align:center
you haven't been able to provide
financial support to Hayu.

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:08.144 position:50% align:center
You became a sponsor to use
Cat Productions as a middle-man.

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.896 position:50% align:center
It's true! That's exactly right!

Hm? What did you have in mind?

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:21.199 position:50% align:center
If we get Hayu and
her father to reconcile,

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.493 position:50% align:center
will you help out the

Yes, of course!
You have got a deal!

Wait, do you really think that's
what they were asking for?

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:50.955 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] What kind of sucker would
actually spend money on this?

This game is for the fans,

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.386 position:50% align:center
But I wanted to add the

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Yeah, look!

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:10.684 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Oh, I see.

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
So, this is what they meant

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
about the game being
"virtual reality."

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:14.938 position:50% align:center
You can collect real-life idols

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:17.148 position:50% align:center
and they each have
different levels of rarity.

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:19.484 position:50% align:center
Is everyone else in
the group "rare," too?

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:28.660 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Why does Nina
get to be "Super Rare"?

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:31.287 position:50% align:center
Way to go! I bet it's
because of your boobs!

Be quiet, Roko! People are
going to get the wrong idea!

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:58.231 position:50% align:center
Besides, I was already an F-cup

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.859 position:50% align:center
in elementary school
before I met you--

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, HAYU]
F?!

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:05.113 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing
to have to wear a bra!

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:08.116 position:50% align:center
If you were an F-cup back
in elementary school...

00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:09.534 position:50% align:center
Then that means you
must have gone up

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:12.120 position:50% align:center
a size every year
for the last six years!

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
I bet she's downplaying
her cup size

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center
just like she does
with her height.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.709 position:50% align:center
An F-cup five years ago
means she's a K by now.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.169 position:50% align:center
I'm not that big!

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:21.504 position:50% align:center
I'm 170 centimeters and a G!

Nuh-uh.

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:26.009 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure you were already
170 centimeters in grade school.

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.761 position:50% align:center
I was 160.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:29.721 position:50% align:center

there's much left for us to do.

[HOHO] Like the National
Baseball Championships,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
the best idols will compete

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:18.019 position:50% align:center
to become the representatives
for their prefecture.

00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:19.729 position:50% align:center
That's what you're up against.

[GROUP gasps]

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.274 position:50% align:center
The competition uses
a voting system.

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
In-game purchases, CDs, merch,

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:28.405 position:50% align:center
and everything else we sell
comes with a voting ticket.

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
The group with the
most votes will go on

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
to become the prefectural
representatives.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
What? We have to start
in the qualifying round?

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
But Cream Anmitsu's
also in Tokyo,

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
so there's no way
we stand a chance!

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:42.585 position:50% align:center
Hey, you girls can't give up
before we've even started.

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
So, what if the
Cream Anmitsu girls

00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
have an SSSSR
status in the game.

Higher than SSR?!

Don't worry!

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.430 position:50% align:center
There's still a chance we can
qualify and move forward!

[GROUP]
Huh?

00:16:55.557 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center
In the battleground of Tokyo,

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
there are <i>two</i> slots
for representatives!

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center
Cream Anmitsu will
take the top slot,

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:04.357 position:50% align:center
but we can make it to the
finals as their protege group!

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
Protege group?!

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.736 position:50% align:center
But I'm the older sister here!

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
If we want a chance at
grabbing that second slot,

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
we need to plan our strategy.

"Voter Reward Funding"?

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.496 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.166 position:50% align:center
It's very similar to organizing
a crowdfunding campaign.

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.751 position:50% align:center
When they reach
a certain number of votes,

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:25.754 position:50% align:center
the idols can reward the
voters with a special fan perk.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:26.921 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Uh...

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
For example,

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
a handshake event when
we get a thousand votes,

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
or putting on a free
concert at 2,000 votes!

00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:34.637 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:36.306 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] So, I want you
to brainstorm a bit

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.892 position:50% align:center
and think about what
we can offer as incentives.

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:41.311 position:50% align:center
Do you have any more good
examples of these perks?

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:42.729 position:50% align:center
Looks like Cream Anmitsu

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:45.815 position:50% align:center

[INO] The first incentive
tier starts at 100 votes,

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
then 300, 500,

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
and then the next tier jumps
all the way up to 1,000 votes.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.415 position:50% align:center
Uh, anyone have an idea yet?

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
Should we start
small and gradually

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
do something bigger
for each level?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
It could be smart to
go big in the beginning

00:18:07.879 --> 00:18:09.506 position:50% align:center

If you really want my opinion,

I think the perk should
feature Hayu or Nina.

you feature me?

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:40.120 position:50% align:center
I can guess why you'd
want to use Nina.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:02.702 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Okay.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
So now everyone has recorded
a cute video just like Hayu's.

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
But do you actually
think that there

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:09.292 position:50% align:center
will be a demand for
this kind of content?

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
[GROUP sighs]

00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:12.420 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, we already shot it,

00:20:12.504 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
so I guess there's no harm
if we put it up for 100 votes

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
and just see what happens.

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:21.262 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] I hope no one
I know in real life sees this.

00:20:24.516 --> 00:20:26.434 position:50% align:center
That love shout-out
was so sweet!

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:29.187 position:50% align:center
It reminded me of my daughter
when she was a little girl!

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.522 position:50% align:center
My grandson was crying,

00:20:30.605 --> 00:20:32.190 position:50% align:center
but as soon as he
watched your videos,

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:33.400 position:50% align:center
it put him in a good mood.

00:20:33.483 --> 00:20:34.442 position:50% align:center
Thank you, ladies!

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
Our grandpa is
probably watching it

00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
and smiling down from heaven!

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:40.532 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much everyone--
you're too kind!

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:43.034 position:50% align:center
So, it turns out there
was a demand, after all.

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:45.954 position:50% align:center
I think it's cause
Miss Ino's so popular.

00:20:46.037 --> 00:20:48.039 position:50% align:center
It is still a
little embarrassing.

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:50.041 position:50% align:center
Hayu, it seems like
your heartfelt video

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
really cheered up all the
dads in the neighborhood!

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
Whoa! You really think so?

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:55.338 position:50% align:center
If we keep this up,

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:57.841 position:50% align:center
I bet we could get even more
votes than Cream Anmitsu!

00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
I dunno--that seems
like kind of a long shot.

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
It's about the intention

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
and keeping up the
positive attitude!

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:06.141 position:50% align:center
Okay, I guess that's true.

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:08.101 position:50% align:center
All right, listen up, everyone!

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:09.936 position:50% align:center
[GROUP grunts]

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.355 position:50% align:center
Let's keep doing our best!

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:14.941 position:50% align:center
[GROUP giggles]

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:16.651 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:20.739 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Sakura! Hayu!

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:22.323 position:50% align:center
Hey, good morning!

00:21:22.407 --> 00:21:23.742 position:50% align:center
Nice to see you, Tone!

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
How's it goin'?

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:26.911 position:50% align:center
I stayed up three
nights in a row,

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:29.581 position:50% align:center
but I finally maxed out
everyone's levels.

00:21:29.664 --> 00:21:31.958 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps] Please don't
lose sleep over the game!

00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:33.460 position:50% align:center
[TONE chuckles]

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
[INO] Why did Tone wrap all
those bandages around her phone?

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
[INO] Is it to prevent
her from spending money?

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:49.059 position:50% align:center
[GROUP sighs]

00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:51.144 position:50% align:center
Even with Tone's and
our neighbors' help,

00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:53.104 position:50% align:center
it's still hard to compete
against these groups

00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:54.564 position:50% align:center
from all over the country.

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:55.607 position:50% align:center
We need to come up with

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.442 position:50% align:center
something else
to help us stand out.

00:21:57.525 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
Maybe we can make a guest
appearance on another show.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:03.239 position:50% align:center
I know when a lot of
big comedians do TV shows,

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:04.616 position:50% align:center
they like to have
idols on as guests,

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:06.076 position:50% align:center
so they can tease them.

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:08.244 position:50% align:center
Being featured on a music
show would be good, too!

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:09.662 position:50% align:center
You're right!

00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:12.874 position:50% align:center
Or do you think it'd be possible
to appear on a TV drama?

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:16.086 position:50% align:center
How about an anime theme
song with us as characters?

00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:17.253 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:18.713 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:22:18.797 --> 00:22:20.423 position:50% align:center
Give me a break.

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:22.258 position:50% align:center
If I had the industry
connections for all that,

00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:25.053 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't be in charge of
a bunch of second-rate idols.

00:22:25.136 --> 00:22:27.931 position:50% align:center
Jeez, why can't you at least
pretend to be encouraging?

00:22:28.014 --> 00:22:29.599 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] The company
doesn't have a big budget,

00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:31.059 position:50% align:center
so we just have to deal with it!

00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:32.894 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
That's not our fault!

00:22:33.895 --> 00:22:36.147 position:50% align:center
We may not have money,
but we still need a plan.

00:22:36.231 --> 00:22:38.441 position:50% align:center
C'mon, does anybody
have a suggestion?

00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:39.859 position:50% align:center
We need something cheap

00:22:39.943 --> 00:22:42.237 position:50% align:center
that lets us showcase our
talent and personalities.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.738 position:50% align:center
Personalities?

00:22:43.822 --> 00:22:45.407 position:50% align:center
I agree, we need to find a way

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.742 position:50% align:center
to completely revamp
Fruit Tart's image.

00:22:47.826 --> 00:22:50.120 position:50% align:center
Revamp our image? I don't know.

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:55.500 position:50% align:center
You okay? You look like you
might need to use the bathroom.

00:22:55.583 --> 00:22:57.752 position:50% align:center
I do not have to pee!

00:22:57.836 --> 00:23:00.922 position:50% align:center
Um, I think I have a suggestion.

00:23:01.006 --> 00:23:03.299 position:50% align:center
When Roko said we should
showcase ourselves,

00:23:03.383 --> 00:23:06.302 position:50% align:center
the first thing that came
to mind was this neighborhood.

00:23:06.386 --> 00:23:07.554 position:50% align:center
This neighborhood?

00:23:07.637 --> 00:23:11.182 position:50% align:center
Yes, this is our hometown.

00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:13.643 position:50% align:center
I think Fruit Tart should
put on a concert right here,

00:23:13.727 --> 00:23:15.520 position:50% align:center
at Higashi-Koganei!

00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:18.148 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
A concert at Higako?

00:23:20.358 --> 00:23:21.818 position:50% align:center
