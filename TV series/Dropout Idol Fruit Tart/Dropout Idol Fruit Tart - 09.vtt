00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
Only a creep would think
something like that, Ino!

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
Then, send them off with
a message and a smile!

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.224 position:50% align:center
I sang my heart out for you!

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
It'll be most effective if
you keep it short and sweet.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
Thanks. Don't bother
listening to it that much.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.482 position:50% align:center
Don't forget to highlight your
specific character traits!

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing, but please
keep supporting us.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
May I take all of Ino's
handshake tickets,

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
since I'm such a
big fan of hers?

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Huh?

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
[HEMO giggles]

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Uh...

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50% align:center
O-Oh! And one more thing.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
Using little props
can be helpful too.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:07.964 position:50% align:center
[TONE] Hm! For me, it'd be
okonomiyaki spatulas.

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
The stronger the
character you present,

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
the more they'll remember you.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
[ROKO gasps]

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:18.391 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] It's true, it might
be embarrassing but,

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:21.269 position:50% align:center
I'd sell more merchandise
if I wore a backpack now.

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
No! Don't do it!

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
You girls have improved a lot!

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
You all seem like you're
totally prepared for tomorrow!

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
Totally prepared?

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
How about a run-down
of the concert, please?

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
We're singing the B-side of the
single tomorrow, aren't we?

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
We ought to rehearse it.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] But it's late now
and that'd be a hassle.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
--Wh-Why don't we try--
--What's that? A B-side?

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
There's another great song
we can add to our repertoire?

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Mm-hm. Yeah.
They finally finished it.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.757 position:50% align:center
What kind of song is it?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
A song about curry?

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.386 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:57.681 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] I'm Riri Higashi,
a producer at Cat Productions.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
I'm 25 years old, my birthday
is December 12th,

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
and I'm blood type A.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
My favorite thing is Hoho!

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.071 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
<i>Dropout Idol Fruit Tart!</i>

[IDOLS sigh]

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.168 position:50% align:center
[MALE PASSENGER A]
What's that? Cosplay?

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:28.670 position:50% align:center
[MALE PASSENGER B]
Maybe there's a festival?

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
[MALE PASSENGER A] Hey, doesn't
that girl look like Broko?

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
Hoho, you're a jerk.

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
So sorry about this!

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
The car's loaded with CDs
and I'm picking up Tone,

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
so you girls'll have to
take the train, okay?

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Are we there yet, Nina?

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.562 position:50% align:center
[NINA giggles]
Almost there.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS gasp]

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.527 position:50% align:center

Wow, the stage is amazing!

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Way to go, Saitama.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.614 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]
Look you guys!

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.867 position:50% align:center
The crowd is so big!

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.201 position:50% align:center
[NINA gasps]
Look at them all

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
I never expected us
to have so many fans,

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
even on a day like today!

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.374 position:50% align:center
And there's still an hour
before the show, too!

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
It's like we're Cream Anmitsu,
or something.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
The size of this venue is the
same as what they usually fill!

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
At this rate, we'll surpass
Chiko and the other girls

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
in no time. He, he, he...

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
[NINA, HAYU]
Her dark side is coming out?

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
Wait, according to this sign,

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
there's an orchestra
playing today.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
They're probably here for that.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
[INO]
What?

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Then, all those people...

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
Aren't here for our concert.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.231 position:50% align:center
[INO]
How sad!

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
But it's not like our fans
would wear suits and gowns.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.652 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Darn you, Chiko.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
Don't think you beat us yet.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
I'll surpass you someday,
just you wait.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
I'll be taller than
you and bustier!

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
[NINA, HAYU] There's no
"dark side." It's just all dark.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
Hi! Everyone! Hey!
Look over here, guys!

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
The merch sales
have already begun!

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE FAN A]
Look! It's Fruit Tart!

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
Roko's so darn cute!

[ROKO gasps]

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
You see, Roko?

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
You've got lots of fans
who want to support you!

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
That's right! So don't go
wasting your time pouting.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
[ROKO gasps]

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
I-I'm not pouting!

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.683 position:50% align:center
Being adored doesn't
make me happy.

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.187 position:50% align:center
[NINA, HAYU]
Not "dark," just silly.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
You're doing so great!

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
Well, tell us, did we
sell a 1,000 CDs yet?

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
[TONE] Oh! Uh, we're not
quite there yet.

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
But don't worry,
everything is going well.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
The merch is flying
off the shelves!

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
Huh? What merch?

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
[TONE] We've got trading cards,
pins, towels, and glow sticks!

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.372 position:50% align:center
So much to choose from!

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
When did this happen, anyway?

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
Hey, but these pictures.

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center
They were all taken
when we weren't looking!

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
[TONE chuckles nervously]
And aren't they super-cute?

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
But my absolute
favorite item is...!

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.051 position:50% align:center
Check it out!

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
These are hug pillows with
everyone's pictures on them!

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
You can take this Hayu
home for only 9,800 yen!

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
No! Don't look at it!

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.395 position:50% align:center
[HEMO gasps] I-I'd like to
reserve three of Miss Ino's

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
hug pillows!

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.441 position:50% align:center
Also, I'd like to reserve
one of each pillow, please!

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.526 position:50% align:center
No prob! You got it!

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
Darn you, Hoho.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna let her
get away with this.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
Oh good, you girls
finally made it!

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
--[HAYU] Miss Hoho.
--[HOHO] Hm?

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:08.705 position:50% align:center
We kinda-- No, we really need
to talk about all of this.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, the merch?
So you saw it, huh?

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.419 position:50% align:center
I think they came out
really innocent and cute,

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
wouldn't you agree?

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
Uh, not really?

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:20.216 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, Hayu. Look!

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
You girls are more popular
than you think, you know?

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
Aw! Stop it!

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:28.516 position:50% align:center
You're just saying that!
I can't be so easily fooled.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
Hayu's pretty silly too.

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
All right! There's not
much time until the show,

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
so let's hurry up
and get changed!

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
Wait, into what?

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
I thought we were wearing
these outfits for today's show.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Of course not!

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.697 position:50% align:center
You can't perform in such
conservative outfits.

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
Then why did you
have all of us

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
wear our outfits on the train?

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Ah! That's just
part of a publicity stunt.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
I thought having you ride
the train dressed like that

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.707 position:50% align:center
would generate some
buzz on social media,

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:53.958 position:50% align:center
you know what I mean?

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
[INO] You never cease
to amaze, Miss Hoho.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
[INO]
We're all set!

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
Aw! You girls look great!

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
What are you smiling about?

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
I thought you didn't
like these costumes

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:12.936 position:50% align:center
when you first saw them.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
And honestly, after the first
look, we were kind of at a loss.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
It's because you're stingy
with the dry cleaning.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Gimme a break!

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center
Setting up this concert
was expensive!

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.114 position:50% align:center
I had to make budget cuts!

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness Nina managed
to come to our rescue!

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.619 position:50% align:center
[HAYU] You don't notice the
holes once the appliques are on,

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
which makes them even
cuter in my opinion!

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
I agree with Hayu.

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
It's a lot showier and
it's definitely better

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
for being seen onstage.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
Nina, you are a genius!

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
Stop it. It's no big deal.

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
I've done this sort
of thing before.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
But I'm still flattered you
would say something like that.

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, everyone.
