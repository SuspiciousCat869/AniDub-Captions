My name is Tone Honmachi.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.310 position:50% align:center
I'm a first-year in high school.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
It's been three years
since I moved to Tokyo

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.689 position:50% align:center
from the Kansai region.

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.191 position:50% align:center
I love singing, so I've
always been in choir.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.861 position:50% align:center
My hard efforts and
vocal training...

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.779 position:50% align:center
...finally pay off today!

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
Hey, everybody!

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.246 position:50% align:center
Why not pick up a copy
of Fruit Tart's new CD?

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
Well, go get 'em, Tiger!

[HOHO] Girls, I have bet
everything on your future.

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:53.298 position:50% align:center
Miss Hoho? How many
CDs are there?

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.300 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Three thousand!

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:57.677 position:50% align:center
Great. We're definitely screwed.

00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.929 position:50% align:center
Three thousand
copies is a bunch!

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.057 position:50% align:center
Don't you think going
we're in over our heads?

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.683 position:50% align:center
We're an independent label!

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:07.562 position:50% align:center
I honestly don't think we have
that many fans to start with.

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
Oh, there's really
nothing to worry about.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.857 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.817 position:50% align:center
our little show has
pretty decent ratings.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.527 position:50% align:center
--[NINA] Huh?
--[ROKO] Really? That's awesome!

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.447 position:50% align:center
[giggles] I'm sure the
fact that Anmitsu Academy

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
is our lead-in show helps too.

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.576 position:50% align:center
As long as the viewers
leave the channel on,

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.495 position:50% align:center
our ratings will
really take off.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.039 position:50% align:center
And... the program after
us is popular, too,

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:28.833 position:50% align:center
so we'll become household
names in no time flat!

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:32.420 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Not only will
we pay back our huge debt,

00:03:32.504 --> 00:03:34.464 position:50% align:center
I'll be promoted as
a big time producer

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.383 position:50% align:center
at an unprecedented pace.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:40.595 position:50% align:center
[HOHO laughs] That means sushi
at Ginza, every day.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.515 position:50% align:center
--I can party every night...
--Yup. We are screwed for sure.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.520 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Why exactly are we having
our release event in Saitama,

00:03:48.603 --> 00:03:49.896 position:50% align:center
of all places?

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.065 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't we usually do
something like this in Tokyo,

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
Yokohama, or least where we're
based in Higashi-Koganei?

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:58.738 position:50% align:center
Higashi-Koganei is Tokyo, too.
You know that.

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
I would rather perform
in Shinjuku or Shibuya!

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
I'm just hoping we'll have an
audience to watch us sing.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:07.497 position:50% align:center
I don't care where we go
as long as Miss Ino's there!

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
Give me a break, huh?

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.001 position:50% align:center
Popular places like
Tokyo or Yokohama

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.502 position:50% align:center
are always booked up...

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.004 position:50% align:center
...and pricy.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50% align:center
Besides, Higako's...

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.716 position:50% align:center
...pretty deserted.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.260 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]
That's terrible!

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:24.055 position:50% align:center
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I'm partial to Omiya.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
Cause it's sorta my
home town, and...

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.476 position:50% align:center
Because it's your home town!

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center
Better a populated Saitama
than deserted Tokyo!

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
Yokohama's in Kanagawa, too!

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.567 position:50% align:center
And if we're talking
about sheer population,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.152 position:50% align:center
saitama's got a
lot more people!

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS sigh]

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.489 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Let's not forget
about the 3,000 copies!

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center
The concert's going to be free!

00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:45.618 position:50% align:center
We'll sell CDs and merch
after the morning show!

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.288 position:50% align:center
And we'll sell more after
the afternoon show!

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
If anything, tomorrow's
about selling stuff!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
Um. Is it okay if
I ask a question?

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.797 position:50% align:center
What's gonna happen
if they don't sell?

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.302 position:50% align:center
Listen: Sales and
swimsuit exposure

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.803 position:50% align:center
are directly correlated.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Swimsuit? Does that mean...?

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh!

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
How does that even work?

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:15.148 position:50% align:center
What do you expect me to do?

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
I've already put a
million yen into this!

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50% align:center
[INO]
That's not our fault!

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.945 position:50% align:center
ust look at all these
receipts that have piled up!

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.155 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Uh?

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Producing CDs
and arranging concerts.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
All these expenses
really start to add up!

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Transportation and consumables.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.998 position:50% align:center
Well, it sure does seem
like lots of expenses.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.628 position:50% align:center
What the heck is this?

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:40.340 position:50% align:center
You spent 10,000 yen
at an unagi restaurant?

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.967 position:50% align:center
You girls are too young
to understand this stuff.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
There's a lot involved when
it comes down to business.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:48.348 position:50% align:center
Besides, there's no way I
could take the higher-ups

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.058 position:50% align:center
out for beef bowls, ya know?

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.602 position:50% align:center
I can't! Even if I love them!

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.689 position:50% align:center
In any case, none of this will
matter as long as we sell

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.732 position:50% align:center
all of those
CDs tomorrow, got it?

00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
You do this and I will treat
you girls to a feast as well!

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:03.905 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS gasp]

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
To an extra-large beef bowl!

[IDOLS]
We... want... eel bowls!

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
Since we're a little desperate
to move the merch, I've arranged

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50% align:center
for someone to come along
and help us sell it all!

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
She changed the subject.

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
So, who's the helper?

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.088 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Hey, there!

00:06:20.171 --> 00:06:22.507 position:50% align:center
Tone the assistant is here,
at your service!

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.175 position:50% align:center
Based on my experience
going to different

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.468 position:50% align:center
idol events around town,

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
I'm here to teach you

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.471 position:50% align:center
of merchandise selling!

--[IDOLS] Tone?

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50% align:center
A-Are you sure?

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
If she has something over
your head, you can tell us!

00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.353 position:50% align:center
Say what?

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:36.479 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:37.814 position:50% align:center
My family runs a diner

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.983 position:50% align:center
and I just happen to be
good at customer service.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
That, and I'm getting paid.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50% align:center
But, best of all, I'm just
really happy to have a chance

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
to help you girls out,
if that's okay.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:46.531 position:50% align:center
Tone...

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:48.700 position:50% align:center
And we all know how much
you love us, Tone.

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.286 position:50% align:center
Yeah, just like I'd
expect of my rival.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.039 position:50% align:center
The additional benefit is
Tone's become really popular

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
with the viewers, too.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
Everyone's talking about the
"busty high school girl."

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
You really are the worst,
you know that, Hoho?

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
Well, let's get right
into it, okay?

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:08.178 position:50% align:center
I'll teach you the secrets of
selling as an idol, you got it?

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.471 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Yes!

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:12.307 position:50% align:center
Bowing politely is the
first crucial ingredient!

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
Bow at 45 degrees,

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
keep your hands in front,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
and be mindful of keeping a
beautiful posture, okay, ladies?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50% align:center
[INO, NINA]
Uh-huh.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Mm-hm!

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
That's it. You're all
doing great, girls.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.823 position:50% align:center
Never forget to keep your
fingertips together

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:30.158 position:50% align:center
in the front.

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Unbelievable!
She really knows her stuff.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
You can tell that she's been
at game for some time now.

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
A force to be reckoned with!

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
Next, I'll teach you
how to handle the merch

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:40.168 position:50% align:center
and do a handshake.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.336 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Right!

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:43.171 position:50% align:center
Miss Sakura, why don't
you give it a try?

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.631 position:50% align:center
Uh, Sure!

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
Thanks for coming!
And thank you for your purchase!

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
Uh. Thank you.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Huh?

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
No good, Sakura!

00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:57.644 position:50% align:center
The moment you hand over
merchandise is very special

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.896 position:50% align:center
to the fans and should
be treated as such!

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.732 position:50% align:center
Always express your gratitude
to the fullest, okay?

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.359 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]
Yes!

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.531 position:50% align:center
Thank you! We appreciate
your support!

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:10.532 position:50% align:center

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.202 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
[INO giggles]

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:19.791 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
So, if I bought every CD
and all the merchandise,

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:27.215 position:50% align:center
would I get to do this with
you all over and over again?

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.591 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
Only a creep would think
something like that, Ino!

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.222 position:50% align:center
Then, send them off with
a message and a smile!

00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.224 position:50% align:center
I sang my heart out for you!

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
It'll be most effective if
you keep it short and sweet.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
Thanks. Don't bother
listening to it that much.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:44.482 position:50% align:center
Don't forget to highlight your
specific character traits!

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:47.444 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing, but please
keep supporting us.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
May I take all of Ino's
handshake tickets,

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
since I'm such a
big fan of hers?

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Huh?

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
[HEMO giggles]

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.040 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Uh...

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.916 position:50% align:center
O-Oh! And one more thing.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.294 position:50% align:center
Using little props
can be helpful too.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:07.964 position:50% align:center
[TONE] Hm! For me, it'd be
okonomiyaki spatulas.

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
The stronger the
character you present,

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.343 position:50% align:center
the more they'll remember you.

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:12.886 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.179 position:50% align:center
[ROKO gasps]

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:18.391 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] It's true, it might
be embarrassing but,

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:21.269 position:50% align:center
I'd sell more merchandise
if I wore a backpack now.

00:09:21.353 --> 00:09:23.980 position:50% align:center
No! Don't do it!

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
You girls have improved a lot!

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
You all seem like you're
totally prepared for tomorrow!

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
Totally prepared?

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
How about a run-down
of the concert, please?

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
We're singing the B-side of the
single tomorrow, aren't we?

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:36.326 position:50% align:center
We ought to rehearse it.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] But it's late now
and that'd be a hassle.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
--Wh-Why don't we try--
--What's that? A B-side?

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.960 position:50% align:center
There's another great song
we can add to our repertoire?

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:48.713 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Mm-hm. Yeah.
They finally finished it.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.757 position:50% align:center
What kind of song is it?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.884 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
A song about curry?

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.386 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:57.681 position:50% align:center
[RIRI] I'm Riri Higashi,
a producer at Cat Productions.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:00.350 position:50% align:center
I'm 25 years old, my birthday
is December 12th,

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
and I'm blood type A.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
My favorite thing is Hoho!

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.071 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
<i>Dropout Idol Fruit Tart!</i>

[IDOLS sigh]

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.168 position:50% align:center
[MALE PASSENGER A]
What's that? Cosplay?

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:28.670 position:50% align:center
[MALE PASSENGER B]
Maybe there's a festival?

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:30.922 position:50% align:center
[MALE PASSENGER A] Hey, doesn't
that girl look like Broko?

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50% align:center
Hoho, you're a jerk.

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
So sorry about this!

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
The car's loaded with CDs
and I'm picking up Tone,

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
so you girls'll have to
take the train, okay?

00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:43.309 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Are we there yet, Nina?

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.562 position:50% align:center
[NINA giggles]
Almost there.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS gasp]

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.527 position:50% align:center

Wow, the stage is amazing!

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Way to go, Saitama.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.614 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]
Look you guys!

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.867 position:50% align:center
The crowd is so big!

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.201 position:50% align:center
[NINA gasps]
Look at them all

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
I never expected us
to have so many fans,

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
even on a day like today!

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.374 position:50% align:center
And there's still an hour
before the show, too!

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
It's like we're Cream Anmitsu,
or something.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.588 position:50% align:center
The size of this venue is the
same as what they usually fill!

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.090 position:50% align:center
At this rate, we'll surpass
Chiko and the other girls

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.259 position:50% align:center
in no time. He, he, he...

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
[NINA, HAYU]
Her dark side is coming out?

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.680 position:50% align:center
Wait, according to this sign,

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.223 position:50% align:center
there's an orchestra
playing today.

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
They're probably here for that.

00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
[INO]
What?

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Then, all those people...

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.772 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
Aren't here for our concert.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.231 position:50% align:center
[INO]
How sad!

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
But it's not like our fans
would wear suits and gowns.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.652 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Darn you, Chiko.

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.154 position:50% align:center
Don't think you beat us yet.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
I'll surpass you someday,
just you wait.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
I'll be taller than
you and bustier!

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
[NINA, HAYU] There's no
"dark side." It's just all dark.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
Hi! Everyone! Hey!
Look over here, guys!

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50% align:center
The merch sales
have already begun!

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE FAN A]
Look! It's Fruit Tart!

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
Roko's so darn cute!

[ROKO gasps]

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50% align:center
You see, Roko?

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:56.841 position:50% align:center
You've got lots of fans
who want to support you!

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:59.469 position:50% align:center
That's right! So don't go
wasting your time pouting.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
[ROKO gasps]

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
I-I'm not pouting!

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:04.683 position:50% align:center
Being adored doesn't
make me happy.

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:07.394 position:50% align:center
[giggles]

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.187 position:50% align:center
[NINA, HAYU]
Not "dark," just silly.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
You're doing so great!

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
Well, tell us, did we
sell a 1,000 CDs yet?

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
[TONE] Oh! Uh, we're not
quite there yet.

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
But don't worry,
everything is going well.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:20.907 position:50% align:center
The merch is flying
off the shelves!

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
Huh? What merch?

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.829 position:50% align:center
[TONE] We've got trading cards,
pins, towels, and glow sticks!

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.372 position:50% align:center
So much to choose from!

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.165 position:50% align:center
When did this happen, anyway?

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.334 position:50% align:center
Hey, but these pictures.

00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.837 position:50% align:center
They were all taken
when we weren't looking!

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
[TONE chuckles nervously]
And aren't they super-cute?

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
But my absolute
favorite item is...!

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:40.051 position:50% align:center
Check it out!

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
These are hug pillows with
everyone's pictures on them!

00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:45.724 position:50% align:center
You can take this Hayu
home for only 9,800 yen!

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
No! Don't look at it!

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.395 position:50% align:center
[HEMO gasps] I-I'd like to
reserve three of Miss Ino's

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
hug pillows!

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.441 position:50% align:center
Also, I'd like to reserve
one of each pillow, please!

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:56.526 position:50% align:center
No prob! You got it!

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
Darn you, Hoho.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:13:00.363 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna let her
get away with this.

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
Oh good, you girls
finally made it!

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
--[HAYU] Miss Hoho.
--[HOHO] Hm?

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:08.705 position:50% align:center
We kinda-- No, we really need
to talk about all of this.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, the merch?
So you saw it, huh?

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.419 position:50% align:center
I think they came out
really innocent and cute,

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
wouldn't you agree?

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.464 position:50% align:center
Uh, not really?

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:20.216 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, Hayu. Look!

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
You girls are more popular
than you think, you know?

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
Aw! Stop it!

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:28.516 position:50% align:center
You're just saying that!
I can't be so easily fooled.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.769 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
Hayu's pretty silly too.

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:33.146 position:50% align:center
All right! There's not
much time until the show,

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:34.898 position:50% align:center
so let's hurry up
and get changed!

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
Wait, into what?

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:39.235 position:50% align:center
I thought we were wearing
these outfits for today's show.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Of course not!

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.697 position:50% align:center
You can't perform in such
conservative outfits.

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
Then why did you
have all of us

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:45.533 position:50% align:center
wear our outfits on the train?

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:48.244 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Ah! That's just
part of a publicity stunt.

00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
I thought having you ride
the train dressed like that

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.707 position:50% align:center
would generate some
buzz on social media,

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:53.958 position:50% align:center
you know what I mean?

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:56.169 position:50% align:center
[INO] You never cease
to amaze, Miss Hoho.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
[INO]
We're all set!

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.223 position:50% align:center
Aw! You girls look great!

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.849 position:50% align:center
What are you smiling about?

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
I thought you didn't
like these costumes

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:12.936 position:50% align:center
when you first saw them.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
And honestly, after the first
look, we were kind of at a loss.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
It's because you're stingy
with the dry cleaning.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Gimme a break!

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center
Setting up this concert
was expensive!

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.114 position:50% align:center
I had to make budget cuts!

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness Nina managed
to come to our rescue!

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.619 position:50% align:center
[HAYU] You don't notice the
holes once the appliques are on,

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
which makes them even
cuter in my opinion!

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
I agree with Hayu.

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
It's a lot showier and
it's definitely better

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
for being seen onstage.

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.546 position:50% align:center
Nina, you are a genius!

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.881 position:50% align:center
Stop it. It's no big deal.

00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
I've done this sort
of thing before.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.928 position:50% align:center
But I'm still flattered you
would say something like that.

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:49.222 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, everyone.

[HEMO] I know, but just
thinking about singing

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.696 position:50% align:center
in front of people makes
me feel embarrassed.

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
I completely understand.

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
I was so nervous
in the beginning,

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
it took some getting used to.

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:34.911 position:50% align:center
Singing on stage
is really cool.

I'm sorry, girls.

00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
Whenever I get nervous, I start
to cry and I can't seem to stop.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:43.837 position:50% align:center
No way! Not fair!

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.756 position:50% align:center
Crying is a lot cuter
than my nervous reaction!

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Yours is actually a
little disgusting, Ino.

To be honest,
I'm still scared about

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.961 position:50% align:center
a whole bunch of little things.

00:17:25.045 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
Will I get the choreography?

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:28.590 position:50% align:center
Will I forget the lyrics
while I'm singing?

00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
Will the audience
even like the show?

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
These thoughts never stop.
