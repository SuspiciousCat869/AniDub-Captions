00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.435 position:50% align:center
I need to talk to you.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.437 position:50% align:center
Yeah? What's on your mind, Hemo?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.480 position:50% align:center
Is it serious?
You're acting weird.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.941 position:50% align:center
Would you happen to be
interested in a small girl

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
who wears her hair in buns?

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:30.113 position:50% align:center

Look, I don't care if you
don't fill me in on every

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center
little detail, but you
shouldn't expect

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.897 position:50% align:center
that I'll agree to
cooperate with them.

[RIRI] I know that this
is little inconvenient,

but now that our
programs air back-to-back,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.864 position:50% align:center
why not be on good
terms with them?

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:38.033 position:50% align:center
They helped us with
our concert, remember?

--[CHIKO giggle] She's right!
--[RIRI] Huh?

And when you say your
adorable older sister,

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
I know you're talking about that
small creature with the buns.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50% align:center
Whose persona's very
similar to mine!

00:02:57.802 --> 00:03:01.264 position:50% align:center
I don't particularly like how
she's a lot shorter than me!

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.641 position:50% align:center
It totally goes against
the established formula

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:06.519 position:50% align:center
of the taller mature junior high
school girl and the pint-sized,

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
childish highschooler!

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
Ah. You do have a point.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:12.359 position:50% align:center
But it's not like the two of you

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.778 position:50% align:center
fit into the established
formulas, either.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
You're way too manipulative
to be the cute types.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.616 position:50% align:center
[NUA] Oh? So should we
break up the band?

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.827 position:50% align:center
Really? C'mon, are you sure
you want to talk about

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
one of your seniors in the
industry like that, Nua?

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.123 position:50% align:center
[NUA]
Huh?

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.542 position:50% align:center
I mean, wasn't the only reason
you wanted to become an idol

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.711 position:50% align:center
in the first place cause
you saw Chiko's sister

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:33.505 position:50% align:center
on television when
we were younger?

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50% align:center
[NUA yelps]

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.258 position:50% align:center
[RUA] You had all her CDs and
merch when we were little.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.010 position:50% align:center
So what happened?

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:41.137 position:50% align:center
You would even force me to
play make believe with you,

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
so you could be Broko, remember?

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
And weren't you totally excited
that you got to meet Broko

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
at our last concert?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.189 position:50% align:center
Stop it. Cut it out.

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
Take it back!

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
That was when I was
in elementary school!

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I was a fan, and yeah,
she was my age, but so what?

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
It's no big deal!

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.823 position:50% align:center
Oh? This is getting good.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.575 position:50% align:center
Stop beating around the bush and
just tell me once and for all

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
if you're for or against
working with them, Rua?

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:07.163 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, okay then, let me see.

00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.166 position:50% align:center
I mean, the Fruit Tart girls are
really cute. And professionally,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
it might be a good idea
for us to work with them.

--[NUA] What?
--[RUA giggles]

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center

just the thought of our seniors

advantage of this chance

She said that she
wanted to volunteer

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
to become our assistant!

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.962 position:50% align:center

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:40.382 position:50% align:center

who's a girl our age?

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:47.097 position:50% align:center
I guess so, but do you really
think your classmate

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.724 position:50% align:center
should get tangled up
in this mess with us?

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:52.519 position:50% align:center

you're a flirt, right?

Tone, um... are you
sure about this?

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
It's a local channel,
but it's still TV.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:03.905 position:50% align:center
You probably won't
get paid, either.

Don't you worry about me.
I don't mind.

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
I'm totally on board!

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:11.830 position:50% align:center
I have my own censor bar,
and just the idea of being able

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:15.250 position:50% align:center
to help Fruit Tart in any
way makes me so happy!

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:16.835 position:50% align:center
I also wanted to say,
Miss Roko,

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
that I was deeply moved
by your last performance!

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:22.382 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay. Thanks, I guess.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.217 position:50% align:center
But I still have to ask...

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Huh?

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:28.763 position:50% align:center
Why are you still wearing your
uniform when it's after school?

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.474 position:50% align:center
Did our manager tell you to
do something inappropriate?

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:32.684 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Uh...

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Like cater to a
"schoolgirl fetish"?

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.311 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
What?

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:36.688 position:50% align:center
H-How rude!

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:40.025 position:50% align:center
I would never ask her to
do anything inappropriate!

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.444 position:50% align:center
I merely suggested that
she wear something nice,

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
like a school uniform.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:45.864 position:50% align:center
I was right.

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
Don't judge me! We need all the
assets we can get for the show!

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
You of all people
show know that!

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
What are you talking about?

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.622 position:50% align:center
[grunts It's what
attracts high ratings!

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center
Which also benefits all
of you, I might add!

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center

Uh...

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
Don't drag our fans
into your schemes!

That it's somehow unseemly?

You're the pot calling
the kettle black.

with soft squishy things?

[giggles] How cool! So this
is the famous Cat Dome!

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
Just think of the
number of actual cats

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.336 position:50% align:center
you could fit inside
of the Cat Dome?

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:42.921 position:50% align:center
If we make it big,

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.632 position:50% align:center
then we'll be able to have our
concerts in there, right? Right?

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:48.009 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's right.

Huh?

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
What?

[INO gasps]
It looks like their aura!

00:16:29.239 --> 00:16:31.324 position:50% align:center
That's how you know an
idol group is sure to make it

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
all the way to the top!

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:36.538 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Chiko, I just
don't understand.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:37.914 position:50% align:center
When did you...?

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.166 position:50% align:center
And how did you...

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.169 position:50% align:center
...manage to get your boobs
and height to grow so fast!

00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
That's what you want to know?

Before our next song,

I'd like to introduce you to
some very special friends!

--[CROWD] Oh?

That's right!
The ladies from Fruit Tart

to promote their newest song!

[gasps]

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
[CHIKO] Did you know that
Roko Sekino, their leader,

00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:05.275 position:50% align:center
is my beloved older sister!

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center
--[CROWD] Wow!
--[ROKO gasps]

00:17:07.736 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center

leader this entire time?

[IDOLS]
Uh, maybe?

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.242 position:50% align:center
Hoho!

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
You never said anything about us
having to go up there on stage!

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:19.581 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:17:19.664 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
It surprised me, too.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
Good luck up there!

Liar!

00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] What do we do?
I'm not ready for this!

00:17:25.628 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd say at this point you
don't have much of a choice.

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:30.633 position:50% align:center
So go out there on stage

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:33.094 position:50% align:center
and show them what
you're all made of!

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:35.305 position:50% align:center
And prepare for failure.

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.849 position:50% align:center
We're so screwed!

00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:41.102 position:50% align:center

new song, and support my group,

00:17:41.186 --> 00:17:44.064 position:50% align:center

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
I wanna hear what they
have to say about

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center
their cute new song, don't you?

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.404 position:50% align:center
We have to speak?

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Say something cute.
Say something cute.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.575 position:50% align:center
Say something cute...

00:17:57.369 --> 00:17:58.536 position:50% align:center

the whole thing!

Ya bombed it, Roko.

00:18:33.738 --> 00:18:37.033 position:50% align:center
What?! Just shut up! I think
loco moco is cute, okay?

00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:39.244 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] I know we haven't
taken the time to practice

00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
public speaking, but...

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.915 position:50% align:center
...you should already have
experience with it, Roko.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
What happened to all your poise?
You were a famous child actor.

[gasps]
Who asked you?

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
I can't pull off that
cutesy act anymore.

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:55.218 position:50% align:center
You can call me Broko,
just like a broccoli!

[giggles]

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
If I acted that way now
that I'm in a high school,

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
it would be so
cringe-worthy!

Eh...

00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
Heh. Well I think everything
you say is cute!

Well, I'd like to see
any of you do better!

You first, Ino!

00:19:14.863 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
Uh. Okay.

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:20.326 position:50% align:center
What's something cute?
What's something cute?

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center

Upper arm! That's it!

Huh?

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:26.624 position:50% align:center
Also... arm pit?

what we're doing?

not body parts!

Let's see.

Welcome back, master,
did you have a good day?

How's that?

You for real?

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.101 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that was pretty bad.

How mean!

Oh, come on, Nina, I know
you can do better.

be able to do it right.

You're the girliest one
in this entire house.

But, uh, I'm still new here.

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
Too much pressure!

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:06.498 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Aww. Just go for
it and say anything.

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
Talk about your
relationship goals.

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.377 position:50% align:center
Relationship?

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.671 position:50% align:center

O...kay.

or something you'd want to hear?

Uh, well, um...

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:34.734 position:50% align:center
How about something like...?

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
You like me? No way.

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:38.321 position:50% align:center
How's that?

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:40.782 position:50% align:center
[INO, ROKO] Oh, no.
That was way too sincere.

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50% align:center
Don't react.

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:46.746 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Every single one of
you girls is so pathetic.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.916 position:50% align:center
Listen up, ladies, and let an
expert show you how it's done,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
I mean me.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:53.920 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
She's drunk.

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:56.756 position:50% align:center
May I please have Dom PÃ©rignon.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.675 position:50% align:center
It's no use. She's an idiot.

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.844 position:50% align:center
Aw! Did you call me an idiot?

00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:04.556 position:50% align:center
I'll have you know Riri buys me
a drink every time I say that.

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:06.725 position:50% align:center
Yes, Hoho, whatever you want.

00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:08.935 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] What the heck
is she talking about?

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:11.021 position:50% align:center
I believe you have
all proved my point.

00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:13.064 position:50% align:center
It's not that easy to be cute.

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
You see how impossible it is to
say something cute on command?

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
You're right, but Cream Anmitsu
manages to pull it off

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:20.739 position:50% align:center
naturally every time.

00:21:20.822 --> 00:21:23.158 position:50% align:center
How can we possibly
compete with that?

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
Ha! A cat is cute, but naturally
deceptive and also cruel.

Hence: Cat Productions.

00:21:28.997 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center

[INO]
I got it!

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.923 position:50% align:center
To achieve the ideal cuteness,
I suggest that we all work

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:40.925 position:50% align:center
on our girliness together!

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
Work on Girliness?

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
And how would we
do that, exactly?

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.514 position:50% align:center
Go eat pancakes or something?

00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:48.892 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, let's see.

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:51.269 position:50% align:center
We can do impressions
of the girliest things

00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:52.395 position:50% align:center
about each other?

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:54.272 position:50% align:center
It'll be just like study group.

aren't you super
into aromatherapy?

--[HEMO gasps]
--[NINA] No, not really.

innocent look fool you, Ino.
