Well, we sold 500 copies
before the morning show.

[NINA] The hardcore fans bought
their stuff in the morning,

we need to add some extra
pizzazz into the show!

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:02.676 position:50% align:center
But none of us knew
how to do that!

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.928 position:50% align:center
Higher up? Does she mean me?

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.597 position:50% align:center
And so, we thought maybe
what we could do was

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:09.349 position:50% align:center
show off a little
more of our skin!

00:14:09.432 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
You sell out!

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.602 position:50% align:center
[NINA] That was only supposed
to be as a last resort!

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:14.229 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
You don't have to!

00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
We've still got a long way to go
with our singing and dancing.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.442 position:50% align:center
And I couldn't
think of any other way

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
to connect with you guys better.

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:25.323 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:27.784 position:50% align:center
Hey! What do you guys
think I should do next?

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:28.910 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
You said all of that

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:30.203 position:50% align:center
without thinking it
through it, first?

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:31.496 position:50% align:center
[INO]
I'm sorry,

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
but I don't have any
idea how to make friends!

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Me neither.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:37.627 position:50% align:center
Hey! Say something!

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
Wait! Why am I next?

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.630 position:50% align:center
[INO] Fine. Then you go, Roko!

00:14:40.714 --> 00:14:43.133 position:50% align:center

Hang on! Where the heck is Roko?

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Hey!

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:45.385 position:50% align:center

[CHIKO chuckles]

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.514 position:50% align:center
Great! I can't think of
anything to say anymore.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.516 position:50% align:center
So, from here on out
we're just gonna wing it!

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:53.351 position:50% align:center
I hope that's okay with you all!

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:56.563 position:50% align:center
And I welcome everyone to get
fired up right along with us!

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:58.148 position:50% align:center

Sounds good to us!

our new song!

[TONE] Oh, wow. You've really
done it now, Fruit Tart!

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.778 position:50% align:center
This song is the
just the greatest!

00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:46.321 position:50% align:center
[OTO]
What?!

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.698 position:50% align:center
That... That train wreck?
Are you serious?

Of course, I am!

[OTO]
Uh...

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
[TONE] It's their first
time hearing this song,

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.539 position:50% align:center
and they're already
dancing along.

00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
Whoa, yeah, they are...

00:15:57.999 --> 00:15:59.793 position:50% align:center
That's not something
you see every day.

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:01.795 position:50% align:center
Remember asking what
makes them so special?

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
Well, that's your answer.

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:04.923 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:07.676 position:50% align:center
It's said that a song is good
if it moves the listener.

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
[OTO] But somehow
this feels more like

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:14.349 position:50% align:center
brainwashing than music.

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:28.321 position:50% align:center

we're going to have a feast

All of you have

Definitely not!

It's been a while since
we've had <i>okonomiyaki</i> !

Well, we hardly ever
go out to eat,

so we never get
the chance to have it.

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:31.588 position:50% align:center
Let me guess, we're each
on a budget of 500 yen?

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:33.381 position:50% align:center
Like how we were
with the beef bowls?

00:19:33.465 --> 00:19:35.008 position:50% align:center
What? That's so rude!

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
That's the whole point
of making this episode!

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:38.511 position:50% align:center

the whole thing.

and top it off with an egg!

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.794 position:50% align:center
[HEMO] Incorporate
as much air as you can

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center

The classic Osaka vs

debate has broken out!

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:14.024 position:50% align:center
My dad is from Osaka originally,
and my mom is from Hiroshima,

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:15.692 position:50% align:center
so this dispute caused
a tremendous rift

between their families right at
the beginning of their marriage!

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.406 position:50% align:center

It looks like the battle
lines have been drawn.

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:26.578 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you're
taking their side, too, Nina.

Look!

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center
Osaka-style is fluffier and
the batter is really delicious!

Wait! Not me!

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.681 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
We wanna know what you think

00:21:46.765 --> 00:21:48.725 position:50% align:center
as a person with
ties to both styles!

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:50.101 position:50% align:center
Leave me out of it!

00:21:50.185 --> 00:21:53.355 position:50% align:center
Fine, well, I think...

00:21:53.438 --> 00:21:54.606 position:50% align:center
You think...?

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:56.107 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
I think <i>mojayaki's</i> the best!

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:57.359 position:50% align:center
--[GROUP gasps]
--[ROKO] Tokyo-style?

00:21:57.442 --> 00:21:58.610 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, I mean...

00:21:58.693 --> 00:22:00.236 position:50% align:center
I got hooked on it
since the first time

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
I tried it when I moved here.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.492 position:50% align:center
Truth is I love both
Osaka and Hiroshima-styles!

00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:07.869 position:50% align:center
Either way, it's still
the most cost-effective dish

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:10.830 position:50% align:center
that basically just uses flour
and cabbage as ingredients!

00:22:10.914 --> 00:22:13.667 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] That's not exactly
a ringing endorsement.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.044 position:50% align:center
[TONE] So, lets agree that
they're both awesome!

00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:18.672 position:50% align:center
This is supposed to be
a celebration after all.

00:22:18.755 --> 00:22:19.923 position:50% align:center
Let's eat and make up.

00:22:20.006 --> 00:22:21.549 position:50% align:center
That sounds good to me.

00:22:21.633 --> 00:22:22.634 position:50% align:center
Shall we finish it off?

00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:24.427 position:50% align:center
[INO giggles]
Yeah!

00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:25.887 position:50% align:center
--[INO] With mustard-mayo!
--[ROKO] With only mayo!

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:26.971 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
What?!

00:22:27.055 --> 00:22:28.848 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?!

00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:32.060 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Tone!

00:22:32.143 --> 00:22:34.396 position:50% align:center
We'd all like you to have this.

00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:38.233 position:50% align:center
W-Wait a minute! An autographed
copy of your debut CD?

00:22:38.316 --> 00:22:42.946 position:50% align:center
Listen, this is to thank you
for everything you've done.

00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:44.322 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:44.406 --> 00:22:46.533 position:50% align:center
[INO] I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
we don't have money,

00:22:46.616 --> 00:22:48.368 position:50% align:center
so this is all we can do.

00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:49.744 position:50% align:center
We appreciate you.

00:22:49.828 --> 00:22:51.454 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Tonecchi!

00:22:51.538 --> 00:22:52.706 position:50% align:center
You take care of us!

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:54.207 position:50% align:center
You've helped us all so much.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.126 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.422 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
No, this is great.

00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:03.049 position:50% align:center
It's the best gift you
could ever give me!

00:23:03.133 --> 00:23:05.260 position:50% align:center
Thanks, everyone.
I'll cherish it,

00:23:05.343 --> 00:23:08.054 position:50% align:center
especially since your show
probably won't get renewed.

00:23:08.138 --> 00:23:08.930 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Huh?

00:23:09.014 --> 00:23:10.181 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:23:10.265 --> 00:23:11.850 position:50% align:center
Not get renewed?

00:23:11.933 --> 00:23:17.856 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
What?!

00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:21.818 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Hmph!

00:23:24.654 --> 00:23:28.700 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Coming at you next time
on <i>Dropout Idol Fruit Tart</i> !

00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:31.411 position:50% align:center
Nua here!

00:23:31.494 --> 00:23:32.871 position:50% align:center
Hey, I only appeared announcing

00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:35.623 position:50% align:center
the episode title and in the
midpoint break this time!

00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:38.835 position:50% align:center
In fact, I barely have
any scenes next time, too!

00:23:38.918 --> 00:23:40.545 position:50% align:center
I'll just have to show
Fruit Tart a thing or two

00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:42.839 position:50% align:center
in the National Idol
Championships!

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:46.468 position:50% align:center
