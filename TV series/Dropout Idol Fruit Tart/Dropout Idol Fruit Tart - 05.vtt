00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.521 position:50% align:center
I love you, Roko!

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
--[ROKO groans]
--[NINA] No! It's not true!

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
You don't understand!

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
The real reason I like
small things is because

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.112 position:50% align:center
I'm insecure about the
bigger parts of me.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
But it's different with you,
I promise, I like you

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
for who you are and not just
because you're small, Roko!

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
R-- You really mean it?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
[NINA gasps]
We're childhood friends, right?

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
I would never lie to you.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
--Nina!
--Oh, Roko!

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
That's a half truth.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Yeah, probably.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:30.510 position:50% align:center
All right! I'm givin'
it my rocker spirit!

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
Bigger. I just have
to make it bigger.

--[HEMO sighs]
--[ROKO grunts]

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Roko, don't you
already have an autograph?

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
Why not use that one?

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
[INO] It was printed, but I
used to have your autographed

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
Broko poster as a kid!

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
I just loved looking at it!

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
[ROKO groans]

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
So have you decided against
using that autograph?

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center
I am never using it again.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center
But it's a really
adorable signature.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center
You just wouldn't
understand, Ino.

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.455 position:50% align:center
You have no idea what it's like
to be stuck using the same dumb

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
autograph you made up when you
were only six years old!

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.046 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Ino.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50% align:center
Nina.

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.214 position:50% align:center
Roko.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
Hemo.

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
Hayu.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Great! Having everyone
base their designs

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center
on Ino's autograph
turned out really nicely!

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS giggle]

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
Now that's done, you girls
are prepared to sign

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
thousands of autographs.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Huh?

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about,
thousands of autographs?

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure I already
mentioned it to you earlier.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.569 position:50% align:center
We are going to have each of
you sign your new autographs

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
on every single
copy of the CD.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
You never said anything about
signing all those copies.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.035 position:50% align:center
What did you expect?
New idols like yourselves

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:38.870 position:50% align:center
have to give it your all
if you want to succeed.

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS groan]

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't worry too
much about it, though.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
I know I said "thousands,"
but at your current popularity,

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center
you have a better chance
winning the lottery

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:48.296 position:50% align:center
than making money from this.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50% align:center
You can't be serious.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec, aren't idol's
CDs really popular these days?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
Would you say Fruit Tart
is "popular"?

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS groan]

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
I guess not.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
Let's not forget,

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
you girls also made your debut
independent of any major label.

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
So, we can't print that
many copies to begin with.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Huh? But why not?

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:11.528 position:50% align:center
Well, to explain it simply.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.364 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] A major music label
handles mass distribution 

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.658 position:50% align:center
by paying for lots
of advertising!

What kind of weird
mental picture's that?

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
In stark contrast, a humble
independent label

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
has to do all the
work on their own.

[ROKO]
Wow, aren't we dramatic?

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
What I'm trying to say is
there's a big difference

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
in financial power, here.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.643 position:50% align:center
Why are you telling
us all of this?

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:44.894 position:50% align:center
Listen, girls.

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:48.565 position:50% align:center
If your debut CD doesn't
sell enough copies...

If it doesn't sell?

and it will be the
end of Fruit Tart!

out of the Mouse House,

a good reason,

That's because that particular

We're planning on
announcing it this week!

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center

our live performance,

[TONE] Can she be more obvious?
This girl is so shameless.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.655 position:50% align:center
It's actually scaring me!

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
[TONE] So will Hemo be part of
the upcoming CD debut, then?

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.869 position:50% align:center
[INO giggles]
Of course she's gonna be.

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
That said, we still haven't
actually recorded her

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.832 position:50% align:center
for it yet, though.

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
But we're not worried, because
Hemocchi was the number one pick

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.044 position:50% align:center
in a Cat Productions audition!

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.088 position:50% align:center
So, she's gotta be
great at singing!

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center
[HEMO squeals]

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Ah!

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:44.134 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Please don't hate me, Ino!

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
I couldn't bear it

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
Hemo, what's wrong?

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Uh...?

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Maybe she's not that good.

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
What you don't know is that the
audition I placed first in,

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.564 position:50% align:center
was to find the girl with the
best black-haired pigtails

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:58.565 position:50% align:center
in Japan.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
That's an oddly
specific audition.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
[HEMO] I'm not quite sure
about all the details,

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
but Miss Riri was the one who
planned the entire thing.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.074 position:50% align:center
Trust me, black-haired
girls with pigtails

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:09.617 position:50% align:center
are super popular now.

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU]
Oh...

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
Oh! She did say the whole
idea was actually suggested

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:14.748 position:50% align:center
to her by someone else.

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
[HOHO chuckles]
C'mon do it, Riri.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.711 position:50% align:center
Now, why doesn't that
surprise me one bit?

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
[HEMO] The truth is, I'm not
too confident about my singing.

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU, TONE]
Hmmm.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
I have an idea!

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
Why don't we all go somewhere to
practice our singing right now?

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:30.847 position:50% align:center
But where?

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.015 position:50% align:center
Karaoke!

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
Wait right now, right now?

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
I've actually never been before,

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
but I've always
wanted to try it out!

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.813 position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to hear everyone
sing their hearts out!

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
And when you say, "everyone,"

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
does that mean I
can join you, too?

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
Of course, you can come!

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
Uh! I have a question.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
So, are things like autographs
and selfies allowed,

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.079 position:50% align:center
and will we be able
to touch the guests?

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:56.373 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry but that's
a little bit...

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
Aw, I get it.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
How disappointing.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
[HAYU] Okay, these two
need to get a grip!

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:04.255 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:09.594 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! So this is karaoke!

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:11.805 position:50% align:center
This must be what it feels
like to be a high-school girl

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.223 position:50% align:center
living in the big city!

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:16.226 position:50% align:center
Don't get too excited now,
Miss Sakura.

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
Oh, it just occurred to me.

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.188 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you be hiding your
faces, since you're idols?

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
Someone might recognize you!

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU groan]

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:25.944 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Guess not...

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
[INO giggles]

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
This room's gigantic!

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
And all of these
devices are high-tech!

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
The whole package was so cheap,

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.327 position:50% align:center
and it even included
one free drink!

00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:35.870 position:50% align:center
Talk about a really great deal.

00:16:35.954 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
I've been watching your show,

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
and the Mouse House always
seems to be so tight on money.

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
But just between us girls,

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.044 position:50% align:center
it can't really be
that bad, can it?

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU]
Uh...

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:46.423 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
You can't believe everything
you see on television.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
You know that!

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:51.594 position:50% align:center
And besides, we have a bunch
of generous neighbors

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.388 position:50% align:center
who like to gift us
with plenty of food!

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.682 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU laugh]

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:58.685 position:50% align:center
[TONE] I have a feeling I
wasn't supposed to ask that.

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Anyway, who wants to sing first?

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
[INO] Oh! It's gotta
be Hemo, of course!

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Wha...?

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:08.153 position:50% align:center
I couldn't do that. I already
told you, I'm not very good.

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
I think maybe... the first
person should be Miss Tone!

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
Wait! Why me?

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you would
put me on the spot like that

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
in front of an idol group!

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:17.287 position:50% align:center
Well, it's just...

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
I have no clue how to navigate
one of these things!

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Mm-hm.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
[TONE gasps]

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
So, uh I guess I'll
go first, then.

[TONE]
That was fun!

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
It's been a while
since I sang so much!

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
See, Hayu, there's no need
to for you to worry so much.

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
It's almost impossible for
anyone to get a perfect 

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.216 position:50% align:center
score, even if they're a
professional singer.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
May be, but my best
score was only 45.

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
Sorry, don't feel bad.

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
It probably just means that
I didn't do a very good job

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
teaching you.

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh.
You helped me, Tonecchi.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:48.438 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah! I just remembered that

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
Cream Anmitsu's having a
street concert on Sunday.

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
Really? Sounds like
that's gonna be fun!

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
[TONE] They'll be at the
stage next to the dome.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
It'll be a great opportunity to
watch some professional idols

in action!

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
But it's already sold out,

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
so it'll be impossible to
get tickets for everyone.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
That's not surprising,

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.332 position:50% align:center
since Cream Anmitsu is
a very popular group.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
You're right about that.

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
The day the tickets were sold,

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:13.213 position:50% align:center
I stayed up all night to be
first in line to get this!

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.006 position:50% align:center
I powered through with
only my determination

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
and one cup of coffee!

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center

O-Oh, I see.

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
Hey, you know what?
