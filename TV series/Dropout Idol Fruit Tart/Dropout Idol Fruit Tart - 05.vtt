[INO] Right off of
Higashi-Koganei station,

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:18.268 position:50% align:center
is the city of Musashino,
which feels preserved in time.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.437 position:50% align:center
In this peaceful
residential district,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.149 position:50% align:center
stands a special building:
the Mouse House.

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:27.569 position:50% align:center
There, young girls who aspire
to be tomorrow's top idols

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
live under strict rules,

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.281 position:50% align:center
which are imposed upon
them day and night.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.158 position:50% align:center
They must all work
diligently together,

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:36.077 position:50% align:center
in pursuit of a common dream--

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.245 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
Heh?

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:39.497 position:50% align:center
Ah?

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:40.415 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:42.042 position:50% align:center
[snores]

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS gasp]

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.383 position:50% align:center
[ROKO grunts]
Yes! I get to go first today!

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:54.095 position:50% align:center
--Wha...?
--Who's in there?

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.431 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Not again!

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:59.184 position:50% align:center
[HOHO snores]

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.603 position:50% align:center
The bathroom is not for
your drunken naps!

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.229 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Rule #1: In the morning,

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:05.774 position:50% align:center
the bathroom is
first come, first serve!

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:11.780 position:50% align:center
[sighs] One must always
use the least amount

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.948 position:50% align:center
of toilet paper
humanly possible.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:17.577 position:50% align:center
And don't spray air freshener
for longer than three seconds.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.871 position:50% align:center
Sorry for the wait!

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.373 position:50% align:center
Okay, then.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.249 position:50% align:center
Nina, we'll have to
deduct 28 seconds

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
from your bathroom
time tomorrow.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.294 position:50% align:center
It's just a few seconds.

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:27.796 position:50% align:center
Won't you please
give me a break?

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.465 position:50% align:center
[INO] Rule #2: Morning bathroom
time is limited

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:31.758 position:50% align:center
to three minutes.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.260 position:50% align:center
[sighs]
Today was a close one.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.056 position:50% align:center
Oh, but I better hurry,
or else I'll end up getting

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.934 position:50% align:center
docked 10 seconds on my
bathroom time as a penalty.

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.520 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Ah... Uh...

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.231 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Eh?

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:48.983 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.904 position:50% align:center
[ROKO giggles]
Nice, this looks good.

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:57.200 position:50% align:center
[INO] Rule #3: Toilet paper,
one-ply of course, must be

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:00.578 position:50% align:center
replenished by the person
who used up the last roll.

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:05.834 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Breakfast is served. Let's eat!

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.627 position:50% align:center
Here you go, Ino.

00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:09.963 position:50% align:center
I made this egg
especially for you!

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.966 position:50% align:center
Wow, it looks delicious.
Thank you, Hemo!

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
--Hey...
--Uh-huh?

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center
Why are you always serving
Ino after everyone else?

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.557 position:50% align:center
Did you put something special
in her food or something?

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:23.101 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.520 position:50% align:center
[HEMO giggles]
The special ingredient is love!

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:27.147 position:50% align:center
How thoughtful!
Thank you very much!

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.231 position:50% align:center
[NINA, ROKO groan]

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.566 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
That was a weird pause.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50% align:center
[INO] Rule #4:
Eat breakfast together

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:33.737 position:50% align:center
to start the day off right!

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.197 position:50% align:center
[ROKO hums]

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:38.908 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Hm?

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:42.704 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hey, Roko?

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.414 position:50% align:center
Don't you think maybe
it's time for you

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:45.957 position:50% align:center
to start using that thing?

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:47.667 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
What thing?

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.169 position:50% align:center
What I mean is...

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
...your booster step.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.047 position:50% align:center
I will never use it!

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.132 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Rule #5: Morning washroom time

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center
is ten minutes per two people!

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.927 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Oh no, this is bad!

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
We don't have any
strawberries to wake

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.930 position:50% align:center
Hayu up with!

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.183 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Hey, we could use this
instead, don't you think?

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.559 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's red too.

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:06.102 position:50% align:center
I think that might
be a little too--

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.021 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
I'm gonna try it!

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.606 position:50% align:center
[sobs]

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.608 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
He, he! Worked like a charm.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:14.861 position:50% align:center
Guys, Roko is being so mean.
She's bullying me!

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center
Mental note. It worked.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.739 position:50% align:center
What's going on, Ino?

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:20.742 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Rule #6: Idols must be punctual!

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:23.411 position:50% align:center
Being on time is
your responsibility!

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center

Ta-da!

00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50% align:center
Gather around and
look at how amazing

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
our CD cover
turned out, everyone!

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.357 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Wow!

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
Incredible! It looks
so professional!

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
I didn't know what to expect
after that crazy swimsuit shoot,

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
but you actually did
a really good job!

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
Heh, well of course I did.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
It's all part of being a
great manager, you know.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.495 position:50% align:center
But I'm also selling
those swimsuit pics

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
for 500 yen a piece!

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.748 position:50% align:center

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
What?

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
Now that we've completed
the cover for the CD,

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.545 position:50% align:center
it's time for the next episode!

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
Episode 6:
<i>Dropout Idol Fruit Tart</i> !

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
"Come up with your
autographs together!"

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Eh...

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:45.095 position:50% align:center
You mean like our signatures?

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.390 position:50% align:center
After all, you girls are
officially an idol group now.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:51.643 position:50% align:center
Each of you need to have a cute
and recognizable autograph.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:53.269 position:50% align:center
And you know...

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.397 position:50% align:center
...they could be worth a lot
of money in a few years.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.816 position:50% align:center
Why are you looking away?

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
Uh... Now that you mention it,

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.821 position:50% align:center
I've never really thought
about my autograph before.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.406 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ino, what about you?

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.949 position:50% align:center
Wha--? What about who?

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
Uh, I guess I can show you mine.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.499 position:50% align:center
I was thinking maybe
something like this?

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:16.626 position:50% align:center
Aw! That's such an
adorable autograph!

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.754 position:50% align:center
Well, I have been
practicing it for a while now.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
But what's this e-mail
address-looking thing

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:22.632 position:50% align:center
at the bottom?

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:24.175 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's there because...

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50% align:center
...if I meet any female fans,
I would want them to be able

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:29.305 position:50% align:center
to contact me so that
we could become friends.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
I couldn't dream
of anything better.

00:06:31.141 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
You're gonna remove
that part right now.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
I already saved it to my phone.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:38.940 position:50% align:center
Ooh, me next! I even have
an autograph ready to go!

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
Check it out!
What do you guys think?

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.777 position:50% align:center
I mean, that's pretty memorable.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
[ROKO gasps]

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.238 position:50% align:center
The black wings and
crosses represent

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
the inner darkness
deep in my soul.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.617 position:50% align:center
And those big bold letters
represent the hidden power

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:51.661 position:50% align:center
of my secret dark energy!
Yeah...!

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing she'll regret
this in a few years,

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
so we should probably stop her.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:56.374 position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:58.251 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Hmm?

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.545 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Nina and Hemo, you're next.

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:02.672 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
Here's what I came up with.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
Does something like
this look okay?

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center
Eh... Nina, your letters
are way too tiny.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
And, Hemo, what's the deal
with the sakura flower?

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
I thought your last
name was Midori.

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.976 position:50% align:center
I think those two things
go very well together,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.977 position:50% align:center
do you not agree?

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.396 position:50% align:center
You know!

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.690 position:50% align:center
Ino's last name's "Sakura"
and mine is "Midori".

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center
Both are very nature-y

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.943 position:50% align:center
and that's why they
go well together!

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
Right? Don't you agree?

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
Oh! Of course I do.

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Ino, this girl is
scarily obsessed with you.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.621 position:50% align:center
Nina, this is so small
I can barely read it,

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.206 position:50% align:center
why are you always like this?

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:37.874 position:50% align:center
What do you mean,
"like this"?

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50% align:center
And it's not just your writing.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.711 position:50% align:center
You buy tiny accessories,
and clothes that are so small

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.963 position:50% align:center
for you that you end up
having to return them.

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:45.215 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Why do you like
small things so much?

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
Maybe the only reason you
became friends with me

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:51.680 position:50% align:center
is because I'm small.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.057 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
What?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.226 position:50% align:center
So... it's true then.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
[NINA] Of course not!
Don't say things like that!

00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.521 position:50% align:center
I love you, Roko!

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
--[ROKO groans]
--[NINA] No! It's not true!

You don't understand!

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.110 position:50% align:center
The real reason I like
small things is because

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.112 position:50% align:center
I'm insecure about the
bigger parts of me.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:09.823 position:50% align:center
But it's different with you,
I promise, I like you

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
for who you are and not just
because you're small, Roko!

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
R-- You really mean it?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.374 position:50% align:center
[NINA gasps]
We're childhood friends, right?

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:20.750 position:50% align:center
I would never lie to you.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
--Nina!
--Oh, Roko!

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
That's a half truth.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.923 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Yeah, probably.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:30.510 position:50% align:center
All right! I'm givin'
it my rocker spirit!

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
Bigger. I just have
to make it bigger.

--[HEMO sighs]
--[ROKO grunts]

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:37.058 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Roko, don't you
already have an autograph?

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
Why not use that one?

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
[INO] It was printed, but I
used to have your autographed

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.732 position:50% align:center
Broko poster as a kid!

00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
I just loved looking at it!

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
[ROKO groans]

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:49.070 position:50% align:center
So have you decided against
using that autograph?

00:08:49.154 --> 00:08:50.947 position:50% align:center
I am never using it again.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:53.575 position:50% align:center
But it's a really
adorable signature.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:55.660 position:50% align:center
You just wouldn't
understand, Ino.

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:58.455 position:50% align:center
You have no idea what it's like
to be stuck using the same dumb

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
autograph you made up when you
were only six years old!

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.046 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Ino.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50% align:center
Nina.

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.214 position:50% align:center
Roko.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.257 position:50% align:center
Hemo.

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
Hayu.

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.553 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Great! Having everyone
base their designs

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.513 position:50% align:center
on Ino's autograph
turned out really nicely!

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:16.806 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS giggle]

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
Now that's done, you girls
are prepared to sign

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.352 position:50% align:center
thousands of autographs.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:21.770 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Huh?

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
What are you talking about,
thousands of autographs?

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure I already
mentioned it to you earlier.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.569 position:50% align:center
We are going to have each of
you sign your new autographs

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
on every single
copy of the CD.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.574 position:50% align:center
You never said anything about
signing all those copies.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.035 position:50% align:center
What did you expect?
New idols like yourselves

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:38.870 position:50% align:center
have to give it your all
if you want to succeed.

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.080 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS groan]

00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:42.207 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't worry too
much about it, though.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
I know I said "thousands,"
but at your current popularity,

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center
you have a better chance
winning the lottery

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:48.296 position:50% align:center
than making money from this.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50% align:center
You can't be serious.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec, aren't idol's
CDs really popular these days?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
Would you say Fruit Tart
is "popular"?

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.472 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS groan]

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.183 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
I guess not.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:01.726 position:50% align:center
Let's not forget,

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
you girls also made your debut
independent of any major label.

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
So, we can't print that
many copies to begin with.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Huh? But why not?

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:11.528 position:50% align:center
Well, to explain it simply.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.364 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] A major music label
handles mass distribution 

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.658 position:50% align:center

of advertising!

What kind of weird
mental picture's that?

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
In stark contrast, a humble
independent label

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
has to do all the
work on their own.

Wow, aren't we dramatic?

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.848 position:50% align:center
What I'm trying to say is
there's a big difference

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.641 position:50% align:center
in financial power, here.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:43.643 position:50% align:center
Why are you telling
us all of this?

Listen, girls.

If your debut CD doesn't
sell enough copies...

and it will be the
end of Fruit Tart!

out of the Mouse House,

announcing it this week!

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center

This girl is so shameless.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.655 position:50% align:center
It's actually scaring me!

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:27.283 position:50% align:center
[TONE] So will Hemo be part of
the upcoming CD debut, then?

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.869 position:50% align:center
[INO giggles]
Of course she's gonna be.

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
That said, we still haven't
actually recorded her

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.832 position:50% align:center
for it yet, though.

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
But we're not worried, because
Hemocchi was the number one pick

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:38.044 position:50% align:center
in a Cat Productions audition!

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.088 position:50% align:center
So, she's gotta be
great at singing!

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center
[HEMO squeals]

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:42.590 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Ah!

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:44.134 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Please don't hate me, Ino!

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
I couldn't bear it

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:47.303 position:50% align:center
Hemo, what's wrong?

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:48.304 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Uh...?

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Maybe she's not that good.

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:54.686 position:50% align:center
What you don't know is that the
audition I placed first in,

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:57.564 position:50% align:center
was to find the girl with the
best black-haired pigtails

00:14:57.647 --> 00:14:58.565 position:50% align:center
in Japan.

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
That's an oddly
specific audition.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
[HEMO] I'm not quite sure
about all the details,

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
but Miss Riri was the one who
planned the entire thing.

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:08.074 position:50% align:center
Trust me, black-haired
girls with pigtails

00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:09.617 position:50% align:center
are super popular now.

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU]
Oh...

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
Oh! She did say the whole
idea was actually suggested

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:14.748 position:50% align:center
to her by someone else.

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
[HOHO chuckles]
C'mon do it, Riri.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.711 position:50% align:center
Now, why doesn't that
surprise me one bit?

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
[HEMO] The truth is, I'm not
too confident about my singing.

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU, TONE]
Hmmm.

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
I have an idea!

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:29.888 position:50% align:center
Why don't we all go somewhere to
practice our singing right now?

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:30.847 position:50% align:center
But where?

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.015 position:50% align:center
Karaoke!

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
Wait right now, right now?

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.643 position:50% align:center
I've actually never been before,

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
but I've always
wanted to try it out!

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.813 position:50% align:center
Awesome!

00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to hear everyone
sing their hearts out!

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.192 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
And when you say, "everyone,"

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.612 position:50% align:center
does that mean I
can join you, too?

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
Of course, you can come!

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
Uh! I have a question.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
So, are things like autographs
and selfies allowed,

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.079 position:50% align:center
and will we be able
to touch the guests?

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:56.373 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry but that's
a little bit...

00:15:56.456 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
Aw, I get it.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
How disappointing.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
[HAYU] Okay, these two
need to get a grip!

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:04.255 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps]

00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:09.594 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! So this is karaoke!

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:11.805 position:50% align:center
This must be what it feels
like to be a high-school girl

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.223 position:50% align:center
living in the big city!

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:16.226 position:50% align:center
Don't get too excited now,
Miss Sakura.

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.894 position:50% align:center
Oh, it just occurred to me.

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.188 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you be hiding your
faces, since you're idols?

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.731 position:50% align:center
Someone might recognize you!

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:24.693 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU groan]

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:25.944 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Guess not...

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:27.195 position:50% align:center
[INO giggles]

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:28.738 position:50% align:center
This room's gigantic!

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:30.699 position:50% align:center
And all of these
devices are high-tech!

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
The whole package was so cheap,

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.327 position:50% align:center
and it even included
one free drink!

00:16:34.411 --> 00:16:35.870 position:50% align:center
Talk about a really great deal.

00:16:35.954 --> 00:16:37.372 position:50% align:center
I've been watching your show,

00:16:37.455 --> 00:16:40.000 position:50% align:center
and the Mouse House always
seems to be so tight on money.

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.209 position:50% align:center
But just between us girls,

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.044 position:50% align:center
it can't really be
that bad, can it?

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU]
Uh...

00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:46.423 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
You can't believe everything
you see on television.

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
You know that!

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:51.594 position:50% align:center
And besides, we have a bunch
of generous neighbors

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:53.388 position:50% align:center
who like to gift us
with plenty of food!

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.682 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU laugh]

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:58.685 position:50% align:center
[TONE] I have a feeling I
wasn't supposed to ask that.

00:16:58.768 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Anyway, who wants to sing first?

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
[INO] Oh! It's gotta
be Hemo, of course!

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Wha...?

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:08.153 position:50% align:center
I couldn't do that. I already
told you, I'm not very good.

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
I think maybe... the first
person should be Miss Tone!

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
Wait! Why me?

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
I can't believe you would
put me on the spot like that

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center
in front of an idol group!

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:17.287 position:50% align:center
Well, it's just...

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.873 position:50% align:center
I have no clue how to navigate
one of these things!

00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:20.790 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Mm-hm.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
[TONE gasps]

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
So, uh I guess I'll
go first, then.

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.091 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
Cream Anmitsu's...

00:17:30.175 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
...The Refreshing
Blue is So Shiny!

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:35.513 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU, HEMO gasp, giggle]

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.642 position:50% align:center
â™ª Whenever you want to give
up Just say, No! No! No! â™ª

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
â™ª You're not quite yet grown,
or a kid, but it matters not! â™ª

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
â™ª You do you,
Blue it suits you, â™ª

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.859 position:50% align:center
â™ª It's all good,
whatever's best. â™ª

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:50.028 position:50% align:center
She's got a beautiful
singing voice!

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:53.239 position:50% align:center
â™ª Any direction you choose,
is the way to go! â™ª

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.658 position:50% align:center
And she even knows
the choreography!

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center
[TONE] â™ª spread
your wings and fly. â™ª

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center
â™ªIf I were here all alone,
I don't think I would've, â™ª

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.833 position:50% align:center
She's amazing,
just like a real idol!

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.794 position:50% align:center
Don't you guys agree? Huh?

00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:07.170 position:50% align:center
She's good, alright.

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
Better than any
of us, in fact.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:11.049 position:50% align:center
Her pitch, it's perfect.

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
And so are all of her moves.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Wow, that was awesome!

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
[TONE giggles] I'm actually
in the school choir,

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.769 position:50% align:center
so I'm pretty confident when
it comes to my singing.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:25.397 position:50% align:center
Hey, if you want, I'd be more
than happy to give you

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.648 position:50% align:center
a few little pointers!

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:28.817 position:50% align:center
Oh, thank you, Tone!

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center
I would really appreciate that.

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
I thought you were a dangerous
stalker targeting Ino,

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:36.032 position:50% align:center
but now I see you
are a good person!

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Oh, uh, thank you I guess?

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
T-Tonecchi!

00:18:42.414 --> 00:18:45.333 position:50% align:center
Would you mind teaching
me some singing tips?

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
You too, Hayu?

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I did way better
than I expected to.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:58.013 position:50% align:center
I did my best and thought
of you the whole time, Ino.

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
[whimpers]

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
[INO, TONE, HEMO
chuckle nervously]

00:19:05.437 --> 00:19:06.980 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
I'm gonna go home.

00:19:07.063 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
No wait! Hold on!
It's the stupid machine's fault!

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.818 position:50% align:center
It can't understand the
depth of your feelings.

00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:13.069 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Ino's right!

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.238 position:50% align:center
A machine couldn't possibly
appreciate your

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
amazing rock and roll spirit!

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:19.242 position:50% align:center
You should try it again,
Hayu, kay?

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.703 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Mmmm.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Mm-hm.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.040 position:50% align:center
[TONE]
That was fun!

00:19:25.123 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
It's been a while
since I sang so much!

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
See, Hayu, there's no need
to for you to worry so much.

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:32.380 position:50% align:center
It's almost impossible for
anyone to get a perfect 

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.216 position:50% align:center
score, even if they're a
professional singer.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
May be, but my best
score was only 45.

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:40.555 position:50% align:center
Sorry, don't feel bad.

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
It probably just means that
I didn't do a very good job

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.351 position:50% align:center
teaching you.

00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh.
You helped me, Tonecchi.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:48.438 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah! I just remembered that

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.232 position:50% align:center
Cream Anmitsu's having a
street concert on Sunday.

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
Really? Sounds like
that's gonna be fun!

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
[TONE] They'll be at the
stage next to the dome.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:58.323 position:50% align:center
It'll be a great opportunity to
watch some professional idols

00:19:58.406 --> 00:19:59.657 position:50% align:center
in action!

00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
But it's already sold out,

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
so it'll be impossible to
get tickets for everyone.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
That's not surprising,

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.332 position:50% align:center
since Cream Anmitsu is
a very popular group.

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:09.084 position:50% align:center
You're right about that.

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
The day the tickets were sold,

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:13.213 position:50% align:center
I stayed up all night to be
first in line to get this!

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.006 position:50% align:center
I powered through with
only my determination

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.800 position:50% align:center
and one cup of coffee!

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
[INO]
O-Oh, I see.

Hey, you know what?

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.555 position:50% align:center
I might be able to
get us all tickets

00:20:22.639 --> 00:20:24.265 position:50% align:center
for Cream Anmitsu's concert.

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:25.225 position:50% align:center
[INO, TONE]
What?

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
Really? But how?

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.813 position:50% align:center
Do you have a connection?
Like, at Cat Productions?

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.856 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
No, that's not really it.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.734 position:50% align:center
Actually, Chiko from Cream
Anmitsu is my classmate

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:36.611 position:50% align:center
and also a good
friend of mine.

00:20:36.695 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
[INO, TONE]
Chiko's your classmate?

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:40.949 position:50% align:center
That's right! So, I should
be able to get a few tickets

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:42.992 position:50% align:center
if I just ask Chiko directly.

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:44.994 position:50% align:center
And besides...

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:48.998 position:50% align:center
[CHIKO]
Oh, Roko, Roko, Roko!

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
Chiko and I share a lot
of the same interests,

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:53.503 position:50% align:center
and I think that's why
we get along so well.

Are you okay? Is it a cold?

00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:09.477 position:50% align:center
No, I just suddenly got
the chills for some reason.
