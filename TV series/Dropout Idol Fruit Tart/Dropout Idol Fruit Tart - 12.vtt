A concert at Higako?

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:16.141 position:50% align:center
You want to put on a show?
Around here? Are you sure?

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:17.600 position:50% align:center
[INO chuckles]

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.103 position:50% align:center
I've actually been thinking
about it for a while, now.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.354 position:50% align:center
The people in this neighborhood

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:23.648 position:50% align:center
have always been so kind
and supportive to us,

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:26.860 position:50% align:center
so I think we should repay
them by hosting an event!

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:27.861 position:50% align:center
Ino.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
Good idea!

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
Inocchi.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
That's Miss Ino.

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:35.910 position:50% align:center
It's a nice idea,

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
but do you think we
can really pull it off?

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
[INO] We can do whatever
we put our minds to!

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.375 position:50% align:center
But where could we even
do a performance?

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.169 position:50% align:center
Is there a decent
place in Higako?

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
Um, I'm not too sure.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.715 position:50% align:center
Me, neither. Any ideas, Hoho?

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
Not bad. My money-making
sense is tingling.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.761 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Hoho...

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.513 position:50% align:center
A festival-style event built
on Ino's local celebrity.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center
Perfect. We'll set up food
and merchandise stalls

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.059 position:50% align:center
that'll rake it in.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:00.685 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Uh...

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.937 position:50% align:center
Um. Hello?

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.982 position:50% align:center
It's amazing! We're gonna make
a fortune on this thing!

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.901 position:50% align:center
[ALL chuckle nervously]

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center

Thank you very much!

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:37.889 position:50% align:center
[gasps] A new song!

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:39.140 position:50% align:center
Don't we need to
have a new song

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:41.309 position:50% align:center
if we're asking these
people to come see us?

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:42.769 position:50% align:center
Well, that was sudden.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:45.855 position:50% align:center
Did you already pass out
every one of your flyers?

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.440 position:50% align:center
[INO chuckles]

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.235 position:50% align:center
Actually, some folks from the
neighborhood offered to help me.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:53.613 position:50% align:center
[NEIGHBORS] We're always there
to help our favorite girl, Ino!

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:55.907 position:50% align:center
Well then, since
you're so popular,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.409 position:50% align:center
if you just went around
and collected a yen

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.661 position:50% align:center
from every person in the
country, we'd be done.

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:01.246 position:50% align:center
Are you possessed by Hoho?

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.455 position:50% align:center
No matter how you slice it,

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.749 position:50% align:center
it comes down to the
fact we have no money!

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.752 position:50% align:center
How should we find the budget
for producing this "new song"?

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:10.880 position:50% align:center
But I think we should
have something special

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:12.340 position:50% align:center
to get people to come.

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:15.927 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, you are
right about that.

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:20.265 position:50% align:center
Guess there's no choice...
but to go with the last resort.

00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:21.516 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Uh-oh!

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.476 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry we don't
have any money.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.271 position:50% align:center
How is it that only the three
of us got volunteered?

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:30.066 position:50% align:center
Great news! We got a ton
of vendors for the show!

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.401 position:50% align:center
Tone!

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.111 position:50% align:center
Even though it's
kinda last minute,

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:37.198 position:50% align:center
almost every business in Higako
wants to set up a stall!

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:39.993 position:50% align:center
We were getting so stressed
about not having enough money!

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:43.413 position:50% align:center
This is the perfect time for us
to make some serious dough.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.875 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna sell my special
grilled <i>monjayaki</i> !

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.169 position:50% align:center
Isn't <i>okonomiyaki</i>
your specialty?

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
I caught some of what
you were saying before.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.049 position:50% align:center
So is it true? You wanna
record a new song?

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.468 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but there's
not enough time.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50% align:center
No way could we write and
record it before the show.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.349 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Don't be so quick to
give up, you hear me?

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:05.477 position:50% align:center
Ladies, I have formed
a fool-proof plan.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.312 position:50% align:center
It'll get us that
new song in time

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.439 position:50% align:center
and give our fan
base a boost, too!

you want--I'll still love it!

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50% align:center

Who's the king?

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:54.776 position:50% align:center
Yay! It's me!

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.654 position:50% align:center
What do you guys think I should
make little Roko do next?

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.865 position:50% align:center
Wh-Whoa. That's not how this
stupid game's supposed to work.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
Each one of us has to take turns
doing what the king wants;

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
it's not just me!

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
Well.... that's how
other people play.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
But in our version of the game,
things are a bit different.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
We've decided that you're the
only one who has to obey, Roko.

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! What are you
gonna make me do?

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50% align:center
You offered yourself
to us for one night,

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
so we'd let you use our song.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:23.096 position:50% align:center
That was the deal we made
and it's too late to back out.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.808 position:50% align:center
Not only that, I'm surprised
you're not happier

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:30.061 position:50% align:center
to get a chance to some spend
time with your loving sister.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.022 position:50% align:center
Think of the fun we're having.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
You put those handcuffs
away right now.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
It's kinda cute though.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.945 position:50% align:center
I had no idea that the Mouse
House meant so much to you.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.030 position:50% align:center
It's outta character.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center
No. You've gotten
everything wrong.

Everyone's been working so hard
and it's not like it isn't fun.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
Plus, I've been
through it before,

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.249 position:50% align:center

senior, you know?

Dreamy.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50% align:center

I was expecting.

I just love it when you
suddenly get all vulnerable.

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:58.757 position:50% align:center
I was trying to be honest!

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
Well then, since you've shown
us all how you truly feel,

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
I guess we can go ahead
and do things your way.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.389 position:50% align:center
We'll play the game fairly now

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center

at being king!

so be a good pup

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center

Tell us what happened!

us the song that we need?

to number one on the charts.

Eh, chill out already.

So what is the name
of this song anyway?

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:27.178 position:50% align:center
It's called "The Demise of Youth
and Little Girl's Wings."

[INO] This isn't the time
to get cold feet!

00:07:00.628 --> 00:07:03.548 position:50% align:center
It's just... I didn't expect
such a wholesome crowd!

Hey, it's gonna be okay.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
Idols are known for being
sweet and innocent.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.970 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but we're not.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:10.930 position:50% align:center
According to surveys,
being an idol

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.433 position:50% align:center
is most girls' number one
sought-after career.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Every idol was a role
model to me when I was young.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:17.645 position:50% align:center
For me, too!

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.147 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and me!

look up to us, we're fine!

ones who will save the world.

What? Stage?
What are you talking about?

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:39.918 position:50% align:center
The main reason that you're here

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.253 position:50% align:center
is so that we can sell all
this leftover merchandise.

00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
You should've told us!

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
Cream Anmitsu's performance
will give us a boost,

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.217 position:50% align:center
but the chances
of us getting into

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.344 position:50% align:center
the NIC finals are very slim.

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:51.638 position:50% align:center
So it's life or death!

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:53.932 position:50% align:center
This is the only way
for us to survive!

00:07:54.015 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
It's a giant pot.

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center

you're going to make

00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
the Mouse House's special curry

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:01.231 position:50% align:center
and sell it for 300
yen with merch.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:02.816 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
You mean the merch is free?

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:06.486 position:50% align:center
Then we will take the
profits and... beg for mercy.

Huh?

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.632 position:50% align:center
It's not normal curry when it's
prepared by a professional idol!

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.884 position:50% align:center
That makes it an exclusive
must-buy product!

Of course it's you!

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:45.984 position:50% align:center
We sold out.

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.152 position:50% align:center

this many people showed up.

was so last minute.

Well, I'm not surprised
in the least!

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.044 position:50% align:center
This was an amazing idea.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
You took the grass-roots support
of your neighborhood.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.298 position:50% align:center
And combined it with
the hard work you put in

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.758 position:50% align:center
to build Fruit Tart's fan-base.

[ROKO] You all make too

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.819 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] There is a perfectly
logical explanation

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
for why I wear buns!

[OTHERS]
Huh?

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:32.122 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] With the buns,
I can create more height,

00:14:32.205 --> 00:14:33.915 position:50% align:center
hence making me appear taller.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
So that's the real reason?

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:37.627 position:50% align:center
When my sister got
taller than me,

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.879 position:50% align:center
I had to make her
stop wearing buns.

I'm not the only one here

how tiny they are.

hair is easier to manage.

When it's longer,

00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:28.511 position:50% align:center

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:10.358 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't worry about it!

00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:13.236 position:50% align:center
The entire neighborhood's
here to help chip in.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
By the way, we're really
loving the event.

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:18.241 position:50% align:center
And we'll make sure
it ends on a high note.

00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:21.494 position:50% align:center
That's so nice.
Especially since it's our fault.

[SHOP OWNER 9C]
I don't think you girls realize

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
what Fruit Tart
means to all of us.

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
[SHOP OWNER 9C]
You put on this festival

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.251 position:50% align:center
and it brought
everybody together.

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center
[TONE'S MOM] Please never forget
that we love you, Fruit Tart!

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:33.006 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
And so, we can't wait for
this afternoon's concert.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE NEIGHBOR 12B]
Good luck!

00:19:37.886 --> 00:19:39.304 position:50% align:center
[MALE NEIGHBOR 12A]
We're rooting for you!

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
[FEMALE NEIGHBOR 12C] I can't
wait for your performance!

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
Oh, my, thank you!

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
Yes! We'll do our best!

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:56.154 position:50% align:center
[INO] Everyone, thank you
so much for being here!

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:58.865 position:50% align:center
This event couldn't have
happened without all of you!

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:02.494 position:50% align:center
And it really warms my heart
to see all your faces.

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
You made this group
of awkward girls

00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:08.166 position:50% align:center
feel a little like
heroines today!

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:09.334 position:50% align:center
And even if we don't make it

00:20:09.417 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
to the National Idol
Championship finals,

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:17.967 position:50% align:center
even if Fruit Tart breaks up,
we were dropouts to begin with!

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:20.053 position:50% align:center
So we'll continue to
challenge ourselves.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:22.889 position:50% align:center
And we'll keep on picking
ourselves up and starting over!

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
[INO]
I hope you enjoy our next song

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:28.853 position:50% align:center
It's one of Cream Anmitsu's.

00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:31.773 position:50% align:center
"The Demise of Youth
and Little Girl's Wings"

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.348 position:50% align:center
Amazing. They really
are just phenomenal!

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.183 position:50% align:center
I mean, this a
Cream Anmitsu song,

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.853 position:50% align:center
but Fruit Tart's really
made it their own!

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
Uh. Heh. You're quite right.

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
They've finally
established themselves

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
and found their own style.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
Even though each one
of them is a dummy.

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.741 position:50% align:center
But the one important question
that remains unanswered

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:25.285 position:50% align:center
is whether it
translates to profit!

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:26.870 position:50% align:center
I love her like this.

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:28.663 position:50% align:center
Can't you sit back
and enjoy the moment

00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:30.623 position:50% align:center
instead of thinking about money?

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:33.752 position:50% align:center
Well, that's my job.

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:36.004 position:50% align:center
But what Ino said
earlier is the truth.

00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
At the end of the day,
we're still a bunch of dropouts.

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:42.510 position:50% align:center
As long as we never
ever give up though,

00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:46.639 position:50% align:center
one day, we may actually make
all our dreams come true.

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying that I have
the highest hopes or anything,

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:51.686 position:50% align:center
but I'm looking at five
little drops of hope that,

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.273 position:50% align:center
when together, may just spill
out into something bigger.

00:21:57.484 --> 00:22:02.489 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:22:27.722 --> 00:22:29.933 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:32.352 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
We did it!

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:35.605 position:50% align:center
Cream Anmitsu's help must've
been what put us over the top!

00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:38.358 position:50% align:center
I can't believe Chiko did
the right thing in the end!

00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:42.487 position:50% align:center
Cream Anmitsu can really dance;
they're on a whole other level!

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.115 position:50% align:center
I had to work so hard
just to keep up with them.

00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:47.367 position:50% align:center
And they're all such
good singers, too!

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.785 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second.

00:22:48.868 --> 00:22:50.203 position:50% align:center
I think you need
to give yourselves

00:22:50.286 --> 00:22:51.871 position:50% align:center
a little more credit than that.

00:22:51.955 --> 00:22:54.207 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but I don't think
we're popular enough

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.292 position:50% align:center
to make it to the
finals ourselves.

00:22:56.376 --> 00:22:58.962 position:50% align:center
The whole neighborhood showed
up and it was a big event,

00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:01.131 position:50% align:center
but we all knew
it was a long shot.

00:23:01.214 --> 00:23:03.883 position:50% align:center
So what do you think
was the deciding factor?

00:23:03.967 --> 00:23:06.219 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Oh, yeah,
it was definitely this.

00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:08.555 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasps]

00:23:08.638 --> 00:23:10.473 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] None of you noticed
when your skirts flipped up

00:23:10.557 --> 00:23:12.058 position:50% align:center
at the same time
during the show?

00:23:12.142 --> 00:23:14.019 position:50% align:center
Um, no? Obviously?

00:23:14.102 --> 00:23:15.687 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] There was a huge
debate among the judges

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.814 position:50% align:center
as to whether you did it
on purpose or not.

00:23:17.897 --> 00:23:19.399 position:50% align:center
[ALL groan]

00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:22.736 position:50% align:center
It kinda went viral.

00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:24.362 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Viral?

00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:34.414 position:50% align:center
[INO] In any case, I'm glad we
bought fancy underwear for show.

00:23:34.497 --> 00:23:38.168 position:50% align:center
Although the future of the Mouse
House is still on the line,

00:23:38.251 --> 00:23:40.545 position:50% align:center
I will continue
to do my very best.

00:23:40.628 --> 00:23:44.341 position:50% align:center
And so will the rest of
the girls in Fruit Tart.

00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:46.509 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll continue
with us on the journey.

00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:48.386 position:50% align:center
See you next time!
