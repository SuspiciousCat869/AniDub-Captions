[CHIKO]
Huh?

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.782 position:50% align:center
Just wondering. What kind
of underwear do you wear

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
when you're up on stage?

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.160 position:50% align:center
[CHIKO]
Why?

00:08:55.243 --> 00:08:57.579 position:50% align:center
Well I'm... just curious is all.

buy some too since I'm here.

Hmph.

Huh? Uh...

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
I was wondering, cause I'd like
to match on stage with you!

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:32.155 position:50% align:center
Oh! Well for starters,

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.657 position:50% align:center
I always wear a pair of
my thick black tights.

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.035 position:50% align:center
That way my underwear
won't show.

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
It's the way I feel
most comfortable.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:43.750 position:50% align:center
Well then, do you
mind if I copy you?

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.919 position:50% align:center
That's completely fine by me!

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.755 position:50% align:center
But, Hemo, I've noticed that
you've already been wearing

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:50.173 position:50% align:center
black tights recently.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.384 position:50% align:center

while we're doing laundry,
I apologize in advance!

going to mix them up on purpose!

But they're a bit pricey.

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:57.991 position:50% align:center
You're paying for quality items

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.826 position:50% align:center
and cute things
don't come cheap.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.954 position:50% align:center
It might be just a little bit
out of our budget right now.

Why don't you just write it
off as a business expense?

As high school idols,

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center

part of your wardrobe.

I'll call Miss Hoho and ask.

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:58.249 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Ah... I feel much better now.

00:15:58.333 --> 00:15:59.709 position:50% align:center
[INO]
That was embarrassing.

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.836 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should try
to drink less water?

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.630 position:50% align:center
No. I just need to stay calm,

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.507 position:50% align:center
but I never know when
my nerves will strike!

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center
Or, should I learn how
to hold it in better?

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:10.887 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Wh-What am I thinking?

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.515 position:50% align:center
It's totally unhealthy
to hold it in!

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:14.891 position:50% align:center
Miss Ino?

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.435 position:50% align:center
Um, did you say, "hold it in"?

00:16:17.519 --> 00:16:21.106 position:50% align:center
[INO gasps] Oh, no! It's not--
It's not what you think!

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
I'm just brainstorming for
the next time this happens!

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Oh.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:29.781 position:50% align:center
You see, I can totally relate.
I always hold my feelings in.

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:32.200 position:50% align:center
Can we talk about
this someplace else?

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:36.079 position:50% align:center
So, have your nerves
always been directly

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.247 position:50% align:center
connected to your bladder?

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.707 position:50% align:center
It's embarrassing,

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.710 position:50% align:center
but it's been like this for
as long as I can remember.

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
During class presentations...

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
During sports events...

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
It happens like clockwork
anytime I perform

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
in front of people.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.677 position:50% align:center
[HEMO] Does this count
as having some strange

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.929 position:50% align:center
kind of super power?

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.764 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah. Come to think of it,

00:16:54.848 --> 00:16:57.434 position:50% align:center
this happened to you
at our concert, too!

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
Tell us the truth.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:00.145 position:50% align:center
Did you pee your pants
that day on stage--

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
I did not pee on stage!

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
I'm able to hold it in
most of the time, okay?

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Only... most of the time?

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:12.449 position:50% align:center
Ugh! This isn't the time or
place for this conversation.

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
We need to turn this
recording session around!

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
She does have a point.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.412 position:50% align:center
None of us were successful.

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:19.122 position:50% align:center
We all have to re-record.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:20.373 position:50% align:center
[HAYU sighs]

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:22.375 position:50% align:center
No more feeling
sorry for ourselves.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
We need to start brainstorming
ideas on how to improve.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:27.547 position:50% align:center
Now, speak up!
Which one of you has a plan?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.299 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Mmmm.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.343 position:50% align:center
Wait! How about
pitch correction?

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.720 position:50% align:center
They can fix our voices using
one of those programs!

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
Absolutely not!

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
[CHIKO giggles] It sounds like
you need some help, big sister.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.144 position:50% align:center
No! Don't tell me.

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:43.229 position:50% align:center
[CHIKO]
There's a trick to singing well.

00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:45.440 position:50% align:center
How would you all like a lesson?

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.360 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Cream Anmitsu?

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:49.652 position:50% align:center
[CHIKO giggles]

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:54.449 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so anyway, we need
to figure out some ideas.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:57.619 position:50% align:center
[CHIKO] Um, hello? Your super
famous sister is here?

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.204 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:02.207 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling Cream Anmitsu
would be here when I saw Riri.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.292 position:50% align:center
The only reason we get
to record here today

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center
is cause you
already were, right?

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:09.214 position:50% align:center
[RIRI giggles]
She figured us out!

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:11.341 position:50% align:center
You do the same
thing every time!

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:14.219 position:50% align:center
How much longer until you try
something new for a change?

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
Big sister! You don't
have to be so mean!

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
Now, now. There's nothing
wrong with accepting help

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
from time to time.

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
As idols, you should be
kind to one another.

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
And lest we forget.

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
Sisters like you two
are incredibly special.

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
Hoho...

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.697 position:50% align:center
Could you stop staring
at us like that please?

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.823 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
Uh...

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
A-Anyway, just hear me out.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.661 position:50% align:center
The younger sister
is a popular idol!

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
The older sister is
an unpopular idol!

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.207 position:50% align:center
Now, they're forced to compete.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.419 position:50% align:center
And only one can become
the world's biggest star!

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
It's a rivalry for the ages!

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:51.798 position:50% align:center
You can't blame me
for taking advantage

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
of your unique situation!

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
As a producer, I have to
jump on this opportunity!

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
[RIRI]
Wow! Hoho, you're so amazing!

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:04.144 position:50% align:center
She really is passionate. Is
your producer always like this?

00:19:04.227 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
Well first off,
she's our manager,

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:09.899 position:50% align:center
so I don't know where all this
producer talk is coming from.

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:11.526 position:50% align:center
Anyway, since you offered,

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
what was that singing trick
you wanted to tell me about?

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
What? Oh!

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:18.199 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe the trick to signing
well is to think about

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
something that
you love, you know?

00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:22.454 position:50% align:center
Nua, Rua, anything to add?

00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
[NUA, RUA]
Uh!

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.999 position:50% align:center
No way. Don't look
to me for advice.

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:29.502 position:50% align:center
The reason I'm so good...
is that I was born talented!

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
Well, let me see.

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
Here you go.

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Ah. Great.

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
Thanks for this completely
unhelpful gesture.

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.387 position:50% align:center
You know, maybe it
is a good idea

00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:40.722 position:50% align:center
to think about
something we love!

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:43.224 position:50% align:center
Yeah! It could be just
the thing we need!

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Something we love...

00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:48.897 position:50% align:center
I'm having a
little trouble, Nina.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.774 position:50% align:center
Can I borrow you for a second?

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:52.859 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU]
Huh?

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
I'm just finding
it hard to decide.

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.864 position:50% align:center
How are you sure if you
really love something?

00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
Isn't that a big
question to ask?

00:19:59.949 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
It is pretty vague.

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:02.744 position:50% align:center
So, what do you guys think?

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:03.995 position:50% align:center
[INO, HAYU]
What?

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
[INO] I can't tell if
she's serious or not,

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:08.291 position:50% align:center
but it looks like she knows
exactly what she loves!

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
All right, break is over!

00:20:11.795 --> 00:20:13.213 position:50% align:center
Time to get back in the booth!

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
You girls better get it
right in one shot, okay?

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
[IDOLS]
Got it!

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:19.678 position:50% align:center
[INO]
It's gonna be okay.

00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:22.806 position:50% align:center
I just need to relax and
think of something I love.

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:26.059 position:50% align:center
What I love... What I love...

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:27.602 position:50% align:center
What brings me happiness is--

[SOUND GUY A]
Here we go!

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:33.066 position:50% align:center
[INO giggles] I know exactly
what to think about!

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] I have to think
of something I love.

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.779 position:50% align:center
[SOUND GUY A]
And we are rolling.

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:41.908 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] What I love is really
soft and super fluffy!

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
I'll think of Nina's big, warm--

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:48.373 position:50% align:center
[NINA sniffs]
I love this smell!

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:50.333 position:50% align:center
I can't get enough of it!

00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:54.295 position:50% align:center
[NINA] Ah! It's almost
too much for me!

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
[HAYU chuckles]
I'm envisioning a packed venue!

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.759 position:50% align:center

where the dark energy

00:20:59.843 --> 00:21:01.845 position:50% align:center
concealed within me
will be released!

most is Miss Ino's tights!

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:12.522 position:50% align:center
[HEMO giggles] We'll have to
share once they get mixed up

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:13.982 position:50% align:center

--[IDOLS] Great work!

Hemo! How did it go?

00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:23.700 position:50% align:center
Were you able to sing
your heart out?

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
Yes! It's all thanks to you!

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:29.122 position:50% align:center
Then that means all of
our sessions went well!

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.374 position:50% align:center
We all went in and
gave it our best.
