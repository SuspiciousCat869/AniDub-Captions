Um, what are you doing?

What are those
strange outfits for?

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
[HAYU] I've been waiting for
this day for a very long time.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:30.947 position:50% align:center
[INO, HEMO]
Huh?

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.200 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
It's finally going to happen.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
All right ladies!

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.372 position:50% align:center
It's time to take back the Mouse
House's pride once and for all!

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
Tonight, we feast on curry!

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:47.964 position:50% align:center
[NINA, HAYU]
Yay!

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.175 position:50% align:center

"Super Awesome Curry!"

[HEMO]
Hey guys, I've got a question.

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:46.541 position:50% align:center
What does the Mouse House's
pride have to do with curry?

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, that's right. You
haven't been told about it yet.

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
The curry that's made
in the Mouse House

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.798 position:50% align:center
is the stuff of legends!
Our pride and joy!

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
Oh wow!

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.595 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but Hoho was the one who
polished the rest of it off.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
[HEMO]
Huh?

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.139 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NINA scream]

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:04.642 position:50% align:center
Oopsie! Guess I was
really hungry!

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.896 position:50% align:center
We managed to stretch that
batch for two whole years.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
Well, that doesn't
seem very healthy.

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:11.733 position:50% align:center
So now you know!

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:13.777 position:50% align:center
That's why all of us have to
work together to recreate

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.653 position:50% align:center
the pride of the Mouse House!

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
Today we resurrect
the God Curry!

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
[INO, HEMO]
God curry?

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
That's right! We'll all add
in our favorite ingredients

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:26.664 position:50% align:center
to create a new masterpiece!

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
I'm from Toyama, it's in
the center of Japan!

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
It's most famous for the
hot springs and ski resorts

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.547 position:50% align:center
in the Hida Mountains!

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center
I'm from Ishikawa.

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.677 position:50% align:center
Home of Kanazawa Castle
and gardens!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
It's beautiful no matter
what time of year you visit.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
I'm from Kanagawa!

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.686 position:50% align:center
We've got Yokohoma Chinatown
and Kawasaki Daishi shrine!

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.146 position:50% align:center
And Higako is just a
stone's throw away.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
[INO, HEMO]
Oh!

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.316 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] We had our favorite
local specialties

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
shipped to us from
each of our hometowns.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
--[ROKO] Not only that...
--[INO, HEMO] Huh?

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
...we've got this huge
watermelon and blowfish roe!

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
A recipe for success!

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:06.162 position:50% align:center
You're... You're gonna put
all that into curry?

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.997 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Yup! There's no
way it can taste bad

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.916 position:50% align:center
with all these ingredients.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.461 position:50% align:center
Anyway, Ino, aren't
you from Okayama?

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
Do you have any peaches?

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I wouldn't wanna
put them in curry.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
How about... we put
the melon down now?

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.972 position:50% align:center
[INO] My parents are always
sending me veggies from home.

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:27.475 position:50% align:center
As for local specialties,
you just have to try these.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.060 position:50% align:center
It's called kibi dango!

00:04:29.144 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
[gasps]
Kibi...

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.773 position:50% align:center
Dan...go?

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:36.526 position:50% align:center
These look interesting.
I've never seen them before.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.779 position:50% align:center
They're dumplings! Did you know
they're full of healthy grains?

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.781 position:50% align:center
No one would ever guess that.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
Who knew?

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.326 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
I've always wanted to try this,

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.496 position:50% align:center
but I've never had
kibi dango before.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.373 position:50% align:center
So, what does it taste like?

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:53.001 position:50% align:center
Oh! Would you like to
try some for yourself?

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:55.628 position:50% align:center
But first you'll have to say,
"Pretty, pretty please"!

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.130 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:04:57.213 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
[INO] Go on and give em' a shot!
The millet tastes so good!

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Mm...

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:05.680 position:50% align:center
Okay then, down the hatch.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50% align:center
[HOHO chuckles]

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] Why the heck are
you filming, Hoho?

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
[HOHO chuckles] I think
that's perfectly obvious.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
I'm documenting how
adorable you look

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:17.108 position:50% align:center
when you're trying
something brand new.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:18.902 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Huh? "Documenting"?

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
[HOHO]
That's right!

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:23.365 position:50% align:center
People love watching cute
girls eat, it's a proven fact!

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
Whether you try gourmet
meals or fast food,

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
local dishes or street fare,

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:30.121 position:50% align:center
the possibilities for
content are endless!

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.248 position:50% align:center
In fact, there's a saying
in our business:

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.541 position:50% align:center
"Those who dominate food shows,

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.669 position:50% align:center
dominate the idol
industry itself!"

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
Are... you sure about that?

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Now that you
know what's at stake,

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
why don't you practice
with that dango?

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
[INO, ROKO]
What?

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
Make it sexy.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.097 position:50% align:center
Absolutely not!

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
Now, listen to me.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.476 position:50% align:center
Why else do you think
the camera zooms in

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
on the mouth during
eating scenes?

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.230 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
What are you talking about?

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.399 position:50% align:center
--Check it.

Aah!

[INO, ROKO, NINA gasp]

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:10.495 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] Now that that's settled,
everybody gear up for practice!

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
[INO, ROKO, NINA]
What?

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] It's time to learn
a new idol skill!

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.463 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Make it sexy.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
Make it sexy?

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:29.597 position:50% align:center
[INO]
Make it sexy!

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:30.849 position:50% align:center
Can I do this?

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:32.434 position:50% align:center
[INO giggles]

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
No way! Absolutely not!

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.731 position:50% align:center
Well I guess I'll throw
it all away, then.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.357 position:50% align:center
[ROKO gasps]

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.151 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
No, don't do that.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:50.452 position:50% align:center
How in the heck am I supposed
to make it look sexy, anyway?

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center
Can't we just eat normally
like regular people?

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.789 position:50% align:center
Oh my.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.542 position:50% align:center
This is why you'll always
be known as a dropout, Roko.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Excuse you?!

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center
Nina. Why don't you show
this amateur how it's done?

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.340 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Huh?

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.508 position:50% align:center
[HOHO] I know you've been
eating this whole time.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.344 position:50% align:center
[NINA whimpers]

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50% align:center
No... I can't.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:15.643 position:50% align:center
I don't like when people watch.

00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
Oh, now I get it.

Hm. You were all pretty good.

something missing.

[HEMO, HAYU]
Huh?

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center

"open wide and say, 'aah'".

[HOHO]
Use this for cooking.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:53.867 position:50% align:center
Couldn't you at least
give us the good stuff?

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.244 position:50% align:center
Hey! It'll work just
fine for this purpose!

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
And it's a lot more expensive
than regular cooking sakÃ©!

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] You shouldn't be
giving alcohol to minors

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.584 position:50% align:center
in the first place.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
Gah!

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.838 position:50% align:center
Anyway, Hemo, have you
got anything good?

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
Hey, where are you from anyway?

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.718 position:50% align:center
Oh! Well, I came all
the way from Chiba.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.678 position:50% align:center
Really? That theme
park is there!

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:14.721 position:50% align:center
You know the home of Mickey--

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, HEMO gasp]

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
What about you Hayu?

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.312 position:50% align:center
[HAYU]
Uh! Hm...

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:25.732 position:50% align:center
I don't think I've got any local
specialties from Kanagawa handy.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
My mom only ever sends
me canned foods

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:30.362 position:50% align:center
and things that just need to be
heated up in the microwave.

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:32.947 position:50% align:center
Oh, well that sounds
pretty convenient.

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:37.327 position:50% align:center
Mackerel, sardines,
grilled chicken, tuna!

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
Curry, stew, instant ramen.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.124 position:50% align:center
[ROKO] So, what's your favorite
thing that she sends you?

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:46.294 position:50% align:center
[HAYU] Hm, well let's see.
It's a tough choice.

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:49.923 position:50% align:center
But I think it's the red
king crab and sea urchin!

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
Red king crab?

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50% align:center
Urchin?

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
You weren't kidding!

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
Those must be so expensive!

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.682 position:50% align:center
[INO] This is my first time
seeing them in person!

00:09:58.765 --> 00:10:01.059 position:50% align:center
[NINA] They're so beautiful,
I can't believe it!

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.520 position:50% align:center
What? I just told you
that these are cheap.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
They are canned, after all.

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
What? Who in the
world told you that?

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center
They must have been an idiot!

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.445 position:50% align:center
[HOHO gasps nervously]

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:14.197 position:50% align:center
--[HOHO] Uh...
--It was you, Hoho.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.242 position:50% align:center
You told me to give them to you
since they were so cheap.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:20.620 position:50% align:center
[HOHO yelps]

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
All right, girls, let's go!

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:27.711 position:50% align:center
[INO, NINA, HAYU]
Yeah!

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:29.587 position:50% align:center

This is the Luxury
Seafood Curry Plus!

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:07.042 position:50% align:center
[whimpers] You used my
precious red king crab.

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
Shame on you, Hoho!

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.879 position:50% align:center
We should make you pay
Hayu back for all the cans

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50% align:center
you took in the past.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
[HOHO grunting]

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:16.468 position:50% align:center
It's kinda surprising.
What do you think?

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center
Does Hayu comes from a wealthy
family or something like that?

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:23.141 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not a hundred
percent sure, but...

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
...when she arrived
here for the first time,

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.774 position:50% align:center
she was dropped off in a fancy
car with a hood ornament!

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.901 position:50% align:center
A hood ornament?

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
Is that how you guys determine
if someone is rich?

the next hour with these
three lovely young ladies.

First up, they'll be
going to swimming class!

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
But not one of
them likes to swim.

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center
In fact, they're all
terrible it!

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:37.317 position:50% align:center
Just let me use this
floaty and I'll be fine.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.736 position:50% align:center
Their challenge today is
to swim the 50 meter,

dog paddling only!

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:42.822 position:50% align:center

[TV NARRATOR] Will our three
favorite idols be able

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.493 position:50% align:center
to complete the challenge?

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:49.954 position:50% align:center
Oh, forget that, did you know
that Chiko is a D-cup?

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
Hey! What does that have
to do with anything?

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.126 position:50% align:center
And Nua's bra size
is A cup, of course.

Did you see Cream Anmitsu's
new show last night?

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.071 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:24.239 position:50% align:center
You think we should
be pushing our group

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:26.491 position:50% align:center
to do more stuff like that, too?

00:14:26.574 --> 00:14:27.701 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:29.828 position:50% align:center
I mean, like, reveal
more about ourselves.

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:37.377 position:50% align:center
from all that dog paddling

I will neither confirm nor deny!

Has anybody ever told you
that you're really rude?

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.311 position:50% align:center
I didn't know that we
went to the same school.

You a first-year?

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center

Nope, I'm a second-year!

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
What? Tell me you're joking!

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
You calling me a liar?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.783 position:50% align:center
[NINA] Why do I feel like I'm
somehow older than these two?

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:10.577 position:50% align:center
I wonder why that is.

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Whatever, when it
comes to our industry,

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
I'm your senior!

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.545 position:50% align:center
Heh! That may be true, but I'm
more popular than you!

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:25.300 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NUA growl]

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NUA]
Which one of the two of us

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.970 position:50% align:center
do you think has seniority?

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:31.222 position:50% align:center
What? Well I think uh--

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:34.267 position:50% align:center
[RUA giggles] You're obviously
both masochists!

00:15:34.351 --> 00:15:36.227 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wh-Where'd that come from?

00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:38.563 position:50% align:center
Quiet, Rua!

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
Nua is a brat, but she's
pretty cowardly, too.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:43.693 position:50% align:center
She's afraid to even leave
the house by herself.

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:45.153 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:45.236 --> 00:15:47.280 position:50% align:center
[RUA] Miss Roko, you might
seem mature at first glance,

00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:49.908 position:50% align:center
but in reality,
you're still a baby.

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:53.953 position:50% align:center
Hm. I can't say that either
of you have the seniority.

00:15:54.037 --> 00:15:56.039 position:50% align:center
It's tricky.

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:58.958 position:50% align:center
I would, however, love to keep
you both in a cage as my pets!

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:00.043 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Roko.

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.461 position:50% align:center
[NUA]
Nua.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:03.713 position:50% align:center
I don't know how
we got here! Ah!

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:06.424 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
But, it kinda makes sense.

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center
[RUA] In any case, I think
you're both more similar

00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:09.928 position:50% align:center
than you'd like to admit.

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.930 position:50% align:center
That's not true! Take it back!

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:14.432 position:50% align:center
I am in no way
similar to this child!

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:15.767 position:50% align:center
What? Child?

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
[NUA] I'm at least two
inches taller than her!

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.689 position:50% align:center
Even more so if you
round that up!

00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:23.024 position:50% align:center
Oh? But I remember
when we were little,

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:26.444 position:50% align:center
you would dress up and imitate
Miss Roko all of the time.

What?

00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
[RUA] So, aren't you
happy about all this?

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not!

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
[RUA] But you always wanted
her autograph, remember?

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.913 position:50% align:center
I really wish I brought
that Broko CD

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
that you still treasure
so much with us!

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:44.713 position:50% align:center

You're embarrassing me!

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:47.173 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Umm. It's okay, don't cry.

00:16:47.257 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
You can have my autograph
anytime, I don't mind at all!

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.636 position:50% align:center
[NUA]
Stop looking at me that!

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.888 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you still believe
that I'm a fan of yours

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.099 position:50% align:center
after all this time,
cause I'm not!

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:58.101 position:50% align:center
I grew out of it long ago!

00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
I haven't liked
your stuff in years.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:01.104 position:50% align:center
Not since I was a little kid!

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:04.065 position:50% align:center
Look! Isn't this video of
Nua just the cutest?

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:15.910 position:50% align:center

This video is private property!

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% align:center
Nua really is an
A-cup, by the way.

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
[NUA]
Cut it out!

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
Anyway, the point is,

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.420 position:50% align:center
we're a lot more popular
than you'll ever be!

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:27.255 position:50% align:center
And I am not a fan
of you at all!

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.632 position:50% align:center
Listen up. You've been
going on and on

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
about how popular you are but...

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.178 position:50% align:center
[NUA]
But what?!

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.930 position:50% align:center
We had no idea that we even went
to the same school together.

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
[NINA chuckles nervously]

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
So maybe you're not
"all that" after all.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
[NUA yelps] Let's--Let's not
jump to wild conclusions!

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:47.150 position:50% align:center
You couldn't have known,
because I wear these glasses

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.444 position:50% align:center
to hide my everyday identity!

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
Then why weren't you
wearing them before?

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:53.448 position:50% align:center
[NUA gasps]

00:17:53.531 --> 00:17:55.825 position:50% align:center
But... do glasses
work that well?

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
[NUA]
Hm-hm!

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:59.621 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
It's not a very good disguise.

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
[NUA giggles]

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
You're not fooling anyone here.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:07.337 position:50% align:center
[RUA gasps] Listen, I know it's
not a very good disguise, but...

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
...she just looks so cute!

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:11.633 position:50% align:center
[NINA] If they're masochists,
she's a sadist!

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
[RUA]
Oh no, please!

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:15.637 position:50% align:center
I'm not deserving of such
a compliment, but thank you!

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.055 position:50% align:center
That's a compliment?

00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
Oh, now I'm so embarrassed!

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.101 position:50% align:center
[NINA] Don't listen in
on my private thoughts!

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:24.604 position:50% align:center
Do you always put up with your
sister's incessant teasing?

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center
Guess you are a masochist.

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
What?! How could you say that?

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.112 position:50% align:center
It isn't true.

00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NINA]
What's with that tone shift?

00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
[NUA]
Oh, no! Look what time it is!

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:37.659 position:50% align:center
We're gonna be late for work!

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:38.785 position:50% align:center
Changed subjects.

00:18:38.868 --> 00:18:40.537 position:50% align:center
Yes. Yes, she did.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
[NUA] Unlike Fruit Tart, Cream
Anmitsu has actual work to do!

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:48.128 position:50% align:center
We don't have time to waste
on petty small talk like this.

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:49.629 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NINA gasp]

00:18:49.713 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
When we meet again as idol
groups, we are gonna be rivals!

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:53.341 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NINA]
Eh...

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:55.260 position:50% align:center
[NUA]
Catch ya later!

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
[NUA]
Oh! And--

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:58.596 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NINA]
Huh?

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
I'll make sure to bring
the CD with me.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.518 position:50% align:center
So I guess you could
sign it if you want.

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50% align:center
[ROKO, NINA gasp]

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
[NUA]
You should be grateful!

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.732 position:50% align:center
You know what?
Just forget about it!

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:09.983 position:50% align:center
Okay, see you later!

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.610 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Sure, sure.

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:15.488 position:50% align:center
Well, they were freakin' weird.

00:19:15.572 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
But, despite that, they weren't
nearly as bad as I had thought.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:19.617 position:50% align:center
[NINA gasps]

00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
Still weird, though.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
And they're perverts.

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:26.541 position:50% align:center
By the way, wasn't it
strange when Nua said

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
that we were now rivals?

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
We're pretty new, so hearing
that was surprising!

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
Right, Nina?

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
[NINA grunts]
Roko, come here.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:39.137 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
Why are you getting undressed?

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.097 position:50% align:center
[NINA]
I said... come here!

00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:43.183 position:50% align:center
[ROKO]
I guess you're a pervert too.

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:59.115 position:50% align:center
What? You saw my
big sister at school?

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
Even I haven't seen
her at school, yet!

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:03.161 position:50% align:center
That's so unfair!

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
Yeah, good looks must
run in the family!

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:06.915 position:50% align:center
She was very cute!

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:09.292 position:50% align:center
[CHIKO]
Hang on, Rua!

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.544 position:50% align:center
You didn't tease her, did you?

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:13.004 position:50% align:center
I'm warning you.

00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
The only one allowed give my
big sis a hard time is me.

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center

Ooh, a sister complex!

Ha!

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
You don't have to worry,

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:23.723 position:50% align:center
I was only teasing
Nua like I usually do!

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.183 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:26.893 position:50% align:center
[CHIKO]
Oh good. That's fine, then.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:28.311 position:50% align:center
Now just wait a minute!

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
That's fine with you?

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
Let it go, it's okay!

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
[NUA grunts]
Darn it.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.694 position:50% align:center
I won't let her
get away with this.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
[NUA] I'm gonna have
to take my revenge!

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
I'll snap a picture
of her in her undies.

[NUA]
Oh, no! That was my chance!

00:20:52.544 --> 00:20:55.797 position:50% align:center
Can I fix it? Why?
No, no, no, no!

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.427 position:50% align:center
[CHIKO] Hmm. Well, I can see
why she'd want to tease her.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.847 position:50% align:center

I don't think Nua and Rua
really understand that.
