00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,953
[KANATA] Someone intentionally
broke the communicator?

00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:03,790
Exactly. Whoever's
responsible is on this ship.

3
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,921
Kanata?

4
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,632
Whoa! Too close!

5
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,133
Is everything okay?

6
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,843
You look kind of worried.

7
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,762
If there's anything you
ever wanna talk about,

8
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,014
just you and me, I'm here!

9
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,308
We are friends, after all!

10
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,979
Yeah.

[KANATA]
Aries Spring.

12
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,108
She was never out of
my sight during the time

13
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,987
that the communicator
must have been destroyed.

14
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:39,076
No, wait, she did leave
to go get changed.

[ARIES, KANATA gasp]

16
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:44,122
Hey, there, you two.
Fancy a tasting?

17
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,958
Herb‐grilled Tur‐Gon breast
and suspicious scones

18
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,168
with dried eccentric fruits.

19
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,837
[KANATA] Looks delicious and
sounds like it could kill us!

20
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,048
I'd love to try some.

21
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,637
Huh?

22
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,556
[CHARCE]
The color of your eyes.

23
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,893
Yes. They've been different
ever since I was born.

24
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,436
Kinda weird, isn't it?

25
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,690
Heh. I'm sorry for staring.

26
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,942
They just remind me
of someone I know.

[KANATA]
Charce Lacroix.

00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,988
Extremely smart and
well‐versed in biology.

29
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,907
Good looking, a great cook.

30

Wow, I kinda hate how perfect
I just made him sound.

I finished with
ship maintenance.

Uh. Great.

[KANATA] Zack Walker.
Brilliant scientist.

34
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,627
I don't think he's a
suspect since he's the one

35
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,713
who found the
broken communicator.

36
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,216
Unless that was to throw me off.

37
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,843
I need more time

38
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,387

[FUNICIA]
Isn't it cute?

42
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,479
[KANATA]
Wow! He made a little hair pin

43
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,356
out of that star flower!

44
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,360
[LUCA] Heh. I found some resin,
so it was no problem.

[KANATA] Funicia Raffaelli.
Quitterie's sister.

46

She's only ten, so she's
out of the question.

[KANATA]
Luca Esposito.

48
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,122
He definitely has the
dexterity to pull off

49
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,417
a trick like that, but...

50
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,836
[QUITTERIE]
Hm. You don't have a fever.

51
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,839
I tried to check for unknown
pathogens, but you're fine.

52
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,717
Must be fatigue. You should
try to get some rest.

53
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,888
I'm so sorry.

54
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,640
Also, would you stop
apologizing for everything?

55
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,809
I just so happen to know
a lot about medicine,

56
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,603
so it's no big.

[YUN‐HUA sighs]

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,690
Take care of yourself.

Quitterie Raffaelli.

62
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,405
Daughter of a famous doctor.

63
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,449
She's the one who's
complained the most,

64
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,285
so it seems unlikely
she's behind this.

65
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,708
[KANATA] Yun‐hua Lu.
Shy, and never really talks.

66
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,585
She seems harmless,
but she's also

67
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,629
the one I know least about.

68
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,342
Ugh! So dumb!

69
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,469
Everyone seems suspicious.

70
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:06,389
But at the same time, like,
they couldn't have done it.

71
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:15,357
Ulgar. This place is...
what, storage?

72
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,108
Why were you in there?

73
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,988
[KANATA]
Did you find anything good?

74
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,160
If I did find anything in there,
I'd use it to keep myself alive.

75
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,079
I don't report to you.

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,955
[KANATA]
Listen.

77
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,207
Personally, I don't mind
if you don't wanna

78
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,209
open up to the others.

79
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,628
But... if there's
anything you wanna say,

80
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,299
you can say it to me.
We're all friends here.

81
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,593
[ULGAR]
Way too close.

82
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,803
Friends, huh?

83
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,889
Nice try, but I don't really
do the whole "friend" thing.

84
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,850
Stay away from me.

85
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,149
[KANATA]
I don't know who destroyed it.

86
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,236
And I can't imagine
why they did.

87
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,988
Are we totally sure
it was one of us

88
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,575
that tampered with it? No.

89
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,036
Worrying about it
won't do any good.

90
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,706
We just need to get home.

91
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,376
[KANATA]
Safely.

92
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,680
Out of FTL and in normal drive.

93
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,850
Everyone, get ready. We'll be
landing on Shummoor soon.

Stop joking around! We're there!

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,399
[LUCA]
Okay, Mom. We hear you.

98
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,276
I'm not your mom!

99
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,862
Aries, did you say you
just transferred in June?

100
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:44,779
Like, this year?

101
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,364
That's right!

102
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,326
I got picked to be an honor
student in my second year,

103
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,286
so they allowed me to
transfer to Caird High,

104
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,413
‐‐and, here I am.
‐‐[QUITTERIE] That's crazy!

105
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:57,125
Funi came to our family
in June, too, right?

106
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,587
[giggles] It was after my mother
passed away in an accident.

107
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,756
I spent some time
in an organage.

108
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,008
Pretty sure you
mean "orphanage."

109
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,469
[BEEGO] After a few days,
some folks showed up

110
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,347
and said they found a
brand new family for us.

111
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,767
You must have been surprised
that it happened so fast. Right?

112
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,394
[BEEGO]
Nah, we kinda knew about it.

113
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,940
[FUNICIA] The night I
arrived at the place,

114
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,693
I got up to go to the bathroom
and heard some people talking.

115
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,738
[FUNICIA]
The headmaster was sitting

116
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,783
with a man wearing sunglasses.

117
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,410
They mentioned something
about me getting adopted.

118
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,579
So I kinda knew it was coming.

119
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,582
Really? On the same night
that you arrived there?

120
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,043
Maybe it was all
set up in advance?

121
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,252
[BEEGO]
The guy in the sunglasses

122
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,547
seemed to know me, too.
He even talked about my show!

123
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,174
Wait, let me get this straight.

124
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,551
This dude actually
mentioned your puppet?

125
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,805
Yeah! I didn't really
understand him.

126
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,849
But I definitely heard
him say Animaroid B‐5.

127
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,851
That's the show that
Beego is on, you know?

128
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,687
So I knew they knew about him!

129
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,147
I think he said...

130
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,943
"Put her in B‐5 and then
we can illuminate them all."

That story makes no sense.

You're sure that's what the

then kill us in space.

Uh‐huh.

...the nine of us weren't
randomly selected to be here.

146

We were deliberately chosen.

Aries transferring.
That was all someone's plan.

in the sunglasses
that she saw that night?

He seems likely.

00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,839
Maybe someone in our
school administration?

155
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,883
Someone with the power
to transfer students

[QUITTERIE] Tell us!
Is your dad a part of this?

163
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,482
How would I know?

164
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,777
That said, he's ashamed
of his failure of a son.

165
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,821
At school, he even hides
the fact that we're related.

166
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,948
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was involved

167
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,700
or wanted me dead.

168
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,368
I don't think it's
a great idea for us

169
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,245
to start jumping to conclusions.

170
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,040
There's just too much that
we don't know at the moment.

There's more to this.

175

[LUCA] Hold on, one of you guys
destroyed the communicator?

But, wh‐why would someone...?

[ZACK] It's the only

I don't wanna

[ARIES]
Why would anyone do that?

180
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,526
Think about it.
If there really was

181
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,112
a plan to kill all
of us, it makes sense.

182
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,489
One of us tried
to make that happen.

183
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,032
And our deaths were
designed to look

184

like a camping accident.

No! Who? Who did this?

I can't sit around
with a serial killer.

want to murder me?

Can you prove that?

[KANATA] No. None of us can
prove that we're innocent.

00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,448
Not under these circumstances.

[LUCA] Oh. That was
your stomach growling?

201
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,002
I'm kind of impressed.

I'm sorry. But it's almost 3PM.

203

[QUITTERIE] So it's like
an alarm for snack time?

204
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,303
[ARIES] Kanata said hunger
is the worst enemy,

205
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,889
and I think he's right.

206
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,141
Why don't we delay
the landing for a bit?

207
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,394
We'll all feel better if we

‐‐[FUNICIA] I am hungry!

[KANATA] I can't thank
her enough, as always.

216
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,293
Oh, wow, Charce,
these are great!

217
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,420
Like a cereal bar
with dried fruit.

218
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,296
Thanks.

219
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,466
I thought they'd make for
an easy portable snack.

220
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,553
[QUITTERIE]
Aries, back there, I...

221
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,555
What's up?

Gross. Chew or talk
but don't do both!

225
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,649
[ARIES] Oh, now that's
a hard decision to make.

226
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,984
[LUCA]
No, it's not.

227
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,487
You stay away from me.

228
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,074
[KANATA]
The accident that happened to us

229
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,743
may have been part
of a larger plan.

230
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,997
Does anyone have any idea why
someone would want us all dead?

231
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,250
No, of course not.

232
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,170
Maybe individually,
but not everyone.

233
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,923
Is there really a reason
common to all of us?

234
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,216
That seems unlikely.

235
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,342
I'm confused.

236
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,219
Was that sphere part
of the killer's plan

237
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,138
or something different
all together?

238
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,266
Because they got sucked in, too.

239
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,184
They risked dying
in the middle of space

240
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,602
along with the rest of us.

241
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,230
It doesn't make sense.

242
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,024
No, that's why this spaceship
was waiting up here for them.

243
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,945
It was their getaway!
That had to be their plan!

244
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,239
[ARIES] But the ship wasn't
ready for long‐distance travel

245
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,366
when we got in it.

246
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,244
She's right. How was the
killer planning to get home?

247
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,038
That's not exactly a
good plan if you ask me.

248
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,124
Maybe they weren't going home.

249
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,252
They could be on the list
just like the rest of us.

250
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,171
Like a murder‐suicide you mean?

251
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,674
I don't know why they
would do that, mind you,

252
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,218
or what the killer
is living with now.

253
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,305
But, it's an explanation.

254
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,057
If there really is some
psycho killer among us,

255
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,935
and they don't care about
their own life then...

256
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,354
They could still be
planning a way to carry out

257
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,231
their extermination plan.

258
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,567
And doing that would
be pretty easy,

259
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,445
if you don't care
about your own life.

260
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,613
All you'd have to do
is disable the ship.

Zack said it's
gonna take a while

317

to fix the switchboard.

318
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,263
I'm more worried about
us trying to land

319

when we're having,
like, a million problems!

320

I'm betting we'll
be okay to land

00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,853
as long as the gravity
controls are fixed.

You mean deflectors?

I'll check the air

The <i>Astra</i> is being pulled

Nine minutes? Hold on.

Can you even fix

While checking the ship,

00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,262
I found a backup generator
near the food storage.

Wait, are you positive?

356
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,641
[ARIES] Yes. We could try

from there to the
gravity controller.

That should give
it power, right?

I found some cables in
