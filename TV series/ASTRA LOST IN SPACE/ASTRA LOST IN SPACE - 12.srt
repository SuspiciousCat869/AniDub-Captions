1
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,437
How is he? Is Kanata okay?

2
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,357
I had to operate
without any anesthesia.

3
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,276
It's amazing how well
he tolerated the pain.

4
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,154
He's so strong. Really.

5
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,365
He's stable and resting up now.

6
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,658
Well, that's good.

7
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,326
So his arm is gone?

8
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,204
[QUITTERIE] Yeah. There's
no way to get it back.

9
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:40,791
But, I'm sure someone will
buy him a nice prosthetic.

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,960
Right? Your majesty?

11
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,212
[LUCA] Quitterie, we could
do without the snark,

12
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,589
I can't be nice right now.

13
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,676
While I sympathize with
Charce's upbringing.

14
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,596
I'm just still
upset about Kanata.

15
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:58,392
[CHARCE] Zack. You should
probably lock me up.

16
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,893
When we get to Astra,

17
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,229
I want you to call the
police and report me.

18
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,023
Along with the originals
who created all of us.

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,025
You sure?

20
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,111
[door opens]

21
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,655
[KANATA]
There's no need for any of that.

22
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,490
[CHARCE]
Kanata?

23
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,491
[ARIES]
What are you doing?

24
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,784
[QUITTERIE]
You need to be in bed!

25
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,828
No, it hurts too much to sleep!

26
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,372
Also, I'm kinda lonely.

27
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,249
Look, Charce.

28
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,002
I'm not mad at you
for what happened.

29
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,838
I made a decision,
and this was the result.

30
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,298
In fact, if you hadn't shut down

31
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,259
the sphere when you did,
I'd probably be dead.

32
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,011
So, thank you.

33
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,180
If we explain what happened,
they shouldn't charge you.

34
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,641
Everything's going to work out.

35
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,019
But you have a choice to make.

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,440
Will you live for yourself
from here on out?

37
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,650
Wait, you're willing
to trust him?

38
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:49,943
Yeah, I am.

39
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,403
What if he activates the sphere?

40
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,197
He can take my left
arm, too, Ulgar!

41
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,283
Look, we've gotta
trust each other!

42
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,660
'Cause we've been through
way too much crap not to!

43
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,120
Nothing has changed!

44
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,539
If any of you have got
a problem with that,

45
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,916
then I'll take
you on one‐handed!

46
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,753
Oh, yeah? You gonna
bleed on us, pal?

47
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,546
No one's gonna fight you on it.

48
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,673
We just wanted the
captain's opinion.

49
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,301
It's not like we're
planning to shun anybody.

50
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,094
We're a team, after all.

51
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,430
That's right. So work hard.

52
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,766
Make that twice as hard.

53
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,976
To cover for Kanata.

54
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,397
You guys. I am truly sorry.

55
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,485
Thanks to you all,
I can be myself.

56
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:35,072
From now on, I want
to be my own original.

57
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,824
And I want us to
go home together!

58
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,825
Of course.

59
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,243
That's the plan.

60
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:44,831
Besides, we still have
a few questions left to ask.

61
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,917
I know.

62
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,669
I'll tell you the whole truth.

63
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,882
The secrets of Astra handed down
through the Vixia royal family.

Again, I say "no duh!"

68
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,809
You've lost a ton of
blood, Captain Obvious!

69
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,811
He needs to be
resting right now.

70
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,688
This Vixia truth stuff
will have to wait.

71
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,481
Yes. Of course.

72
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,692
Listen up. We still
need supplies.

73
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,276
Tomorrow, we forage!

74
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,861
[STUDENTS]
Aye, yeah!

75
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,987
[KANATA weakly]
Aye, yeah!

76
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,698

Not you, Kanata!

[ARIES]
Team B‐5, camp log.

78
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,038
Day seven on Planet Galem.

79
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,873
Fortunately, this
place has both food

80
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,792
and water in abundance.

81
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,585
And the climate's stable, too.

82
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:34,589
Replenishing our supplies
is proving to be easy.

83
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,425
Kanata's been
focusing on sleeping

84
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,343
and nourishing his body,
so that he can heal up

85
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,220
as fast as possible.

86
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,056
[chiming]

87
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:43,807
[KANATA groans]

88
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,309
[ARIES] To be honest, I think
he might be a bit bored.

89
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,019
I feel bad for the guy.

90
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,273
[KANATA] ...it's so easy,
it's almost stupid.

91
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,524
[ARIES]
It's okay, though.

92
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,694
I've been visiting him
a lot to keep him company.

93
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,073
[ARIES]
Everything here is so shiny.

94
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,576
This planet really is
beautiful, don't you think?

95
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,744
For sure.

96
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,705
It's definitely
a sight to behold.

97
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,708
You know, I'll never
forget this trip.

98
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,420
The pretty view, or the
time we've spent together.

99
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,798
[KANATA chuckles] Thanks to
your photographic memory.

100
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,925
[ARIES]
Come on, that's not what I mean!

101
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,594
I'm talking about feelings!

102
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,680
[KANATA]
Right. No need to shout.

103
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,057
I feel the same way, actually.

104
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,935
This was all a very
precious experience.

105
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,481
Though to be fair, it did
have a few rough patches.

106
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,864
[ARIES] Speaking of.
How's your arm feeling?

107
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,658
[KANATA] It hurts like nobody's
business, but I'll live.

108
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,785
I need to toughen it up.

109
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,036
[ARIES]
How are you gonna touch it up?

110
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,872
[KANATA] That's not what I said.
Please don't touch it, okay?

111
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,081
[laughs]

112
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,291

[ARIES]
Despite everything,

114
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,213
I kinda wish this trip would
last a little bit longer.

115
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,298
[BOTH gasp]

116
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,426
[ARIES]
In a way. I'm sad it's ending.

117
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,309
[ARIES]
At long last,

118
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,187
we've gathered enough food
and water to leave Galem!

119
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,065
It's finally time
to head home to Astra.

120
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,234
[KANATA] All right!
Everyone ready to leave?

121
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,486
[QUITTERIE giggles] You guys,
I thought we were totally

122
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,613
done for when that Burr‐Burr
attacked us head on!

123
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,907
[YUN‐HUA] Right? I never would
have imagined that the dull

124
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,534
fish's tentacles would
prove to be so useful!

125
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,660
Get this, Luca.

126
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,079
Did you know the purple
mandala flower smells awful?

127
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,581
[KANATA] Thanks a lot, everyone,
now I feel all left out!

128
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,291
Ah! Heh! Ha! Hoo!

129
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,001
[KANATA]
What are you laughing about?

130
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,586
Is that even a laugh?

131
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,889
This was our last
stop before home.

132
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,058
We'll be on Astra
next time we land.

133
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,352
Yes, if it all goes smoothly.

134
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,729
It's always possible our
originals could find out

135
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,064
that we're still alive.

136
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,316
They may do something
to sabotage us.

137
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,151
Yeah, I suppose they might.

138
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,237
Isn't there a way we
can prepare for that?

139
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,490
Maybe. Let's hear what
Charce has to say.

140
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,952
[CHARCE sighs]

141

[ZACK] Now entering
faster‐than‐light travel.

142
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,251
Destination: Planet Astra.

143
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,634
[KANATA]
Right.

144
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,598
Everyone is here and
there's lots of time.

145
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,434
Charce, can you tell us
everything you know?

146
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,685
Please.

147
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,065
[CHARCE] Yes. These are
the secrets of Astra.

148
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:44,446
[CHARCE] In the past, there
was a planet known as Earth.

149
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,699
When an enormous asteroid
threatened Earth's extinction,

150
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:52,329
humanity made the bold choice
to migrate to a new planet.

151
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,915
"<i>Per Aspera. Ad Astra.</i>"

152
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,667
Overcome hardships
to reach your goals.

153
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,919
That was their slogan.

154
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,005
The idea that humanity
rallied behind.

155
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,300
[CHARCE] Two years later,
they discovered a planet

156
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,969
with a similar
topography to Earth.

157
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,804
It was a miracle.

158
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,724
The planet, which was

00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,406
Humanity moves to a new planet
and shuts down the wormholes.

318
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,783
Then they rewind the
calendar by 100 years

319
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,328
so the era matches
the societal level.

320
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,372
They connect Earth's
history with a new story.

321
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,248
Hold on.

322
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,876
So the history before
that time is just gone?

323
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,712
That's impossible. It has to be.

324
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,048
It's not, though I
imagine revising history

325
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,091
proved to be a rather
difficult project.

326
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,177
While changing things
like electronic records

327
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,596
wasn't a huge
challenge in itself,

328
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,016
silencing the general population
was a different matter.

329
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,352
Still, the new history
was eventually

330
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,562
accepted by the population.

331
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,607
The first generation prohibited
the truth from getting out,

332
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,734
and everyone played along.

333
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,819
The unification of
nations and languages

334
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,573
was a big factor.
But more importantly...

335
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,283
The first generation
was completely

336
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,202
on board with everything.

337
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,120
They were given a second chance

338
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,456
to finally clean up
their foolish history.

339
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,167
That desire won out.

340
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,962
All for the sake of peace.

erased for the cause.

348

[CHARCE] Well, I wouldn't say
it was completely erased.

That's just how the

the adults were lying.

So, yeah.

But they aren't
lying on purpose.

385

They're only repeating
the lies they were taught.

The fault is with the generation
that started all this.

Yeah, you're not wrong.

And it might sound weird,
but in the end,

392
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,877
we're not really that
different from Charce.

393
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:47,423
We think this way because
it's how we were all raised.

394
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,591
Still though.

395
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,720
It doesn't mean that
has to continue.

396
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,556
We have to look at the
world with our own eyes,

think about it,
and ask questions.

Once we can do those things,

It's not something we can
think about by ourselves.

404
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,909
It's something every
citizen on Astra

405
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,619
needs to consider.

406
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,412
We've gotta make it back home.

them all our story!

410
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,299
What do we do
about our originals?

411
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,343

their plan failed,

What if the truth
about the wormholes

416
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,269
and history fell
into the wrong hands?

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,812
It might not matter, but,

418
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,647
there's a division in
the government tasked

419
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,440
with keeping the secrets hidden.

420

for takin' out my brother.

422
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,696
He found out about
the clones, and in turn,

423
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,448
uncovered the secrets of Astra.

424
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,325
[KANATA] Why don't send

00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,412
Once we get close to Astra,

to send a message

out, we're done for.

He technically has

we should move forward

without fear.

633

Humanity did achieve
world peace,

but it was an unnatural one,
built on lies and deceit.

After our journey,
we agreed it was time

to tear down those lies
and embrace the truth.

They insisted that the world
deserved to know the truth.

upon the idea initially,

but when Kanata said we'd
release the information

they agreed to cooperate,

true history with the world.

Thankfully, something
that helped suppress

729
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,377
the uproar was a book Kanata
wrote detailing our journey.

It was titled "The Adventure
of the Spaceship Astra".

The book covered the
entire trip with both humor

we were initially worried

744
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,212
about what would happen to him.

745
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,548
[ARIES] In the end,
the government decided

746
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,717
not to charge him
with any crimes.

747
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,719
They determined his
actions were the result

of severe brainwashing,
and none of us

he was crowned king,

00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,906
he relinquished all of
his political power.

755
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:56,243
He publicized all of the secrets
held by the royal family,

756
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,828
opening them up for
historical research.

757
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,914
Then he allowed the
public access to parts

758
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,791
of the castle and
tore down the walls

surrounding the royal quarter.

760
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,253

00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,907
[ULGAR]
And you were okay with that?

788
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,783
Huh?

789
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,202
The day we found out.
You were sad, too!

790
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:06,373
[GERT] I meant it when I said
I wished you had died instead.

791
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,876
I still wish it.

792
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,337
But my real son is gone.

793
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,298
If I ended the project,
I would have lost everything.

794
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,718
I needed to complete it,
for his sake, too.

795
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,012
So I thought, anyway.

796
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:24,224
[ULGAR] But despite all that,
the project still failed.

797
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,810
And you weren't
able to erase us.

798
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,395
[GERT]
Hm.

799
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:36,903
[GERT]
Hm? You know.

800
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:41,282
Finn was a really good man.
And he was an even better son.

801
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,744
[ULGAR]
Yeah. I know.

802
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,622
[GERT gasps]

803
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,587
I often think.

804
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,339
If only that old
ship hadn't been

805
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,092
at the exit of the wormhole.

806
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,469
[GERT laughs]

807
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,312
[ULGAR]
Old ship, huh?

808
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,819
I suppose.

809
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,988
[beeping]

810
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,742
[ULGAR]
See ya.

811
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,089
[FUNICIA]
Hey. Polina!

812
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,675
Whoa. Did you forget
I'm your teacher now?

813
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,302
Show some respect.

814
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,846
[FUNICIA]
Oops, sorry Miss Livinskaya!

815
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,848
[POLINA]
Are you done for the day, Funi?

816
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,976
Yep! What about you?
Are you going somewhere?

817
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,229
[POLINA] Yes. I'm getting ready
to do a quick interview,

818
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,191
and then I'm giving a lecture
on history at the university.

819
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,901
[FUNICIA] Sometimes I think
you're the busiest one

820
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,027
out of all of us.

821
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,446
[laughs] Well, I'm
an important witness

822
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,906
of the old era, right?

823
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,407
And over 100 years old!

824
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,910
I'm 36, okay?

825
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,704
Are you still going to Yun‐hua's
concert later tonight?

826
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,748
[FUNICIA]
Uh‐huh, that's the plan.

827
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,917
[POLINA]
I'm jealous. I wish I could go.

828
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,877
Please, send my regards.

829
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,839
[gasps] It's Ulgar!

830
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,342
[ULGAR]
Hey. What's up?

831
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,843
Did you come here
to pick me up?

832
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:25,512
Are you going to the concert?

833
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,388
Unfortunately, I
gotta do some work.

834
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,141
Oh. I guess journalists
are super busy.

835
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,559
[POLINA]
Well, Mister Reporter.

836
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,936
Thank you for escorting me.

837
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,687
‐‐Aye, yeah.
‐‐[FUNICIA] Wait!

838
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,233
You never mentioned that Ulgar
was gonna interview you!

839
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,609
I'm way jealous!

840
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,070
This is just a date, isn't it?

841
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,364
Later, kid.

842
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,115
[BEEGO]
Take me for a ride, Ulgar!

843
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,700
Please, please, please!

844
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,035
[giggles]

845
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,122
[ULGAR]
Sure. Sometime soon, okay?

846
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,415
[BEEGO]
Ah!

847
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,045
[ULGAR chuckles]

848
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,547
What's so funny?

849
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,465
Well, she looks
identical to Quitterie.

850
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,675
It's pretty crazy.

851
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:06,261
Yes. But then again,
she's as old now

852
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,054
as Quitterie was back then.

853
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,099
By the way, you said you aren't
going to Yun‐hua's concert.

854
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,142
Does that mean you're
headed to the spaceport?

855
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,853
They'll be leaving soon, right?

856
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,021
I actually stopped
by there earlier.

857
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,482
Said my farewells
and all that stuff.

858
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,359
I see, that makes sense.

859
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,820
I wish I could have at
least seen the captain,

860
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,490
but I'm sure he'll be back soon.

861
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,492
Maybe I'll even interview him.

862
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,039
Whoa. Look, pal.

863
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,125
We're Yun‐hua's closest friends!

864
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,752
Move aside! We're
part of Team B‐5!

865
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,879
[LUCA]
It's okay, Quitterie.

866
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,214
We don't have to go
backstage like right now.

867
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,758
Yeah, we can always go
see her after the concert.

868
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,344
Besides, we're still
waiting for Funi, right?

869
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,596
Where's Ulgar?

870
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,389
That guy's always
flying all over,

871
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,724
he's hardly ever home.

872
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,226
Heck, last night he asked
to crash at my place.

873
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:59,230
I wouldn't waste your time
worrying about that busy bee.

874
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,399
Oh! Speaking of flying around.

875
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,484
They're supposed to
take off today, right?

876
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,570
I know they said they didn't
want us to send them off,

877
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:06,779
aren't you worried though?

878
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,948
Please. If that dolt
wants to leave

879
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,868
his gorgeous wife behind,
then that's his business.

880
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,120
[LUCA] Translation: you're
actually pretty peeved.

881
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,623
I bet you're feeling upset,
too, huh, Aries?

882
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,290
[ARIES]
Uh.

883
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,667
Come on, is everything
okay between you two?

884
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,587
[ARIES]
The thing is, well...

885
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:25,757
Kanata and I recently decided
we'd like to get married.

886
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,425
[BOTH gasp]

887
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,303
[ARIES] Sorry, I should have
told you guys sooner.

888
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:31,429
[LUCA]
Ah!

889
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,598
[BOTH]
Congratulations!

890
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,308
[QUITTERIE] Your dream
is finally coming true!

891
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,436
[LUCA] That jerk sure did
make you wait long enough.

892
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:39,604
[ARIES]
He never really had time,

893
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,482
he's been so focused
on becoming an explorer.

894
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,402
But then, the other day he and
I made the trip out to Vixia.

895
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,946
It was all just a formality,

896
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,406
but we scheduled
a meeting with Charce.

897
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,702
[ARIES]
And then Kanata asked him

898
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,829
if he could marry his daughter.

899
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,969
[QUITTERIE, LUCA laugh]

900
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,928
[LUCA]
When he gets back.

901
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,222
We're gonna throw you
guys the biggest party.

902
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,348
[QUITTERIE]
Wait, didn't you mention

903
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,141
you'd like to have a baby soon?

904
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:20,687
Yes! I'm really hoping that
we'll have a little girl.

905
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,272
I would name her Seira.

906
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,820
[applause]

907
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,947
[YUN‐HUA]
Thank you all so much.

908
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:34,450
Next, I'd like to sing
you a brand‐new song.

909
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,663
And I'd like to dedicate
it to my closest friends.

910
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,290
You see, today is very special.

911
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,669
A few of them are
going back into space.

912
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,754
When I was 17 years old,

913
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:50,299
I spent five long months
lost in space with them.

914
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,137
But that time was
incredibly precious to me.

915
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,055
We worked together as a team

916
00:41:56,097 --> 00:42:00,435
to reach our goal and move
forward against all odds.

917
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:04,313
I was trapped in my own shell,
and I couldn't express myself.

918
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,982
But thanks to them, I was able

919
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:12,613
to grow into the person
standing before you.

920
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,949
I won't forget those days,
or the adventures

921
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,368
we had together.

922
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,038
We encountered
life‐threatening dangers,

923
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,623
we fought, we cried,
and there were times

924
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,333
we got depressed.

925
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:29,797
And yet, the thing I remember
most is everyone's smiles.

926
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,216
Our fearless captain went
on to make a fortune

927
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,303
with his book and managed
to buy back that old ship.

928
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,096
[AUDIENCE laughs]

929
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,682
[YUN‐HUA]
But I think I understand why.

930
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,434
Because in a way,

931
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:44,979
that spaceship represents
the bond between us all.

932
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:49,275
We may have come home,
but our journey is never over.

933
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:53,488
The <i>Astra</i> will move forward,
towards the future.

934
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,075
This song's called
"The Adventure of Astra"!

935
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,659
[AUDIENCE gasps]

936
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,105
[KANATA]
So, hey.

937
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,107
Are you sure this
craft is good to go?

938
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,400
It looks more beaten
up than the others.

939
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,529
[ZACK] Well, the Ark series
is over 100 years old.

940
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,906
It's practically a fossil.

941
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,366
But don't you worry, Captain.

942
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,201
I made sure I
conducted the interior

943
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:42,036
maintenance personally.

944
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,539
Besides, exploring
space in this ship

945
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,916
should come fairly easy to you.

946
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:51,629
Heh. Yeah. It is
our ship after all.

947
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:52,755
[ZACK]
I'm impressed.

948
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:56,634
You really did get your own
vessel in seven years.

949
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:59,053
How's the new prosthetic
arm treating you?

950
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,638
[KANATA]
You gave it too many features.

951
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,266
An electronic ear pick
is just superfluous!

952
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,016
Is it though?

953
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,726
[KANATA]
Yes, 100 percent!

954
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,229
[ZACK] Our mission is to scout
out potential locations

955
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,607
to place wormhole
exits. So first up,

956
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,193
we'll go to Planet McPa,
and once we're there,

957
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,238
we can use the wormhole to
head out towards Gazenette.

958
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,282
After that, it's up to us.

959
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,076
[KANATA] Beyond Gazenette,
it's uncharted territory.

960
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:23,244
Nice.

961
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,580
I meant to tell you that
Ulgar stopped by earlier.

962
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,456
For real? He could
have joined us!

963
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,624
I invited him.

964
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,334
"Last time I followed
Cap anywhere,

965
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,045
we got dropped way out in
the middle of space." He said.

966
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,422
Excuse me?

967
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,300
It's not like any
of that was my fault!

968
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,302
Huh? Wait, it can't be.

969
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,179
What?

970
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,847
Hey. How are you?

971
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,307
[KANATA, ZACK]
Charce?

972
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,267
But... what are you doing here?

973
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,519
Well, I RSVP'd as "maybe."

974
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:49,645
[KANATA]
This isn't a party!

975
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,607
Can the king really just peace
out for a space adventure?

976
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:56,110
I can. Afterall,
I did make a promise.

977
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,196
That I would be
your right‐hand man.

978
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,617
[KANATA] You know I only said
that to sound cool, right?

979
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,910
[CHARCE]
Yes, I do.

980
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,411
But I'll be more
useful than you.

981
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,830
[KANATA] Dude, I can shoot
missiles from my elbow.

982
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:08,706
[ZACK]
That's not a feature.

983
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,041
[KANATA]
But you added an ear pick?

984
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:10,958
[ZACK]
You're welcome!

985
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,251
[KANATA]
Whatever.

986
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:27,600
[ZACK] Hey, you ready?
Let's go. Captain.

987
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,268
[KANATA]
Aye, yeah.

988
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:42,156
We've come pretty
far, haven't we?

989
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,075
Thanks, guys.

990
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,832
Prepare for takeoff!

991
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,376
Aye, yeah!

992
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,185
Destination...

993
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,730
[KANATA]
The unknown!

994
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,245
To the depths of space!
