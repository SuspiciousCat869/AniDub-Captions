reorganized into districts.

Only one region was allowed
to be ruled by a monarchy.

00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,876
It's all my fault.

317
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,378
I should have been
paying more attention

318
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,754
while piloting the ship.

319
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,548
You're wrong. Your
flying was fine.

320
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,468
I'm responsible for this mess.

321
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,721
I just... I thought
we could get home.

322
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,641
If we worked together,
one step at a time.

323
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,562
[ULGAR]
Thanks for the pep‐talk, Cap.

324
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,398
I thought the captain's
supposed to act tough

325
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,982
when things are bad.

326
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,860
What about those survival tips
you're always spouting?

327
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,904
Something like
"If you stand still,

328
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,198
then you don't move
forward" or whatever.

329
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,368
Good point, Ulgar.

330
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,038
[KANATA]
You're right. Thanks. I'm sorry.

331
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,292
Wherever we're gonna live,
we'll still need food.

332
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,128
We're running low on supplies.

333
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,004
So let's explore.

334
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,756
Survival tip number ten:

335
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,758
"If you stand still, then
you don't move forward."

336
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,301
[LUCA]
Hey, you totally stole that!

337
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,137
[ARIES, CHARCE laugh]

338
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,349
Thank you, Ulgar.

339
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,018
[ULGAR sighs]

340
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,106
[FUNICIA]
It's starting to snow!

341
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,732
[CHARCE] Probably because
we're on the edge

342
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,528
of the belt area. So,
closer to the frozen zone.

343
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,197
Thankfully our crust suits
keep us from freezing.

344
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,492
[YUNHUA] I see berries.
Do you think they're edible?

345
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:53,870
[ULGAR]
Yummy.

346
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,704
[ULGAR]
Yep.

347
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,789
[YUNHUA]
That was so impressive, Ulgar.

348
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,708
It was oddly neat to watch.

349
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,586
Still though, I don't see
very many animals around,

350
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,171
so that might limit our hunting.

351
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,255
[FUNICIA]
Oh, maybe we could catch

352
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,673
some of those big bugs!

353
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,884
[CHARCE laughs]
That might be difficult.

354
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,554
We would need nets
as big as soccer goals.

355
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,807
[sighs] So, everyone's
just accepted it, huh?

356
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,684
I really admire you guys.

357
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,061
Those are some nerves
of steel you've got.

358
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,606
[ULGAR] They're just
puttin' up a good front.

359
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,065
If we don't keep
moving and focus on

360
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,026
what's ahead of us,
then we'll end up

361
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,320
drowning in despair.

362
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,947
Nobody can come to terms
with this that fast.

363
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,575
Oh...

364
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,493
Hold up.

365
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,620
You're actually scared,
too, aren't you?

366
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,289
With that perma‐scowl,
it's hard to tell sometimes.

367
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,833
[ULGAR]
Wha‐‐ I'm not scared!

368
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,629
Hey, c'mon, Charce.

369
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,756
Let's look on the other
side of that cliff.

370
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,049
Can we please go?

371
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,467
Behind the cliff?

372
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,052
But there won't be
plants growing there

373
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,720
since there isn't any sunlight.

374
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,139
[FUNICIA]
Okay. I was just asking

375
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,807
'cause I saw something.

376
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,559
[gasps]

377
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,772
[CHARCE]
You did? No way.

378
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,825
At least... the
water's drinkable.

379
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,035
Indeed.

380
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,580
Good thing we were
able to move the ship.

381
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,542
Quitterie, you need
to shift gears.

382
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,627
We have to focus on surviving.

383
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,672
Why should we try to survive
on this stupid planet?

384
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,174
There're so many things
I wanted to do.

385
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,051
Believe it or not,
I had a vision

386
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,845
of the future and what I wanted!

387
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,430
Like going to college.

388
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,434
Becoming a doctor.
Getting married one day.

389
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,229
But now I'll never be able
to do any of those things!

390
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,565
How the heck can you
be so calm right now?

391
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,943
Because it's my job
to be calm, Quitterie.

392
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:49,860
When others panic,

393
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,322
I have to be calm
and level headed.

394
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,284
Listen. You have to
make a decision.

395
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,453
Live here or place your
bets on a low probability.

396
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,539
I'm not sure what you mean.

397
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,790
Did you know?

398
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,959
On board the <i>Astra</i>,
we have exactly one

399
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,336
functioning hibernation device.

400
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,172
And if you wanted, you could
use it to wait for help.

401
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,799
Are you serious?

402
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,427
How would she even let
someone know she was here?

403
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,637
There's no way to communicate.

404
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,307
[ZACK] That's why I said
"low probability."

405
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,434
You would have to wait
for someone to come.

406
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,979
It could take decades,
or even centuries.

407
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,148
Long after we all
died of old age,

408
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,609
you'd still be waiting,
peacefully asleep.

409
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,902
It's possible that
you'd never be found.

410
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,113
You'd be betting
everything on the chance

411
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,865
that someone might
explore this planet

412
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,201
in the far‐off future.

413
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,413
[QUITTERIE]
Why? Why would you tell me this?

414
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,539
That's just like telling me

415
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,875
I would have to die
here by myself.

416
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,918
I'm sorry. But
that's the only way

417
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,837
I can think of to
get you back home.

418
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,797
But I don't wanna be by myself!

419
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,507
Don't you get it?

420
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,637
Why do you have
to be such a jerk?

421
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:02,058
[ZACK] Let's live here.
Together. With everyone.

422
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,727
Kanata, it looks like

423
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,646
you've come to terms
with it already.

424
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,481
It's pretty impressive.

425
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,107
[KANATA]
Nah, not really.

426
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,943
I haven't accepted it
and I probably never will,

427
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,987
but I have to try.

428
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,157
That being said, I'm not
very hard to please.

429
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,326
I feel like I can
survive almost anywhere.

430
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,203
It sounds crazy,
but I was kinda hoping

431
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,954
we could make some stone tools,

432
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,999
and then maybe fix this thing
over the next ten years or so.

433
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,794
[laughs]

434
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,089
[ARIES]
I'd be okay with that,

435
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,633
‐‐as long as you're around, too.
‐‐[KANATA] Huh?

436
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,551
I mean... I kinda...

437
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,387
[KANATA]
Right. Yeah. I got you.

438
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,846
What?

439
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,058
It's Charce.
He said he needs us.

440
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,143
[ARIES]
Where does he want us to go?

441
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,229
He's over by the cliff.

442
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:55,027
[STUDENTS panting]

443
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:59,198
[KANATA gasps]
What is this?

444
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,367
I don't understand.

445
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:05,454
Nor do I. But still.
There it is.

446
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,376
Can it really be...

447
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,297
[KANATA]
...another <i>Astra</i>?

448
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,261
[ZACK] No, it's the same model,
but a different ship.

449
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:24,223
It's more weathered, and
the damage isn't the same.

450
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,350
Okay, let's investigate.

451
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:30,688
Team of three. Me and
Zack, and, who else?

452
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,523
Ulgar, let's go.

453
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,941
All right.

454
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,162
It has power.

455
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,790
[ULGAR]
I'm goin' in.

456
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,297
[KANATA]
Same internal structure.

457
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,302
[KANATA]
It's in pretty rough shape.

458
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,597
Like an old house.

459
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,475
The ship must have
crash landed here

460
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,810
just like ours did.

461
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,521
There's a fair amount of
damage on the ship's bridge.

462
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,356
I doubt it's capable of flight.

463
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,566
Well, that sucks.

464
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,318
I checked the cabins back there.

465
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,153
Nobody else is on board.

466
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,946
[KANATA]
So maybe the crew was rescued,

467
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,324
but the ship was damaged
and left behind?

468
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,950
That would make sense.

469
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,328
[gasps] No, look,
I just found a message

470
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,871
from one of the crew.

471
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,581
"Help me."

472
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,292
What? But weren't
they all rescued?

Why leave a message for help?

474
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,172
I've no idea. Wait, hold on.

475
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,132
It's the hibernation device!

Looks like it's running.

There's someone inside.

478
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,436
It was activated July 2051.

479
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,940
Which means this person's
been in there for 12 years.

480
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,611
[ZACK] Twelve years? That's
a long time to wait for help.

481
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,238
What should we do?

482
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,616
Wake them up.

00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:16,544

A woman?
