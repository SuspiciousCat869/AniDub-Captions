1
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,349
[KANATA]
Come on. Tell us everything.

2
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,435
Why did you have to be the one
to complete this mission?

3
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,396
Talk to us. Tell us who you are.

4
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,565
The truth is I'm a clone.

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,275
The name of my original

6
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:29,780
is Noah Vix. He's
the ruler of Vixia.

7
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,907
I am the king's clone.

8
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,295
[CHARCE] When I recall
my earliest memories,

9
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:12,799
I see stone pillars.
So many. Row upon row.

10
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,219
Like a marble forest
with no end in sight.

11
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,642
Now then, Charce.

12
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,477
Tell me about your
mission again.

13
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,189
What is the purpose
of your existence?

14
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,735
My king. I exist to
become your new body.

15
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,945
That's right.
You're not a person;

16
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,615
your life belongs
to me and me alone.

17
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:41,828
Someday, you will surrender
your very being unto me.

18
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,748
[CHARCE]
As you wish, my king.

19
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,668
[CHARCE] Growing up, that
mission was drilled into me.

20
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,587
I lived under a false identity,
claiming to be the son

21
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,255
of a close aide to the king,

22
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,257
forbidden to leave
the castle grounds.

23
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,343
I was allowed to learn
everything I could

24
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,178
about the outside world, though.

25
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,391
What fascinated me most
was flora and fauna.

26
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,351
I suppose being
confined to the grounds

27
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,895
is what made me so
interested in biology.

28
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,481
Full of wonder, I
dedicated myself to learning

29
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,066
everything I could
about what lived

30
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,110
beyond the castle walls.

31
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,779
The princess, who saw
how much I loved science,

32
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,322
looked after me every day.

33
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,990
Together, we studied
all the insect

34
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,659
and plant life we could find.

35
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,828
I loved spending time with her.

36
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,746
It was the only real fun I had,

37
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,624
with no idea the world had
anything more to offer,

38
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,626
I was content.

39
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,421
Until everything changed.

40
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,799
Your new mission is to
perish. Leave no trace.

41
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,968
[CHARCE] When the
Genome Control Act passed,

42
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,970
the king decided
to kill his clone

43
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,514
and sent me into space.

44
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,057
[NOAH] This device
has been passed to us

45
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,352
in secret through Vixia.
You will exit above Earth,

46
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,397
where no one will ever
be able to find you.

47
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,316
You will be transferred
to a civilian high school.

48
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,026
In your few, remaining days,

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,155
you will have the opportunity
to make some friends.

50
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,408
And then you will
die alongside them.

51
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,037
[CHARCE] I existed for
the king, and him alone.

52
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,291
A mere vessel, I was not
permitted to have goals.

53
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,127
It was a fact I accepted
without question.

54
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,379
It was just how I was raised.

55
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,888
No way. I can't believe this!

56
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,848
[CHARCE]
The king's orders were absolute.

57
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,183
I became an assassin for him

58
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:30,020
so that I could kill all
of you, along with myself!

59
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,855
But what about the
story you told us,

60
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,274
the one about being a noble?

61
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,614
[CHARCE] Not bad for something
I improvised on the spot, right?

62
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,782
[gasps]

63
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,868
[ZACK] I don't understand.
Why would you agree to this?

64
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,828
[KANATA]
Charce...

65
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,206
Do I see pity in your eyes?

66
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,958
You have no right to judge me!

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,586
You don't understand
what my world's like.

68
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,463
I'm willing to die for my king.

69
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,716
I consider this mission
to be the highest honor.

70
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,220
It wasn't dissimilar in
your era. Was it, Polina?

71
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,596
No.

72
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,350
[POLINA] Many in my era
happily gave their lives.

73
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,268
They were willing to
sacrifice everything

74
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,103
in the name of what
they worshipped.

75
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,064
The fraught nature
of human relations

76
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,317
plunged the entire planet
into darkness and chaos.

77
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,194
That was just the
way things were.

78
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,655
[CHARCE] And who could blame
them for their crimes?

79
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,406
They were molded to be that way,

80
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,784
raised to become martyrs
for their beliefs.

81
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,536
There are scores of
people out there,

82
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,163
existing without any
purpose or direction,

83
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,415
but no one could
say that about me!

84
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,794
My life is wonderful and
filled with great meaning!

85
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:41,216
[ARIES sobs]

86
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,761
[KANATA] Are you telling
us it was all an act?

87
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,096
I am.

88
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,430
[KANATA]
You're lying.

89
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,392
I know you think of us as
your friends, as your family.

90
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,352
Stay away from me.

91
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,813
I know you, Charce.

92
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,649
I can tell when
someone's forcing it.

93
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,318
You love us, I have
no doubt about that.

94
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,988
Don't flatter yourselves.

95
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,905
[KANATA]
How else do you think

96
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,282
we could've made it this far?

97
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,492
[CHARCE gasps]

98
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,077
[KANATA]
We've had each other's backs,

99
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,205
clawing our way home
from the brink of death!

100
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,333
You'll never convince me
that we aren't friends!

101
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,631
[CHARCE] Shut up!
I don't have any friends!

102
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,675
[KANATA]
Then answer this:

103
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,052
Why did you retract
the sphere twice?

104
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,470
[CHARCE gasps]

105
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:33,226
[KANATA] On Vilavurs,
and then on this planet.

106
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,520
You had your chance,
but you didn't take it.

107
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,981
You could have hunted
me down and killed me.

108
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,401
I wanna know what stopped you.

109
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,612
You couldn't murder your friend!

110
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,529
[CHARCE]
You're wrong.

111
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,283
I have no hesitations
about my mission.

112
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,535
But I'll tell you why I stopped.

113
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,664
I couldn't let Aries
be taken, too.

114
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,916
[gasps]

115
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,376
A‐Aries?

116
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,795
There's one thing
you misunderstand...

117
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,213
...about my mission.

118
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,925
I can't return to Astra alone.

119
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,345
Originally, I did plan
to kill everyone.

120
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,513
But, along the way,
that changed.

121
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,267
All because I discovered Aries.

122
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,269
What are you saying?

123
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,231
[CHARCE] The moment I
saw you at the spaceport,

124
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,192
I noticed the resemblance.

125
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,485
Then, in the
forests of Vilavurs,

126
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,362
I was struck by something else:

127
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,656
your photographic memory.

128
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,991
And, of course,
your heterochromia.

129
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:36,581
[CHARCE] There's no denying it.
You share the same genes.

130
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,876
Aries, you are the
king's only daughter.

131
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,842
[CHARCE]
You are Princess Seira's clone!

132
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,762
[ARIES gasps]

133
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,390
[SEIRA]
Charce. Wait, I can't keep up!

134
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,685
Oh, sorry, Princess.
I'll slow down.

135
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,438
Come on, please
just call me Seira!

136
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,148
After all, as my personal aide,

137
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,943
you have to obey me.
Consider it a command.

138
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,779
[CHARCE]
Yes, Seira.

139
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,280
[SEIRA]
It's kind of funny.

140
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,784
Technically, or, genetically,
rather, I'm your daughter.

141
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,285
But, to be perfectly honest,

142
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,538
you've always felt more
like my little brother.

143
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,956
Is there a reason
why you've always

144
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,542
been so kind to me?

145
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,627
I'm only a clone,
you don't have to‐‐

146
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,837
Quiet, Charce.

147
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,172
I couldn't care less
how my father sees you.

148
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,008
I'm nothing like him.

149
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,718
As I've said many times before,

150
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,678
I am fundamentally
opposed to my father's

151
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,680
rejuvenation plan.

152
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,434
Clones are people, too.
I can't forgive him.

153
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,768
[CHARCE]
Hm...

154
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,520
[SEIRA]
As a matter of fact, Charce.

155
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,230
I used to have a clone, as well.

156
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,733
Wait, really? Are you serious?

157
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,945
[SEIRA] Yes. When they first
told me about their plan,

158
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,615
I adamantly refused to
let them make one of me.

159
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,452
But then, they took

Why you were so happy.

320
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,389
You finally got
out of that castle

321
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,350
and had a chance
to see new worlds.

It's a dream come true for me.

00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,398
[KANATA]
What you really want is to live.

325
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,609
Let's go home together.

326
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,779
We can see what
Astra has to offer.

327
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,531
I mean, the truth is,

328
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,408
none of us got the chance
to know our home planet‐‐

329

Not nearly as well as we wanted!

It's not too late! He's right!

Please, Charce!

Just come home with us!

The originals will be
punished, not you, Charce.

King or not, it's still a crime.

There's no reason
you should die.

336
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,341
[KANATA]
You didn't choose to be born,

337
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,885
and you had no say
in how you were raised.

338
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,263
But you can make
the choice to change!

339
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,473
I can't change.

340
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,433
Where I'm from,
no one ever does.

I was able to transform!

00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,357
And it was because
of my friends!

my mother raised me
to be. Funi either.

347

Your parents and your
genes don't matter!

The people you meet,
and the experiences

if you allow them to!

[CHARCE] I kept the sphere
generation device hidden.

356
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,966
It was in the left
sleeve of my suit

357
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,761
so that I could bring it out
whenever I needed to.

do anything to hurt us.

Yes, of course he is.

He's always running
