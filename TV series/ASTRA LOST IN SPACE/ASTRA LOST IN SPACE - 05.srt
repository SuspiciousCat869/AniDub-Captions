1
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,851
[KANATA] Wow. So, Yun‐hua's
singing was that awesome?

2
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:18,769
Really?

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,438
[ARIES] Yep! I would even
go so far as to say that

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,566
it was the most beautiful sound
I've heard in my whole life!

5
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,694
For real, it made me feel
super relaxed and stuff.

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,447
Not just mentally,
but like physically, too.

7
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,783
[CHARCE] It's almost as if
her song served as a life line

8
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,826
to help us make it
through that moment.

9
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,705
[ZACK] I'm certain it
saved our lives. Thank you.

10
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,457
Oh, sure.

11
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,918
So, I've been
wondering something.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,337
Did you know she wants
to be a singer, Kanata?

13
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,673
Huh? Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,343
I mean, Yun‐hua's
mom is Lucy Lum.

15
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,345
Uh.

16
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,556
The Lucy Lum? Are you serious?!

17
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,350
What? You mean the
super‐famous singer?

18
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,309
I see!

19
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,019
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Hold up!

20
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,230
[gasps]

21
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,523
[QUITTERIE]
Now that I'm really looking,

22
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,316
you guys do look similar!

23
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:10,195
You're actually, like,
crazy cute, Yun‐hua!

24
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,072
[YUN‐HUA]
Please don't stare at me!

25
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,951
[KANATA] Hey now. There's
no need to be so shy.

26
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,869
You're with friends
here, remember.

27
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,955
You can express yourself freely.

28
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,836
[YUN‐HUA]
Yes.

29
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,423
[YUN‐HUA]
It's kinda like what Aries said.

30
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,009
This trip has been a lot of fun.

31
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,221
[YUN‐HUA] I like being on
this adventure with everyone,

32
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,182
even if it is
a little dangerous.

33
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:46,356
You're all so warm and reliable.
That's why I feel this way.

34
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:52,863
It's silly, but singing
is the only talent I have.

35
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,824
I still promise to help
as much as I can, though.

36
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,118
So let's go home.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,661
Together!

38
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,788
[ALL]
Aye, yeah!

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,376
[ARIES]
Team B5 Camp Log.

40
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,635
[ARIES] We were still struggling
to find food for our journey.

41
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,512
[FUNICIA]
Yum, yum, yummy!

42
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,388
[CHARCE]
I knew it!

43
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,389
[KANATA]
Seriously?

44
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,933
[ARIES] But then, Charce
had the idea that we might

45
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,728
be able to actually
eat the Pole Trees.

46
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,439
I just hypothesized that since
they're giant mushrooms

47
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,983
and not trees at all, there was
a chance they were edible.

48
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,486
[ARIES]
Wow! They look super tasty!

49
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,363
I'm glad you and I
are on the same page!

50
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,281
Great minds, am I right?

51
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:40,077
[KANATA]
Yeah, more like strange minds.

52
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,537
[ARIES] After five days
and a near death experience

53
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,248
on Planet Shummoor,
we finally had enough supplies

54
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,417
for the next leg of our journey.

55
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,507
Goodbye, Gruppies!

56
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:58,804
‐‐[ARIES] I miss you already!
‐‐We'll never forget you!

57
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,013
[QUITTERIE]
Wow, they're really attached

58
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,766
to those alien bird
things. Weirdos.

59
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:06,061
Well, they did
help us out a lot.

60
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,106
[ARIES] Our experiences
on this planet weren't easy,

61
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,358
but I think we've all
grown a lot from them.

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,276
We're stronger than ever.

63
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,576
[LUCA]
Uh?

64
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,453
[YUN‐HUA]
Hey, Luca?

65
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,542
Can I ask for a favor?

66
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,793
[LUCA giggles]

67
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,088
[ALL gasping]

68
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,007
[YUN‐HUA]
Um...

69
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,385
Please don't stare at me.

70
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,846
[ALL sigh]

71
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,890
[QUITTERIE]
Ugh, boys can be such pigs!

72
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,436
[ARIES] Then, a scary beef stole
my bag so I called out for help!

73
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,895
Things were really bad!

74
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,399
Luckily, someone named Kanata
Bive Domb came to my rescue!

75
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,943
The patrol bots were all
like, "One‐two, one‐two,"

76
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,112
but he came back and said
he wanted to be our champion!

77
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,531
[TEACHER] Hey. We're
getting ready to land.

78
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,533
Everyone take your seats.

79
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,035
Okay. I'll send you
a message tomorrow.

80
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,290
It'll be like your very own
camp log. Bye for now, Mom!

81
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,137
[sighs]

82
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,641
[REPORTER] Nine students from
Caird High are still missing.

83
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,060
It has now been almost 40
days since the children were

84
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,855
last seen during
a trip to Planet McPa.

85
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,608
The incident is quite
mysterious. All of the students,

86
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,943
as well as their luggage,
appear to have vanished,

87
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,236
leaving behind no evidence...

88
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,279
[EMMA]
Aries.

89
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,490
[REPORTER]
Authorities are baffled.

90
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,832
[GERT] I want to thank
each of you for coming today.

91
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,668
I understand how difficult
this must be for all of you.

92
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,380
These are indeed trying
times for everyone involved.

93
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,383
As I'm sure you're well
aware, my own son is one

94
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,762
of the students who went
missing on Planet McPa.

95
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,139
Allow me to get
straight to the point.

96
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,809
It has now been one month since
the search for our children

97
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,437
was officially suspended, and
I think the time has come for us

98
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,816
to accept the undeniable
truth of this matter.

99
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,277
I say we file for a judicial
declaration of disappearance.

100
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,488
You can't be serious!

101
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,825
You want us all to declare
our children legally dead?

102
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,535
Don't you think
it's too soon for that?

103
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,955
You're really willing to
give up? Because I am not.

104
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,084
Listen, I understand how you
feel, however, we simply cannot

105
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,253
allow the children to
remain missing indefinitely.

106
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,172
[gasps] Well, what about
the rest of the parents,

107
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,174
how do you all feel?

108
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,884
Look, we did everything we could

109
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,388
in order to continue the search.
Unfortunately, at this time,

110
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,182
I believe we've simply
exhausted our options.

111
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,394
I see no reason
to oppose this idea.

112
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,604
[WEI] We need to take
a more realistic stance

113
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,815
regarding these discussions.

114
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,943
Do you think your
daughter will just reappear?

115
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,405
Simply believing she will isn't
enough to make that happen.

116
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:07,367
[gasps] Well, no. Not exactly.

117
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,619
But that's why I want us
to continue searching!

118
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,204
[OLIVE] Oh, and where
else do you suggest

119
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,665
we search, Ms. Spring?

120
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,876
We've scoured every
inch of Planet McPa,

121
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,836
except the deepest oceans.

122
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,088
An accident on the water
means that our children

123
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,135
have been lost to the waves.
Face the facts, it's hopeless.

124
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,391
[EMMA]
Mm... Possibly.

125
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,895
But I don't think they're
anywhere in the ocean.

126
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,605
The boat was still docked,

127
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,357
and the engines
were never activated.

128
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,027
Besides, why would the
children swim out to sea

129
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,486
with all of their luggage?

130
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,989
None of this makes any sense!

131
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,576
Then in that case, where
do you propose we search?

132
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,495
We search space!

133
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,707
[GERT]
Wha‐‐? Are you being serious?

134
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,460
Yes, of course I am.

135
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,879
What method would they
have used to get to space?

136
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,923
I'm not entirely sure.

137
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,800
I suppose they could have found
an old spaceship or something?

138
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,552
[RAY]
Unbelievable.

139
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,387
How absurd.

140
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,682
So, your only idea is that
maybe they found a spaceship?

141
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,310
But there's no evidence.
You'd be better off trying

142
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,021
to convince me there
was a second boat.

143
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,274
In fact, at least that story
would be more plausible.

144
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,194
You're wrong! What's
unbelievable is we haven't found

145
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,487
their remains or luggage!

146
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,280
There's no trace
of them anywhere!

147
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,407
Look at it this way;
if they did go to space,

148
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,868
then there's still
a possibility they're alive!

149
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,244
So, let's find them!

150
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,829
[GERT]
Ms. Spring.

151
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,793
I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
thought about it, as well,

152
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,879
but, unfortunately, the cost
of such a search party

153
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:46,591
would be phenomenal without
government assistance.

154
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,261
The odds are just
not in our favor.

155
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,432
This is difficult for me, too.

Speaking of the government...

00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,214
Well, I can't help but
notice that Luca's father,

165
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,259
Mister Esposito, seems to be
absent from today's meeting.

a senator, isn't that correct?

00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,264
Do you think that
there's a chance

168
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,058
he could talk to the
government on our behalf?

169
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,186
He already did those
things a long time ago.

You see, while they sympathize,
he's informed me that

00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,692
the government won't help us
with any future searches.

172
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,277
The senator couldn't
be here today

173
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,447
because he had to attend
his scheduled DNA sampling.

174
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,948
[JED] I wonder how
he feels about that,

175
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,742
seeing as he was
a leader of the faction

opposing the genome
management project.

466
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,728
I totally forgot.

467
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,480
[KANATA]
Thanks for the reminder.

468
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,024
[YUN‐HUA]
Sorry.

469
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,777
But hey, we're still
making good progress!

470
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,489
Some of the shiest people on
the team are opening up lately.

471
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:07,034
Our relationships are really
starting to move forward.

472
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,829
[LUCA] Yeah, you're right, we're
all getting along pretty well!

473
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,372
Like, if there is a traitor,

474
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,707
I can't imagine who it would be.

475
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,420
[ALL gasp]

476
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,095
Don't move.

477
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,055
Ulgar!

478
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,308
[ULGAR]
The gun I'm holding is real.

479
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,894
Move, and I'll shoot.

480
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,813
It can't be.

481
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,940
I don't believe this!

482
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,403
[KANATA]
Ulgar is the enemy?
