1
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,390
[POLINA]
What do you call that planet?

2
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,392
If that's not Earth, what is it?

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,937
What planet do all
of you come from?

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,980
What's our home planet?

5
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,274
I thought that was obvious.

6
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,110
Our planet is Astra.

7
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,622
[POLINA]
What's this continent?

8
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,249
That's Carifa.

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,291
[POLINA]
This one?

10
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,086
[LUCA]
That'd be Aria Sue.

11
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,629
Like I thought, this planet

12
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,839
is nothing like
the Earth I know.

13
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,800
And why would it be?

14
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,135
It seems we come from
different home planets.

15
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,679
It's the only explanation.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,430
[LUCA]
But that doesn't make sense!

17
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,140
Does that actually mean
there are humans

18
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,350
living on "Earth"?

19
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,935
[KANATA]
Listen.

20
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,854
This might be a shot
in the dark, but...

21
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,773
What if Polina's a space alien?

22
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:05,607
[QUITTERIE]
What if you're stupid?

23
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,859
Seriously, she could be
mimicking a human form!

24
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,778
[QUITTERIE] Maybe you should
follow her example, idiot!

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,946
Sorry, Polina.

26
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,073
He just has whipped cream
where his brain should be.

27
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,199
No, it's fine.

28
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,243
From your point of view,
I am some weirdo

29
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,494
from an alien planet.

30
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,745
[QUITTERIE]
Way to go Captain Moron,

31
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,664
you made her cry again.

32
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,292
I'd say it's obvious that
we're all human beings.

33
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,668
I'm certain of that.

34
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,628
But we cannot ignore
that we originate

35
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,463
from different planets.

36
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,716
[POLINA] It's a bit odd
that we all speak English,

37
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,302
though my native language
is actually Russian.

38
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,428
Have you heard of Russia?

39
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,513
[KANATA]
Mm... Uh‐uh.

40
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:39,766
Wait. Russia? I know
that! It's a country.

41
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,602
So you have heard of it?

42
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,938
[ZACK] "Country"? An outdated
geopolitical term.

43
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,356
They've ceased to exist.

44
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,484
No countries? But that's...

45
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,861
[ARIES]
Russia was in the northern part

46
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,446
of the Aria Sue Continent.

47
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,115
At least, before it
became the Soviet Union.

48
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,825
China used to be over there.

49
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,244
The small island next
to China was Japan.

50
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,871
And I think right
below that was India.

51
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,997
Whoa.

52
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,582
[LUCA]
Those are Old Era maps.

53
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,583
I can't believe
you remember them.

54
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,168
[POLINA]
Everything seems out of place,

55
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,670
but the relative
positions are correct.

56
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,214
The difference is... time?

57
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,383
[POLINA] I think if we really
want to get to the bottom

58
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:19,014
of this conundrum, then we
need to compare our histories.

59
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:19,931
[ARIES]
At that point.

60
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,935
We started sharing the
histories of our two worlds.

61
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,480
Let's see, there's the
industrial revolution,

62
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,232
and then we had the first
and second world wars, right?

63
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,110
Yeah, everything seems
pretty similar so far.

64
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,489
That's true, but your knowledge
of world events is vague.

65
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,824
Don't they teach
you kids any history?

66
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,242
[CHARCE]
There are a few classes,

67
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,578
but not much regarding
the Old Era.

68
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,205
[ARIES] I thought it was
all pretty interesting,

69
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,165
so I studied a lot on my own.

70
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,958
But there aren't
many books about it.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,585
Not many books?

72
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,462
You see, in school,
we're taught to always

73
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,465
look towards the future instead
of dwelling on the past.

74
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,591
How sad.

75
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,720
History's such an important
facet of a good education.

76
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,807
This whole thing feels
deliberate somehow.

77
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,476
Like something is
being covered up.

78
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,228
Anyway, let's get back on track,

79
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,064
after the cold war there's
a key turning point.

80
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,734
And that was World
War Three, in 1962.

81
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,152
[POLINA gasps]

82
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,738
World War Three?
That's can't be!

83
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,741
Because that was the year
of the Cuban Missile Crisis!

84
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,034
Never heard of it.

85
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,036
Same here, but there
used to be a country

86
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,913
called Cuba whose
base got bombed.

87
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,040
And from what I read,
that event became the trigger,

88
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,875
leading us to World War Three.

89
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,128
Hold on. My history
is different!

90
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,214
Cuba's base was never bombed‐‐
the whole war was averted!

91
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,049
That must be where
it branches off.

92
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,384
This is the juncture.

93
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:40,637
[POLINA] A war broke out after
the Cuban Missile Crisis?

94
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,391
I don't understand.
Dear God. Help us.

95
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,143
[KANATA]
God?

96
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,520
That's weird.
What does "God" mean?

97
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,356
[POLINA gasps]

98
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,817
[POLINA]
He doesn't know about God?

99
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,987
So, they don't have
countries or religions?

100
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:01,950
Please, tell me, what happened
after the third world war?

101
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:07,581
[ARIES] On October 27th,
1962, all‐out war began

102
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,667
between the USA and
the Soviet Union.

103
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,711
Nuclear missiles were
launched which affected

104
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,880
nearby countries,
plunging the world

105
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,632
into a full‐blown nuclear war.

106
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,968
The conflict only
lasted two months,

107
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,471
but half the world's
population was lost,

108
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,891
and our planet was reduced
to a barren wasteland.

109
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,226
The survivors regretted
what had happened

110
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:33,148
and vowed to strive for
a more harmonious way of life.

111
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,235
In 1963, the United World
Government was established,

112
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,322
which unified the planet's
remaining population.

113
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,034
A common language was adopted,
and guns were outlawed.

114
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,660
People set aside
their differences

115
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,164
and worked together to rebuild
society at a rapid pace.

116
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,124
That's how humanity
was finally able

117
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,710
to create a peaceful world.

118
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,171
[POLINA] Their history
is completely different.

119
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,049
How is this possible?
More importantly,

120
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,635
did these things even
really happen at all?

121
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,637
Okay, now it's
your turn, Polina.

122
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,806
Please tell us. About the war.

123
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,307
Is it true that
Earth really managed

124
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,184
to avoid World War Three?

125
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,937
[POLINA] Yes. And though
it was far from peaceful,

126
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,481
we avoided starting
a global war.

127
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,567
However, a far greater
threat emerged,

128
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:20,529
one that overshadowed
petty human conflicts.

129
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,657
In 2049, an asteroid
was discovered,

130
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,243
predicted to hit earth
within eight years.

131
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,828
[ALL]
An asteroid?

132
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,372
[POLINA] It was 300
kilometers in diameter,

133
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,541
and it would have annihilated
every living thing

134
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,084
on the planet upon impact.

135
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,794
[KANATA]
No way. Are you serious?

136
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,213
[LUCA] But the year 2057
has already passed!

137
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,007
And we weren't hit
by any asteroid!

138
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,094
Listen, we already know that
our histories are different.

139
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,429
So let's hear Polina out.

140
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,516
There was only one logical
solution to the problem.

141
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,102
We would have to immigrate
to a new planet.

142
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,604
All of humanity,
our plants and animals,

143
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,189
our historical relics...

144
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,024
Once we found a new home planet,

145
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,360
the idea was to
move everything there.

146
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,653
But that's so much!

147
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,406
You could never move an entire
planet's worth of people.

148
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,577
[POLINA] It's possible.
Thanks to artificial wormholes.

149
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,746
[KANATA]
Artificial what now?

150
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,914
[gasps]

151
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,252
No way.

152
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,879
Um, what's a wormhole?

153
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,256
It's a tunnel that passes
through time and space.

154
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,259
It allows for instantaneous
transport between two points,

155
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,720
though I had no idea
the technology existed.

156
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,388
[LUCA]
Wait, then maybe that's...

157
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,347
Oh, yes.

158
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,266
That thought had
actually crossed my mind

159
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,393
when you told me
about your story.

It's possible that
the "ball of death"

161
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,314

[STUDENTS gasp]

163

[POLINA] At the time
the wormhole technology

164
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,444
was being developed,
we were scrambling

165
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,487
to find a new habitable planet.

166
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,615
In fact, the <i>Arc</i>
series of spaceships

167
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,159
were built specifically
for that task.

168
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,119
This ship is probably
the <i>Arc Seven</i>,

169
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,871
which was never used.

170
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,290
You already know
the fate of the <i>Arc Six</i>.

171
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,417
Because that was our ship.

Do you have any idea what
happened after you left?

173
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,173
Did the exodus work?

174
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,176
Yes, it did. I'm sure of it.

175
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,385
It was successful.

So then what you're saying...

00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:14,601
Yes. The planet that was
chosen had to be Astra.

You and everyone else on Astra

logical conclusion.

183
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,112
We found a new planet.

184
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,907
And inevitably, the
asteroid struck Earth.

[QUITTERIE]
Did it survive?

[POLINA sighs] You said that
when the sphere swallowed you,

187
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,374
it spat you out into space

188
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,334
That there were
no signs of life.

Isn't that correct?

190

Over an ice planet?

[KANATA, CHARCE, ARIES gasp]

194
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,100
There would certainly have
been debris from the impact.

00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,019
Which blocked out the sun,
causing an ice age.

That would explain it.

The sphere of light was
a gate for the exodus.

Your ship, the <i>Arc Seven</i>,

was probably parked over
the terminal above Earth.

00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:09,322
It was most likely
knocked into free orbit

201
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,450
shortly after the
asteroid struck.

Oh, I see. All this time,

203
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,373
we've been traveling
from Earth to Astra.

It's 2063.

According to Polina's timeline,

208
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,263
the exodus was
completed in 2057.

That was only six years ago.

The planets may be similar,

be construction.

00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,019
And I'm the captain.

318
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,188
[gasps] Y‐Yes, I'd like that!

319
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,940
I'll introduce you to my mom!

320
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,817
Uh. Okay, cool.

321
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,902
Well, I think we've
covered this area!

322
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,238
I should go look in
the southern parts.

323
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,240
Why don't you go
meet up with everyone?

324
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,074
They're in the forest.

325
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,242
[ARIES]
Sure, sounds good!

326
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,286
I'll heat up with everyone
for a good rest.

327
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,747
[KANATA] That's definitely
not what I said.

328
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,755
[KANATA]
Things are going well.

329
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,632
The odds of making it
back are pretty good.

330
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,259
I'm worried about
the enemy among us,

331
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,637
but now we all share a bond
that's deeper than friendship.

332
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,182
I'm sure they value
that, as well.

333
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,601
There haven't been
any attacks in a while.

334
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,727
Nobody's trying to figure out

335
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,314
who the traitor is
because of that bond.

336
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,441
I don't have to worry about it.

337
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,860
It's gonna work out and
we're all gonna get home.

338
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,363
I doubt that person's
our enemy anymore.

339
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,618
[gasps]

340
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,246
[KANATA]
The sphere!

341
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,379
[KANATA]
Dammit!

342
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,881
I didn't think it would
follow me into the cave!

343
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,222
[KANATA]
Aries!

344
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,557
Kanata? What's the matter?

345
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,642
Why are you running?

346
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,727
[KANATA]
Aries! It's the death ball!

347
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,229
Are you sure?

348
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,360
It vanished.

349
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,154
Hey, what's going on?
Are you okay?

350
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,199
Let's return to the ship.

351
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:15,164
[KANATA] The enemy intends
to kill us all on this planet.

352
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:19,669
My gut says they'll use
the Astra and go home alone.

353
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,422
I've figured out
who the enemy is.

354
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,758
I don't think they know
that I've caught on yet.

355
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,678
I'll have to make
my move tomorrow.

356
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,471
It's going down.

357
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,603
Guys. Listen.

358
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,647
I need to talk to you alone.

359
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,608
Yesterday, I was attacked
by the death ball.

360
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,735
‐‐[ZACK gasps]
‐‐[CHARCE] You're kidding me!

361
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,029
That means it's the enemy.

362
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,575
[KANATA] Yes. They're
trying to kill us here.

363
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,703
But I'm going to take them
down before they can hurt us.

364
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,704
Do you know who it is?

365
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,289
Please tell us.

366
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,174
It's Ulgar? Are you sure?

367
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,550
Really? He's the one?

368
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,219
It's true. I don't have proof.

369
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,805
So I'm going to need your help
to lure him out of hiding.

370
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,807
Just hold on. Why is it Ulgar?

371
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,517
I can't explain everything.

372
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,563
But for right now...
Just hear me out.

373
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,398
Remember the first day of camp?

374
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,485
When we were all
swallowed by the orb?

375
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,278
If the "exit" for
that thing was used

376
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,030
for the exodus, then why
was the "entrance"

377
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,074
on a different planet?
Like why McPa?

378
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,744
Or even Vilavurs
for that matter.

379
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,830
It must be a portable wormhole
that someone could carry.

380
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,748
[KANATA]
That's right.

381
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,249
Assuming that is true,

382
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,668
why would he resume
the killing spree now?

383
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,087
Doesn't he want to get
back to Astra, too?

384
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,881
He only worked with us
because it improved

385
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,466
his chances of survival.

386
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,968
But now we're only one
stop away from home.

387
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,470
Now he can finish his mission

388
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,764
and escape without
the rest of us.

389
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,641
[ZACK] Can't we just
lock Ulgar in the brig?

390
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,601
That would be safer, right?

391
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,019
[KANATA]
It won't be that simple.

392
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,647
He has two powerful weapons.

393
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,564
The gun.

394
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,690
And the sphere.

395
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,859
Do you have a plan, then?

396
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,278
I tried to guess his actions.

397
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,697
He came after me
when I was alone.

398
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,990
Probably thought
it was too risky

399
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,992
to go after all of us together.

400
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,619
That's how we'll win.

401
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,453
So then?

402
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,872
I thought Charce could
go forage with Ulgar.

403
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,124
You want me to be
the bait? Come on.

404
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,960
Please, just listen.

405
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,631
[KANATA]
Zack and I will tail you.

406
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,342
So try to go somewhere
that's easy for us to hide.

407
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,262
Like that cave in the south
where I was yesterday.

408
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,930
We'll adjust the helmet comms.

409
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,807
That way the three
of us can talk.

410
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,849
We can take our positions

411
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,143
while you lure Ulgar
into the cave.

412
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,437
Eventually, he should
bring out the wormhole.

413
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,189
That's when we'll
strike from behind.

414
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,816
You really think
it'll be that simple?

415
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,359
We have a good chance.

416
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,697
He thinks he can surprise us,
but we already know his game.

417
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,990
You just need to be on guard

418
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,200
for the moment he
brings out the orb.

419
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,661
Something else to note:
he's tried to attack us

420
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,497
with the sphere three
times now and failed.

421
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,332
He might try to use
the gun this time

422
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,293
to make sure he succeeds.

423
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,921
But I made a few alterations,
so it won't be able to fire.

424
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,006
[CHARCE]
I see.

425
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,674
He'll be vulnerable while
trying to figure out

426
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,843
why the gun is malfunctioning.

427
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,885
[KANATA]
Can you handle it?

428
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,971
[CHARCE]
I trust you, Captain.

429
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,973
We've entered the cave.

430
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,766
[KANATA]
Go straight down the path.

431
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,811
You can use the fluorescent
plants to guide the way.

432
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,313
[ZACK]
We just got here.

433
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,481
[KANATA] Try to keep some
distance from Ulgar.

434
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,108
Don't get too close.

435
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,578
There's a chamber.

436
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,705
I'll pretend to search
the area for food.

437
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,206
Wish me luck.

438
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,458
[KANATA]
Wait, Charce, abort!

439
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,168
[gasps] What's wrong?

440
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,377
[KANATA]
It's an emergency!

441
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,547
I just got a call from
Quitterie. Funi's missing!

442
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,798
That's terrible!

443
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,133
[KANATA]
Return to the ship.

444
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,302
Zack and I are leaving
now to go look for her!

445
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,470
[CHARCE]
Got it.

446
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:09,982
[gasps]

447
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,610
[gasps]

448
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,952
[ULGAR gasps]

449
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,412
[CHARCE gasps]

450
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,749
[KANATA]
Turn off the wormhole.

451
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,294
So you were the enemy
the whole time.

452
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,962
Huh, Charce?

453
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,013
[KANATA] Is this what
controls the sphere?

454
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,933
What's going on here?
How dare you!

455
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,060
You tell me what's going on.

456
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,937
I saw you bring
out the wormhole.

457
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:51,148
I took the control. Now what?

458
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,525
Explain yourself!

459
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,110
[gun clicks]

460
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,612
PS, nobody tampered
with this gun.

461
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,072
It shoots fine.

462
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:58,906
[gasps]

463
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,200
[ZACK]
We were all working together.

464
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,082
[CHARCE] So, it was an
elaborate act. To trap me.

465
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,335
Rather, to trap your
would‐be enemy.

466
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,962
[KANATA]
Exactly.

467
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,968
[CHARCE] Well, it would
appear I was the only one

468
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,928
who didn't know
about the charade.

469
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,638
That's quite unfortunate.

470
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,974
Look, I'm really sorry, Charce.

471
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:28,060
For what it's worth,
I still believe in you!

472
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,562
Be honest with us.

473
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,480
This was all a mistake, right?

474
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,983
Say it was!

475
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,235
How'd you know I was the enemy?

476
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,611
Charce, no!

477
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:42,158
I was thinking about the time
we all ran away on Planet McPa.

478
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,744
If the enemy was sent
to kill all of us,

479
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,996
then they would need to
see it through to the end.

480
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,541
Meaning, the killer was whoever
entered the wormhole last.

481
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,710
Hah. That's all you have?

482
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,171
You really think, in that
confusion, you could identify

483
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,591
the last person
swallowed by the sphere?

484
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,051
Did I miss the part
where you filmed it?

485
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,470
[gasps]

486
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,846
Ah, I see.

487
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:07,433
Yeah. Aries remembered.

488
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,063
Okay, then.

489
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,441
And just what were you going
to do if you were wrong?

490
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,944
Please, Charce!
Say that it wasn't you!

491
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,946
I'm out of excuses, Aries.

492
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,531
Anything is fine!

493
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,867
I refuse to believe
you'd hurt us!

494
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,661
Because... no one
here's the enemy!

495
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,831
We're all friends, aren't we?

496
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:34,752
You were always so kind to me
and everyone else on board.

497
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,005
You knew about biology,
and you even cooked for us.

498
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:41,175
You were always
so supportive, Charce!

499
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,636
And I know that, if we
didn't have you with us,

500
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,305
we'd never have
made it this far!

501
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,974
So... tell me I'm wrong.

502
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,021
[CHARCE]
I'm sorry. But I had a mission.

503
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:54,855
[ARIES gasps]

504
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,774
Is it because we're all clones?

505
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,443
Did one of the originals
order you to exterminate us?

506
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,611
Tell me.

507
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,823
Yes. It's just as you suspected.

508
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,659
This entire trip was
nothing but a cover up.

509
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,245
To hide the crimes of cloning.

510
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,414
It was supposed to
be a simple mission.

511
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,043
Push the button on McPa
and send everyone to space.

512
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,212
I would die alongside you.

513
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,130
But then you went and
activated the wormhole

514
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,550
too early into the trip.

515
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,802
We were still wearing
our crust suits,

516
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,429
so we were able to
activate our helmets.

517
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,641
[CHARCE] Yes, you're right.
It was selfish.

518
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,520
But I wanted to do it while
I still had my suit on.

519
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:38,899
I wanted to die while
gazing into space.

520
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,234
‐‐How sad.
‐‐[ARIES whimpers]

521
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,444
But then we came upon the ship.

522
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,447
Not exactly part of
your plan, was it?

523
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,993
[CHARCE] No. After we found
the ship, and rescued Aries,

524
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,911
I pretended to investigate
the communicator

525
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,997
and disabled it.

526
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,291
I couldn't have
you contacting home.

527
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,542
Once I was done though,

528
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,586
I decided it would be best
to work with everyone

529
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,964
to get to the last planet.

530
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,884
And that's how we
got to this moment.

531
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,469
I'm quite impressed. I mean it.

532
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,179
You've surprised me.

533
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,764
I never expected
that working together

534
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,933
would yield such great results.

535
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,560
Astounding. Truly.

536
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,313
[ULGAR] Shut up! You
don't get to compliment

537
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,398
the people you intended to kill!

538
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,026
Come on. Tell us everything.

539
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,904
Why did you have to be the
one to complete this mission?

540
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,324
Why did it matter so much that
you'd be willing to die for it?

541
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,035
Because that's unacceptable!

542
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,121
Talk to us. Tell us who you are.

543
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,545
[CHARCE]
The truth is I'm a clone.

544
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,214
But, the difference
between you and me

545
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,384
is that I've always
known that about myself.

546
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,219
The name of my original...

547
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,888
...is Noah Vix.

548
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,601
He's the ruler of Vixia.
I am the king's clone.
