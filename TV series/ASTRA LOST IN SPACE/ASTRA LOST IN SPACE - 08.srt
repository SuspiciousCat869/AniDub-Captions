[gasps]

2
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,940
[KANATA]
A woman?

[retches]

4
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,784
[KANATA]
Whoa! Are you okay!

5
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,579
Hey! She's pretty weak.
Call Quitterie!

6
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,039
[ZACK]
Aye‐yeah!

7
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,708
[KANATA] Ulgar. Go get
the anti‐gravity cart.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,793
Let's take her back.

9
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,962
‐‐[ULGAR] Right.
‐‐[POLINA] Is this a dream?

10
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,339
‐‐Hey, can you hear me?
‐‐[POLINA] Is this a dream?

11
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,341
Who are all of you?

12
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,593
And what happened to me?

13
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,596
[KANATA] You've been asleep
inside the hibernation pod.

14
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,224
Yes, sleeping... in the pod.

15
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,351
You did well.

16
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:05,148
[sobs]

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,902
[POLINA]
Help. Help actually came.

18
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,737
Now I can go back.

19
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,574
Home. To Earth.

20
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,207
[POLINA]
Um. Thank you.

21
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,918
I really appreciate what
you've done for me.

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,004
Sorry if I'm a bit disoriented.

23
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,131
Hey, we understand completely!

24
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,383
Try not to push
yourself too much.

25
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,761
I'm concerned about your
memory being affected.

26
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,264
Can you remember who you are?

27
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,808
Yes. My memory's fine.

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,061
My name is Polina Livinskaya.

29
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,188
And I am an astronaut.

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,983
I was a crew member
on board of the <i>Ark Six</i>.

31
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,912
[POLINA]
Originally, we were headed

32
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,622
to a different planet,

33
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,542
but we had to make an
unexpected emergency landing

34
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:33,338
here due to ship malfunctions
and a faulty communicator.

35
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,341
We were attacked by plants

36
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,302
and crash‐landed
under that cliff.

37
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,514
My fellow crew members
left to explore

38
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,641
and never returned.

39
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,436
I was stuck here all by myself.

40
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,938
But I had no idea how
to survive on my own.

41
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,566
So, I entered the
hibernation device

42
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,026
and waited for help to arrive.

43
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,820
[KANATA]
I was wondering.

44
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:00,282
Why were you out here?
Were you guys on a mission?

45
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:04,077
[POLINA]
Uh... Let's see.

46
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,954
[sighs] I'm sorry.

47
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,664
The details are
still a bit fuzzy,

48
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,499
but I'm trying to remember.

49
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,543
It's like a bad hangover.

50
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,669
It's fine!

51
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,296
Just take your time,
there's no rush.

52
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,923
Polina is so mature,
it's such a nice change!

53
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,925
[QUITTERIE]
Well, excuse me.

54
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,344
Wait, hold on. I know.

55
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,096
We were investigating.

56
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,015
Our mission was to find
planets suitable

57
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,142
for human habitation.

58
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,685
You're on an <i>Ark</i> ship as well,

59
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,062
so is that why
you're out here, too?

60
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,399
Uh, not exactly.

61
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,235
I don't know if you could call
what we're doing a mission.

62
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,779
We sort of found this ship.

63
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,654
[POLINA]
You what?

64
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,532
Wh‐Whoa. Come again?
You found it?

65
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,075
Oh, yeah, sorry.

66
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,535
Makes it sound like
we found a bike

67
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,037
in an empty lot, huh?

68
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,206
It's true though,
we really did find it.

69
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,499
[POLINA]
Where?

70
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,917
Up in space.

71
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,251
[POLINA]
I'm sorry, space?

72
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,294
[QUITTERIE]
Can you guys not?!

73
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:55,670
You're gonna confuse
the poor woman

74
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,798
if you dump all the
details on her at once.

75
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,549
[LUCA] Does that mean you
don't want us to tell her

76
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,593
about camp and how
some giant ball of death

77
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,387
transported us over 5,000
light years away from home?

78
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,765
[POLINA]
Wait. A what did what now?

79
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,811
[KANATA] Dude, she said
<i>don't</i> dump details on her!

80
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,854
[laughs]

81
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,315
I haven't laughed in forever.

82
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,193
[POLINA]
I'm so happy.

83
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:23,240
I had given up hope, but now
I really do get to go home.

84
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,244
[KANATA]
Polina.

85
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,414
There's something we
should probably tell you.

86
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,875
Turns out our
ship's broken, too.

87
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,335
We're also stranded here.

88
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,878
[POLINA gasps]

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,213
[LUCA]
We were on our way back home,

90
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,466
and we stopped here to resupply.

91
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,759
But then, as we were
trying to land,

92
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,470
our ship was attacked,
and we crash‐landed.

93
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,474
Our reactors are now broken,
so space flight's impossible.

94
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,435
[POLINA]
That... can't be!

95
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,898
‐‐[ZACK, KANATA gasps]
‐‐Polina, what's wrong?

96
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,149
Let me see!

97
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,905
[QUITTERIE]
She's okay. She's just asleep.

98
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,115
That makes sense.

99
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,075
She was unconscious
for 12 years.

100
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,160
And this was a whole lot
of stuff to take in.

101
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,830
Still, it's a miracle
we found her.

102
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,707
I mean, think of how
big this planet is‐‐

103
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,584
what're the odds
we'd crash by her?

104
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,627
[ZACK]
Not bad, actually.

105
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,046
The central belt of this
planet is the only part

106
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,757
with conditions fit
for living creatures.

107
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,343
The <i>Ark Six</i> flew into this
area for the same reason

108
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,555
we did and was also met
with ferocious wildlife.

109
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,057
The fact that our two ships
crashed close together,

110
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,059
isn't that improbable.

111
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,019
Yeah?

112
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,314
So we've got two, identical,
broken ships that can't fly.

113
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,816
Why don't we just call
them coffins instead?

114
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,319
[QUITTERIE] Why do you have
to be so emo all the time?

115
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,029
[LUCA] He's only doing
it for attention.

116
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,072
[ULGAR]
Shut up!

117
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,950
[ARIES]
Hey. If it's okay with you,

118
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,243
could I have your snack?

119
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,537
[ZACK gasps]
What? Are you serious?

120
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,414
What an incredibly
greedy request, Aries!

121
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,626
No, no, I promise I'm not
gonna eat it or anything!

122
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,255
So, the <i>Astra</i> can split into
different sections, right?

123
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,632
Yes.

124
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,967
In the case of a
catastrophic emergency,

125
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,094
it can decouple
into separate blocks.

126
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,014
This is typically reserved
for hull breaches.

127
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,807
[ARIES]
Polina's <i>Ark Six</i> was damaged

128
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,561
in the central residential
block, but the reactor is fine.

129
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,688
Meanwhile, our
reactor is broken.

130
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,608
But our residential areas
are in tip‐top shape.

131
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,901
So I was thinking...

132
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,403
What if we take this,
and move it over here?

133
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,447
‐‐Oh! That could work!
‐‐[KANATA gasps]

134
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,867
We can connect the
functional sections together!

135
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,619
[STUDENTS]
And fix it!

136
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,897
Yo, Zack! How's it look?

137
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,691
[ZACK]
We've managed to connect.

138
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,275
This might actually work.

139
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,445
[KANATA]
Awesome! We're going home.

140
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,615
Indeed. I'm glad.

141
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:15,453
Honestly, I was upset with
myself for crashing our ship.

142
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,872
I suppose it was just
one more hurdle,

143
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,416
but now that there's hope,

144
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,210
this trip doesn't
seem so terrible.

145
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,337
[KANATA]
When we get home,

146
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,340
I'm going to work hard
to get my own ship.

147
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,176
Then it's back to the unknown.

148
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,554
You said you'd
be my pilot, right?

149
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,140
[ZACK] If you get your
own ship, then sure.

150
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,392
How many years do you think
it's going to take you?

151
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,853
[KANATA]
Hmm. Seven, maybe?

152
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,730
[ZACK] There's absolutely
no way you'll have

153
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,483
your own ship at 24!
Be realistic for once.

154
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,655
Good. That's great news.

155
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,408
So the ship's blocks
connected with no problems?

156
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,077
[YUNHUA]
Yes! It's such a huge relief.

157
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,163
I suppose in a weird way,
I've gotten used

158
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,082
to being lost in space,
but it'll be really nice

159
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,084
to go back to a peaceful life.

160
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:07,255
Peaceful. That sounds nice.

161
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,383
Oh. I can't believe I
almost forgot to ask.

162
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,803
Tell me, what year
is it currently?

163
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,098
Well, it's September
of 2063 CE.

164
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,851
You were sleeping in
that pod for 12 years.

165
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,686
For that long?

166
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,482
[POLINA gasps]

167
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,275
Wait, can you repeat that?

168
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,360
Did you say it was 2063?

169
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,862
Uh. Yes, that's right.

170
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,574
What does that mean?
Did anything happen?

171
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,702
[YUNHUA]
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,331
[gasps]

173
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,375
So then. Nothing happened?

174
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,048
Um, is something
the matter, Polina?

175
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,342
[POLINA]
It's nothing. Forget it.

176
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,553
Guess I'm still just
a little bit confused.

177
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,767
[YUNHUA]
I'll let you rest for a while.

178
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,560
Right, thank you.

179
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,610
Dear lord...

180
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,743
[KANATA]
All right!

181
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,621
Thanks to the efforts of the
<i>Astra</i>'s pilot, Zack Walker,

182
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,957
and our new friend, Polina,

183
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,459
the ship's officially
back in action!

184
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,628
[ALL]
Yay!

185
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,297
Wow. It actually worked.

186
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,675
I know. To be honest,
I wasn't sure

187
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,176
we'd make it past this barrier.

188
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,011
[KANATA]
Yeah well, I never gave up hope!

189
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,805
Survival tip number five,
when you decide

190
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,141
to give up, then it's
game over, man!

191
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:44,686
[LUCA] Pretty sure you gave up
right after we crashed.

192
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,314
[POLINA] They're only children,
but they've made it so far.

193
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,568
I'm sure a lot of it has to do
with how skilled they are

194
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,487
and their unwavering positivity.

195
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,532
I have an important update.

196
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,910
It's about the plant life.
It's quite interesting.

197
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,370
The plants here seem
to have an organ

198
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,455
similar to an animal's heart.

199
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,959
Some of them can even
move around, though slowly.

200
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,712
So is it like, basically
an animal, then?

201
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,339
[LUCA laughs]
Sounds kinda like me, huh?

202
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,300
Doesn't mind blurring
the lines a bit.

203
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,427
Could be male or female,
animal or plant,

204
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,305
sci‐fi thriller,
gag anime, who knows?

205
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,973
[KANATA]
What was that last part?

206
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:22,849
So, anyway.

207
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,017
[LUCA]
He ignored me?!

208
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,060
I was able to confirm
that several of the smaller

209
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,855
moving fauna, though
dangerous, are still edible.

210
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,024
There's a trick
to countering them.

211
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,817
It involves this.

212
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,741
[shrieks] Ew!

213
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,583
[grunts]

214
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,668
[QUITTERIE screams]

215
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,921
I see, if we block
their photosynthesis,

216
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,964
these plants are unable to move.

217
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,800
Interesting. Just as
Charce predicted.

218
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,427
I'll hunt these
larger specimens.

219
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,055
Why don't you collect
the harmless ones?

220
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,098
Fine.

221
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,852
[ZACK] After a little break.
Here, have some tea.

222
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,065
I brought you some
biscuits, as well.

223
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,858
Everyone's working so hard.

224
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,444
We want to leave
as soon as possible.

225
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,239
We just have to
keep pushing forward.

226
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,325
[QUITTERIE sighs]
Yeah.

227
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,577
Remember how the
other day you said

228
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,371
you wanted to live together?

229
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,499
Because I certainly do.

230
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,794
What did you mean by all that?

231
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,711
Huh?

232
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,837
[yelps]

233
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,756
Exactly what I said.

234
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,132
If the <i>Astra</i> couldn't fly,

235
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,635
then we'd all have to live
on this planet together.

236
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,389
You're such an insensitive,
dumb, genius! Hmph!

237
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,977
[QUITTERIE]
Not that it's a huge surprise,

238
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,979
but I'm glad the ship's fixed.

239
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,147
If we had to stay here,
I'd have to give up

240
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,024
on my dreams and aspirations.

241
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:59,279
Your aspirations? You
mean to be a doctor?

242
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,948
That's not the only one I have.

243
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,283
How about you?

244
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,785
Don't you wanna join
your dad in his research?

245
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,662
He's super famous, right?

246
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,290
Didn't he discover
something groundbreaking?

247
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,791
Yes, almost.

248
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,168
He's researching
memory transplants.

249
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,754
There's a problem
he hasn't solved yet.

250
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,047
Sometimes I get the feeling

251
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,174
you don't like your
father that much.

252
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,718
He's kinda like my mom.

253
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,512
A single parent, always busy.

254
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,473
While he never has
time for his son.

255
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,559
It's not as if that bothers me.

256
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,105
I actually quite prefer
being alone. However...

257
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,401
[JED]
A portrait! For me?

258
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,611
Did you draw this in school?

259
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,131
[ZACK] Some parents don't
like their children.

260
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,842
It's not the end of the world.

261
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:07,013
But... his eyes were
dry and emotionless,

262
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,681
like glass marbles.

263
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,351
It was as though he
were looking at a doll.

264
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,855
[ZACK]
His research changed him.

265
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,358
I don't want to
end up like that.

266
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,028
So, I would like to specialize
in space science instead.

267
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,113
I want to study,
go back into space,

268
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:28,618
and see things no one's
ever seen before.

269
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,412
And, I already have
a captain in mind.

270
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,165
I promised Kanata
that I'd be his pilot.

271
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,584
I suppose that's my dream.

272
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,421
[QUITTERIE]
You boys are so lucky.

273
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,216
You guys just plow
forward, no matter what.

274
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,344
Maybe one day, my real
dream will come true.

275
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,178
[ZACK]
What is it?

276
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,763
I think you should
pursue it, Quitterie.

277
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,264
[QUITTERIE]
Forget about it.

278
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,226
[ZACK] Becoming a doctor is
what your mom wanted for you.

279
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,520
If your dream is different,
I'll support it.

280
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,314
Survival tip number five,
when you decide to give up,

281
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,525
then it's game over, man.

282
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,819
I'm saying it's
impossible, you dumb oaf!

283
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,154
You have no idea
how I feel, do you?

284
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,948
Probably not, 'cause
you're too freakin' busy

285
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,533
talking about yourself!

286
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,702
My dream won't ever come true!

287
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:18,167
Because my real dream is to
become your wife one day!

288
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,544
Huh?

289
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,132
[QUITTERIE]
This again?!

290
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,260
I assumed... we'd marry one day.

291
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:31,180
[QUITTERIE]
What?! But you and me?

292
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,808
Wait a sec! What are you
even trying to say right now?

293
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,143
‐‐[ZACK] Well‐‐
‐‐Are you dumb?

294
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,061
‐‐No?
‐‐Are you going insane?

295
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,980
[ZACK] I thought we
already made a promise

296
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,357
in May of 2052.

297
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,817
[gasps]

298
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,986
Marry me one day?

299
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,029
Sure. Okay.

300
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,701
[QUITTERIE] But... we were
just little kids back then.

301
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,871
Most people wouldn't take
that kinda talk seriously!

302
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,372
Is that so?

303
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,374
I've always been in love
with you, though.

304
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,460
[QUITTERIE gasps]
I've had enough!

305
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,919
You don't get to
criticize your dad's

306
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:06,632
emotionless eyes
ever again, you jerk!

307
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,759
[ARIES]
Team B5, camp log:

308
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,262
Today marked a
momentous occasion.

309
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,681
Zack and Quitterie got engaged!

310
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,148
[POLINA]
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,484
I'm sure that you'd prefer
to get going right away

312
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,902
now that we're ready.

313
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,988
It's really selfish of me
to make a request like this.

314
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,448
Hey, don't worry about it.

315
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,741
Besides, there's not any harm

316
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,243
in checking the place
out before we leave.

317
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,788
[POLINA] It was the last place
my crew sent a signal from.

318
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,542
I knew the location, but
couldn't bring myself to visit.

319
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,003
It was a wise decision,
and for the best.

320
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,546
Going to a place
like that unarmed

321
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,840
would likely end in death.

322
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,384
That thought did cross
my mind at one point.

323
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,513
Honestly, a part of me
wanted to join them,

324
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,932
but I couldn't.

325

[KANATA] You decided to live
by going into hibernation.

I respect you for that.

327

[KANATA]
We'll let your crew know

328
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,695
that you're leaving
this place alive.

329

Are you sure that
we're in the right spot?

330
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,413
This place is like
a barren wasteland.

331
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,165
If Polina's information
is correct,

332
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,459

the right area.

the rover was flipped over.

the rover had been flipped.

we were finally able to
leave Planet Icriss behind.

is still fresh for Polina.

[QUITTERIE]
Hm...

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,549
What, is something
wrong, Quitterie?

421
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,384
Oh, sorry, I was thinking.

422
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,011
About what, exactly?

423
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,972
It's not a huge deal,
but when we donated blood

424
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,266
for Polina, I decided
it'd be best to check

425
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,893
everyone's blood type.

426
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,603
And that's when I
noticed that Funi and I

427
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,813
have the same kind.

428
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,439
Yay, that's so cool!

429
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,609
I dunno, don't a lot of people
have the same blood type?

430
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,821
[QUITTERIE] There's more to it
than just the ABO system.

431
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,156
There's also the MN and P types.

432
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,367
It's pretty close to
impossible for two people

433
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,160
to have an exact match.

434
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,995

I don't understand.

435
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,872
The two of you
are sisters, right?

436
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,124
[QUITTERIE]
We aren't blood related.

437
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,001
Our mothers were best friends.

438
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,671
When Funi's mom passed
away, we adopted her.

439
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,089
Oh, I see.

440
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,259
It's just that I was certain
you were biological sisters.

441
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,429
After all, you look identical.

442
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,640
You know, Polina makes
a pretty good point.

443
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,141
Have you ever considered
that the two of you

444
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,060
might actually be sisters?

445
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:36,021
I wouldn't be surprised
if it were true.

446
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,523
Mom is totally
the kind of person

447
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,317
who would have a child in
secret and hide her away.

448
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,735
[ZACK]
We could always find out.

449
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,070
If you want definite answers,

450
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,240
the ship's computer is
capable of analyzing DNA.

451
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,325
Interesting.

452
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,871
Okay. I'm all in,
let's investigate it!

453
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:55,332
[KANATA] Ooh! DNA tests!
This is getting exciting!

454
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,334
What would I even do?

455
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,797
Like, if it turns out that
Funi is my real sister?

456
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,091
I'd love her too much.

457
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,057
[ZACK]
Hm...

458
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,478
What does this mean?
It should be impossible.

459
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,650
Unless... No way.
Is that the reason?

460
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,991
[KANATA]
Why are you telling me?

461
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,075
[ZACK]
Because I thought you should be

462
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,411
the first to know the results.

463
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,787
[KANATA]
I mean, the results should be

464
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,832
for Quitterie and Funi,
but fire away.

465
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:41,295
I looked into it and they
do have a relationship.

466
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,422
But they're aren't sisters.

467
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,136
[ZACK]
They're the same person.
