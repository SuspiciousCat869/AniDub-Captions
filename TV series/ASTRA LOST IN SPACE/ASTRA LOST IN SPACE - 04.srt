Team B5 camp log.

2
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,269
We've reached the next
leg of our journey.

3
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,979
We managed to avoid
a crash landing

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,148
and have arrived safely
on Planet Shummoor,

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,734
the second planet of our trip.

[QUITTERIE humming]

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,989
[ARIES]
I'm so excited. I feel dizzy!

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,243
[QUITTERIE humming]

9
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,547
Whoa, listen, Zack, I get it!

10
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,965
And I understand how you feel!

11
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,885
But I've gotta be honest,
your timing sucks like big time!

12
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:55,305
[ZACK] Sorry. I failed to
notice the "in use" sign.

13
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,768
[ZACK]
Hurry up and get dressed.

14
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,852
We'll be landing shortly.

15
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,812
[QUITTERIE grumbles]

16
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,855
[screams]

17
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,816
[BEEGO]
Aye, yeah, guys!

18
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,609
Right? I grabbed
the cable, said,

19
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,403
"Aye, yeah" and saved the day!

20
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,571
[QUITTERIE]
How can you be so calm

21
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,989
after seeing a girl naked?

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,490
[ZACK]
I've seen you naked before.

23
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,576
As kids! I have curves now, duh!

24
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,618
I was wondering.

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,870
What's "aye yeah"
supposed to mean?

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:19,997
[BEEGO]
Are you for real?

27
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,916
You gotta check out my
anime someday, Mister Luca!

28
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,001
[FUNICIA]
It's what Beego says when

29
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,669
he's receiving instructions!

30
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,213
‐‐Oh? That sounds cute.
‐‐[FUNICIA] Mm‐hm!

31
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,132
Maybe we should all say that.

32
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,384
Plus, it feels super
weird to be so formal

33
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,760
to Captain Obvious.

34
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:37,055
‐‐[KANATA] Excuse me?!
‐‐[ARIES, LUCA, FUNICIA laugh]

35
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,558
We're lucky. I'm
surprised we made it.

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,352
I thought for sure
we were all done for.

37
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,645
[LUCA]
Yeah, same.

38
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,480
For a minute there,
I figured the murderer

39
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,233
was behind everything.

40
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,069
But, everyone's still
here and alive.

41
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,947
[ARIES]
So, um.

42
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,158
I've been giving this
some thought, and you know,

43
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,410
if there is an enemy
hiding among us,

44
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,412
I'm positive that person
is doing their best

45
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,539
to try and survive
right now, too.

46
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,707
In that case,

47
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,335
it might be better to
continue working together.

48
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,462
And quite honestly,
we're going to need

49
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,255
everyone's help to survive.

50
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,341
What's your opinion, Captain?

51
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,843
[KANATA]
Same as before.

52
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:18,013
The truth is, we just
don't know, right?

53
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,140
The worst thing we can
do is doubt one another;

54
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,059
it would tear our team apart.

55
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,520
Once we lose control,
it's over, for real.

56
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,315
I forbid anyone to
look for the culprit.

57
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,566
Is that clear?

58
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,110
[ALL]
Aye, yeah!

59
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,490
[KANATA]
To the enemy that's hiding here,

60
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,117
I say, do your worst!

61
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,994
But seriously, which
one of you is it?

62
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:44,122
[LUCA] You literally just
said not to look for them.

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,673
[LUCA] I wonder what
0.85 G gravity is like.

64
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,634
[ZACK] It might be noticeable,
but only slightly.

65
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,094
Nothing too disorienting.

66
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,639
[KANATA] Oh, please. I read
about this in a manga.

67
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,767
Just one small jump and you
should go flying in the air!

68
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,644
Aw, man, I can't wait to try it!

69
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,688
Right, First step
on Planet Shummoor!

70
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,940
Let's go!

71
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:10,857
Ah...

72
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,360
[LUCA]
The planet's eating Kanata!

73
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,071
[CHARCE] Parts of the ground
seem to be soft and fluffy.

74
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,698
Almost like moss.

75
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,615
[QUITTERIE]
That's what you get for

76
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,367
leaping before you think. Idiot.

77
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,785
[KANATA]
I did that on purpose!

78
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,413
A spectacular gag for
a spectacular landing!

79
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,207
[LUCA] Okay, great.
We've definitely landed.

80
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,418
But this planet
seems kinda barren.

81
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,586
Look, there'd better
be some food here.

82
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,922
There's no way I'm eating,
like, moss or whatever.

83
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,216
My intel said this
planet has food.

84
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,177
But actually finding it
is the real issue here.

85
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,263
Well, that sucks hard.

86
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,015
[KANATA]
No.

87
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,351
The captain doesn't
get to say things suck.

88
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,687
I think we should
try and enjoy this.

89
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,980
We may be lost in space,

90
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,441
but that doesn't mean we
can't make the most of it!

91
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,402
Most unique Planet
Camp ever, right?

92
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,862
Let's go explore!

93
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,239
[STUDENTS]
Aye, yeah!

94
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,952
[LUCA]
You think that's edible?

95
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,247
Looks kinda like a wild flower.

96
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,958
And it's got a really
cool glow to it.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,585
[ZACK]
Let's check it.

98
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,919
[FUNICIA]
Yummy!

99
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,546
[ARIES]
Aw, that was so cute!

100
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,673
[LUCA] Wait, was that
Funi's voice just now?

101
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,592
[ZACK]
Yes. I wanted to improve it.

102
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,844
[KANATA]
Great use of your time.

103
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,222
You sure it's okay to eat?

104
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,974
It said, "Yummy."
Or didn't you hear?

105
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,226
That doesn't have taste buds!

106
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,772
[screams]

107
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,273
[LUCA]
A‐Are you okay?

108
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,524
[KANATA]
Delicious!

109
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,525
[LUCA]
What?

110
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,068
[KANATA] It's like the
tastiest things in the world

111
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,779
got together and
had a food baby!

112
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,907
C'mon, you've gotta
be exaggerating.

113
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,326
[LUCA]
He's not!

114
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,912
[KANATA] I'm naming these
guys "Candy Flowers."

115
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,038
Let's grab as much as we can

116
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,623
and take 'em back
to the others.

117
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,667
[ARIES muffled] 'Kay! I can't
believe how delicious they are!

118
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,586
[KANATA] Talk or chew,
Aries, pick one!

119
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,797
[LUCA] Now sit down, Zack.
Come eat with us.

120
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,256
[ZACK]
Gee, thanks, "Mom"

121
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,760
[sighs] Okay. Let's hurry.

122
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,179
Uh‐‐ [gasps]

123
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,639
Check it out, guys!

124
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,848
[ARIES, LUCA gasp]

125
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,309
[LUCA]
Cool satellite!

126
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,269
It's beautiful.

127
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,106
I don't think I've ever seen
anything this incredible before.

128
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,985
[ARIES]
Space is amazing!

129
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,910
[CHARCE]
Aha! My suspicions were correct!

130
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,162
This cactus‐like plant
is full of water!

131
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,831
[BEEGO] Ta‐dah, and just
like that, we've managed

132
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,499
to solve our water problem!

133
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,959
Yeah, it's real promissing.

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,960
We should gather up a few

135
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,087
and bring them back
to the <i>Astra</i>.

136
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,256
[BEEGO]
But how are we gonna carry 'em?

137
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,841
[CHARCE] I suppose we
could always go and get

138
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,092
the anti‐gravity carts.

139
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,052
[ULGAR]
Hey, ogre chick.

140
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,429
We don't even know if any
of those will keep well.

141
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,266
Don't bother getting too
many of the same type.

142
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:53,436
Man, you really are useless.

143
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,565
[YUN‐HUA]
I know that.

144
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,150
Believe me, I know.

145
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,486
[QUITTERIE] Look! There's like,
a ton of different vegetables

146
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,821
growing around here!

147
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,281
Yes, they seem to
grow the thickest

148
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,409
around these pole‐shaped trees.

149
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,952
[FUNICIA]
It's kinda stinky.

150
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,203
[BEEGO]
Something reeks!

151
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,455
It's not me, I just showered!

152
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,000
She's right, there's an odor.

153
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,126
Hey, look!

154
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,961
A carcass.

155
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,629
[yelps]

156
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,339
[CHARCE] If I didn't know
better, I'd say the moss

157
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,633
on this planet feeds
off dead animals.

158
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,011

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,245
[KANATA]
Look, I'll stay over here,

315
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,998
and we can chat via
helmet comm, okay?

316
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,461
[KANATA] Oh, you left
your glasses on the ship.

317
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,714
[YUN‐HUA] I don't need
them. They're not...

318
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,631
[KANATA]
...not prescription.

319
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,258
[gasps]

320
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,635
[KANATA]
Aries was the one who noticed.

321
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,554
[FUNICIA]
Kanata, here.

322
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,515
Will Yun‐hua be able
to see without them?

323
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,684
[ARIES]
I think so.

324
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,895
They're fake. Those
are just for looks.

325
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,481
[KANATA]
You probably think no one

326
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,692
pays attention to you, right?

327
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,237
But we're your friends.
We've got your back.

328
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,989
Let me guess, the glasses
are there to keep

329
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,991
your bangs out of your eyes.

330
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:49,203
And the bangs are there
to hide your face.

331
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,623
I don't want to draw
attention to myself.

332
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,376
I'm so big,
but I'm also useless.

333
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,004
Sure, you're tall, but that
doesn't make you useless.

334
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,549
But I can't do
anything to help out.

335
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,677
Everyone else on board
has a special talent.

336
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,389
But I'm worthless. Which hurts.

337
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,975
[KANATA] Hey, you don't
need a flashy talent.

338
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:14,562
And it doesn't mean that
we don't need your help.

339
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,148
[YUN‐HUA]
I'm sorry. I...

340
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,984
I don't want to fail
and draw attention,

341
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,488
and I don't want to succeed
and draw attention.

342
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,448
If you can't do anything right,

343
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,242
then don't draw
attention to yourself.

344
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,953
[YUN‐HUA] That's just
how my mother raised me.

345
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,123
No matter what, I'm not
allowed to stand out.

346
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,542
What? For real? But...

347
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:43,591
I wish... I were invisible.

348
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,016
The wind's getting stronger.

349
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,603
Oh. Here come Zack and Funi.

350
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,063
Still no luck?

351
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:57,939
Not yet.

352
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,650
Maybe we should head back
to the ship and regroup.

353
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,776
With the temperature dropping,

354
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,903
we should probably
wear our crust suits.

355
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,198
[rumbling]

356
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,873
[ARIES]
Charce... What's that?

357
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,208
Weird.

358
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,630
[CHARCE] Huh. Interesting. It's
like it's spreading its seeds.

359
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,298
Or are they spores?

360
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,093
The Pole Trees might be
like ferns in that regard.

361
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,638
[CHARCE]
Aries?

[CHARCE]
Everyone. Don't breathe.

364
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,023
The spores are poison.

365
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,192
[CHARCE]
That's it.

366
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,028
I'm a fool for not
realizing sooner.

367
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,489
With so many poisonous plants,

368
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:52,368
the dominant species on
this planet aren't animals...

369
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,078
...but fungi.

370
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,296
Man, it sure got windy.

371
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,922
[GRUPPIE 4C groans]

372
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,924
[KANATA gasps]

373
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,093
What's the matter, big guy?

374
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,636
Are ya hungry?

375
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,099
[KANATA]
Yun‐hua.

376
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,184
[YUN‐HUA]
Here.

377
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,270
I found this flower thing
by one of the trees earlier.

378
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,481
Maybe it'll like it.

379
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,067
[laughs]

380
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,819
Good, you seem to
be feeling better.

00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,446

Eat and you'll feel
better! Well then?

384
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,078

00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,999
Yo, what's up?

387
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,001
[CHARCE weakly]
Kanata.

388
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:46,339
[KANATA gasps]
Charce? What's going on?

389
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,509
[CHARCE] Thank goodness.
You're wearing your helmet.

390
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,138
Come to the location
I send you.

391
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,431
Please hurry.

392
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,558
Keep your helmet on, Kanata.

393
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,897
[KANATA]
Quitterie, help me!

394
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,315
[QUITTERIE]
Wait, them, too?

395
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:08,486
Luca and Ulgar came back
in bad shape, earlier!

396
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,322
It was the Pole Trees.
They release spores.

397
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,866
Spores which are highly
poisonous when inhaled.

398
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:14,992
[panting]

399
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,121
The symptoms are a high fever,
coughing, and soreness.

400
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,998
Okay, can you cure them?

401
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,751
I've never seen this before now,
so why are you asking me?

402
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,836
Because you have to know!

403
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,673
[KANATA]
You're the ship's doctor,

404
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,134
and the best hope
that they have.

405
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,553
[QUITTERIE]
I'll do what I can.

406
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,179
I'm putting everyone
on the bridge.

407
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,597
Get some mattresses.

408
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,890
Okay!

409
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,771
I need you, 'kay?
We can talk later.

410
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,401
[KANATA]
The trees are mushrooms?

411
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,570
They are, and able
to spread poison

412
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,946
with their spores.

413
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,949
I could be wrong, but here's
what I think happens.

414
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,660
The fungi and plants
all work together.

415
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,163
Let's say a fungus has a
symbiotic relationship a plant.

416
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,833
Then it wouldn't be unusual
for that fungus to have a poison

417
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,502
that actively kills animals.

418
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,212
The moss would
then grow on top

419
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,757
of the animal's carcass,
photosynthesizing energy

420
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,552
for the mushroom to grow.

421
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,263
Making those mushrooms
the dominant species

422
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,140
of this planet.

423
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,852
They're not getting any better!

424
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,688
We just don't have the
right supplies on board.

425
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,774
[KANATA]
There's gotta be something.

426
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,235
Like a balance in the
ecosystem or whatever.

427
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,029
Or else all these
crazy mushrooms

428
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,823
would kill everything off.

429
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,366
You may be right.

430
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,368
It's possible that the
plants and fungi have

431
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,203
some sort of method
to control how many

432
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,080
animals they take down.

433
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,958
[QUITTERIE]
What do you mean, Charce?

434
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,336
[CHARCE] There could be
an antidote or something.

435
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,631
Like a medicinal mushroom
that could cure us.

436
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,925
[gasps] Kanata!

437
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,429
Do you remember the thing
we fed the Gruppie?

438
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,266
Could it be that was actually
a medicinal mushroom?

439

[KANATA panting]

441
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:11,317
[KANATA] Yes! It's the only
thing that makes sense!

442
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,818
Oh, but now that
I think about it,

443
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,570
it was the only
one around there.

At least we know there's a cure.

447
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,454
I promise I'll find some.

448
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,457
[ZACK]
Hey. Check the roots.

449
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,833
Of the Pole Trees?

450
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,377
That's right.

451
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,420
They need to have the
carcasses near them,

452
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,215
so they have to lure
the animals there.

453
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,426
The antidote plant
could serve as the bait.

454
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,053
[KANATA]
I get it!

455
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,557
[ZACK] The sick animals go to
the Pole Trees to get medicine,

456
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,143
and if they manage to
find it, they're cured.

457
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,895
And if they don't find it,

458
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:51,148
then they die right there
at the base of the tree.

459
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,025
That's how it does it.

460
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:57,405
How it controls which animals
live and which ones die.

461
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:04,912
[KANATA panting]

462
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,540
[gasps] No!

C'mon, where the heck are they?

464
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,295
Why aren't there
any good mushrooms?

465
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:19,760
Um, hey! You're burning up!

466
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,512
Are you poisoned, too?

467
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,182
I don't know how to
help them. What do I do?

468
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,394
I was only able to
make them comfortable.

469
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,604
That's it, so...

470
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,983
All we can do now
is wait for Kanata.

These footprints are fresh,

00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:45,077
but there aren't
any new carcasses.

473
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,328
Does that mean that
all the mushrooms

474
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,331
were eaten already?

475
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,541
No.

476
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,044
Maybe it won't give them to me
because it knows I'm not sick.

[KANATA] I really hate that

Is someone... singing?

484
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,690
[KANATA] Seriously?! Your dream
is to become a singer?

You don't have to yell.

486
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,071
My mother told me
that I was not allowed

487
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,697
to tell anybody.

488
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,659
And to not sing
in front of others.

489
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,119
[YUN‐HUA]
But...

490
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,122
I still love hearing
my mother sing.

491
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,253
[YUN‐HUA]
And I love singing.

492
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,265
[YUN‐HUA]
Because...

493
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,393
[YUNHUA] ...I've always found
it to be very soothing.

After an adventure‐filled day,

Kanata brought back
the medicinal mushrooms

00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,759
we needed to live,

You did really well. Good job.
