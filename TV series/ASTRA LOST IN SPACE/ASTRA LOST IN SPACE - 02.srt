Ugh, I totally forgot
to pack my sunscreen.

Check out this baby.
I made an awesome bug net!

Aw, sweet!

9
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,456
We should try to
catch some beetles!

We've reached the

Hopefully, we'll be
able to find 20 days'

[ARIES] I have to admit,
I'm a little nervous

about exploring a new planet.

20

[KANATA] Awesome! This

22

Uh. Hey, you guys?

29
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,976
Since its head is
shaped like a turtle,

30
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,769
we should call it a Tur‐gon,
what do ya think?

31
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,354
[QUITTERIE] That monster
could swallow us whole

32

and that's your first thought?

Aw, stop being
such a worry‐wart!

34
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,985
If it tries to start
anything, then I'll kill it

what the first character

Zack actually helped me
with it before we got here.

If he left it alone,

This time, I won't fail.

I'll be a reliable leader.

62
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,212
We'll split into three teams.

Zack and Funicia will
take care of the ship.

be a little risky,

care of everyone!

Nope, denied.

[KANATA]
Come on!

75
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,776
Um. I was just wondering,

76
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,778
is there, like, any
particular type of food

77
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,862
we should be looking for?

78
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,490
[KANATA]
Excellent question!

79
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,243
Nuts are usually the most
nutritious of the options.

80
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,663
Followed closely by berries.
Avoid red plants.

81
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,082
Most mushrooms will probably
be poisonous as well,

82
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,834
so it's best if we skip those.

83
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,585
Wow, that was super impressive!

00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,963

ever sounded knowledgeable!

me and you'll be fine!

[LUCA]
So... Which ones are the berries

87
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,183
and which ones are the nuts?

88
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,727
It's a different planet, okay?

89

about this weird food!

This is interesting!

91
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,984
From what I can see,
the local flora and environment

92
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,778
appear similar to the
Treepeel Spat system.

Her entire life she's been

The thing is,

431
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,145
my dad used to be a
world‐class athlete himself,

432
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,439
but then he got injured one day,

so he had to retire
at a pretty young age.

434
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,698
He was forcing his dream
onto me and I wanted out.

435
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,451
And then... in middle
school, I met my teacher.

436
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,746
He got me interested
in space exploration.

437
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,874
I was finally free of my dad.

438
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,461
But, then we got lost
in the mountains.

have done more.

[KANATA] Maybe my teacher
would still be alive.

443
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:33,274
So I begged my dad
to train me again.

intend to compete.

474
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,243
[FUNICIA]
So yummy!

475
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,370
[CHARCE] It's important
to balance our diets though.

476
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,164
Especially over
the next 20 days.

477
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,332
[ZACK]
About that.

478
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,669
Using some spare parts
from around the ship,

479
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,671
I've made an edibility tester.

480
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,589
[LUCA]
You can do everything!

481
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,092
Watch this. I'll show you.

482
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,096
[EDIBILITY TESTER]
Yummy.

483
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,973
[KANATA] Check out how
cute the display is.

484
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,059
[LUCA] Did you record
your own voice for it?

485
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:40,234
[ARIES laughs]

486
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,777
Is something wrong?

487
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,197
[ARIES] I'm sorry. I just
thought it was really funny.

488
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,199
This might sound
a little bit crazy.

489
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:51,245
But I... I'm enjoying
myself a lot on this trip.

490
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,122
See I grew up in the country,

491
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,166
and I didn't have a lot
of friends out there.

492
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,294
So being here with
you guys makes me happy

493
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,338
and I'm super glad
we all get to be friends!

494
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,552
[ARIES]
Team B‐5 Camp Log.

495
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,014
[ARIES] After just two
full days, we had enough

496
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:15,436
food and water so that we
could leave Planet Vilavurs.

497
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,813
Also, I think we're
all a lot closer

498
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,440
to each other now!

499
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,822
[ZACK] Kanata. I need
to discuss something

500
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,116
with you in private.

501
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,369
What! Someone broke
the communicator?

502
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,704
Are you sure?

503
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,414
Yes, I took a closer look.

504
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,708
The missing parts weren't
damaged over time‐‐

505
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,877
they were actually
cut out of it.

506
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,172
Worse, the cuts seem
new. They're fresh.

507
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,633
Hold on. You mean...?

508
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:49,970
Exactly. Whoever's
responsible is on this ship.
