1
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,224
[RAY] You want to
resume your training?

2
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,809
I thought you had
given up on all that,

3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,311
Kanata.

4
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,148
Look, I've nothing against
track and field, okay?

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,150
I just couldn't stand
the idea of you pushing

6
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,360
your old dreams onto me,

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,737
not giving me the freedom
to do what I want.

8
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,156
I deserve to pursue
my own dreams!

9
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,200
So, I'm going into space!

10
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,160
But to do it well
and protect my crew,

11
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,579
I need to be in peak condition.

12
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,957
You had to retire because
of your injuries.

13
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,959
But if you train me,
you can push me

14
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:45,379
without hurting me, too, right?

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,964
[RAY]
'Course I can.

16
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,383
Your body is precious,
we can't let it get injured.

17
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,759
[gasps]

18
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,136
Dream what you want, kid.

19
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,973
Just work hard to maintain
the perfect physique,

20
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,184
and you'll have an advantage,
whatever you pursue.

21
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,732
It all makes sense now.

22
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,942
Dammit.

23
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,114
[QUITTERIE]
Hey, um...

24
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,658
Did you really have to
gather the whole crew?

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,452
I mean, this only
concerns me and Funi.

26
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,330
[ARIES] Wow, did you already
get the DNA test results back?

27
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,374
[LUCA] You're gonna announce
the results to all of us?

28
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,043
Oh, this will be life
changing, I can feel it!

29
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,920
[QUITTERIE] Stop making such
a huge deal out of this!

30
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:30,048
I'm nervous enough as it is!

31
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,800
I'll share the results,

32
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,469
but they might not be
what you're expecting.

33
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,264
Your DNA is a match.

34
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:41,101
Huh? Wait. What does that mean?

35
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,228
[ZACK] DNA is the
blueprint for all life.

36
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,605
While likenesses are common,

37
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,024
no two beings have
identical genes.

38
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,902
The only answer is that you
two are the same person.

39
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,529
[ALL gasp]

40
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,865
Huh? You moron!

41
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,450
I don't believe a word you say!

42
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,993
Who'd make up such a dumb story?

43
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,661
[ZACK]
It's the truth.

44
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:00,704
[LUCA]
Hold on.

45
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,789
What if they're like
identical twins?

46
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,750
That would explain their
DNA being the same.

47
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,127
[QUITTERIE] Twins?
Well, that does make sense.

48
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,338
If a fertilized egg
splits in two...

49
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,132
[ZACK] No. You'd have
to be the same age.

50
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,009
To be fair,
I considered that Funi

51
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,178
may have endured the
same sort of hibernation

52
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,930
that Polina did, but that
hypothesis doesn't align

53
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,975
with the memories Funi has
of her early childhood.

54
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,645
[KANATA] Then the other theory
is most likely correct.

55
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,521
What theory are
you talking about?

56
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,149
[KANATA] It's not just
Funi and Quitterie.

57
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,860
The missing piece,
the one commonality

58
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:36,698
everyone here shares, connecting
us in this murder plot.

59
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,285
Every one of us is a clone.

60
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,081
[ARIES]
Clones? But, how?

61
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,333
You mean we're all
copies of other people?

62
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,793
Hold on just a minute!

63
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,920
We cannot all be clones!

64
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,713
You're making that up
to mess with us!

65
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,383
Think about it, though.

66
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,843
The people we know as parents‐‐

67
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,221
they're actually
our "originals."

68
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,723
I don't know.

69
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,017
[YUNHUA]
Our originals.

70
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,312
Then Funi is really
a clone of, me?

71
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,647
[ULGAR]
Wait.

72
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,983
Cloning humans is a felony‐‐
it'd get you serious jail time.

73
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,069
Why would anyone attempt
to do something like this

74
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,404
knowing what the risks are?

75
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,781
[ZACK]
I have a theory about that, too.

76
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,702
My father's been researching
memory transplant technology.

77
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,704
Put simply, he wants
to transfer the memories

78
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,956
of one person into
the brain of another.

79
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,166
With a clone, you could
theoretically discard

80
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,877
an aging or sick body
and inhabit a younger,

81
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,462
healthier copy of yourself.

82
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,296
[GROUP gasps]

83
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,756
That's awful.

84
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,758
They wanted to live longer?

85
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,302
[ZACK] My father hoped to
keep his research secret

86
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,139
and transfer his own
mind to a new body.

87
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,640
He found allies.

88
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,143
A like‐minded group
with a singular goal.

89
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,853
First there was the
brilliant scientist

90
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,938
who had developed
the technology.

91
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,482
The head of the school
the clones would attend.

92
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,360
The hospital director who
could have them created.

93
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,823
The athlete, singer,
artist, and noble.

94
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,450
That's who we are.

95
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,911
Vessels to ensure our
originals' rejuvenation.

96
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,174
[FELICE]
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

97
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:21,386
Well, well, isn't this pleasant?
Impressive VIP room.

98
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,263
It's been quite
a while, hasn't it?

99
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,931
Who's this guy?

100
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,975
[FELICE]
Oh, come on, we've met before.

101
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,519
Please don't tell me
you've all forgotten.

102
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:33,190
I'm Luca's original,
also known as Felice Genma.

103
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,442
He's a world‐famous
artist, you know.

104
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,444
Art isn't really my thing.

105
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,280
So, considering the fact
that you brought me here

106
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,532
instead of Mister Esposito,

107
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,910
does this involve
a nefarious plot?

108
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,037
[JED chuckles]
Nefarious?

109
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,039
As if we're a bunch
of arch villains.

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,791
[OLIVE] What do you
have to laugh about?

111
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,584
You're the one who
concocted this whole

112
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,212
clone rejuvenation nonsense.

113
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,756
We all came dangerously
close to getting arrested.

114
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,218
[JED] Oh, spare me.
What was her name? Funicia?

115
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,512
We made an agreement when
we began this endeavor:

116
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,722
one clone per original,
no exceptions.

117
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,849
But you had to have
your spare organs.

118
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,476
[GERT]
Yeah, that's right.

119
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,561
And as a result of
your little stunt,

120
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,646
I had no other choice

121
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,232
but to force a ten‐year‐old
onto their team.

122
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,275
I can't begin to describe
the work it took

123
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,860
to get that cleared.

124
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:19,986
[JED]
Easy now.

125
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,738
[OLIVE]
You can't fault me for trying.

126
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,573
This little plan would
be dead in the water

127
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,701
without my hospital‐‐I more
than earned the privilege!

128
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,871
If you ask me, the plan
was way too complicated.

129
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,958
Sending them away under
the guise of a camp?

130
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,543
It was the only way.

131
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,921
We couldn't leave a single cell,
let alone any corpses.

132
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:41,049
That Genome Control Act.

133
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,717
Even a basic DNA test

134
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,262
would reveal they
were all our clones.

135
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,430
A stupid law, in my opinion.

136
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,141
[FELICE] If the rumors are true,
rooting out illegal clones

137
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,228
was actually one of
the goals of the law.

138
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,021
[JED]
It's not unheard of.

139
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,441
Making clones for spare organs
as a sort of life insurance.

140
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,570
Ugh. Why are you
giving me that look?

141
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,196
In order to make sure
none of the clones'

142
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,448
genetic material
could be recovered,

143
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,450
they had to be "lost"
somewhere‐‐far enough

144
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,828
in deep space that
they'd never return.

145
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,913
It was the best plan we had.

146
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,623
It took me by surprise.

147
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,626
I was amazed such
a thing even existed.

148
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,503
If the public got
wind of that sphere,

149
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,256
I have no doubt it would
cause quite a commotion.

150
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,465
Don't you think?

151
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,886
How and when was that thing
developed in the first place?

152
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,263
At any rate, this plan
we hatched together

153
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,308
has played out, and there's
nothing more to do here.

154
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,434
[OLIVE]
Oh, I can't wait

155
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,686
to never work with
any of you again.

156
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:38,565
[FELICE] Well, I can't help
but feel disappointed.

157
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,859
I must say, I was
looking forward to it.

158

reservations before,

Hey. You all right?

Yeah, I had a good cry,
but I'm feeling much better.

355
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,867
It all makes perfect sense now,

telling me not to stand out.

357

If I got too much attention,
it would make things

more complicated
when the time came

I wonder what'll happen
when I get back.

Well, like I said,

I want to sing all the time.

I would enjoy that a lot.

Who would've thought
you were all clones?

373
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,961
I knew that there
had to be something

374
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,715
about you guys, but I never
imagined it'd be that.

375
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,425
[ARIES] I'm sure the

[POLINA]
Are you upset about it, Aries?

[ARIES]
To be honest,

380
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,812
I think I'm more confused
than everyone else.

381

Even if we are right
about how it happened,

382
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,901
I have questions. Like,
who am I a clone of?

383
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,904
I mean, I look
nothing like my mom.

384
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,906
I know that she cares about me.

385
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:35,161
I have no question about that.
Her love for me is real.

00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:39,540
Beyond that... I don't
care what else is true.

387

Adults lie, that's for
sure, but deep emotions

Even if I am a clone
of someone else,

390

my mom will always be my mom.

And I know this: I still
believe in her love.

I might not look that way,
but I'm getting over it.

Until now, I've
been living my life

the way my mom wanted me to.

I used to think that
was a good thing,

to have her attention, you know?

it was all a lie,

[ZACK] Your DNA isn't all
that determines personality.

According to behavioral
genetics research,

the influence of
nature versus nurture

is more or less equal.

415

Funi was raised in
a different place,

00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,699
[squeals] Oh, Zack!

472
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,742
Oh, no! I have to go
to the infirmary!

473
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,453
This is giving me heart
palpitations! Help!

474
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,289
Am I the only one who finds
Zack impossible to read?

475
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,125
No, I can't read him, either!

476
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,293
[ARIES]
Oh, I see what happened here.

477
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,546
Zack is doing his
very best to hide it,

478
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,214
but on this trip, you
couldn't help getting

479
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,633
closer with each
passing day! Right?

480
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,510
[QUITTERIE]
Aries, give it a rest!

481
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,178
Quitterie and I have
always been close,

482
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,513
ever since we were small.

483
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,141
And that will
forever be the case.

484
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,809
Oh, man, you better
not push him!

485
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,477
Can't you see this
guy is trouble?

486
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,187
He's not afraid to
use the big guns!

487
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,273
So. So! What about Quitterie

488
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,191
makes you love her
like you claim to?

489
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,901
Aries, don't be a hero!

490
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,320
[ZACK] Huh? She's cute,
isn't that obvious?

491
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,530
[QUITTERIE]
Stop it! I'm begging you!

492
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,283
I can't handle it anymore!

493
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,743
Luca. I'm sorry,

494
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,786
but we need to change
the title again.

495
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:46,787
Seriously?

496
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:50,207
Yeah. "Farewell to Icriss,
Welcome Aboard, Sis Lina,

497
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,042
and Best Wishes
Zack and Quitterie!"

498
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,587
It's now a farewell,
welcome, engagement party!

499
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,797
[LUCA]
Focus!

500
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,508
[ARIES]
Team B‐five camp log.

501
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,552
No matter what we go through,

502
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:07,349
this crew stays positive
and strong. We're invincible!

503
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,855
[KANATA]
What is this? A warning?

504
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,025
[ZACK] No, not that.
We finally got an image.

505
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,818
Ah, I fixed the
broken telescope,

506
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,529
using some parts I found
onboard the <i>Ark VI</i>.

507
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,574
Now we can see planets
2,000 light years away,

508
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,201
and that means...

509
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,411
Home, sweet home, on screen.

510
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,289
‐‐[STUDENTS gasp]
‐‐[LUCA] Whoa! Amazing!

511
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,041
[KANATA]
I've got goose bumps, you guys!

512
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,585
[QUITTERIE]
Is that seriously it?

513
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,671
Yes. Blue ocean
and white clouds,

514
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,089
green patches of land.

515
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,258
Wow, feels like forever.

516
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,261
We've been gone for, like,
three whole months, haven't we?

517
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,305
I can't believe it's
really happening!

518
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,807
One more stop, then it's home!

519
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,142
[FUNICIA giggles]
Look, Yun‐hua's crying!

520
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,852
You are, too, Funi!

521
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:55,898
[chuckles] There's nothing
weird about that!

522
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,776
It's only natural
to cry at this sight.

523
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,906
Right, let's do this!
To the final planet!

524
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,033
[STUDENTS]
Aye yeah!

525
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,912
What is it? Why
all the excitement?

526
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,413
Polina, look!

527
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,582
The telescope's back
up and running now!

528
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,835
Our goal's in sight!
See, take a look!

529
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:20,339
[gasps] You mean,
I'm seeing Earth?

530
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,507
Huh?

531
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,427
This isn't a dream.
I'm really going home!

532
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,513
Yes, we are.

533
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,224
I've imagined it so many times.

534
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:33,018
The oceans, the continents.

535
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,815
Hold on. Something's
not quite right here.

536
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,942
Are you sure
that's really Earth?

537
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,862
That can't be Africa,
the shape is all wrong.

538
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,197
And what is that
island over there?

539
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,659
[gasps] I'm so confused,
what is this?

540
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,036
Uh, what's wrong, Polina?

541
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,331
It can't be. I'm positive
that isn't Earth.

542
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,458
You'd better check
your coordinates again,

543
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,253
you have got the wrong planet!

544
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:03,132
Hey. Polina. What is "Earth?"

545
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:09,179
[POLINA] What? Are you
joking? Earth is Earth!

546
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,473
Why are you all
looking at me like that?

547
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,810
Our home! Earth is
where we all come from!

548
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,354
Hold on. What is happening?

549
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,481
You're freaking me out a little.

550
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,233
Could your memory
still be messed up

551
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,443
from the hibernation?

552
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,195
Are you okay Polina?

553
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,490
I don't‐‐ Am I going crazy?

554
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,661
Please. Tell me that
you're joking. Or...

555
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,414
What do you call that planet?

556
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:38,417
If that's not Earth, what is it?

557
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,962
What planet do all
of you come from?

558
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,715
What's our home planet?

559
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,259
I thought that was obvious.

560
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,433
[KANATA]
Our planet is Astra.
