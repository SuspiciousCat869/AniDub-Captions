One more thing.

This is Funicia Raffaelli.

164

with a unique task.

169
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,566
And in your case,
the task is to take care

Thanks for having me
along on your trip.

Why should we take care of her?

There is no way this is safe!

It wasn't me, Beego was
the one being rude.

00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,395
How fascinating!

Anyway, moving on.

[TEACHER 1A]
Yes.

That's because we're
still missing someone.

We can't wait much longer.

Cuttin' it close, am I right?

Gettin' left behind

Yeah. But I thought it
couldn't hurt to go ahead

and throw my candidacy
out there early.

you can show up late

316
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,204
...that if you want to, you
can reach the skies and beyond.

317
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,209
You mean it?

318
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,919
Yes.

319
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,214
And my purpose in life
is to help you get there.

Hiya!

322
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,271
[KANATA]
Hi!

323
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,772
I wanted to thank
you for your help

324
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,274
back at the space port.

325
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,485
Well, hey, if it
isn't Aries Spring.

326
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,403
It's awesome that
we're on the same team.

327
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,237
[ARIES]
Whoa!

328
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,781
I can't believe you've already
learned everyone's name!

329
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,825
That's super impressive.

330
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:36,537
It's Kanata... Bive Domb
something or other!

331
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,164
[KANATA]
That's not my name!

332
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,500
[giggles] I have my
wallet in this bag,

333
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,127
so I would have been in huge
trouble without your help.

334
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,004
Just hold on and I'll
give you a little something

335
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,130
to repay your kindness.

336
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,174
Oh, please, that's
not necessary!

337
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,801
[ARIES] How about a frozen
tangerine for a treat?

338
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,803
[KANATA]
Are you a grandma?

339
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,975
[ARIES] Y'know, I was
impressed back there.

340
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,019
I thought it was really
neat how you volunteered

341
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,437
to be our group's champion.

342
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,939
You mean captain?

343
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,026
Yeah. So what made you
wanna volunteer for it?

344
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:11,489
Well. I want to be
an explorer of space.

345
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,699
One day, I'll have my own ship.

346
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,327
Then I'll discover
an uncharted star.

347
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,620
I just thought
being captain here

348
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,956
would be a good
first step to that.

349
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,875
Wow. That's so cool!

350
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,544
Even though you're young,
you already know

351
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,420
what you wanna do in life!

352
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,422
I guess. But to be
honest with you,

353
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,217
it was my mentor's dream first.

354
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,969
He actually passed
away in an accident

355
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,846
a few years ago. In a way, I...

356
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,891
Maybe I'm just trying
to carry out his wishes.

357
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,643
I know it sounds crazy.

358
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,271
But that's the reason
why I'm doing this.

359
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,192
[KANATA]
Uh‐‐

360
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:49,902
I'm sure you'll achieve it!

361
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,112
You have to!

362
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,989
[KANATA]
Yeah, that's the plan.

363
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,865
I appreciate the loud support.

364
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,326
[ARIES] Now, how about a
nice cold glass of iced‐tea?

We've arrived safely

Yay!

Grab your belongings

00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,442
and enter the air lock.

374
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,611
Once we've confirmed that
everyone is disembarked,

375
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,863
we'll take off
and head back home.

376
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:39,035
We'll return for you
in exactly five days.

377
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,704

looked kinda like lakes.

Let's make our way to the lodge.

We'll change outta these

00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,820
We never said you were
the captain, remember?

C'mon, follow me, everyone!

392

00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,070
We're gonna regroup
on that ship!

475
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,863
Use your thrusters!

476
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,448
We don't have much fuel,
but there should be

477
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,617
at least enough
to get us over there.

478
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,209
[KANATA]
Looking for this?

479
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,460
[gasps]

480
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,256
Hey, guys, if you see
any luggage floating

481
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,967
within reach, try to grab it.

482
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,218
[gasps]

483
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,146
[KANATA]
What's going on?

484
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,065
Why is this happening?

485
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,318
[ZACK] There's no response
from anyone inside.

486
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,028
It must be unoccupied.

487
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,455
[ZACK]
But there is power.

488
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,916
[grunts]

489
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:04,628
Once we're all in,
activate the ship's airlock!

490
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,381
[CHARCE] And the gravity
controls, too!

491
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:08,716
[ZACK]
I just turned them on.

492
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,134
Wait, what does that mean?

493
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,219
Somebody tell me what's
going on right now!

494
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,346
Incoming gravity!
Brace yourselves!

495
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,765
[ALL yelp]

496
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,187
Looks like there's
a locker room over here.

497
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,939
Let's regroup in there.

498
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,526
[QUITTERIE]
Okay, I wanna know:

499
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,236
Why did that
glowing ball eat us?

500
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,529
Calm down, Quitterie.

501
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,490
First, we need to make sure
that everyone's safe.

502
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,492
There were nine of us.

503
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,327
Anyone missing?

504
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,287
[ZACK]
Yes.

505
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,913
[LUCA]
Huh?

506
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,582
[ZACK]
We're missing one.

507
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,252
[KANATA]
Who?

508
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,255
[KANATA]
Who's not here?

509
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,134
[ULGAR]
Isn't that her?

510
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:16,450
[KANATA]
No way! Is that...? It's Aries!

511
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,744
Are her thrusters not working?

512
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,704
[ZACK] It looks like
her comms are also down.

513
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,331
We have to go save her!

514
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,874
She's too far out.

515
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,125
We could run out
of thruster fuel,

516
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,087
and then the rescuer
would be lost, too.

517
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,881
You can't be serious.

518
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,966
[LUCA] So it's really
just hopeless, then?

519
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,219
What are we gonna do?

520
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,637
Can you stop freaking out?

521
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,556
We need to come up with,
like, a plan or something!

522
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,022
And when things seem hopeless...

523
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,524
...act tough!

524
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,914
[KANATA]
I'll go.

525
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,167
I really hate that word.

526
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,753
Nothing is hopeless. 'Kay?

527
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,176
[CHARCE]
Is it secure?

528
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,177
[KANATA]
Yeah.

529
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,429
[ZACK] You should be able
to make it out to Aries.

530
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,515
We'll pull the cable
in when you have her.

531
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,603
[KANATA]
I'll be back.

532
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,778
How's it look?

533
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,738
He's a bit off,
too far to the right.

534
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,782
Kanata, adjust your path!

535
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,534
[KANATA]
Okay. Which way?

536
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,787
[QUITTERIE] A little...
Oh, wait, she's moving, too.

537
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:47,291
So then... Left. No, west!

538
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,792
Make up your mind!

539
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,628
[ZACK] Kanata, Conserve
your thruster fuel.

540
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,088
Minimize your bursts.

541
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,133
Do a 1.5‐second burst
toward your seven o'clock.

542
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,384
Once on the right trajectory,

543
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,636
then inertia should
do the rest for you.

544
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,847
[KANATA]
Got it!

545
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,932
[CHARCE]
There, that's it!

00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,104

Everyone's gone.

I'm so scared.

00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,247

Being alone is terrifying!

Surrounded by darkness.

It'd be easy to panic right now.

I have to focus

[ZACK]
The cable's pretty far away.

585
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,006
But there should be
just enough fuel left

586
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,175
to drift back here with inertia.

587
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,312
We had just enough fuel.

As long as we stay
on course, we're fine.

No. You're not.

five degrees downward.

You're gonna fly right past us.

Okay, so now what?

They're out of thruster fuel.

00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,344
Anyway...

634
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,472
So it turns out the communicator
on the ship's completely busted.

635
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,807
Which means we can't
talk to the school.

636
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,851
[ARIES] Well, if nothing else,
they'll know something's wrong

637
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,728
when we don't report
in as scheduled.

638
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,979
[QUITTERIE]
What? So we just have to

639
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,940
sit around and wait
for them to help us?

640
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:48,318
[LUCA] Relax, McPa is only like
nine light‐years from home,

641
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,361
that's four hours.

642
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,612
Plus, look on the bright side,

643
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,614
at least none of us
kicked the bucket!

644
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:56,159
[ZACK] I'm not entirely
sure help is coming.

645
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,328
Look at the planet
in front of us.

646
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,080
I just surveyed it.

647
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,583
It's completely lifeless
and covered in ice.

648
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,046
[ZACK]
That's not McPa.

649
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:08,922
[ALL gasp]

650
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,716
There's no way!
That can't be true!

651
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,511
[ZACK]
If my calculations are right,

652
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,305
then we're 5,012
lights years from home.

653
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:20,684
What‐‐5,012 light years?

654
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,812
I don't understand how
we got this far out.

655
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:27,440
But, given the extreme distance.

656
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:31,403
the chance of being
rescued is next to none.

657
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:37,701
[ARIES] Space Camp Log.
Aries Spring. Day One.

658
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,663
We the members of Team B‐5,
Caird High Planet Camp...

659
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:46,501
...are lost in space.
Far away from home.

660
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,629
[KANATA] It's getting
kind of hard to act tough.

661
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,679
[KANATA]
What's going on?

662
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:00,223
[QUITTERIE] How the heck
did we get so far away?

663
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,683
[ZACK]
I know it's strange.

664
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,518
But it must have
been that sphere.

665
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,478
It swallowed us up
on McPa and sent us

666
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,981
5,000 lights years
into deep space.

667
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,524
So, if we jump
into the ball thing,

668
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,234
we could go back to
where we were, right?

669
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,068
Yeah!

670
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,403
Hey, that could actually work!

671
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,030
Except we don't
know where it is.

672
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,157
Do you see it floating
around outside?

673
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,076
No ball means no plan, genius.

674

Jerk! It's better than
your nonexistent one!

Calm down. He's right.

676
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,168
We don't actually know where
the sphere is located.

677
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,253
Much less how to find it again.

678
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,714
[KANATA]
Hm. That is a good point.

679
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,424
So. What should we do?

680
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,259
[LUCA]
I know!

681
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,886
Okay, this might sound weird.

682
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,889
But what if all of this
is some sort of test?

683
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,390
How so?

684
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,893
Well, I mean, just think
about it for a second.

685
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:48,021
We shoot 5,000 light
years in an instant?

686
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,523
And then we happen to appear
right next to a ship?

687
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,858
That's all too weird!

688
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,610
Maybe the ship's
computers are a set up

689
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:54,903
to try and trick us.

690
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,280
Meaning we're actually
still over McPa.

691
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,282
And right now the
teachers are watching us

692
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,076
to see how we handle
the situation!

693
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,328
[BOTH]
Whoa! Seriously?

694
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,997
That's totally the best
possible explanation!

695
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,041
[LUCA] I know, right?
This is all staged!

696
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,584
They almost had us!

697
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,670
[ARIES]
Our helmets.

698
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,796
On McPa.

699
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,547
Remember how Kanata
had to tell us all

700
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,050
to put our helmets
on as we ran away?

701
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,386
Meaning...

702
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:24,182
[LUCA] If we hadn't, we
would have died instantly.

703
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,101
There's just no way the
school would administer

704
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,436
a test that could
result in us dying.

705
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,356
[KANATA]
True. There goes that theory.

706
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,857
[QUITTERIE]
Can you please stop agreeing

707
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,943
with whatever anyone
else is saying?

708
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,279
[BEEGO] Look. If there's not a
way to fly this ship back home,

709
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,700
then it might as well
be a big, fancy coffin!

713
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,417
but don't you have
a spaceship license?

That's right.

[KANATA] That is definitely
something you should mention

00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,091
during a crisis!

00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,342
I didn't feel like it.

really don't know?

Why are you bragging?

It's not like that's your IQ.

[ZACK] While the ship is old,
it looks like it can fly

726
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,069
using propellant
gathered from space.

727
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,571
It doesn't have to refuel.

728
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,115
[KANATA]
Awesome! So we can get home!

I wouldn't celebrate just yet.

731
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,665
To travel 5,000 light years,

732
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,959
even with the faster‐than‐
light drive at maximum,

733
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,086
it would take at
least three months.

734
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,172
What's worse.
Although we can combine

735

all of our supplies,

736
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,760
we only have enough food
and water for three days.

737
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,469
No problem!

738
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,387
We can just lighten the
load of the ship, right?

739
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,306
Or maybe we can
disable a limiter

740
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,807
and boost the engines!

741
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,769
I thought about all of that.

742
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:51,644
But...

743
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,063
...even with full tanks,
the ship can only carry

744
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,107
about 20 days' worth of water.

745
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,650
We would need much
more than that

00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,733
I understand!

790
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,276
Out there, when I thought

791
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,486
for sure it was all over...

792
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:09,991
Everyone held hands in
order to help save me!

793
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,829
Right now, we're all
still separated.

794
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:15,747
Come on.

795
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,624
We don't even know
everyone's names yet,

796
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,878
and that's not right.
I want to know you!

797
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,422
Let's go back together!

798
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:38,186
I'm Quitterie.
Quitterie Raffaelli.

799
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,022
I'm Zack Walker.

800
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,025
I'd like to be a
researcher one day.

801
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,068
Name's Luca!

802
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,694
I'm pretty good at
making different things,

803
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,322
and I really wanna
go to art school.

804
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:54,535
My name is Charce Lacroix.
I enjoy biology a great deal.

805
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,120
And what's your name?

806
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,497
[YUN‐HUA]
Uh...

807
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,165
[QUITTERIE]
Introduce yourself.

808
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,668
Oh, um.

809
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:06,089
I'm Yun‐hua, and I'm not
that good at anything.

810
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,133
So uh. I'm sorry.

811
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:13,638
[laughs] Come now.

812
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,890
‐‐[KANATA] Uh‐‐
‐‐[LUCA] Huh?

813
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,226
Don't be sorry. It's fine.

814
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,436
Whoa, good looking dude alert!

815
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,605
Here. Join us.

816
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,816
[KANATA] How are you making
your face sparkle like that?

817
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,567
[CHARCE]
Worry not, for one day you, too,

818
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,069
shall have the chance to shine.

819
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:31,197
Even the way he talks is shiny!

820
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,615
[sighs]

821
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,168
I'm Funicia Raffaelli.
The little sister.

822
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,004
Uh, okay.

823
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,886
[sighs] I'm Ulgar.

824
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,304
[BEEGO]
Nice to meet ya!

825
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,265
[gasps] Whoa, it talked?

826
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,766
[BEEGO]
My name is Beego!

827
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,268
[ALL laugh]

828
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,770
Who knew holding hands
with a puppet was so scary?

829
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:06,357
Well, he is embracing
the unknown!

830
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,817
[KANATA]
That's it!

831
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,487
Maybe if we form connections,
we can make it!

832
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,156
What are you saying?

833
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,533
[gasps] I think I get it!

834
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,411
Not alone, but together
we could reach out.

835
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,831
As long as we do it like that,
then we can all be stars!

836
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,417
[QUITTERIE] I have no idea
what you're saying.

837
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,462
[ZACK]
Stars? Do you mean like planets?

838
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,629
Yeah, that's right!

839
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,758
[QUITTERIE]
Huh? What are you talking about?

840
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,677
[KANATA]
Okay. Here's the plan:

841
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,096
we search for a planet that's
within three days of here

842
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,557
that has both food and water.

843
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,729
[ZACK] Entering the conditions
into a list of planets

844
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:48,274
I brought along.
Let's see what comes up.

845
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:53,321
I found one! It's
called Planet Vilavurs.

846
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,573
Looks like it would be
a three‐day journey.

847
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,200
But if we go to that planet,

848
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,203
then it'll give us the chance
to stock up on food and water.

849
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,080
Enough to last for 20 days.

850
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,708
[CHARCE] Oh, I see!
So we find another planet!

851
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,460
And then we use that
one to forage enough

852
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:09,670
food and water for the
next leg of the journey.

853
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,506
Wait. Can we?

854
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,049
Like, is that possible?

855
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,550
[CHARCE]
If we keep connecting planets

856
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,512
that are about 20
days apart or less.

857
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,346
But...

858
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,764
...we'd have to make
a lot of stops

859
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,016
in order to make that work.

860
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,687
We can do it.

861
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:36,823
We'll make it.
One planet at a time.

862
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,204
I've got it.

863
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,334
[ZACK]
There's only one possible route.

864
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,003
And it spans five planets.

865
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,589
[STUDENTS cheer]

866
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,758
[LUCA]
Yeah! It's a miracle!

867
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,301
I can't believe there's
even a route at all!

868
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,804
[QUITTERIE]
You're a genius, Zack!

869
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,723
Do you really
think it's possible?

870
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,852
[KANATA chuckles]
I'd say it's 50‐50.

871
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,896
But it's either that, or death.

872
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:11,315
I think we should
definitely try.

873
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,651
That's survival
pro‐tip number one:

874
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,444
Moving forward equals progress.

875
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,530
[QUITTERIE]
Again with the obvious!

876
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,907
Man, you really are
an idiot, aren't you?

877
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,034
All right then.
Let's move this ship.

878
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,703
[FUNICIA, BEEGO]
Yeah!

879
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,338
'Kay. Is everyone ready?

880
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,090
Make sure you're
all strapped in.

881
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:37,884
And remain seated
while the sign's on.

882
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,844
Flight safety should
be our top priority!

883
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,137
[LUCA]
Yeah, we get it, Dad,

884
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,472
so can you just
sit down already?

885
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,141
The captain's chair awaits.

886
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,685
Huh?

887
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,520
Well, we needed
to pick a leader‐‐

888
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,814
someone who could
keep us all together.

889
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:52,815
That's true.

890
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,151
Kanata did volunteer
for the position.

891
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,736
He's got my vote!

892
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,820
[BEEGO]
Mine, too.

893
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,531
Uh, whatever. It's cool.

894
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,703
Oh, you guys, I couldn't
possibly take on

895
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:06,871
the responsibility...

896
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,456
[QUITTERIE]
Now you don't want it?

897
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,374
There aren't any
chairs left, stupid.

898
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,709
Sit down already.

899
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,628
[KANATA]
Uh‐‐ Heh.

900
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,340
Okay. I'm good.

901
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,508
All right, team! Let's go!

902
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,595
Hey, I was wondering if our
ship has a name or anything?

903
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,680
[KANATA]
Please don't cut me off!

904
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,934
I mean, come on.
Name of the ship?

905
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,894
Who cares if it has a name?

906
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,187
Uh‐‐

907
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:35,483
What's that? The
gold plate thing?

908
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,819
[ZACK]
"Per Aspera Ad Astra."

909
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,863
[FUNICIA]
What's that mean?

910
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:44,033
Aspera means hardship.
Astra is star.

911
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,994
It says "Overcome hardships
to reach your goal."

912
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,704
Oh. That's kinda awesome.

913
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,791
A lot better than Kanata's
lame survival tips, am I right?

914
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,961
[KANATA]
Low blow! Okay.

915
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,256
Actually, that old star word
might be kind of perfect.

916
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,758
All right guys,
I've made up my mind.

917
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,220
The ship's name is <i>Astra</i>.

918
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:14,397
Get ready! Our next
stop is... Vilavurs!

919
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,235
[KANATA] Activate
faster‐than‐light engines!
