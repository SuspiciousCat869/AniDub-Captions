3
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:02,247
[KANATA] It's real. How did
he get his hands on a gun?

4
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,583
Does this answer our question?

5
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,461
Is Ulgar the enemy?

6
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,046
[KANATA]
Hey, just put the gun down.

7
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,881
No, It belongs to me.

8
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,549
I'll do what I want with it.

9

What should we do?

10
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,887
[KANATA] Listen. If you wanna
make the rules, then fine.

11
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,557
You have the gun, so that means
you're the one in charge here.

Don't be stupid.

It's not like I wanna
be your king or whatever.

14
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,314
By the way, I should
prob'ly tell you.

15
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,066
I'm not the assassin.

16
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,859
Then tell us why!

17
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,903
Sorry, but this is personal.

18
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,822
Luca. It's time for you to die.

19
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,240
What the heck, man?

20
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,117
Won't you tell me
what I did first?

21
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,869
You at least owe me that much!

22
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,330
I thought we were
supposed to be friends!

23
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,878
If you want some
sort of explanation,

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,838
then ask Marco Esposito.

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,092
My dad? So this is about him?

26
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,219
Isn't his father a politician?

27
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,763
Yeah, pretty sure
he's a senator.

28
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,266
[ULGAR] I've been tracking
the man for years.

29
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,394
I want him dead.

30
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,272
[ULGAR] I used to
have an older brother.

31
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,822
[ULGAR]
Everyone loved him and hated me.

32
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,323
Even my family.

33
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,575
For some reason,
most everyone in my life

34
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,286
acted like I didn't exist.

35
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,705
It didn't bother me.

36
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:30,001
I prefer to be alone.
That's just how I am.

37
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,088
But my brother was different.

38
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,424
Despite the lousy
people in my life,

39
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,968
he was the only one
who was nice to me.

40
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,594
The only one.

41
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,722
He became a
freelance journalist,

42
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,181
wanted to expose the dirty deals

43
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,101
of politicians and
big companies.

44
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,854
I admired my brother,
and I found myself

45
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,315
wanting to become a
journalist just like him.

46
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,027
[ULGAR'S BROTHER] Hey, Ulgar.
Is there anything you want?

47
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:00,282
Me? Uh...

48
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,533
Not that I can think of.

49
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,827
Wow, talk about boring.

50
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,170
Look, you only get to be
a teenager once, man.

51
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,298
You can go out and make the
most of it, or you can waste it.

52
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,925
Either way, it's all over
once you're grown up.

53
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,636
As an adult, you'll have to
make your own way in life.

54
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,804
Spend some time thinkin' 'bout

55
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,306
what kind of life
you wanna lead.

56
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,517
'Cause the folks who don't
end up being left behind.

57
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,353
[ULGAR]
I want a hat.

58
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,606
Huh?

59
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,775
[ULGAR]
'Cause I wanna be like you.

60
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,862
[ULGAR]
Then one day, my brother died.

61
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:43,784
He fell off a building.
The police ruled it a suicide.

62
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,535
Before he died, he mentioned

63
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,205
he was worried about
something at work.

64
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,831
Looks like I got
mixed up in somethin'

65
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,708
more dangerous than I thought.

66
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,836
Not that I intend to
back down, of course.

67
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,423
[ULGAR]
He was writing a story

68
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,301
about the senator,
Marco Esposito,

69
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,553
and some illegal
campaign donations.

70
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,389
My brother would
never commit suicide.

71
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,225
[gasps]

72
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,354
[ULGAR]
Tell me something.

73
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,272
What kind of person would
buy his little brother

74
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,609
a birthday gift, and then
turn around and kill himself?

75
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,070
[STUDENTS gasp]

76
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,991
[ULGAR] Your father is the
one who killed my brother.

77
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,244
[KANATA]
Do you have any proof?

78
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,247
If I did, I would have
accused him in public!

79
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:35,752
[ULGAR]
Got anything to add, Luca?

80
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,379
Yeah, I wouldn't
put it past him.

81
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,714
Luca!

82
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,801
I vowed that one day
I'd avenge my brother.

83
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,431
[ULGAR] In preparation,
I honed my marksmanship

84
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:52,561
with a training gun.
Shot, after shot, after shot.

85
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,189
It was weird, but shooting
made me feel relaxed.

86
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,692
It's crazy, but my revenge
was the only thing

87
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:02,779
that made my complete garbage
fire of a life worth living.

88
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,907
Just what kind of
life did you have?

89
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,618
I trained, but I knew
getting a real gun

90
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,203
would be pretty tough.

91
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,163
Thought I'd have to steal one
from the cops or hit up

92
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:16,167
the black market,
until I stumbled on this.

93
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,213
An actual gun stored
on board the <i>Astra</i>.

94
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,300
Must've been destiny.

95
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,302
Finding the gun was
a sign telling me

96
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,138
that it was time to finish
my quest for revenge.

97
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,265
And on top of that,
we were grouped together.

98
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,892
Destiny again.

99
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,852
I know how the Espositos work.

100
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,897
It's nepotism, passing their
power down to their sons.

101
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,649
Luca's the oldest,
so he's the heir.

102
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,694
Marco is about to understand
what true pain feels like.

103
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,197
To have your loved ones
torn away from you!

104
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,824
[KANATA]
Stop this, Ulgar!

105
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,743
Don't do something
you'll regret!

106
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,620
You can share your pain with us!

We're friends‐‐that's
what we're here for!

I don't have any friends!

109
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,501
My brother was the
only one who cared!

110
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,086
He was better than me.

111
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:04,966
He was strong.
And he had a kind heart!

112
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,886
He showed his useless
brother the light!

113
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,307
Why did he have to
be the one to die?

114
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,185
Especially when I was
the worthless son?

115
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,315
If only it were you instead.

You have to die, Luca.

118
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,785
It won't work. I'm in the
same boat you are, Ulgar.

119
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,287
Because my dad doesn't
love me, either.

What?

00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,333
I'm not actually the heir
to the Esposito family.

122
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,377
My dad's been grooming
my little brother

is clinically ambiguous.

You see, my whole life,
I was raised as a boy.

144
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,819
I always felt a little
bit different,

145
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,280
but I never thought
too much about it.

146
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,157
Didn't realize the extent
until my parents

took me to the hospital.

Like you saw, I have
both characteristics.

160
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,648
Shut up, you're lying!

161
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,733
No, it's true.

162
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,195
And I can prove it to you
when we get back home.

163
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,406
My parents had a really tough
time conceiving children.

164
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,117
They needed an heir,
so they took me in.

165
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,827
Something about
an artist they knew

166
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,038
who couldn't raise
their own child.

167
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,836
[KANATA] So Luca is adopted,
too? Just like Funi?

168
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,338
It seems like we all
have some kind of

169
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,090
issue with our parents.

170
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,218
Maybe that's the common
element that connects us.

171
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,594
After my adoption,

172
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,179
my little brother
Riccardo was born

173
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,431
and then we found out
I was intersex.

174
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,976
Naturally, my dad shifted
his attention to my brother.

175
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,020
So then why did you hide it?

176
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,065
[LUCA] It's not like I'm
intentionally hiding it.

177
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,316
I'm registered as a boy

178
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,027
and that's how
I identify myself.

179
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,322
Thing is, I know that my body's
gonna continue to change

180
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,949
as I keep growing older.

181
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,867
But I'll still always be me.

182
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:21,287
So I don't treat it like
it's a big deal or anything.

183
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,581
But... Dad's different.

184
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,750
Our family's not so flexible.

185
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:29,379
I'm not a man, so I'm
not fit to be the heir.

186
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,756
Killing me off isn't gonna
hurt him in the least.

187
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,758
[ULGAR]
That's impossible! C'mon!

188
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,052
I mean, what kind of
parent wouldn't be‐‐?

189
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,307
[LUCA] Yeah. You of all
people would understand

190
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,226
what this feels like.

191
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,771
You can shoot me,
but it won't help.

192
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,399
Though if it did upset my dad...

193
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,401
That'd make me happy.

194
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,285
[ULGAR'S BROTHER]
Ulgar! Come on, hurry up!

195

Check it out!

196
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,877
This is my secret spot.

197
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:09,794
Whenever I'm feelin' down,

198
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,672
I come here and
shout my lungs out.

199
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,592
No one can hear us up here.

200
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,885
A headwind?

201
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,761
It's time. Do it!

202
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,140
[ULGAR'S BROTHER]
Shout!

203

Damn it.

[ULGAR screams]

206
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,822
[KANATA] So the thing
that ties us together

207
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,450
is that we all have
issues with our parents?

208
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,743
That doesn't make sense.

209
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,745
It's not a reason to kill us.

210
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,207
Besides, some of us
have loving parents.

211
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,583
What is it, then?

212
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,377

You did really well.

Kanata, I've gotta admit,
you're pretty awesome.

268
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,537
I apologize. Not only
did I try to kill you,

269
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,957
but I also made you
reveal your secret.

270
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,502

you get naked...

Sorry, what did you just say?

I'm afraid I didn't
catch the last part.

Oh. I um, made you strip.

275
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:12,972
Seems as if someone's

00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,308
taking advantage
of Ulgar's guilt.

277
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,059
Nah, it's cool, man.

278
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,854
It seriously doesn't
bother me. In fact...

279
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,565
I'm glad it gave me the
opportunity to tell everyone.

280
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,902
It's kind of a relief.
Still though.

281
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,112
If my dad did something
behind the scenes

282
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,281
to cause your brother's death,

283
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,074
then I'm the one who's sorry.

284
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,410
In a way, you and I
are very similar.

285
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,330
So I think I can understand
part of what you're feeling.

286
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,790
And... I'm not the
only one either.

287
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,251
Everyone here has
their own issues.

288
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,836
But in the end,
that's what makes us

Don't think for
a second this means

00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,803
I'm letting your
dad off the hook.

293
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,431
I intend to investigate
his actions

get home in one piece

[ZACK]
May I have your attention?

300
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,405
There's something
I wish to discuss.

301
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,574
Would a senator
really kill someone

302
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,077
over campaign donations?

303
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,496
Politicians are accused
of dishonest behavior

304
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,291
all the time. If Ulgar's
brother really was murdered,

305
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,378
then I highly doubt that
was the reason for it.

306
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,172
Perhaps while investigating
Marco Esposito,

307
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,008
he discovered there was
something much bigger at play.

308
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,385
You think?

309
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,179
Looks like I got
mixed up in somethin'

310

more dangerous than I thought.

[LUCA] Bigger than a
campaign finance scandal?

312
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,103
I'm not sure what that could be,

313
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,730
but I wonder if it's somehow
related to all of us

314
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:48,442
getting lost in space like this?

315
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,487
The traitor onboard is
just part of the puzzle.

316
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,823
Somebody else set all this up.

317

They've been giving the orders

318
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,910
from behind the scenes
the whole time.

319
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,997
[ULGAR'S BROTHER] Listen.
Don't let the adults fool you.

320
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,584
[ULGAR]
We're clearly being lied to.

321
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,961
I'm gonna become a journalist.

322
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,589
Then I can uncover the
truth about everything!

323
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,011
[ULGAR]
Here's the gun.

324
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,097
It got wet, but
it's still usable.

325
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,432
[KANATA]
You hold onto it.

326
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,850
[gasps]

327
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,810
Seriously? But I almost shot‐‐

328
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,895
[KANATA]
No "buts" about it, dude.

329
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,940
You're the only one here
who can shoot that thing.

330
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,984
You're in charge
of the gun, Ulgar.

331
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,111
We're counting on you.

332
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,155
I'm counting on you, Ulgar.

333
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,872
Aye yeah.

334
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,793
[ARIES]
Team B‐5, Camp Log.

335
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,297
After narrowly escaping a
tsunami on the planet Arispade,

336
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,301
we decided it was time to
proceed to the fourth planet.

337
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,511
This incident was tough,
but it gave us a chance

338
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,055
to share some things
about ourselves

339
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,057
with the rest of the team.

340
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,725
Our journey's proving
to be a long one,

341
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,977
but it's never boring.

342
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,438
I still wouldn't say
Ulgar's the talkative type,

343
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,941
but he's definitely changed
a little from before.

344
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,234
We treat Luca like a boy,

345
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,904
just like we did
from the beginning.

346
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,864
Let's sumo wrestle!

347
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,449
[ARIES] I think the other
boys feel kind of

348
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,534
awkward sometimes, though.

349
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,329
If you ask me, it's nice
getting to see him express

350
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,498
more of his feminine side,

351
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,458
Listen up. If you don't
stop messin' with me,

352
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,334
then I'll‐‐!

353
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,794
[gasps]

354
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,838
[LUCA] Um. Can we leave
them out of this?

355
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,759
[CHARCE]
Using his guilt to pick on him.

356
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:40,513
Yeah, he certainly knows
when to play the right cards.

357
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,223
[ARIES] I feel like it
was a pretty big relief

358
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,184
for Luca to air everything out.

359
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,145
I'd say all of us
are on good terms now!

360
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,194
[ARIES]
Ouch! I just cut my finger.

361
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,195
[gasps]

362
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,447
[ARIES] I don't think
it's too serious, though.

363
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,241
[CHARCE]
Let me see it!

364
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,742
Oh, good, it doesn't
look too deep,

365
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,328
so as long as we bandage it,
you should heal right up.

366
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,373
Make sure you get Quitterie
to check it out later, okay?

367
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,208
No, it's fine! I swear!

368
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,292
[CHARCE]
I'm so sorry.

369
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,503
I shouldn't have grabbed
your hand without asking.

370
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,796
[ARIES]
I didn't notice,

371
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,047
‐‐now I'm double embarrassed!
‐‐[stomach growls]

372
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,092
[ARIES gasps] Make that
triple embarrassed!

373
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,885
You know something, Charce?

374
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,805
I'm starting to realize that
you're extra nice to Aries here.

375
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,682
Like you're always
looking out for her.

376
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,768
‐‐[ARIES] Uh...
‐‐[CHARCE] Hm?

377
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,895
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm nice to everyone!

378
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,107
[QUITTERIE] Didn't say
you weren't. I said "extra."

379
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,900
I'm just curious as to
why you tend to give

380
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,193
Aries special treatment.

381
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,529
Go ahead and explain.
I'm dying to know!

382
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,156
[CHARCE] I'll leave it
to your imagination.

383
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:44,493
[QUITTERIE] Whoa, scandalous!
Did you guys hear that?

384
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,620
Yummy!

385
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,080
[ARIES]
So, anyway, Charce.

386
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,374
What kind of classes
are you taking in school?

387
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,751
I've been wanting to
learn more about you,

388
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,877
and figured now would be good,

389
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,212
since we're all opening up
to each other and stuff.

390
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,381
Yeah, I bet you wanna
learn more about him.

391
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,341
[QUITTERIE]
A budding love triangle!

392
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,301
Yeah, same here.

393
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,803
I wanna know your super
awesome origin story!

394
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,513
[LUCA] Kanata the
Clueless strikes again.

395
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,389
[QUITTERIE]
I know, right?

396
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,017
Whatever he's eating's
making him dumb!

397
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,602
I bet you're taking biology.

398
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,895
So, you gotta tell me.

399
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,480
Is it actually true
that the teacher

400
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,440
wears some ridiculous hairpiece?

401
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,525
While it is true I take biology,

402
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,195
I can't say that I've ever
noticed the teacher's hairpiece.

403
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,406
Oh. I'm in Bio, and believe me,
it's really noticeable.

404
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,075
The thing pretty much covers
the whole top of his head.

405
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,994
C'mon, seriously?

406
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,205
Our school only has
the one biology class,

407
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,957
so you obviously had to have
been classmates before this.

408
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,418
[laughs] Oh, I'm afraid
I've never noticed.

409
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,711
[LUCA]
Well yeah, you guys probably

410
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,922
never talked much
until camp, right?

411
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,757
Yeah, I guess so.

412
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,551
[KANATA]
Something up, Aries?

413
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,345
It's strange, but...

414
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:48,557
...I don't remember ever
seeing Charce in class before.

415
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,768
Yes. Makes sense. Who
would remember someone

416
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,977
they never even spoke to?

417
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,729
It's understandable
you'd forget.

418
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:54,980
[ARIES]
But I wouldn't forget.

419
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:55,856
Uh...

420
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,193
I remember the face of everyone
in all of my classes.

421
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:03,447
Uh‐huh! I actually have
a photographic memory.

422
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,115
[ARIES] I may have
transferred late in the year,

423
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,535
but I still went to biology
class several times

424
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:10,037
before we left for camp.

425
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,289
I made a conscious effort
to remember the faces

426
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,251
of every classmate,
so I'm positive.

427
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,963
There's not a doubt in my mind,
Charce wasn't in that class.

428
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,382
Be honest with me. Are you...

429
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,343
[ARIES]
...hiding something?
