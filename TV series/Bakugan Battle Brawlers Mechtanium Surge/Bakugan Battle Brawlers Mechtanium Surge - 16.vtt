00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.190
COMPUTER VOICE: Deletion of Area B complete.

00:10:58.224 --> 00:11:01.360
DAN: [angry grunt]

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:02.528
SPECTRA: You okay?

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:04.163
DAN: Huh?!

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:06.966
DAN: Hehe...Talk about a crummy reunion, huh?!

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:10.503
SPECTRA: You've changed, my friend. You're not the same guy

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:12.671
who brought me out of my darkness.

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:16.709
And the Battle Brawlers...seem to be fractured.

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:18.878
SPECTRA: How very sad.

00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:27.586
DAN: Hey...wait...!

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.921
DAN: [frustrated grunt]

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.056
MARUCHO: Dan!

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:31.791
SHUN: What's wrong?!

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:37.763
DAN: [groan, pain reax] [panting]

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:41.600
SPECTRA: We can't lose this fight Helios!

00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:42.968
DAN: What's happening Zenthon?!

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:45.905
You're supposed to be a friend not an enemy!

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:49.108
MARUCHO: You went back to New Vestroia?!

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.976
DAN: It seemed like a good idea to go back there

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.445
while we tried to get control

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:54.747
over Drago's powers and Zenthon.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.782
And the plan actually worked.

00:11:56.816 --> 00:12:00.052
PAIGE: Well you could've fooled me with that last display.

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:02.988
RAFE: You clearly had no control over Mechtogan Zenthon.

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:05.958
Why don't you just admit it Dan?

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:07.593
DAN: Who are these punks?!

00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:09.695
SHUN: Rafe and Paige are our friends.

00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:10.930
DAN: Since when?

00:12:10.963 --> 00:12:12.898
MARUCHO: Since they helped us out

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:14.366
in battle when you weren't around.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.636
PAIGE: I can't believe this guy is your mighty, leader.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.972
RAFE: Don't you mean, ex-leader, Paige?

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.340
DAN: What did you say?!

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:23.142
Come on, speak up, pal!

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:25.711
PAIGE: Marucho took over as leader while you were gone.

00:12:25.744 --> 00:12:29.381
DAN: [gasp]

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:32.318
SHUN: You left us no choice, Dan.

00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:34.220
SHUN: We had to make a decision...

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:37.790
and it was the best for the entire team.

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:40.526
DAN: Well...fine then.

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:42.261
DAN: Thanks for stepping up...

00:12:42.294 --> 00:12:43.262
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:44.964
DAN: ...I really appreciate it.

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:46.532
MARUCHO: Huh?!

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:49.068
DAN: But you don't need to worry about that anymore.

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:50.803
Drago and I are back and better than ever.

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:55.207
So just sit back and let me take the reins, okay?!

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:58.244
Cool! [laughter]

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:00.212
SHUN: [angry grunt] Listen you...

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.414
RAFE: Are you really that arrogant?!

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.884
RAFE: I just can't believe what I'm hearing!

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:06.852
PAIGE: You've got some nerve pal!

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:09.622
The way you're disrespecting your teammates like this!

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:11.023
DAN: What do you mean?!

00:13:11.056 --> 00:13:12.758
PAIGE: I mean you pulled a runner

00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:14.793
and left them in the dust. And now you think you can

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:17.530
just stroll back in and pick up where you left off?!

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:18.931
Not cool dude!

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:21.867
RAFE: It's time you realized your actions have consequences.

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:26.105
DRAGO: Dan, we should tell them...about everything.

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.873
MARUCHO: What aren't you telling us?!

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:30.409
DAN: Well, all this stuff with Drago and his new powers...

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:32.611
somehow we're linked to this creep named Mag Mel

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:34.580
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:35.881
SHUN: Linked how Dan?

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.950
PAIGE: Yeah! What does that mean?

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:39.685
DAN: I don't know exactly but...

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:41.720
I've got this really strong feeling that they're the ones

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:43.756
responsible for the rampage that

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:47.493
just happened in Bakugan Interspace.

00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:50.129
MARUCHO: What ever gave you that idea Dan?

00:13:50.162 --> 00:13:53.098
DAN: Whenever there's a spike in his anger,

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:56.402
I feel it in the centre of my being. The same with Drago.

00:13:56.435 --> 00:14:00.005
It's one of the reasons he was losing control of his powers.

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:02.942
SHUN: Why didn't you tell us this before, Dan?

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:05.644
MARUCHO: Yeah Dan, we had a right to know.

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:08.714
DAN: Well yeah, but don't sweat it guys...

00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:10.082
Drago and I have a handle...

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:11.917
MARUCHO: Enough, OK! DAN: Huh?!

00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:16.155
MARUCHO: Everything is not all right! Do you understand me?!

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:20.092
Uh...I'm just upset that I had to delete a large part of

00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:23.329
Bakugan Interspace. Maybe it's best if you go home

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:26.332
and rest while I get the repair process started.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:28.767
DAN: Sure, I guess.

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:31.203
PAIGE : Where are you going?

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:34.940
SHUN: I'm going to do a final sweep for stray Chaos Bakugan.

00:14:34.974 --> 00:14:43.916
We don't need any more surprises.

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:45.150
SHUN: Why, Dan?!

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:46.986
TAYLEAN: Just because he's back, doesn't mean

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:49.154
you can lose focus on what you need to do.

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:55.194
SHUN: [frustrated grunt]

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:57.196
DRAGO: It seems like we have some work to do

00:14:57.229 --> 00:15:00.099
on repairing our relationships with Shun and Marucho.

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:01.901
DAN: Just gimme a break...

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.803
it's not like we were on a spa holiday.

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:06.572
DRAGO: That's true, but maybe we should still...

00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:09.141
DAN: I don't wanna talk about it anymore!

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:11.076
BOY #1: Hey look, it's Dan Kuso.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.945
BOY #2: Nice of him to show his face after

00:15:12.978 --> 00:15:15.347
the Chaos Bakugan trashed most of Interspace.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:16.982
That guy's a total coward.

00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:18.317
GIRL #1: Ya no kidding.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.286
BOY #1: What a joke!

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:22.921
DAN: [angry grunt] Hey Noah!

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:24.223
NOAH: [gasp]

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:25.824
DAN: I saw you almost take a blast back there.

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:27.359
Are you okay, pal?!

00:15:27.393 --> 00:15:29.261
NOAH: Why the heck did you have to come back, huh?!

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:35.834
Things were just fine without you!

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:38.337
BEN: ...but it makes no difference.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.508
DAN: This stinks.

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:44.143
MARUCHO: Maybe we were too hard on them.

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:45.678
They were only trying to help.

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:55.621
TRISTAR: You're too quick to forgive.

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:57.790
BEN: The boss isn't here? Where could he have

00:15:57.823 --> 00:16:02.695
disappeared to this time? Ah man!

00:16:02.728 --> 00:16:03.996
MIYOKO: Make sure you eat everything

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:06.398
on your plate okay sweetie?

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:08.867
You're growing and, well your body needs to catch up

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:11.670
to that big head of yours.

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:14.773
MIYOKO: Oh don't look so serious. Your father had

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.710
a giant head too when he was your age but he grew

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:21.380
into it, just fine. And just like him honey, you're going to

00:16:21.413 --> 00:16:23.082
be the handsomest boy on the block.

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:24.850
DAN: May I be excused please?

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:28.354
DAN: [grunt] I don't understand!

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.289
Our training was going so well. We were totally

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:32.091
in control of things and then as soon

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:34.126
as we get back it all goes crazy again.

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:38.297
What's happening? Why can't we get a handle on this?

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.465
DRAGO: Dan...

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:40.933
DAN: Hmmm?!

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:42.401
DRAGO: If we put our heads together we should be able

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:45.404
to figure this out.

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:47.639
DAN: You're right buddy. We can't let one bad bounce,

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:54.780
drive a wedge between us again. We've gotta stay in synch.

00:16:54.813 --> 00:16:56.582
SHUN: Don't you find it odd that after such an

00:16:56.615 --> 00:17:01.453
intense rampage, the Chaos Bakugan just disappear?

00:17:01.487 --> 00:17:04.022
TRISTAR: Something definitely smells rotten.

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:07.359
PAIGE: Maybe they just got freaked out and ran away.

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:10.029
MARUCHO: Based on the behaviour they've shown, I don't buy it.

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:12.498
PAIGE: So what then Marucho?!

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.933
MARUCHO: I wish I knew.

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.770
SHUN: Whatever the case, we can't let our guard down.

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:19.171
MARUCHO: Shun's right. We have to be

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:21.373
even more vigilant than ever before.

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:23.275
WOLFURIO: We understand.

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:25.277
SHUN: Then we're all clear guys.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.645
TRISTAR: But what about Dan and Drago.

00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:30.582
Should we talk to them too?

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:40.759
MAG MEL: Finally the time has come.

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:50.836
RAZENOID: At last we are...freeeeeeee!

00:17:50.836 --> 00:18:00.646
RAZENOID: At last we are...freeeeeeee!

00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:10.722
[earth shaking rumble]

00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:20.365
[earth shaking rumble]

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:34.480
MAG MEL: First stop...Gundalia!

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:48.927
MAG MEL: Arise, Razenoid!

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:58.937
[mighty roar]

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:08.380
DAN: [gasp]

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:10.315
Aaaaahhhhh!

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:11.817
DRAGO: Dan! What is it?

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.620
DAN: It's it's...Gundalia!

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:15.721
DRAGO: What?!

00:19:15.754 --> 00:19:18.924
DAN: I had another vision...

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:22.060
...Gundalia 's in danger!

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:24.630
PAIGE: What?! Did you say, Gundalia?

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:27.599
RAFE: You came all this way to tell us about a dream?

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:31.203
DAN: It's not a dream, it's a vision and it's real okay!

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:34.439
Mag Mel is heading to Gundalia and he's gonna attack!

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:36.475
PAIGE: You're crazy man! Why should we believe

00:19:36.508 --> 00:19:39.144
some nutty dream you had?

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.446
DAN: You better not be calling me a liar.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.482
PAIGE: I'm not calling you a liar!

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:46.018
PAIGE: I'm calling you a crazy person, got it?

00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:49.555
DAN: [angry grunt] SHUN: Hmmmph.

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:53.025
PAIGE: [gasp] SHUN: [gasp]

00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:55.894
PAIGE: Oh it's a distress call!

00:19:55.928 --> 00:20:00.599
RAFE: For real?

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:04.436
PAIGE: The Chaos Bakugan are invading my home!

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:05.604
MARUCHO: Huh?!

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:07.372
SHUN: So they didn't just vanish.

00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:09.241
They found another target.

00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:11.209
MARUCHO: But of all the places they could invade,

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:12.945
why Gundalia?

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:14.746
TRISTAR: Who cares?! Dan's dream was right!

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.482
They're in trouble!

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:21.019
PAIGE: I've gotta go! Let's roll, Boulderon!

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.120
BOULDERON: Right behind you!

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:23.622
RAFE: Paige, wait a second!

00:20:23.655 --> 00:20:25.457
PAIGE: There's no time! I've gotta get back!

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.728
MARUCHO: Hey, slow down! We'll go with you Paige!

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:30.896
PAIGE: Are you sure?!

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:32.731
MARUCHO: Of course! You're a Battle Brawler!

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:35.734
That means you're part of a team and we fight together!

00:20:35.767 --> 00:20:37.803
RAFE: Marucho's right.

00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:40.238
PAIGE: Cool!

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:41.607
DAN: Hold up, guys!

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.942
RAFE and MARUCHO: [gasp] SHUN: Hmmm?!

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:45.510
DAN: We're going too.

00:20:45.544 --> 00:20:46.678
PAIGE: No thank-you.

00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:48.947
RAFE: After the damage you caused in Interspace?

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:50.649
Sorry, it's too risky.

00:20:50.682 --> 00:20:52.784
DAN: I'm not asking, I'm telling you!

00:20:52.818 --> 00:20:56.722
MARUCHO, SHUN, RAFE and PAIGE: [gasp]

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:59.558
DAN: I'm the original Battle Brawler...

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:07.265
You're not cutting me out, of this fight!

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:09.067
DAN: After we fought to rid Interspace of the Chaos

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.937
Bakugan, they turned their sights on Gundalia.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.273
That's the planet we brought peace to when we brokered

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:16.408
a treaty between them and Neathia. The last thing

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:19.077
these guys need is another war, so the rest of

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.545
the Battle Brawlers and I decided to jump in

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:22.814
and help out. We immediately hooked up with our old buddy

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:25.751
Ren, but Mag Mel somehow managed to stay one step

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:27.319
ahead of us the whole time.

00:21:27.352 --> 00:21:29.621
Tune in to see just how spooky it is.

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.690
It's like he knows this planet better than anyone else.

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:36.628
But how can that be? Is it possible he's been here before?

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:37.663
