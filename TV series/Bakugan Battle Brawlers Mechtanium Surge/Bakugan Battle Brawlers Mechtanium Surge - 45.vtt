WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.475
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.943
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.911
But then out of nowhere, we were invaded

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.414
by these mysterious evil Mechtogan,

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.182
who were intent on destroying everything!

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.752
Cordegon, Slycerak,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.820
Exostriker, and Mandibor were their names.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.556
And leading them was this clown, Wiseman.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.091
They also had help form an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.359
called the Nonets.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.595
Luckily for us, we had our own secret weapon

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.331
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.833
So we fought back, because no one is gonna take our freedom.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.502
Not now, not ever!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.638
\u266a What are you gonna do

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.608
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.044
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.945
\u266a You gotta give it your all

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.381
\u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, this is the final stand \u266a

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.617
\u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.318
\u266a The power's in your hands

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:55.021
\u266a Two worlds collide on the inside \u266a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.527
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.196
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.898
\u266a This is Bakugan \u266a

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:13.173
Finally, I am rid of all the vermin who have stood in the way

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.275
of my master plan!

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:18.044
Now I can get on with the business of destroying

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:21.915
Bakugan City and all those who inhabit it.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:22.982
What?

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:26.953
Where did you miserable insects come from?

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.556
We've come back from the future to stop you in your tracks.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:32.091
Your days of destruction are over!

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.893
We're gonna wipe you from the history books!

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.933
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in:

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:47.106
\u266a

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.609
Hey, you guys! Welcome back. It's your favourite

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.445
roving reporter Julie here!

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.814
Live from downtown Bakugan City!

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:57.851
We're here to cover all the festivities happening today

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:00.186
as we commemorate the one year anniversary

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.422
of the day the Bakugan came to live on Earth.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:03.656
(Laughing)

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.092
As you all know, things have been a bit insane

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.761
around the city these days, so I thought I'd turn the microphone

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.497
over to you to see what the public is thinking

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.131
on this historic day.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:15.168
Are you serious? Has it really been a year already?

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.736
What a surprise!

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.738
BAKUGAN: The first few months really flew by, those were good times

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.140
with lots of happy memories.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.574
Lately that hasn't been the case, though,

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.376
now that Baku Arenas have been shut down.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.546
It's understandable given the threat that Wiseman posed.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.015
We're just hopeful that the Brawlers can defeat our enemies

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.518
so that one day, things will get back to normal.

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:34.020
ALL: Bakugan battling is the coolest!

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.955
BOTH: We love brawling, too.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.991
ALL: The Bakugan are our friends!

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.330
For reals? You're saying Dan and the others just disappeared?

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.299
MIRA: Sort of. They were heading to Wiseman's secret hideout

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.400
when we lost contact with them.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.135
And we haven't been able to raise them

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:50.136
on the Bakumeter since.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.771
Oh my gosh! Dan!

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.373
No need to worry, Julie.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:54.741
We're on the case.

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:57.443
We're gonna find them no problem.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:58.945
I'm sure everything is fine

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:01.681
and there's a reasonable explanation for it.

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:03.049
We should hurry, Runo.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.150
Coming!

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:05.852
Okay, guys, wait!

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.320
Huh?

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.789
Just hold on a second, okay?

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.090
What?

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:12.926
I've decided I'm coming along with you too.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.794
Uh, I don't think that's a good idea.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:18.131
DAN: Mira, Runo!

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:20.567
We're here!

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.834
I know this is gonna sound weird,

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.670
but is Bakugan City still there?

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.239
Yeah, of course it is. Where else would it be, Dan?

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:29.042
Are you sure that you guys are all right over there?

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.209
SHUN: We're fine.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.744
MARUCHO: We'll explain things later.

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.880
Marucho! Shun! Hey, guys!

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:35.214
It's good to hear your voices.

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.951
We were super worried about all of you.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.385
Glad you're okay.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.553
Looks like we made it, guys.

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:42.855
And not a minute too late.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:46.859
We've been given a second chance

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:49.028
to avoid that horrible future we saw.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:53.967
Failure is not an option, everyone. Let's win this!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.669
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Your arrogance is so absurd!

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:59.205
It's almost pathetic, boy.

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:01.574
You don't stand a chance against me!

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:02.842
(Menacing laughter)

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.277
Listen up, Runo.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.713
We've got some unfinished business to take care of

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.014
but as soon as we're through,

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.482
we'll be home to celebrate with all of you.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:11.384
(All gasping)

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.453
Dan, wait! Come back!

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:14.721
Hm...

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:19.926
\u266a

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.194
Okay, you guys!

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:23.630
Let's get this party started!

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:26.332
Ability Activate!

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.034
Dragon Asteroid!

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:29.435
Attack!

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:35.275
It's going to take more than that.

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:37.110
Ability Activate!

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.812
Slash Boomerang!

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:45.485
(Growling)

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:47.053
My turn.

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:49.222
Ability Activate!

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:50.857

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.026
You're gonna pay for what you did to Gunz.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.765
Ability Activate!

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.768
Illusion Stealth Confusion!

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.536
Now you see us...

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.671
Now... You don't!

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:13.279
\u266a

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:16.082
Ability Activate!

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:19.085
Super Explosion Burning!

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:21.154
This way, big bro.

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:23.156
Right behind you!

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.660
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: And what do you think you're doing?

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:30.129
Ability Activate!

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.832
Supreme Jet Shock!

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.071
(Roaring)

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:43.242
(Groaning)

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:47.714
Let's get in there, Roxtor! Ability Activate!

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:49.649
Under Explosion!

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:54.654
(Laughing victoriously)

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:59.158
Where are you going?! Whoa!

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.993
(Booming)

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:03.529
Nice one!

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:05.498
We pulled the rug out from underneath him!

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:11.471
\u266a

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.306
DRAGO: Unbelievable!

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.442
RADIZEN: Seriously! Unbelievable!

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:19.612
\u266a

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:23.116
Did you really think it was going to be that easy?

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:28.287
I've gotta find them. They'll need as much help

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:30.389
as they can get against Mechtavius Destroyer.

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:31.924
Well, I'm coming with you.

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.860
You're a reporter. Not a battler.

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:35.928
Right, I am a reporter! That's why there's no way

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.597
I'm going to pass up the chance to cover what will be

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.132
my biggest scoop ever!

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:41.634
I mean, seriously! Talk about real life drama!

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.603
The viewers need to see this!

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:46.205
So make sure you keep up with me!

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.608
Are you coming too, Runo?

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:51.878
RUNO: Uh-uh. I'm gonna stay behind and man the battle suits

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.679
just in case those guys call for them.

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:55.748
Okay then.

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:58.651
Make sure you guys fly safe.

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:01.287
You got it, Runo.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.122
(Engine powering up)

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:09.228
We'll be back with Dan and the others in no time!

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:18.638
\u266a

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:22.108
Now it's my turn to play!

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:23.609
(Roaring)

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:29.348
(Booming)

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:30.616
He's not fooling around.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.818
No kidding!

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:35.488
Ugh... Okay, time to change strategy.

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:38.057
Drago! Reptak! Let's combine!

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.792
What do you mean \"combine,\" man?

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:42.495
It's a new trick we have in our arsenal, Gunz.

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:44.463
Check it out!

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:46.432
Are you ready, Reptak?

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:48.100
You bet, Drago!

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:51.604
BOTH: Bakugan Unite!

00:07:51.637 --> 00:08:01.647
\u266a

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:09.956
That's awesome!

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:14.026
Let's go! Jaakor! Skytruss! Orbeum!

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.965
(Roaring)

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:25.271

Combined ninjas Herculean power!

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.615
Radizen! Roxtor! Now!

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:37.850
You got it, boss! Aw, yeah!

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:39.852
RADIZEN: Bakugan Fuse!

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.424
Here comes your worst nightmare combo!

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:51.898

(Screeching)

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:02.108
United Ability Activate!

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:06.312
Supreme Jet Shock!

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:09.081
United Ability Activate!

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:13.586
Flame Harvey Cannon!

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.955
REPTAK: Time to annihilate this evil scourge!

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:18.925
\u266a

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.993
(Groaning)

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:24.997
\u266a

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:26.799
Keep the power up, you guys.

00:09:31.137 --> 00:09:34.340
(Booming)

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:35.408
No way!

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:39.412
(Menacing laughter)

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:46.319
\u266a

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:48.487
Whoa! Gotta go! Gotta go!

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:54.560
\u266a

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:57.797
Don't you understand?

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.632
No matter what you do,

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:02.401
no matter what you throw at me,

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:06.939
you insects will never be strong enough to take me down.

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:10.209
(Menacing laughter)

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:13.946
I will drive you to extinction, Bakugan!

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.917
MARUCHO: We might need our own Mechtogan to win this, guys!

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.155
Are you okay, Reptak?

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.461
He might be okay now, but he won't be for long!

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:29.729
Hah!

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.532
We have to fight fire with fire, guys!

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:37.470
After all, not all Mechtogan are evil scum like this lousy creep.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.507
Dragonoid Destroyer!

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.946
\u266a

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:48.814
Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:54.420
Gunz! Launch me onto Dragonoid Destroyer, too!

00:10:54.453 --> 00:10:57.189
What are you-- what are you talking about?

00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:58.791
Just trust me, okay?

00:10:58.824 --> 00:10:59.925
Come on!

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:04.430
Okay. Let's do it!

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:08.834
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:11.270
Let's go, Drago! Ready!

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:15.408
Bakugan Brawl!

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:16.942
DRAGO: Ride on!

00:11:22.948 --> 00:11:25.351
(Groaning)

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:28.988
Now you're just annoying me!

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:29.989
Runo?

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:32.425
Coordinates locked on!

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:35.394
Battle suit Fortatron, teleport to Jaakor!

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:38.464
And Combustoid, over to Reptak!

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:48.507
\u266a

00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.348
(Grunting)

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:59.952
RUNO: Connection complete! Battle systems are on,

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:02.088
and synchronization rate is 100%.

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:05.357
That's what I'm talking about!

00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:09.762
Jump, Thorak!

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:18.838
Come now, Flytris!

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:24.710
\u266a

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:26.212
Whoa...

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:30.149
\u266a

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:34.353
I am Thorak! Here to serve my masters,

00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:35.721
Shun and Jaakor.

00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:41.861
And I am Flytris, here to destroy any evil

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:44.396
that tries to harm Marucho and Radizen!

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:49.902
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Together, we will take down the evil Mechtogan

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.771
who sullies our name!

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:59.745
\u266a

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:01.947
Okay, everyone! Full on attack!

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:06.051
Battle suits! Digital camouflage on!

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:12.324
\u266a

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:13.859
Augh!

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:18.230
(Grunting) You traitors make me sick!

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.301
Change tactic!

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.308
Stay on him! Let's go!

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:32.711
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Earth Revolver! I'm going to enjoy this!

00:13:36.715 --> 00:13:38.083
Force Cannon!

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:41.353
You're going down!

00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:50.496
Your little tricks are all useless.

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:52.097
Surprise, dirt bag!

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:56.135
(Groaning)

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:58.604
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: You're going to pay for that one!

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:02.341
THORAK: You'll have to go through me first.

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:03.809
Attack!

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:05.444
(Booming)

00:14:05.477 --> 00:14:07.279
Get us in there, boss!

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:10.649
Fusion Ability Activate!

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:12.218
MARUCHO: Abyss Render!

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:13.619
FLYTRIS: Swirly action!

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:15.988
I can't wait to see the look on his face!

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:20.426
(Moaning)

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:22.094
How do ya like me now?!

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:29.235
\u266a

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:32.371
Brawlers are... totally awesome in action!

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:38.677
\u266a

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.280
Hey! Check it out! Over there!

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:47.820
\u266a

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:51.023
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you breaking news

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:53.492
from everybody's favourite roving reporter, Julie.

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:55.928
So get ready for it. Let's cut to her live

00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:58.831
from the scene somewhere near Volcano Island.

00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:01.333
Oh, what's going on? What the heck?!

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:04.003
Hey there, everyone. This is Julie here with you.

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:06.171
I'm bringing you all of the incredible action

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:08.207
from the Battle Brawlers' most fearsome fight ever

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.944
against Mechtavius Destroyer. This one's gonna be epic!

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:16.282
Mark my words!

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:18.484
Huh? Check it out!

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:21.720
That's my helicopter up there. Mira's here!

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.922
Attack!

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:26.325
Earth Revolver!

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:36.368
\u266a

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:50.783
MIRA (VOICEOVER): I don't understand. Dragonoid Destroyer is only working

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:52.451
at 90% of his full power.

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:54.920
Are you there, Dan? Huh? I'm here!

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.389
My diagnostic scan shows that Dragonoid Destroyer

00:15:57.423 --> 00:16:00.092
is only fighting at 90% efficiency.

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:03.462
But that doesn't make any sense!

00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:04.563
MIRA: You need to find out why, guys.

00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:07.766
Dragonoid Destroyer, what's going on?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.502
Why are you still holding back 10% of your powers?

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:15.007
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Not all of us are here yet!

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:20.746
\u266a

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:22.448
Whoa!

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:23.816
Dan, no!

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:27.119
(Moaning)

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:31.790
Hit him again, brother!

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.258
You got it!

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:38.697
Let me help!

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.165
Down you go!

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:46.438
Fusion Ability Activate! Terror Blue!

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:52.578
We'll keep fighting until you go down!

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.783
Let's hit him again!

00:16:57.816 --> 00:16:59.051
Hold on a second, big bro!

00:17:02.054 --> 00:17:03.522
What's happening?

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:05.524
Something's not right here.

00:17:05.557 --> 00:17:07.526
It... feels creepy!

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.995
No kidding! I'm totally freaked out.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.364
Let's hold back, Dan. It could be a trap.

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:13.999
I'm through toying with you.

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:17.035
I think it's finally time that I show you the full extent

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.837
of my mighty power!

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:21.206
Now stand back and bow at my feet!

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:25.911
Quick! Cross gear shield! Full power!

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:29.114
No one will harm my master!

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:32.551
\u266a

00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:33.585
JULIE: Whoa, hold on, everyone!

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:38.023
This is gonna get really rough!

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:40.125
(Booming)

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:44.830
\u266a

00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:46.965
(Gasping) Look down there!

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:53.405
\u266a

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:55.808
Volcano Island disappeared!

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:57.376
Oh my gosh!

00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:02.347
\u266a

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:05.017
Any final words, fools?

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.486
This isn't over!

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:10.456
Taking out the island would have used up a lot of his energy.

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:13.192
His defenses will probably be down now.

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:15.394
This is our chance to get the upper hand!

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:18.097
Okay! Let's hit him all together!

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.698
Force Cannon!

00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:23.168
(Grunting)

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:25.370
Fusion Ability Activate!

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:26.905
Terror Blue!

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:31.477
You're finished!

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:36.815
Not even close, you insolent swine!

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:38.817
What's wrong, am I too fast for you?

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.853
(Groaning)

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:48.961
I'll find his weak spot yet!

00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:50.696
Reptak! Take him down!

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.767
Only one problem, punk!

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.402
I don't have a weak spot!

00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:05.944
Are you okay there, Reptak, buddy?

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.413
Yeah. That hurt.

00:19:08.447 --> 00:19:11.283
Maybe you should battle with Dan as your partner instead of me.

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:12.284
So what do you think?

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:13.919
REPTAK: Why, Gunz?

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:16.655
GUNZ: I don't have the experience with jumping attacks or battle suits,

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:18.423
and it's a real liability now.

00:19:18.457 --> 00:19:20.225
I need to think of the greater good here.

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:23.362
We'll have lots of time to get back into sync once again

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:26.031
as partners as soon as this battle is over.

00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:29.401
Now go find Dan! Before it's too late, okay, Reptak?

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:32.604
Gunz...

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:35.908
GUNZ: You don't have to say anything! I'm okay with this. Really.

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:38.810
So do what you have to do to win, all right?

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.616
Lots has definitely happened since Wiseman kept you

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.986
locked away in a coma, but one fact still remains.

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:53.792
You are my one and true partner. End of story.

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:57.162
We're going to win this, and we're going to do it together.

00:19:58.463 --> 00:20:00.132
Thanks, my friend.

00:20:04.803 --> 00:20:06.405
Watch out, Jaakor!

00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:10.142
This is bad!

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:14.846
\u266a

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.815
(Booming)

00:20:16.848 --> 00:20:19.785
Gunz, no! Aw, snap!

00:20:19.818 --> 00:20:21.253
Huh? I don't believe it, guys!

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:28.860
\u266a

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.996
What? What the heck just happened?

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:33.198
REPTAK: That should have been a direct hit!

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:36.668
\u266a

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:41.306
Who is that?!

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.075
I am Chromopod!

00:20:43.108 --> 00:20:46.345
A Mechtogan born of my masters, Gunz and Reptak!

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:51.316
\u266a

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.485
We created...

00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:55.287
Our own Mechtogan!

00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:02.628
\u266a

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:04.529
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Now we're all here!

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:09.701
DAN: Now that Gunz and Reptak created their own

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:11.536
Mechtogan, Chromopod, we may actually have a chance

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.406
to take down Mechtavius Destroyer once and for all!

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:15.807
Not only do we have another giant wrecking ball

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:17.976
to add to our team, but also Dragonoid Destroyer

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.612
is finally battling at 100% of his full ability.

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:22.614
In fact, Dragonoid Destroyer undergoes some kind

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.916
of metamorphosis and turns golden right around

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.586
the same time that this crazy light show starts happening

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:30.055
in the skies over Bakugan City. But don't take my word for it!

00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:32.324
Tune in and check it out for yourself.

00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:34.293
This is the final Bakugan Battle ever!

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.895
But I promise you, we're saving the best for last!

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:46.905
