00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.543
When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.011
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.715
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.051
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.019
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.422
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.125
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.395
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.530
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.632
We just might have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:35.502
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.438
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.775
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:44.944
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.214
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:51.451
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:57.524
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.196
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.365
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.035
CHRIS: What's um, happening here?

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:13.840
SELLON: You poor fools still don't understand.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.749
DAN: They're on Mag Mel's side!

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:25.385
SELLON: It's true. We are artificial life forms...

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:28.755
created by Master Mag Mel to aid in his resurrection.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.757
CHRIS: It just can't be!

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.259
SOON: Tell us it's not true, Mistress!

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.861
SELLON: [evil chuckle]

SELLON: [panting] [grunt, pain reax]

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:01.788
SELLON: [grunt, panting reax]

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.560
SELLON: [gasp]

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.898
MAG MEL: Awake!

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.808
MAG MEL: Hmmmmmph!

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:29.549
[energy crackles]

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.629
SELLON: It's so beautiful...

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.001
SELLON: [groan] [gasp]

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:53.373
SELLON: [terrified gasps]

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.177
SELLON: [startled scream]

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.551
SELLON: [grunt, exertion reax]

CHRIS: Mistress Sellon!

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.025
SELLON: [gasp]

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.726
SOON: Is that you?

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.629
SELLON: [excited gasp] Hmmm?

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.499
SOON: Watch out! CHRIS: Watch out!

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.069
DRAGO: What's the plan, Marucho?

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.404
MARUCHO: It's to focus on keeping the remaining...

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.005
Chaos Bakugan occupied while I figure out...

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.907
if I can repair the access point.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.711
MARUCHO: I need you guys to run interference for me.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:34.581
DAN: We got your back. Isn't that right, Drago?

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.382
DRAGO: Absolutely.

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:37.483
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.252
RAFE: We have a situation, guys.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:41.120
DAN: Is it more Chaos Bakugan?

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:42.121
RAFE: Well...

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.923
PAIGE: It's way worse than that, okay?

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.959
Just get over here, now!

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:52.031
DAN and MARUCHO: [panting, running reax]

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.400
DAN: What's happening here?

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:58.571
DAN: Huh?

00:03:58.605 --> 00:03:59.939
DAN: Sellon!

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:02.041
MARUCHO: Hey, why would you bring her back here?

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.510
RAFE: What on Earth were the two of you thinking?

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.512
CHRIS: Wait! You don't understand!

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.848
SOON: Miss Sellon is on our side now.

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.216
DAN: Huh? Yeah right!?!

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:11.684
MARUCHO: How do you know?

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:14.253
SOON: Because she's been cast out.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.056
SOON: Mag Mel was furious with her...

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.660
for losing her last battle against us.

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:23.263
CHRIS: He stripped her of all her Bakugan and Mechtogan,

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.064
and was about to vanquish her when...

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.067
CHRIS: She used the last bit of her energy to break free,

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.704
and escape from his nasty clutches.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.607
SOON: But Mag Mel wasn't going to let her go that easily.

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.176
SOON: He sent Spyron to hunt her down and destroy her.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.511
And he would have succeeded...

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:41.381
if Chris and I hadn't shown up in time.

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.416
SOON: Please, friends. We wouldn't be asking...

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.918
for your help if we didn't really need it.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.489
PAIGE: Hah! You're nuts if you think we're gonna help her.

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:50.790
CHRIS: [angry grunt] Say what?

00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:52.525
PAIGE: Ya, you heard me, doll.

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:53.526
CHRIS: What did you say?

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.527
PAIGE: You heard...

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.895
DAN: Alright, alright, enough, you two!

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.363
SOON: We don't want to fight with you,

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:59.732
but we don't know what else to do.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:02.835
Mistress Sellon has nowhere else to go.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.444
SOON: Will you please help us protect her?

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.079
SHUN: Never! She's the enemy!

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:15.148
MARUCHO: [gasp] But Shun...

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.718
SHUN: No \"buts\". She's evil.

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:19.719
CHRIS: No way!

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.220
SOON: Please, she's not like that anymore.

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:23.289
I promise she's changed for good this time.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.957
CHRIS: You can't just leave her behind!

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:25.958
SHUN: Watch me!

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.661
CHRIS: Why are you so mean?

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:33.232
SOON: You don't understand. She's our...light.

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:37.103
SELLON: Would you like to see something beautiful.

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.105
SOON: Yes, please. CHRIS: Yes, please.

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:43.076
SELLON: Watch very closely now. Isn't it glorious,

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:44.777
and worth giving your life for?

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:49.282
SELLON: It is the light of... victory.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.953
SOON: From that moment on, Mistress Sellon took us...

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:56.723
under her wing and mentored us.

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.725
SOON: She took a pair of second rate Battlers,

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:02.195
and made us champions! We owe her everything.

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:04.630
CHRIS: She taught us how to be beautiful,

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:08.267
and elegant while unleashing our battling skills.

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:10.703
CHRIS: If it weren't for Mistress Sellon we'd be nothing,

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:12.505
so if you're serious about being our friends

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.006
then you have to help us.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.909
SOON: Can't you find it in your heart to...

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:18.745
CHRIS: ...forgive?

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:23.816
SHUN: Just get rid of her or you two are on your own!

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.951

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:26.018

PAIGE: Agreed!

SHUN: [sigh]

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.089
SELLON: I was always told that because I was...

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:13.593
an artificial life form created by Master Mag Mel,

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:16.028
the moment I was no longer useful to him...

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:19.966
my life would be over.

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:22.768

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:25.271
just take me away from you like that.

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:30.243

MARUCHO: Remember guys, aim for their horns if...

00:11:03.662 --> 00:11:06.565
you want to destroy them. It's their weak spot.

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.321
quickly, that'll take them down for good.

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:32.258

TRISTAR: Oh no! Are those more reinforcements?

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:25.144

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:26.912
that they're headed for Point X-10.

DAN: Huh? From Sellon?

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:18.931
SELLON: There's something urgent that I need to tell you, Dan.

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:24.436
SELLON: It has to do with the bond that you and Mag Mel share.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.738
DAN: Huh?

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:28.641

I'm in the middle of a fight here.

00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:46.892
you need to do, Dan.

00:13:46.926 --> 00:13:48.160

DAN: Sellon! Are you okay? What happened?

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.967
SELLON: [groan] Is that you, Dan?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.303
DAN: Yeah, I'm right here. Wake up.

SELLON: Mind your own business, Shun!

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.849
SELLON: This is just between Dan and I.

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:18.450
SHUN: You're wrong, Sellon!

00:15:18.484 --> 00:15:20.519
SHUN: Now give it back!

SELLON: I wish we had more time...

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:18.911
to see this through properly, Shun.

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:21.146
I've always respected you as a battler.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.815
SELLON: Even though you're nothing more,

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:25.250
than a lowly human.

00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:26.752
SHUN: [grunt] Be quiet!

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:29.121
SELLON: To tell you the truth, I've always thought

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:31.457
that you and I were a lot alike.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.058
SHUN: [angry grunt]

00:16:33.092 --> 00:16:35.094
SELLON: After all, we both bring a dignity,

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:39.565
and nobility to battle that no other battler truly does.

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:45.270

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:49.375

SELLON: What makes you two insects believe...

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:08.487
that you're worthy enough to come along with me?

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.721
SOON: [gasp] CHRIS: [gasp]

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.690
SELLON: You were nothing more than tools for me...

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:14.827
to utilize in pursuing Master Mag Mel's greater plan!

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.728
SELLON: You're both human, which means...

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.197
you're crippled by so many useless concepts,

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.965
like friendship, sympathy and love!

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:22.401
These things have no place in battle where the only thing...

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:24.470
that matters is victory.

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:28.140
SELLON: I'm not burdened by such foolish things as these.

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:29.875
SELLON: Master Mag Mel has shown me the way.

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:31.410
Now I live in his glory.

SELLON: Don't look so sad there Chris.

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:39.251
You should feel very honoured to have played

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:41.153
a role in the Master's plan.

00:18:41.186 --> 00:18:42.488
SOON: I can't believe it.

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:45.257
SELLON: You should enjoy your final moments of life...

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.092
because soon the Earth will be destroyed...

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:49.962
under his wrath and you along with it.

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:00.739
RAFE: They're retreating.

00:19:00.772 --> 00:19:02.241
PAIGE: That's weird.

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:06.612
MAG MEL: You finally succeeded, Sellon!

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:11.116
And now I have the gate and the key.

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:16.088
SELLON: I did it in your honour, Master.

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:18.490
MAG MEL: Come to me, child.

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:22.561
SELLON: This is it finally the Master is whole...

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:27.699
and his glorious rule over the universe will last forever!

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:29.201
SELLON: [scream, pain reax]

00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:34.940
SELLON: What's happening to me?

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:37.209
SELLON: Master Mag Mel, please wait!

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:40.012
SELLON: I understand that I have always been disposable...

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:44.116
to you, but before you dispatch me into oblivion...

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:48.353
I beg of you please allow me just one glimpse...

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:50.822
of the world under your glorious reign!

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:55.994
SELLON: I want to see the beauty of all your light

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:59.731
SELLON: Master Mag Mel, pleeeeeeeeaaaaase!

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:02.267
MAG MEL: The passion you have shown for your mission...

00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:05.070
is impressive. But your intense desire...

00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:08.373
to continue living is of more use to me...

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:11.009
as fuel for my impending re-birth.

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:15.347
DAN: I can't believe she tricked me.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.348
DRAGO: Dan...

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.350
DAN: There's nothing to say, Drago...

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:22.054
she totally punked me dude, Aw man!

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:24.823
DAN: I got played like a total chump and now...

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:27.392
SHUN: It's okay Dan.

00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:28.694
DAN: Thanks, pal.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.095
TAYLEAN: She you knew you had a good heart...

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:32.331
and played on your sympathetic nature.

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:34.499
There's no shame in being kind.

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:35.834
DRAGO: But there's no point in sitting around,

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:36.935
and dwelling on it.

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:38.303
We're still stuck inside this place,

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:39.771
and need to figure a way out.

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:43.642
DAN: Alright, I hear you, buddy. Let's go, everyone!

00:20:46.445 --> 00:20:48.880
ANUBIAS: It looks like Sellon's disappeared.

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:52.384
ANUBIAS: Which means she won't be getting in my way.

00:20:57.055 --> 00:20:59.891
ANUBIAS: I'm coming for you, Kuso!

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:03.629
[evil laughter]

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:10.068
DAN: Things took a bad turn after Sellon suckered us,

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.437
and now Mag Mel has both the gate and the key.

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:14.673
That means that any minute now he can be resurrected,

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:16.808
which will also mean lights out for all that's good

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:18.710
in the universe. There was no way that we were

00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:20.445
going to let that creep unleash his nastiness,

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.014
so we got together to hatch a plan on how to

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.783
take him down for good. But then he went and kidnapped Noah

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:27.352
so he could force us to back off. And then his right hand

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:30.055
cockroach Anubias showed up looking for a fight!

00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:32.357
Tune in to check out the insanity and you can see how

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:37.129
we brought it all to a colossal finish! Oh yeah!

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:47.205
