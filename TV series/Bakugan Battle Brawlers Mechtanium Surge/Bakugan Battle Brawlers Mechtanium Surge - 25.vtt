WEBVTT

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.477
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.945
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:15.682
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:17.650
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.986
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.355
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:25.125
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.228
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.463
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.232
We just might have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.468
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:38.471
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.741
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.944
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.281
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:51.451
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:57.524
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.293
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.163
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:06.065
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.401
RAZENOID: I can already taste the tears of those

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:10.937
that we're about to destroy!

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.440
MAG MEL: Nothing will compare to what comes next.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:17.243
MAG MEL: The complete and utter destruction of Earth!

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:19.612
MAG MEL: But first, before I put an end...

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:22.582
to the miserable existence of every last human,

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.718
I will show them fear like they have never known.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:29.122
MAG MEL: They will live just like you and I were forced to!

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:31.991
MAG MEL: In a dark and backward twisted dimension.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:35.361
Their final moments will be spent begging for mercy.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.269
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Dark Moon

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:56.549
ALL: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:06.392
DAN: [grunt, exertion reax] Huh?

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.896
NOAH: Where are all the people?

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.733
ROBIN: It's like they've just vanished!

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:16.069
MAG MEL: [evil laughter] Let's just say I had to...

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:20.540
clear the field, in order to focus on our final battle.

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.876
SHUN: I don't like the sound of this at all.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.577
DAN: Where did everybody go?

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.546
MAG MEL: Once again, you're focusing...

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.681
on the wrong thing, Kuso.

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.284
MAG MEL: But since you asked, I sent them all...

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:35.488
away to the dark reverse dimension of this world.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.357
MAG MEL: [evil laughter]

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.360
MARUCHO: Those poor people. It's awful!

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:41.861
NOAH: Oh man! [gasp]

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.530
DAN: Let the others go, Mag Mel!

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.366
Your beef's with us, not them! You understand?

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.835
MAG MEL: I admire your fire, Kuso,

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:52.605
but your naive idealism is so pathetic.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.140
DAN: This sounds bad.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:57.043
MAG MEL: That's enough talking for now, boy.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.779
MAG MEL: Behold!

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:03.550
MAG MEL: I've dispatched five of my deadliest Dreadeon Titans

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.752
to the five largest cities across...

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:08.121
your pathetic excuse for a planet.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.323
Good luck trying to stop them in time!

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.125
BEN: They're all over the place!

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:15.628
JACK: It's like the end of the world tour.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:20.133
[electric drilling buzz]

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.101
PAIGE: What the heck is it doing?

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:23.136
RAFE: That looks to me like...

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.738
a super high-intensity laser drill.

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.707
RAFE: If they all drill to the Earth's core...

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.877
PAIGE: the release of pressure will blow the Earth to pieces!

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.046
MARUCHO: Paige is right. If we don't stop those things...

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.147
the Earth is doomed.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.481
DAN: Huh?

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.183
MAG MEL: The Earth is merely the lynch pin...

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:40.920
in my larger plan for universal wide destruction.

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:43.456
Too bad you won't be around to see the end.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.425
DAN: What the heck are you talking about now?

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:48.061
MAG MEL: Others must suffer for the part they played...

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.430
in the treachery that befell me.

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:53.700
MAG MEL: The force caused by the Earth's destruction...

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.969
will ripple across dimensions,

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.371
toppling each world it passes over.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:01.040
And no species shall be spared.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.575
PAIGE: Gundalia's next!

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.879
RAFE: Then Neathia and Vestal! We have to stop him!

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:10.283
MAG MEL: [snickers turning into maniacal laughter]

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.119
PAIGE: You're not going to banish my people...

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:14.787
to some dark dimension!

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.457
BEN: We're gonna have to take down those Titans first.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.826
CHRIS: But they're in five different places!

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.227
PAIGE: So then we split up.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.929
What's the problem with that, huh?

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:25.265
DAN: It's our only play. We can sit here...

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.066
and debate the risks but at the end of the day...

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.435
it's the best shot we have to save Earth and the Universe.

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.838
DAN: So let's quit talking and start brawling.

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.940
What do you say, fellas?

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:35.408

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:58.851

PAIGE: Huh, I'm about to lose my cool!

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:27.513
RAFE: Easy, a hot head makes for poor battling.

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:29.949
PAIGE: You Castle Knights have your way of doing things,

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:31.851
and we Gundalians have ours.

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:34.353
So since we're fighting to protect each of our homes,

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:36.689
how 'bout we stick to our own skills?

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:37.857

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:10.489
Time to bring out our Titan!

MAG MEL: Humans are a weak and pathetic species.

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:37.243
If we continue the barrage of Chaos Bakugan attacks,

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:42.048
sooner or later they will break. And we will crush them!

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.383

SPECTRA: Um, Gus...

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:18.751
GUS: On it!

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:30.496
GUS: Sir it appears that our enemy...

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:32.632
is using a very strong shield.

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:36.202
HELIOS: Don't worry! He will crumble like tissue paper.

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:41.674
HELIOS: Rangrok Buster!

DAN: Spectra!

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:56.722
DRAGO: That was quite the surprise,

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:58.624
but we should get our heads back into this battle.

00:10:58.657 --> 00:10:59.925
DAN: Yup!

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:01.627

to smithereens, Drago!

SOON: Three of them?

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:04.890
CHRIS: This is impossible!

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:06.926
SPECTRA: Let's use Mutate Morph.

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:08.761
SHUN: That might work.

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:12.998
SPECTRA: Morphing three Bakugan together is the only way.

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:16.969
DAN: Okay. Let's do this. Come on, Drago!

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:18.471

HELIOS: How am I supposed to fight with these stick legs?

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:40.793
DRAGO: Knock it off Helios!

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:42.928
We've all got the best parts each other!

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:44.363
DRAGO: So let's do this!

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:45.998
HELIOS: Right!

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:54.173

00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:11.570
Maybe he's too powerful!

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:14.540
SPECTRA: Gus, it's time to take out the system.

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:18.477
GUS: But are you sure, Master? We haven't even tested it yet.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.678
SPECTRA: Don't worry about it.

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:21.613
Helios can definitely handle it.

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:24.216

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:45.497
HELIOS: How is that even possible?

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:47.699

DAN: We're in trouble!

00:17:59.244 --> 00:18:01.480
DRAGO: I don't understand why none of those attacks...

00:18:01.513 --> 00:18:03.148
did any damage.

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:05.717
MAG MEL: Now that Razenoid and I have been reborn...

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:09.221
our powers are limitless. We'll use our connection...

00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:12.491
to the dark dimension to rain terror upon all.

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:14.059
DAN: Not gonna happen!

00:18:14.092 --> 00:18:16.962

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:19.498
ALL: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:20.999

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:22.468
DAN: Yeah, that's right!

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:24.136
We're the ones you want so come and get it!

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:25.437
Unless you're too scared!

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.439

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:28.440
Haaaaaah!

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:29.808

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:40.886
your home, your very future ripped apart?

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:42.921
Does it make you feel small?

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.858
MAG MEL: Does it fill you with sadness and pain?

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:48.127
Or are you overflowing with rage?

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.962
DAN: Stoooooooooop!

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:57.536
MARUCHO: The gate and key... [gasp]

00:18:57.569 --> 00:18:59.805
Hey Tristar are you there?

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:01.406
TRISTAR: Barely, but yeah.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.841
MARUCHO: Okay, listen up...

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:04.510
TRISTAR: I hear you.

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:07.179
SPECTRA: That could work.

00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:10.349
HELIOS: Sounds like Marucho is hatching a plan.

00:19:10.382 --> 00:19:11.850
You thinking what I'm thinking?

00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:13.752
TAYLEAN: Ya. Let's keep them busy.

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:16.221
RAZENOID: What are you two whispering about, huh?

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:18.824
HELIOS: Haaaaaaaah!

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:22.494
RAZENOID: Haven't you learned your lesson yet?

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:23.996
RAZENOID: Hmmmmmph!

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:26.298
TAYLEAN and HELIOS: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:27.733
TRISTAR: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:28.934

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:31.537
TRISTAR: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.539
DRAGO: Tristar! Let go!

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:35.073
TRISTAR: [groan] I have a message...

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:38.076
from Marucho about the gate and key.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:39.711
RAZENOID: Haaaaaaaah!

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:41.146
TRISTAR: Aaaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:42.347
DRAGO: Tristar!

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:44.316
TRISTAR: Ooooomph!

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:46.418
MARUCHO: No, Tristar!

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:51.423
DAN: The gate and the key, huh of course!

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:54.126
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:55.594
MARUCHO: Mag Mel and Razenoid are drawing their power...

00:19:55.627 --> 00:19:58.397
from the dark moon, which they opened with the gate and key,

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.766
then Dan and Drago should be able to close it because

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.601
the gate and key once belonged to them.

00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:04.303
All they have to do is concentrate...

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:06.104
so they can reconnect with it.

00:20:07.105 --> 00:20:08.640
RAZENOID: What's happening?

00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:11.643
MAG MEL: Quickly! Go!

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.991
MARUCHO: I'm so sorry, Tristar.

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:28.360
MARUCHO: I never meant for this to happen to you.

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:32.864
TRISTAR: Why all the long faces, guys?

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.766
ALL: [gasp]

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.468
TRISTAR: You didn't actually think I was gonna...

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:38.604
go down that easily, did ya?

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:40.505
MARUCHO: Tristar!

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:42.841
SPECTRA: Now that the portal is completely closed...

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:46.011
Mag Mel can't send any more reinforcements.

00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:47.479
Which means...

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:50.882
It's up to Dan and Drago to finish this.

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:54.519
MAG MEL: You just made the biggest mistake...

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:56.054
of your life, boy!

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:59.725
DAN: I think you've got things backwards, Mag Mel!

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:10.302
DAN: Now that Mag Mel and Razenoid are finally whole

00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:12.104
again, they're a bigger threat than ever!

00:21:12.137 --> 00:21:14.106
After we stopped them from destroying the Earth

00:21:14.139 --> 00:21:16.341
with a team of Titans Drago and I followed them back

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:18.410
to the dark dimension they originally escaped from.

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:20.278
The only way the universe will be free of the threat

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:22.748
they pose, is if we take them down for good!

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.616
Of course that's easier said than done

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.051
and there's still the matter of cleaning up

00:21:26.084 --> 00:21:27.853
all the Chaos Bakugan left on Earth.

00:21:27.886 --> 00:21:29.888
You've got to tune in to see what I mean!

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:32.190
Mag Mel might think he and Razenoid have the upper hand

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.659
now that they have the gate and the key,

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:37.029
but Drago and I are still the baddest Brawlers around.

00:21:37.062 --> 00:21:47.105
