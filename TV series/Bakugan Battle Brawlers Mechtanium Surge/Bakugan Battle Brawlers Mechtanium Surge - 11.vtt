WEBVTT

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.577
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.178
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:15.749
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.817
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.286
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.455
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.592
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.528
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.597
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.766
We might just have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.702
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.505
\u266a What are ya gonna do?

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.875
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:45.044
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.248
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:51.418
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The powers in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:57.490
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:00.160
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:03.096
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.934
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:08.935
KYOSUKE: Marucho.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.503
MARUCHO: Hey, Dad!

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:14.040
This is a surprise. Is everything okay?

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.109
KYOSUKE: I want you to quit the Battle Brawlers.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.145
MARUCHO: What?

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.613
TRISTAR: Are you serious?

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.449
KYOSUKE: I think it's time that you started looking

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.516
at the big picture.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.718
MARUCHO: What are you talking about?

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:39.432
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Back In Sync

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.501
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.437
DRAGO: He's still got some fight in him, Dan.

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.772
DAN: I know.

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:50.577
Don't worry, he's gotta break sooner or later!

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.911
DRAGO: Ooomph! [grunt, pain reax]

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:57.450
DAN: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:08.528
[mighty roar]

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.698
DAN: [gasp] That was heavy.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.199
Are you okay, buddy?

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.834
DRAGO: I'm okay.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:16.836
DAN: I think we're getting closer to having control

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.339
over him, but still it feels like something's

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:20.640
standing in our way.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:21.774
DRAGO: It's us.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.643
We're standing in our own way.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.845
We're out of synch.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.080
DAN: What are you talking about?

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:30.984
You and me are like two peas in a pod, buddy.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:34.020
DRAGO: [sigh]

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.489
DAN: Come on. Pitter patter, dude!

00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:39.025
Let's get back to it, okay?

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:43.429
DRAGO: You bet.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.298
PAIGE: I can't believe it!

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.901
Princess Fabia sent us here to learn from the Brawlers.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:51.404
Based on everything I've seen their skills are pathetic.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.607
RAFE: I don't know what happened, out there.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.644
I never expected to see Shun so worn out.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:00.713
I'm surprised. Those definitely weren't the

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.749
Battle Brawlers that I remember.

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:04.384
PAIGE: Hmmm?

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.619
RAFE: From the first moment I saw those guys,

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:09.622
they were, my heroes. The way they just swooped

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.524
into Neathia to help us fight.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.860
It was the coolest thing I had ever seen and I wanted

00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:15.428
to be just like them.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:19.198
I don't know what, but something happened to them.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.534
RAFE: I know we were sent here to be their students

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:24.270
but they're obviously in deep trouble.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:27.206
RAFE: They need our help.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.909
PAIGE: I still don't know what you see in those guys

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:32.612
but even if I agreed with you that they needed

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:44.290
our help, Shun made it clear he wasn't interested.

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:46.125
TAYLEAN: Since Dan left us, you've been doing

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.860
an incredible job as the new leader

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.697
but I can't help but wonder if, Maybe those kids had a point.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.766
Perhaps we shouldn't be so proud and accept their help.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.201
SHUN: No thanks.

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:57.403
You and I are doing just fine on our own.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:59.405
TAYLEAN: No offense, Shun.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.241
But I seem to remember Dan saying the same thing

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:04.243
when we offered him our help.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:13.486
SHUN: [frustrated grunt]

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.989
KYOSUKE: I hear that Dan and Drago have left

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:18.024
the Battle Brawlers and that things have been

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:20.093
falling apart around you ever since.

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.194
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:04:21.227 --> 00:04:23.563
KYOSUKE: I also understand that Bakugan Interspace

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.532
has been dissolving into a chaotic and lawless land.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:29.736
MARUCHO: I wish I could tell you that it wasn't true, Dad.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.437
KYOSUKE: Perhaps it's time that you put

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:33.840
your career as a battler to rest and focus

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:35.942
on the problems from a different vantage point.

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:37.076
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.012
KYOSUKE: Come work with my team of executives

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:41.047
and together we can try and fix Interspace.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.983
MARUCHO: And just leave battling completely?!

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:48.388
KYOSUKE: Just promise me that you'll think about it. Okay?

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:52.258
MARUCHO: Uuuuuhhh?

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:54.294
MARUCHO: I have so many good memories of my time

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:57.630
as a Battle Brawler. Even though we had our share

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.666
of hard times, it wasn't anything

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.734
we couldn't get through when we worked together.

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:05.138
We knew that as a team we were invincible.

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:10.109
MARUCHO: But those days are gone now and I feel so alone.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.211
MARUCHO: Maybe my father is actually right.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.880
TRISTAR: Did you say something?

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:17.684
MARUCHO: Huh? Oh I was just thinking out loud.

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.452
Maybe my Dad had a point about me giving up

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.521
battling, you know?

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.256
TRISTAR: What?

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.024
MARUCHO: I'm not a little kid anymore.

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.459
Since I'm the one who built Interspace,

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:29.796
I have a responsibility to make sure it gets fixed.

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.464
It will be a bit of an adjustment

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:34.767
but I'll get used to my new life in no time.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:37.070
TRISTAR: I hear you saying the words Marucho,

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:39.072
but I don't know if I believe them.

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:49.148
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:54.287
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.022
SELLON: Seeing this flower wilt,

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:59.926
makes me think of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:02.628
SELLON: Just like the petals, one by one

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:06.065
they are each falling away. Soon, there will be nothing

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.335
left but a memory of what once was.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.537
SELLON: And, from their demise Anubias,

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.940
Master Mag Mel will be re-born.

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:15.675
SELLON: Do you think anyone will mourn

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:16.843
the loss of the Brawlers?

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:18.778
ANUBIAS: Who cares?

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:20.680
,ANUBIAS: All I know for sure is

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:26.953
I'll be the one who takes down Kuso once and for all.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:28.521
DAN: Give it, Drago!

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:31.190
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.926
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.263
DAN: Hold tight! You've got this!

00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:42.301
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax] Whoaaa!

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:44.003
DAN: You okay, buddy?

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:46.806
DRAGO: I'm fine but I'm telling you, we're out of synch.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.742
Otherwise scaling that would've been no problem.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:51.410
DAN: You think so?

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:53.146
WYVERN: Drago's right, Dan.

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.581
DRAGO: Wyvern! Is that you?

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:57.917
WYVERN: Oh good. You can hear me.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.952
DRAGO: Yes, but we can't see you.

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:02.421
WYVERN: Hearing my words is what's most important.

00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:04.524
The power of the perfect core has allowed me to

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:06.259
communicate with you.

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:07.794
WYVERN: You need to reconnect

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.829
with those who are closest to you.

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.998
DRAGO: Well Dan's right here.

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:15.434
WYVERN: I'm not talking about just physical proximity.

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:17.603
WYVERN: The Brawlers shared a bond like no other,

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:20.673
but right now it's fractured and you need to repair it.

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:22.475
DRAGO: [gasp] DAN: [gasp]

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:24.777
WYVERN: You may be far apart, but you mustn't forget

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:27.446
that you are forever linked in your hearts.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.116
Which is why you must come together now.

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.518
WYVERN: Because as a team you can overcome

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:35.021
any obstacle that stands in your way.

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:40.760
DRAGO: [gasp] Thank you, Wyvern.

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:42.862
MARUCHO: Oh man, the amount of background information

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:45.298
I'm gonna have to study is massive.

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:46.799
TRISTAR: Watchu doin'?

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.401
MARUCHO: I'm trying to read up on the current

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:51.237
data architecture of Bakugan Interspace.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.372
TRISTAR: Why would you do that?

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:55.007
MARUCHO: I'm out of touch.

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.676
If I'm going to solve the issue I should have

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:59.045
a clear understanding of how things operate

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:01.147
so I need to brush up Tristar.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.616
TRISTAR: You're serious about quitting battling then?

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:04.784
MARUCHO: That's right.

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:07.220
Being a Battle Brawler was my old life.

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.754
Now I'm focused on working from

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:10.656
inside the Marukura Company.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.558
Just like my father and I discussed.

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:14.760
TRISTAR: This is craziness.

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.629
MARUCHO: What's crazy about it?

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:19.532
Oh good, it's ready. Let's see.

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:22.568
Well this is very interesting to say the least.

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:25.438
In the last two years the corporation has

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:28.474
developed a new software that uses Artificial Intelligence

00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:31.344
to trouble shoot and identify the source of inefficiencies

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:34.280
within the company. Oh wow!

00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:36.449
They used it to figure out the problems we were having

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:38.417
with one of our soft drink companies.

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.152
Oh, it looks like...

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.221
...that brand wasn't profitable so the software

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:45.525
recommended it be discontinued. Cool!

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:48.227
Last year the software was also used to reformulate

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:50.263
the fragrances produced by our perfume company

00:08:50.296 --> 00:08:52.198
and then...Hmmm?

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:54.800
Uh oh. Wait a sec it says the perfume was

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:56.435
turned into bug spray.

00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:58.938
With my luck this software will suggest we fix Interspace

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:02.975
by dismantling it... [gasp]

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:05.111
TRISTAR: Are you sure you're ready to leave

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:06.679
the Battle Brawlers Marucho?

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.648
Maybe you should have a serious re-think

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:10.950
about this change in tactics.

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:13.452
MARUCHO: But there's nothing left to turn my back on.

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:15.955
The Battle Brawlers have all scattered to the wind.

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:17.556
Sure I've got some wonderful memories

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:21.427
of our times together but it's not enough.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.030
MARUCHO: Maybe what's best for Bakugan Interspace

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:25.631
is that I use my brains for a change

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:27.400
instead of my battling skills.

00:09:27.433 --> 00:09:28.935
TRISTAR: Stop fooling yourself!

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:31.070
MARUCHO: Whuuuh!

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:33.406
TRISTAR: There's no way you can just give up on brawling.

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:35.975
Think of the bond you have with Dan and Shun!

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:38.244
You can't break that!

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:40.046
MARUCHO: It's time to move on.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.148
TRISTAR: That's not the Marucho I know.

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.916
Battling is in his blood.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.685
Not only that, but he'd never give up

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:47.420
on his friends and just bail!

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.622
MARUCHO: Listen Tristar, you may think you know

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:52.892
everything about me, but you haven't even got a clue.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.894
TRISTAR: Yeah, well that's where you're wrong buddy.

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.963
I know we've only been partners for a short while

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:59.632
but I had my eye on you long before we met.

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:02.535
I bet I know you better than you know yourself.

00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:04.136
MARUCHO: What?

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.005
TRISTAR: I may be hot headed in battle,

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:07.873
but when it comes to picking my battling partner

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:11.277
I never make a rash decision.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.613
TRISTAR: The whole reason I wound up in Bakugan Interspace

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:17.283
was because I was on a journey to find myself

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:19.285
and my one true partner.

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:20.987
TRISTAR: There were tonnes of willing battlers

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.922
but none of them seemed quite right to me.

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:25.992
I didn't feel any kind of connection.

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:28.728
TRISTAR: So I continued my search constantly keeping

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:30.963
my eyes and ears open, hoping that I would

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:33.299
receive some kind of sign that would show me

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:35.568
who I was meant to end up with.

00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.570
TRISTAR: I made a promise to myself

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:39.438
that I wouldn't settle for anyone

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.140
who I didn't feel a connection with,

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:43.776
even if that meant my search would last for years.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:47.847
I didn't care. I knew it's what I had to do.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.517
TRISTAR: And then one day, it finally happened.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.519
TRISTAR: The second I saw you on that monitor

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:55.588
I knew you were the one.

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:57.757
TRISTAR: I could tell by the gleam in your eyes

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.126
that we shared the same passion for battling.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.094
TRISTAR: And that's how I knew

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:03.496
you and I were meant to be partners.

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:04.964
MARUCHO: Ooohhh!

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:06.899
TRISTAR: Sure it took me a long time to find you

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:10.269
and join forces but I think our record speaks for itself.

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:11.971
MARUCHO: Yeah, I guess so.

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:14.940
TRISTAR: If I ever needed you to trust me Marucho, it's now.

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:16.675
I'm telling you that leaving the Brawlers

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:19.045
and battling behind will be a mistake

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:21.213
that you'll regret for the rest of your life!

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:25.117
MARUCHO: Huh. Maybe you're right.

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:27.420
TRISTAR: Maybe? Of course I'm right!

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:30.489
You, Dan and Shun are the originals of Bakugan Brawling.

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:32.124
If you didn't love it as much as you do

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:35.227
you wouldn't have created Bakugan Interspace.

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.229
MARUCHO: You're right there's nothing I love more

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:40.733
than battling, except of course my friends and teammates.

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:42.802
I'd be totally and completely miserable

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.804
without those things in my life.

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:47.406
Thank you for opening my eyes to the truth

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.709
I'd been avoiding, Tristar.

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.911
TRISTAR: So then, you'll stay?

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:54.914
MARUCHO: Mmmm-hmmm.

00:11:54.947 --> 00:12:00.252
MARUCHO: It's time to clean up Bakugan Interspace, Tristar!

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:03.255
DRAGO: You can't fight me forever Zenthon!

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:06.559
I will control you!

00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:09.295
MARUCHO: Reckless Brawlers like you need to be stopped!

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:11.664
JACK: Oh yeah?! You think you're tough enough?!

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:12.765
MARUCHO: That's right.

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:15.468
Because unlike you, I've got the perfect partner.

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:17.136
TRISTAR: You're goin' down!

00:12:17.169 --> 00:12:19.405
MARUCHO: I need to win this to show my Dad.

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:21.740
KYOSUKE: So Marucho, have you made a decision yet?

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:24.410
MARUCHO: Yes sir. Father, You always taught me

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:27.580
that it was important to finish what I started.

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:29.248
KYOSUKE: Right.

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:35.187
MARUCHO: Bakugan Battle Brawling is truly my life, Dad.

00:12:35.221 --> 00:12:37.623
MARUCHO: I can't just leave it when it's in such bad shape.

00:12:37.656 --> 00:12:39.925
That would mean I would be giving up, but even worse

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:43.229
it would mean I would be abandoning my friends.

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:46.599
MARUCHO: Gate Card, set! Huh.

00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:48.701
MARUCHO: Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.769
MARUCHO: Bakugan stand!

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:53.806
MARUCHO: Let's go, Aquos Tristar!

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:56.242
TRISTAR: Oh yeah! Let's make 'em hurt!

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:57.409
JACK: Bakugan Brawl!

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:59.612
JACK: Bakugan Stand!

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:03.215
JACK: Rise Aquos Krakenoid!

00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:05.785
JACK: Let's smash these clowns!

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:07.586
JACK: Ability activate!

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.357
JACK: Gilly Motion!

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.858
TRISTAR: Hmmm?

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.160
Whoa!

00:13:14.193 --> 00:13:16.061
MARUCHO: So you think you can confuse us, huh?

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:17.463
Bring it, Jack!

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:19.465
JACK: [angry reax] Ability activate!

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:21.600
JACK: Fish Lock!

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:24.537
MARUCHO: Tristar. He's going for a surprise attack!

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.705
TRISTAR: Don't worry. I'm ready, pal!

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:28.574
MARUCHO: Ability activate!

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:31.277
MARUCHO: Shield Cyclone.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.379
TRISTAR: Oooooooooh yeeeeeeeeeeeah!

00:13:33.412 --> 00:13:35.481
MARUCHO: Dan might have the power,

00:13:35.514 --> 00:13:36.949
and Shun might have great skills,

00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:38.851
but my brain is like an encyclopedia

00:13:38.884 --> 00:13:41.187
filled with strategies of all my opponents.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.822
And that fact is what's going to win this battle for me.

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:45.624
Got it?

00:13:45.658 --> 00:13:47.526
MARUCHO: Ability activate!

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.596
MARUCHO: Aquos Mine!

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:54.733
[roar]

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:59.505
JACK: [angry grunt] Submerge, Krakenoid!

00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:01.607
MARUCHO: I totally knew you'd do that!

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.143
Gate Card, open!

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:08.047
MARUCHO: Dry Delta!

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.149
MARUCHO: The Command Card Dry Delta creates

00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:12.017
an environment that saps the powers

00:14:12.051 --> 00:14:14.019
of any Aquos Bakugan.

00:14:14.053 --> 00:14:17.856
So good luck using your surprise attack strategy now.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.793
JACK: [angry grunt] But Tristar's an Aquos Bakugan.

00:14:20.826 --> 00:14:22.661
Aren't you sabotaging yourself too?

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:23.863
TRISTAR: Not a chance!

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:25.231
JACK: [gasp]

00:14:25.264 --> 00:14:27.132
TRISTAR: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:28.867
MARUCHO: Tristar's safe because he's protected

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:31.503
by the Shield Cyclone Ability.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:34.173
TRISTAR: Unlike your puny brain, Marucho's is always thinking

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:37.109
three steps ahead, punk!

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:39.411
MARUCHO: Let's finish this now, Tristar!

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:41.146
MARUCHO: Ability activate!

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.415
MARUCHO: Abyss Cyclone!

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:47.386
TRISTAR: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:50.055
JACK: I'm not finished, yet.

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:53.292
Gate Card, set.

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:54.927
JACK: Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.096
JACK: Bakugan Stand!

00:14:57.129 --> 00:15:00.199
JACK: Here we go again, Krakenoid.

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:02.001
MARUCHO: Bakugan Brawl!

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:04.303
MARUCHO: Bakugan Stand!

00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:05.638
TRISTAR: Say cheese!

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.072
Hmmmph!

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:08.807
JACK: Your silly little strategies

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:09.942
are no match for my power.

00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:11.443
Say good-bye!

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:13.245
JACK: BakuNano, Jamsaber.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:21.020
JACK: Destroy!

00:15:21.053 --> 00:15:24.923
MARUCHO: A BakuNano?

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:29.028
JACK: This is gonna be fun!

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:30.796
TRISTAR: Whoa! What the heck are...

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:32.798
Oooomph!

00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:34.867
TRISTAR: [grunt, pain reax]

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.402
MARUCHO: Tristar no!

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:39.371
JACK: [evil chuckle] Good luck trying to strategize

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:42.541
your way around that little piece of awesome!

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:44.643
MARUCHO: [angry grunt] Ability activate!

JACK: Ability activate.

00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:55.187

TRISTAR: Aaaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhh!

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:01.694
MARUCHO: Oh no!

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:04.029
JACK: I told you my power was going to be too much for you!

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:06.365
Save yourself the embarrassment and quit now!

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:08.600
MARUCHO: [angry grunt] Not a chance, Jack!

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:11.870
JACK: [laughter] Suit yourself.

00:16:11.904 --> 00:16:14.106
Gate Card, open!

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:16.842
JACK: Forcement Wind.

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.444
MARUCHO: Oh man!

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:20.646
JACK: The Command Card Forcement Wind multiplies

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:22.881
your power by the number of Bakugan on the field

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:24.583
who share the same attribute.

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:26.785
JACK: That means we just doubled our power.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:30.856
Two times Aquos, equals epic fail for you.

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:34.460
MARUCHO: How the heck are we gonna come back from that?

00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:36.161
TRISTAR: Figure it out!

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.397
TRISTAR: You can't just give up so easily, Marucho!

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.265
Didn't you tell your Dad you needed to finish

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:41.967
what you started, huh?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.135
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:45.037
TRISTAR: No one can out-fox you, dude.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.873
We both know you're the king of strategy so dig deep

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:49.975
and find us a way out, okay?

00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:54.713
MARUCHO: Okay pal. [determined grunt]

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:58.183
MARUCHO: I can turn this around!

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.486
MARUCHO: Ability activate!

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:01.754
MARUCHO: Climb Water!

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:03.789
TRISTAR: That's what I'm talking about, buddy.

00:17:03.822 --> 00:17:09.862
Yeaaaaaaah!

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:12.197
[mighty roar]

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:14.566
TRISTAR: [grunt, pain reax]

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.035
JACK: [gasp] Huh? What's going on?

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.671
MARUCHO: Climb Water allows my Bakugan to merge itself

00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:22.174
with my opponent's Bakugan and then boost itself

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:23.942
to the same power level.

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.911
MARUCHO: It also creates a boomerang effect where all

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:27.913
the attacks that Krakenoid launches at us are spun around

00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:29.548
and bounced right back at him!

00:17:29.581 --> 00:17:32.051
JACK: Yeah, but Tristar's getting hit too!

00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:34.853
What kind of strategy is that? You guys are nuts!

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.122
TRISTAR: Hah! It's a game of endurance, son!

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:39.191
TRISTAR: [grunt, pain reax]

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:41.060
JACK: [gasp] It's on auto forming.

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:43.062
That means I can't stop it!

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:44.997
MARUCHO: I'm with you all the way.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.232
We're gonna stick together and win this thing!

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:49.535
We're a team Tristar!

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:51.537
JACK: You're relying on Tristar's strength.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.172
Where's the strategy in that?

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:54.740
TRISTAR: [grunt, pain reax]

00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:56.442
MARUCHO: It's actually a very simple strategy

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:57.743
we're using, Jack.

00:17:57.776 --> 00:18:01.013
It's all about putting everything that you have

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:05.250
and your trust into your partner.

00:18:05.284 --> 00:18:07.286
TRISTAR: [grunt, pain reax]

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.188
TRISTAR: I won't let you down, Marucho!

00:18:09.221 --> 00:18:11.256
JACK: [gasp] I'm gonna have to get radical

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.791
to shake these turkeys loose.

00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:14.092
Ability activate!

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:16.662
JACK: Wise Rush!

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:20.866
TRISTAR: [grunt, exertion reax] Whooooaaa!

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:23.302
MARUCHO: Now! Ability activate!

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:25.103
MARUCHO: Let's go Tristar.

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:26.805
Brow Freeze!

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.474
TRISTAR: Haaaaaaaah!

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:30.776
MARUCHO: Now you're blocked from activating any more abilities!

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:32.211
That goes for your BakuNano too!

00:18:32.244 --> 00:18:33.912
JACK: [gasp] No way!

00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:37.015
MARUCHO: Thanks for not letting me give up on things, Tristar!

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:38.951
MARUCHO: And for reminding me that teammates

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:41.653
always need to stay connected to one another!

00:18:41.687 --> 00:18:43.555
MARUCHO: No matter how far apart they may be.

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:44.790
TRISTAR: You said it pal.

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:48.327
MARUCHO: Alright, here we go!

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.329
MARUCHO: Ability activate!

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:52.397
MARUCHO: Hyper Stream!

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:57.136
TRISTAR: Lights out!

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:59.304
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [wild cheering]

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:04.309
ANNOUNCER: The small but mighty Marucho takes the win!

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:07.546
KATO: I... I have never been so proud.

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:11.517
Our Marucho has grown into a fine battler.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.419
KYOSUKE: He most certainly has, Kato.

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:16.889
RAFE: You see that, Paige? That's exactly the kind of

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:19.758
battling I was talking about back there.

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:26.632
PAIGE: It was okay.

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:28.333
TAYLEAN: Shouldn't we go and congratulate them

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:29.835
on their win?

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:36.742
SHUN: We've got our own battles to worry about.

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:39.044
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:19:39.077 --> 00:19:41.947
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.082
DAN: Let's go, Drago!

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:47.119
DAN: We can do it this time. I can feel it!

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:55.160
DRAGO: Yes. Me too! [grunt exertion reax]

00:19:55.194 --> 00:20:03.235
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:05.204
DAN: What'd I tell ya, pal?

00:20:05.237 --> 00:20:08.974
DRAGO: I never doubted you.

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:10.943
DRAGO: For the longest time, I confused

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:13.579
having the same goal with being in synch.

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:15.514
Dan and I may have wanted the same thing,

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:17.316
but we were on different paths.

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:18.750
And over time this created

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:22.087
a great divide between us. But thanks to Wyvern's

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.922
words of wisdom, we've been reminded

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:28.160
that success can only come when we work together in synch.

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:30.128
DRAGO: It's certainly an important lesson

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:33.966
that I hope we never have to learn again.

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.867
DRAGO: [gasp]

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:38.604
WYVERN: Of all the battling partners I've ever laid eyes on

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:40.839
I knew that if you two could find your rhythm

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:42.641
you'd be unstoppable.

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:44.009
DRAGO: Wyvern.

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:46.945
WYVERN: Now you must work together to decipher the truth

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:49.181
behind your nightmarish visions.

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:53.085
DAN: She knows about the visions we have?

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:55.020
DRAGO: We should listen to her, Dan.

00:20:55.053 --> 00:20:56.421
If it weren't for Wyvern,

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:58.223
we would have never made it this far.

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.658
DAN: That's true.

00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:04.830
WYVERN: Have faith in each other and you will succeed.

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:09.801
MARUCHO: As hard as I've been trying to stop them,

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:11.903
the crazy, chaotic battles keep raging on

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.706
in Bakugan Interspace. And right in the centre of it all

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.942
is Shun. It's like he's some kind of lone wolf

00:21:16.975 --> 00:21:19.878
who's spun out of control. If someone doesn't step in soon,

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:22.114
to help, who knows what could happen.

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:24.216
Flying solo only works for so long.

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:26.385
It's time that the Brawlers come back together

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:28.420
and clean up Interspace as a team!

00:21:28.453 --> 00:21:30.822
You should tune in to see what I'm talking about.

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:33.225
I have to convince the others to rejoin the team.

00:21:33.258 --> 00:21:37.262
I hope it's not too late to save Bakugan Interspace!

00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:38.296
