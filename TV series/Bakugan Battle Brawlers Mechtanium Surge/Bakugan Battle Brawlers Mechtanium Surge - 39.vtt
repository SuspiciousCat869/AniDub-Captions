WEBVTT

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.441
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.909
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.344
But then, out of nowhere,

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.746
we were invaded by these mysterious

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.180
and evil Mechtogan

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.149
who were intent on destroying everything!

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.718
Coredegon, Slycerak,

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.787
Exostriker, and Mandibor were their names,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.523
and leading them was this clown Wiseman.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:24.858
They also had help from an evil pack

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.326
of Bakugan called the Nonets.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.927
Luckily for us, he had our own secret weapon

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.297
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer, so we fought back,

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.266
because no one is gonna take our freedom,

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.468
not now, not ever!

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.771
\u266a What are you gonna do?

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:41.574
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:44.010
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.913
\u266a Got to give it your all

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:49.849
\u266a This is the final stand

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.418
\u266a The power's in your hand

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.888
\u266a Two worlds collide on the inside \u266a

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.193
\u266a You got to fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.862
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.230
\u266a This is Bakugan

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.278
Yuck, this whole place smells like wet dog.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:21.414
Quiet! I'm trying to create a mental map in my head

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.416
of all the passageways we've already taken.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.919
All your talking is getting me confused.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.954
Well, I'm sorry I forgot to bring the breadcrumbs

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.356
to leave a trail with, so give me a break!

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.058
It's not like we had a lot of notice!

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.263
Come back!

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.404
ORBEUM: What choice did Master Shun have?

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:48.241
Until now, we had no idea where Wiseman was hiding out.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.143
He made a split decision to send us,

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.278
and now it's our mission to collect intel

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:53.613
on the enemy's location

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.982
and report our findings back to the Brawlers.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.418
I guess so, but still...

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.119
The stink is so back in here

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:03.289
if I don't get out soon, I'm gonna barf.

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:06.259
(Grunting)

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:07.694
Hey! Knock it off!

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:09.362
(Grunting) I'm trying!

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:15.235
Oh man! What the heck did you just do?

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.070
SKYTRUSS: Well, I think I just saved the day, little bro.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.105
Wouldn't you say?

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.613
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Enemy Infiltration.\"

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:33.019
Finally, after our countless battles against the Brawlers,

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.754
the moment we've all been waiting for has arrived.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.190
The charging has been completed.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:39.559
It is time for the complete

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.728
and final resurrection of...

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:45.698
the mighty, nomadic Mechtogan!

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.334
BETADRON: Are you sure this time, Wiseman?

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:52.405
SPATTERIX: Yes. It feels like we've heard this all before.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:56.409
Bakugan brawl!

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.945
Baku-sky Raiders Jump!

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.782
Bakugan, stand!

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:07.921
Come, Complete Mechtogan.

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:10.690
Slycerak! Mandibor! Exostriker!

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:23.870
Can you feel the level of power?!

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:26.272
It's like nothing I've ever felt before!

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:29.409
Yes, indeed, my brother. It's incredible.

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:34.013
(Laughing) So, what are we waiting for?

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.383
(Roaring)

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:40.253
TREMBLAR: If it's true, and they really are complete,

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:44.023
I can't imagine how much total power they must wield.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.124
Hold on!

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:47.360
We're not inside that cocoon of light!

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.996
Yeah! We can move around freely!

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.831
Perhaps the Mechtogan truly are complete,

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.499
as Wiseman says.

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:56.069
It seems they don't need a Bakugan host to operate.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:57.537
Hold on just a second!

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.638
If they really are complete,

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.540
then where the heck is Coredegon?

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:03.376
As leader of the Mechtogan, he needs just a little more time.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.447
Think of it as saving the very best for last.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.848
I don't have time

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:11.317
to decipher your double talk anymore, Wiseman!

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.721
Take us to Drago so we can destroy him once and for all

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.423
and have our revenge! (Laughing)

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:21.461
Indeed. The time for talk is over, Wiseman.

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:24.530
All we care about now is action.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.102
BALISTA: And, of course, revealing

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:32.105
your little buried secret.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:38.578
That sounds like all kinds of bad news.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.781
No kidding. We should tell the boss.

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.150
Hmm? Who's there?

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.256
Whatever it was, it's dust now.

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.992
(Chuckling)

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.731
SKYTRUSS: Whoa! That was way too close.

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:04.337
WISEMAN (Thinking:) That's it.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.239
Go ahead and warn the Brawlers.

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.341
It will save me the trouble of summoning them myself.

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:10.710
(Chuckling)

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:12.111
Hurry up!

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.847
We have to send word to the others right away! Let's go!

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:16.215
Relax, I'm coming!

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.687
(Grunting)

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.391
That should do it, little brother.

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.593
Now let's just hope they get here quickly.

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.065
Did you hear that?

00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:33.399
ALL: Huh?

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:36.035
What is it, pal?

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.738
Yeah, Jaakor. I didn't hear anything.

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.573
It's a message guys!

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:41.574
Huh?

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:43.342
Huh? What's that?

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.383
It's an ancient Bakugan text,

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:53.419
rarely seen anymore, and known only to the ninja clan.

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.821
It's a distress call.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.355
Distress call?

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.825
What the heck is going on here, Shun?

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:00.293
Well guys,

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:02.795
at the end of the last battle we fought,

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:04.163
I sent Skytruss and Orbeum on a recon mission

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.866
to find Wiseman's hideout.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.768
So why didn't you tell us?

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.737
Yes, why?

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.072
Surely they could've used our help!

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.507
Let me guess,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.376
you sent them because they're ninjas and we're not, right?

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.280
Correct. It was a stealth mission.

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:23.082
Let's have a look at their message.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:25.485
It appears that the evil Mechtogan Mandibor,

00:06:25.518 --> 00:06:28.321
Exostriker and Slycerak have been completely resurrected

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:31.557
and are working with a dangerously high power level.

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:34.293
Well, that's all helpful information,

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:37.897
but did they happen to send us their coordinates?

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.599
Yes.

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:43.136
It says Wiseman's hideout is in sector G48.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.272
Computer, satellite view of G48.

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:51.043
There it is! Look!

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:54.480
It figures he's hiding out inside a volcano.

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:59.285
It's the last place we would ever try to look.

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.254
So, everyone knows what needs to be done.

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:04.257
So, let's get right to it, okay, guys?

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.692
Mira and Runo, we need you guys here in the lab.

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:08.261
If we're up against some crazy power,

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:09.862
we'll need you to send us the battle suits.

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:10.963
Sounds good.

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:12.765
Be careful, you guys.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.636
Kato, can you please get us--

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.471
It's already done.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.282
ORBEUM: I'm telling you, I'm positive this time!

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:32.084
The corridor we came in through is just over this way!

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.588
Oh yeah? Well you've been saying that for the last half an hour!

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.089
Just admit it - we're lost!

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:39.725
Uh-oh.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.260
What the...? Whoa.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.663
Why don't ya watch where you're-- huh?

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:45.832
Who are you two?

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:49.769
I've seen you somewhere before.

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:51.037
But where?

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.539
Wait a minute!

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.608
You fight with the Brawlers sometimes. Hold on!

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:58.077
Where'd they go?

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.345
They couldn't have gotten far.

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:02.548
I bet they're just...

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.050
over there!

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:05.651
(Both yelling)

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.119
That should do it.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.088
SKYTRUSS: You wish!\\ ORBEUM: Smell ya later!

00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:11.891
You little punks! I'll get you!

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.029
Wiseman has been using us

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:20.900
this entire time to generate enough power from our battles

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:23.402
to resurrect the Mechtogan.

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:25.071
We've allowed him to do so

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:28.541
because he's promised us our vengeance against Drago,

00:08:28.574 --> 00:08:31.344
but still, something doesn't fell right.

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:35.348
We've extended far too much trust to this stranger.

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:38.351
It's time that we knew his true identity now.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.291
And the key to unlocking this mystery is right here.

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:50.263
(Chuckling)

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:02.375
Come back here and fight!

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:07.546
Whoa! Hey! How about a heads up?

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.749
(Roaring)

00:09:09.782 --> 00:09:12.952
(Grunting)

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:18.524
BOTH: Huh? Whoa!

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.525
What was that?

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.726
A new player.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.128
Did you really think

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:24.697
you could sneak into our hideout and not pay the price?

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.432
If so, you're fools!

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.834
That underground stink pile is your hideout?

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:31.137
We thought we got lost and found Bakugan City's sewer system!

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.574
It's time we showed these creeps why you never mess with ninjas!

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:35.608
Bring it roaches!

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.009
Hah!

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:38.744
(Roaring)

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:41.948
Ahh! My eyes!

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:43.482
I'm over here!

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:48.287
Is that all you've got?

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:49.388
Not even close!

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:54.994
If you're finished with these fancy aerial ballet moves,

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:57.863
perhaps we can get down to some serious brawling!

00:09:57.897 --> 00:10:00.833
Oh, so you want to make fun of my stealthy ninja moves, huh?

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:02.501
Well let's see how you like this instead!

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:03.936
(Roaring)

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.972
(Grunting)

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:09.909
(Groaning)

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.083
Let's finish them off!

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:19.018
What the...?

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.953
BOTH: Huh?

00:10:20.987 --> 00:10:22.922
(Yelling)

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:26.425
That is easily my favourite booby trap of all time!

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.761
Did you see the looks on their moronic faces?

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:31.130
Yeah! It was classic!

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:33.366
(Yelling)

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.668
Well, that really hurt. (Groaning)

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:37.870
(Rumbling) BOTH: Huh?

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:46.579
We're here! Skytruss! Orbeum!

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:50.216
JAAKOR: Excellent work, you two.

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:52.852
Thank you sensei. But we were just doing our jobs.

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:56.455
We were worried our transmission might not get to you in time.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.892
So, this is the place.

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:02.628
Okay! Are you ready to take those creeps down?

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:04.096
Yeah! Yeah!

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.898
What the heck?!

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:22.381
\u266a

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:29.989
MARUCHO: Get ready, Radizen, this is going to be intense!

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:36.095
DAN: Okay, Drago and Reptak, let's take them down!

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:40.066
DAN: There they are. Just like the message said!

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.434
DRAGO: So, this is what they look like

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:43.269
in their completely resurrected form!

00:11:43.302 --> 00:11:46.338
We've been waiting for you, Battle Brawlers!

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.708
This is going to be so much fun!

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:51.744
I can't decide which one of you I want to smash first!

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:56.482
Whatever! We'll take you down just like every time before!

00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:58.651
Bakugan brawl!

00:11:58.684 --> 00:12:00.386
Bakugan brawl!

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.888
Bakugan brawl!

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:05.057
DAN: Baku-Sky Raiders, jump!

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:08.227
Go Pyrus Fusion Dragonoid!

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.630
Go Haos Reptak!

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:14.100
SHUN: Baku-Sky Raiders jump!

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:16.268
Go Ventus Jaakor!

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:20.106
Go Darkus Skytruss! Go Darkus Orbeum!

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:22.108
(Roaring)

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:24.410
MARUCHO: Bakugan stand!

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:26.278
Go Aquos Radizen!

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:28.414
Go Subterra Roxtor!

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:29.515
(Speaking gibberish)

00:12:33.486 --> 00:12:34.587
Let's go!

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.888
Right Right.

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.824
BALISTA: Hey you, wake up!

00:12:38.858 --> 00:12:42.128
I've got some questions for you!

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:44.697
Who is Wiseman, and what's your connection to him?

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.166
Can you hear me in there? Huh?

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:48.734
Say something!

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:50.603
WISEMAN: Balista...

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:51.937
Hmm?

00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:53.005
Oh. Wiseman.

00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:54.773
Have you heard?

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:57.476
The Brawlers have invaded the island.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.211
What?

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:01.147
(Roaring)

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.985
(Growling)

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:07.586
Ability Activate!

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.189
Dragon Astral!

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:11.423
(Roaring)

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:15.561
SHUN: Ability Activate! Grapple Buster!

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:17.596
Is that supposed to scare me?

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:21.700
What?

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:24.036
Let's try this!

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:26.272
Oh no, it's too much energy!

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:28.007
Reptak! Get out of the way!

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.408
Too late!

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:30.676
(Groaning)

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:32.144
Reptak!

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:33.946
You'll pay for that!

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:41.720
Nice try, but it's going to take more than that you fool!

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:44.223
(Groaning)

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:49.128
Anywhere, man! They're too strong!

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.764
Now it's my turn to join in the fun!

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:55.100
I wanna crush some Bakugan too!

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.903
Let's go! Ability Activate!

00:13:57.937 --> 00:14:01.340
Ultimate Kazami Style - Rapid Fury!

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:02.374
ALL: Right!

00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:05.377
(Grunting)

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.748
Let's add a little charge to the mix!

00:14:12.084 --> 00:14:14.186
(Groaning)

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.922
Pathetic!

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:17.923
No way!

00:14:17.957 --> 00:14:19.058
After all that,

00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:20.359
there's barely a scratch on him!

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:24.830
Now I'll show you how I dole out punishment!

00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:26.565
(Groaning)

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:27.933
This is bad!

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.401
No kidding!

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:32.338
One Mechtogan is taking on three Bakugan with no trouble at all!

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:34.773
Smile, you overgrown chicken,

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:37.509
because you're next on the chopping block!

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.645
Aww, snap! This isn't going to end well!

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:41.113
Hang on, did he just call me--

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:42.715
DRAGO: Radizen! Huh?

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:45.117
We can't take them on single-handedly.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.052
We need to combine our efforts!

00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:49.755
Yeah! You heard Drago, guys!

00:14:49.788 --> 00:14:50.756
ALL: Right!

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:53.626
(Roaring)

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:56.095
Let's do this!

00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:57.963
Bakugan, Fuse!

00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:06.872
Talk about a killer combination!

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:11.043
(Roaring)

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:22.821
JAAKOR: Combined Ninjas, Herculean Power!

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:29.795
BOTH: Bakugan unite!

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.073
Do you actually think

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:44.677
combining like that will make a difference?

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:48.580
If anything, they've only make it easier for us!

00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:49.982
Exactly!

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:52.551
Now we'll be able to kill two birds with one stone!

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:55.621
Yeah? Well, try getting past my two fists first!

00:15:55.654 --> 00:15:56.722
Let's go!

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:59.591
Come and get it!

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:02.227
Now Dan!

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:07.666
United Ability Activate!

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.336
Harvey Cannon Impact Torrent!

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:16.542
The more you resist, the more you annoy me.

00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:21.513
How is it possible that their power isn't dissipating?

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:23.315
(Grunting)

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:25.517
Huh?! (Grunting)

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:27.052
Huh?! (Grunting)

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:28.454
(Groaning)

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:30.022
How could they possibly do damage

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:32.524
to our resurrected bodies?

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:34.493
Keep hammering them!

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:37.262
Don't worry, Dan, we're all over this!

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:45.804
Here we are.

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:47.773
I thought we were going to fight the Brawlers!

00:16:47.806 --> 00:16:50.109
Where are they? I don't see them anywhere!

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:53.312
Bakugan brawl!

00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:55.514
Bakugan stand!

00:16:58.016 --> 00:17:00.986
What the heck are you doing, Wiseman?

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:06.392
WISEMAN: You've been a naughty boy, Balista.

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:09.862
Sticking your nose in places it doesn't belong.

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:11.196
You couldn't be content

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.333
with the vengeance I promised you against Drago.

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:17.302
Well, now it's time you pay the price for all your snooping!

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:20.339
Well, I'm not going to let you take me down without a fight!

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.945
(Roaring)

00:17:29.014 --> 00:17:32.418
United Ability Activate!

00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:35.020
Harvey Cannon Impact Torrent!

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:38.090
(Groaning)

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:40.559
I'm gonna make you suffer!

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:42.761
Go Jaakor! You too, Radizen!

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:45.230
SHUN: United Ability Activate!

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:47.399

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:51.370
Say goodbye!

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:54.006
(Groaning)

00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:56.308
We're not done with you insects yet!

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:58.343
Fusion Ability Activate! Terror Blue!

00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:00.112
Choke on this!

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:07.653
(Groaning)

00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:10.322
Did we finish them off?

00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:11.857
We must have.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.592
We used all of our energy on them.

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:16.028
There's no way they could've survived that,

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:17.729
not in a million years!

00:18:20.732 --> 00:18:23.168
Look! Over there!

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:26.305
(Laughing) Another futile attempt!

00:18:26.338 --> 00:18:30.042
Perhaps we should applaud their tenacity?

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:31.210
But why encourage them

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:33.145
when they're doomed to fail anyhow?

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:35.113
I can't believe it didn't work!

00:18:35.147 --> 00:18:36.582
Don't give up!

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:39.351
We can do this if we attack them all together!

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:42.754
Ready, Jaakor? Skytruss? Orbeum?

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:45.290
Let's go, Radizen and Roxtor!

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:46.325
ALL: Right.

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:48.227
We... Won't be...

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.928
...Defeated! (Laughing)

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.063
Ready?

00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:53.198
Absolutely, my brother!

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.133
Let's erase them from existence!

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:57.269
(Roaring)

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:59.271

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:03.175
(Roaring)

00:19:08.514 --> 00:19:10.082
Come out, Wiseman!

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:12.951
Or don't you have the courage to show yourself?

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:15.120
I've had enough of your games!

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:17.656
Tell me who you really are!

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:20.459
I demand it! Do you hear me, Wiseman?

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:22.127
I want answers!

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.429
Very well then, Balista.

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:25.831
What?

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:30.035
If you really do insist on knowing who I am, then...

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:33.805
hmm, I'll grant you your wish.

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:37.009
What? No!

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:40.445
It can't be!

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:43.682
(Screaming)

00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:47.085
(Groaning)

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:49.154
Huh?

00:19:49.187 --> 00:19:53.258
Where a-am I?

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.597
W-what happened to me?

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.499
(Laughing)

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:01.600
Now you're looking at...

00:20:01.633 --> 00:20:06.471
One true and united power!

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:09.141
(Groaning)

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:11.610
Oh no!

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:13.245
This stinks dude!

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:17.216
Our combination...

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:18.550
They separated us.

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:20.452
Drago! Reptak!

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:23.188
I don't get it! With only one hit?

00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:26.425
They actually took all of them down!

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:30.395
Aww, man. They've got too much power.

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:33.298
Hmm. Why the long faces, Brawlers?

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:35.934
You're not just giving up on us, are you?

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:39.371
It was ridiculous of all of you to think

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:41.740
that you even had the slightest chance at defeating us!

00:20:41.773 --> 00:20:43.575
We'll show you!

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:44.576
Quiet!

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.845
It's time for you all...

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:48.513
To disappear!

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:50.148
(Yelping)

00:20:50.182 --> 00:20:51.817
Dan! Watch out!

00:20:53.719 --> 00:20:56.655
(Groaning)

00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:58.624
(Screaming)

00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:00.392
(Screaming)

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:03.428
(Screaming)

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:09.801
GUNZ: Can someone please explain to me what's going on?

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:11.136
The last thing I remember is brawling with Dan.

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:12.437
Next thing you know,

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:14.573
I open my eyes and I'm in some sort of cave.

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:15.907
Sounds crazy, but it's like I've woken up

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:17.809
in my own worst nightmare.

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:20.112
These Nonets are trying to destroy the world

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:23.081
and my partner Reptak is battling on Dan's side now.

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.883
But the craziest part of all is that the evil ringleader dude,

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:27.653
Wiseman, who's behind all this, he looks just like me!

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:29.054
I'm serious.

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:30.656
You need to tune in to see what I'm talking about.

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:32.491
I hope someone can fill in all these blanks for me,

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:33.892
'cause if they don't,

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:36.895
I might permanently lose my identity to Wiseman.

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:52.878
