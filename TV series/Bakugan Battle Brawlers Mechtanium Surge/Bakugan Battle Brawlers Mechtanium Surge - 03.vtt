WEBVTT

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.807
DAN: It's been over a year since we defeated Gundalia

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.110
in the battle for Neathia and the Sacred Orb.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.245
Once we returned to Earth and rebuilt a mega Bakugan

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.781
Interspace the number of people accessing it from

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.983
around the world totally exploded!

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.019
DAN: Of course Drago and I are back in action, along with our

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:22.489
pals Marucho and his new partner Tristar; and Shun

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.759
who's rockin' the Battle Arena with Taylean.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.060
DAN: The flood of new battlers

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.561
means we're up against some

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.029
crazy serious competition now!

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.599
This is Bakugan battling like you've never seen it before...

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:35.001
DAN: ...but we're in it to win it!

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.737
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:41.074
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:42.942
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:44.577
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.146
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.547
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.282
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.750
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.886
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.654
\u266a On the inside

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.392
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.429
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.330
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:12.672
TRISTAR: If I keep watching this,

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.307
I'm gonna explode!

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.708
Who the heck does that guy think he is,

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.111
coming in here and busting things up like that?

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.512
MARUCHO: I think the bigger question is;

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.115
Where did this Mechtogan character come from?

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:27.620
[\u266a]

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:28.655
DAN: [angry grunt]

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:30.323
TAYLEAN: Whatever the case,

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:31.991
we've got a serious problem on our hands.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.393
DAN: How could something that came from Drago,

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.662
be so evil and destructive?

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.363
It makes no sense!

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:47.740
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Disconnect.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:54.881
[\u266a]

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:56.015
MARUCHO: It was a total miracle

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.650
that no one got hurt.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.752
We won't get that lucky again, guys.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:00.920
SHUN: So Dan.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.355
Where were you and Drago when

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.890
all this was happening?

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.859
You never told us.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.060
DAN: Nowhere.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.394
[grunt]

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.034
MARUCHO: What do you mean?

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.270
DAN: I uh...mean we uh...

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:22.075
we were at my place, chilling out.

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:24.978
[throat clearing]

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:26.346
DAN: Um.. I just remembered,

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.649
I gotta pick up a package for my mom so...

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.791
TRISTAR: Dan's a great battler but a lousy liar.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.193
MARUCHO: Something is definitely going

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:43.062
on with those two guys, that's for sure.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.731
TAYLEAN: We can't worry about that now.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:46.566
We need to focus on getting rid of Zenthon

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.435
before he causes any more damage.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.905
SHUN: I wonder if Dan knows more about Zenthon

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:54.941
than he's admitting.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.148
DAN: I thought the powers from Code Eve

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.017
would be a good thing.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.186
DRAGO: Well maybe they're a blessing in disguise.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.721
DAN: I dunno.

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:10.423
Too bad they didn't...

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.859
DAN: ...come with a set of instructions.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:14.961
DRAGO: No kidding.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.732
BOY A: I'm telling you, Anubias is the baddest

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.200
battler there is right now.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:22.735
He's hardcore!

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.304
BOY B: Yeah, and remember how he saved those people

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.039
from that Mechtogan attack?

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.473
BOY A: Dude's got guts!

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:28.875
GIRL A: I dunno, guys.

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:30.910
If you ask me I think Sellon's pretty bangin'.

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:32.612
GIRL B: Yeah, she's foxy and tough!

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.981
She's totally the best!

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:36.916
NOAH: You guys are all totally nuts.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.718
Dan and Drago are way better than

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.987
any of those lame clowns.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.322
BOY A: No way.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:45.024
Those guys are totally old and played out, man.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.926
NOAH: Say what you want, but those two are a team

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.661
who always fight as one.

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.330
No one else sticks together through thick and

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:51.631
thin like they do.

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:54.334
NOAH: I totally admire the bond they have.

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:55.768
BOY A: What?

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:57.203
BOY B: If they're so loyal, then where were

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:59.706
they when their teammate Marucho was in trouble?

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.474
Tell me that, huh Noah!

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.176
NOAH: They must've had a...

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.044
NOAH: ...really good reason not to be there,

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:06.379
otherwise they would've been!

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.580
BOY A: Whatever, dude!

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:08.648
BOY B: Know what?

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.283
I bet Dan thought he was too cool to be bothered.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:11.951
NOAH: You're wrong, dude!

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:13.920
Dan and Drago would never leave a teammate hanging

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:15.455
like that!

00:04:15.488 --> 00:04:16.756
You got me?

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:17.857
BOY A: Okay.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.192
Chill dude.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:20.860
BOY B: Let's just head over to the meet and

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.495
greet, okay?

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:24.397
BOY A: Yeah, let's go!

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.766
NOAH: [frustrated grunt]

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:27.767
NOAH: Those guys don't know what

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.035
they're talking about!

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:32.238
Dan and Drago are the best!

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:38.077
DAN: [gasp] Huh.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.746
NOAH: Hmmm?

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.447
Anubias?

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:42.882
ANUBIAS: I hear you've been talking smack about me.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:44.550
How bout you say it to my face kid?

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.552
NOAH: I...uh...I

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:47.687
ANUBIAS: Go on.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.988
I wanna hear it.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.591
NOAH: All I said was that Dan and Drago are

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:55.094
my favourites, that's all, man.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:58.064
ANUBIAS: Hmmph. Relax, kid.

00:04:58.097 --> 00:04:59.632
ANUBIAS: I like your style.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:02.135
NOAH: Gee...uh...thanks.

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.737
ANUBIAS: I've got nothing but respect for someone

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.740
with strong opinions, who doesn't bend to peer pressure.

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:11.644
NOAH: Yeah?

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:16.683
ANUBIAS: Maybe one day soon, I can earn you as a fan.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.055
MARUCHO: What's going on, guys?

00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:23.156
DAN: I told you guys.

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.391
I gotta pick stuff up for my Mom.

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.593
MARUCHO: If there's something bothering you guys,

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:28.728
you can tell us.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:30.063
We're here for you.

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:31.664
SHUN: Mmmm hmmm.

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:33.366
DAN: Yeah, we know but seriously...

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:34.867
DAN: Everything's cool.

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.503
There's nothing to worry about, okay?

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:40.506
DYLAN: Well isn't this a lucky coincidence, huh Brawlers?

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.509
DAN: [gasp] Man, this is a private conversation,

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:45.611
Dylan. Hit the bricks.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.513
DYLAN: That's a little harsh, buddy. Relax.

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:49.248
I'm just here because I want to give you a chance

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.317
to give some love back to your fans.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.618
DAN: Whah?

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:54.253
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.488
GIRL A: I can't believe we're gonna

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.056
get to meet Sellon!

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.125
GIRL B: What a trip!

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.761
BOY A: Oh man, I think I see Anubias.

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.396
BOY B: Yeah, and there's Ben!

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.531
BOY C: And and Jack!

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:10.870
CROWS OF SPECTATORS: [excited whispers]

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:13.039
DAN: Huh? What is this thing?

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:14.941
MARUCHO: It looks like a meet and greet.

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:16.309
TRISTAR: So are we supposed to shake hands

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:17.710
and sign autographs?

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:19.245
DYLAN; Don't you think that's the least you can

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:22.448
do for you loyal legion of adoring fans?

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.118
DAN: And how much are you charging them, huh?

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.286
DYLAN: Relax, it's a paltry five credits each,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.756
with all of the proceeds going to charity.

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.157
DAN: Yeah, right!

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.592
More like your wallet.

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.093
I'm outta here!

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:35.795
MARUCHO: Dan, wait!

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:37.230
SELLON: It must be terribly hard for you, Dan.

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:40.600
Having to share the spotlight with others.

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:43.302
DAN: [gasp]

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.971
SELLON: But you shouldn't punish your

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:48.007
fans because of your own fragile ego.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.609
DAN: [angry grunt]

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.077
BEN: Come on, Big Time!

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.979
Go say hi to the few fans you have left!

00:06:53.012 --> 00:06:55.348
SELLON: No one can be number one forever, Dan.

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:57.183
Why not show the fans that you're at

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:58.718
least a gracious sportsman?

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.319
DYLAN: It'll be quick and easy.

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:02.622
Just follow me this way, okay?

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:04.791
MARUCHO: Maybe it's not such a bad idea, if we say

00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:07.460
a quick hello to the kids, huh Dan?

00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:08.995
TRISTAR: Yeah, why not give them

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:11.497
the thrill of a lifetime?

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:12.865
DAN: Sorry guys.

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:14.867
Not today.

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:26.846
DAN: Drago, you know this is not an ego thing right?

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.115
DRAGO: You don't have to explain anything to me.

00:07:29.148 --> 00:07:30.850
I know we have to focus on getting

00:07:30.883 --> 00:07:32.718
my powers in check.

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:33.820
ANUBIAS: I can't believe it.

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:35.788
Are you really turning your back on your fans,

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.290
Kuso?

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:38.891
ANUBIAS: These kids worship you and

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:41.494
you're going to just slap them in the face,

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:42.829

DAN: [angry grunt]

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:46.098
ANUBIAS: I met a kid who said you were his hero today,

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.466
but after seeing this,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.036
I gotta say, he deserves way better.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.238
DAN: Mind your own business.

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.906
ANUBIAS: Don't you walk away from me!

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.875
DAN: [gasp]

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:58.044
ANUBIAS: If you're such a big deal...

00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:00.880
...then fight me!

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:06.719
[\u266a]

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:08.554
DRAGO: If we keep avoiding, he may try and

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:12.592
trick us into battle.

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:13.926
DAN: Yeah...

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.497
DAN: [angry grunt]

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:19.999
DRAGO: That would be dangerous with my powers

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.901
being so unpredictable.

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:23.536
DAN: Fine! Then we're gonna take

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.172
control of the battle and do this our way!

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:28.608
DRAGO: Yes, I'm with you one hundred percent!

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.076
DAN: Sweet.

DAN: Hmmm?

MARUCHO: Sorry guys, but...

TRISTAR: We heard you talking crazy!

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.120
SHUN: Seriously it's too dangerous to battle with

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:44.190
Zenthon still lurking around this place.

00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:45.958
TAYLEAN: We need all hands on deck to battle him in

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:49.362
case he decides to return.

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.731
DAN: Don't worry, if he shows his ugly face again,

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:54.567
we'll drop whatever we're doing and throw down.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.605
But for now, we gotta go.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:01.040
TAYLEAN: That didn't go very well.

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:02.975
SHUN: Nope.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.513

Let's counter attack!

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:37.870
A challenge.

ANUBIAS: Horridian!

on the defensive.

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:05.564

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:07.893
Drago just defused himself!

DAN: Whoa!

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.252

his power into thirds but on the upside...

I'm not too proud to admit,

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:44.810
that was impressive indeed.

TRISTAR: That was embarrassing.

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:12.844
MARUCHO: Well, I guess the only way they could

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.746
control Drago's new powers was to hold back

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.782
during battle.

ANUBIAS: I think you owe me an explanation.

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:37.402
ANUBIAS: Even though we're rivals, I still have

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:40.672
respect for you and I'd hoped that you had

00:20:40.706 --> 00:20:42.874
the same for me.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:45.377
Clearly I was wrong, otherwise you wouldn't

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.814
have insulted me by battling with the

00:20:48.847 --> 00:20:51.183
skills of a total amateur.

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:53.418
DAN: [angry grunt]

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:55.654
ANUBIAS: If your heart's not in it

00:20:55.687 --> 00:20:59.358
maybe you should just quit.

[\u266a]

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:09.835
SHUN: Something strange has been going on with

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:11.536
Dan and Drago ever since we returned from Neathia.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.438
The problem is, whenever we ask them about it,

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:15.440
they change the subject; but when we discovered that

00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:18.110
they were training in secret, we had to confront them.

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:19.878
SHUN: Unfortunately, before we could get an

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:21.713
answer out of them, Sellon challenged them to a

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:23.882
battle, and of course Dan accepted.

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:25.951
Given his messed up mental state, I figured it would

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:28.020
be a good idea if I joined in.

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:29.755
SHUN: Things got pretty crazy, but rather than

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:32.291
spoil the surprise, why don't you tune in!

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:33.992
SHUN: If we don't get to the bottom of Dan and

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:37.329
Drago's problems it could destroy the Brawlers, for good.
