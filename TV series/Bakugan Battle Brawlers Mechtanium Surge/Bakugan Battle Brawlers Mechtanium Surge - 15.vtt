DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.011
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.715
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy,

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.784
and both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.186
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.422
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.358
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.261
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.997
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun. We just might

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.299
have a chance of regaining control of Bakugan Interspace

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.502
and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.471
\u266a What are ya gonna do?

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.775

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:51.451
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The powers in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:57.390
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.293
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.163
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:06.733
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

MARUCHO: I don't know guys,

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.832
but those Bakugan are on a pretty serious rampage.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.901
RAFE: Yeah, but it looks to me like it's only

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:18.338
the Chaos Bakugan.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:22.275
MARUCHO: Be careful everyone it's a strategic attack.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.345
PAIGE: Yeah, but who the heck do you think is behind it, huh?

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:29.048

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.908
NOAH: Anubias!

ROBIN: And Krakenoid?

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:33.479
ANUBIAS: Why are you standing there?

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.648
ANUBIAS: We can't be the champions of this place

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:38.218
if it's destroyed so snap out of it!

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:42.288
You guys head over to Area B. I'll take Area C.

NOAH: Ah... What's this?

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.573

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:03.876
NOAH: Awesome!

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.712

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.183
ANUBIAS: Get lost.

SELLON: Don't lose your focus.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:15.054
Master Mag Mel is counting on you after all.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.223
ANUBIAS: And what about your mission Sellon?

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.659

ANUBIAS: Hah! Cat got your tongue?

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.876
I guess you're not so perfect after all.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:30.263
BOULDERON: Thanks Wolfurio!

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:37.503
WOLFURIO: No problem. I know you'd do the same for me.

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:39.272
PAIGE: They just keep coming.

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:41.474
RAFE: The only way we're going to stop them is to find

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:44.210
the root of the problem and destroy them from within.

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:47.046
TRISTAR: Marucho! What are we gonna do, buddy?

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.449
MARUCHO: Hang on. Let me think about this.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.250
MARUCHO: We need to split up so we can corral

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.753
all of the Chaos Bakugan into one place.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.288
PAIGE: What for?

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.890
MARUCHO: If they're in one spot I can delete the spatial data

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:59.726
and wipe out the Chaos Bakugan.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.495
RAFE: But you'll leave a hole in the data matrix.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.564
MARUCHO: We don't' have a choice Rafe. We have to

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:08.034
put the safety of the human occupants of Interspace first.

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:11.170
PAIGE: Huh. For a little guy he sure has a big brain.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.807
MARUCHO: Um. I'm not that small, but thanks I guess.

00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.610
PAIGE: Okay! I'm ready to do this!

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:23.883
RAFE: Mmm-hmmm! Let's go!

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:27.120
RAFE: I want to give you something Marucho.

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:28.955
MARUCHO: What is it?

00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:31.290
RAFE: They're the BakuNanos we Castle Knights use.

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:32.692
SHUN: I don't trust these.

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:34.193
PAIGE: What's your problem?

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.662
You're not really in the position to be fussy, pal.

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:37.997
SHUN: Whatever.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.832
TAYLEAN: I'm willing to try it, Shun.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:41.267
SHUN: Are you sure?

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.769
TAYLEAN: I know you're worried about the chaos

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:45.938
these things can cause, but we are skilled battlers.

00:06:45.972 --> 00:06:47.840
SHUN: I just don't know if now's the time

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:49.609
to try out new technology.

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:52.445
TAYLEAN: It may give us the advantage we need.

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:54.447
SHUN: Okay.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.216
RAFE: Alright then, I'm going to forward the BakuNano

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.621
operational data to your BakuMeters.

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:04.157
MARUCHO: Okay everyone. Don't forget the plan.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.025
MARUCHO: We need to herd all of the Chaos Bakugan

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:08.728
into Battle Area B.

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:13.966
PAIGE: I love it! When do we get started, huh?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.568
MARUCHO: Attention everyone.

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.203
This is an emergency message from

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:19.505
the Bakugan Interspace administrators.

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:21.741
Everyone must evacuate immediately.

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:22.809
MARUCHO: I repeat.

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.243
This is an emergency message from the

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:32.185
Bakugan Interspace administrators...

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:34.487
JACK: I dunno guys. Are you sure we can

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.888
handle all of them?

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:39.025
BEN: Quit being a chicken. The boss said fight so we fight.

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:47.934
ROBIN: So jump in there if you're such a tough guy.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.771
NOAH: Oh man!

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.606
WOLFURIO: Haaaaaaaaaaah!

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.508
RAFE: Let's go, Wolfurio!

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:56.809

00:07:56.843 --> 00:08:01.080

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:10.089
Destroy, now!

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:13.092
BOULDERON: Haaaaaaaaaah!

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:16.362
BOULDERON: Oh yeeeeeeah!

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:18.064
TRISTAR: Okay! My turn!

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:24.337
TRISTAR: Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.639
TRISTAR: That's right. Run you cowards.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:30.476
TRISTAR: They're all heading for Area B, Marucho.

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:33.246
MARUCHO: Nice work, Tristar! Way to go.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.882
TRISTAR: We've got them all moving now buddy.

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:38.117
Are you sure you can circumvent the security systems

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.219
in time to delete the operational data

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:41.587
and get rid of them?

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:43.656
MARUCHO: I'm working on things right now.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:48.794
Fingers crossed it'll all pan out.

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:51.531
SHUN: Ability activate!

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:54.467
Done Red, Slash Sword!

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.768
SHUN: Head over that way!

00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:58.771
TAYLEAN: You got it! [grunt]

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.973
SHUN: Ability activate!

00:09:01.007 --> 00:09:03.042
SHUN: Slash Hyper Sword Storm!

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:06.045
TAYLEAN: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:08.547
TAYLEAN: Slaaaaaaash!

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:12.251
[ground cracking explosion]

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:13.619
SHUN: Great work, Taylean!

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:18.257
TAYLEAN: Thanks boss.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:25.131
MARUCHO: Come on, guys. Get the rest of them here.

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:39.512
[computer beeps and trills]

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:48.187
[heavy impacts]

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.389
WOLFURIO: And stay down.

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.592
TAYLEAN: Come and get it.

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:59.165
TAYLEAN: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:01.300
TAYLEAN: Hah. Just like a row of dominoes!

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:02.468
Hmmmmph!

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:04.737
RAFE: Oh wow! PAIGE: Check it out!

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.840
MARUCHO: Yeah, Shun's a pretty fierce battler.

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:09.909
SHUN: Marucho. That should be all of them.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:11.177
You ready?

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.513
MARUCHO: You bet. If everyone can secure the exits Shun,

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:16.916
I'll run the startup sequence.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.217
SHUN: You heard the man.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.285
WOLFURIO: We're on it!

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:22.622
BOULDERON: Yup!

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:25.224
TAYLEAN: Over there Shun!

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:29.395
SHUN: What the?

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:31.864
SHUN: What is Team Anubias doing here?

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:33.733
RAFE: Marucho don't do it!

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:35.868
If you run it they'll be erased too.

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:38.738
MARUCHO: Huh? You guys need to get out of there!

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:41.173
I'm about to delete the spatial data for that whole area!

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:42.641
If you stay you're in danger!

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:43.676
JACK: Delete?

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:44.910
BEN: Aw snap!

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:48.381
ROBIN: This way!

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:51.384
BEN: What are you doing? We gotta get outta here!

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:53.719
NOAH: I can't move my legs.

00:10:53.753 --> 00:11:00.092
BEN: What? Aw man!

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:04.196
MAG MEL: That's right little boy! Tremble with fear,

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:09.168
because fear feeds me just as well as chaos energy.

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:11.804
[mighty roar] [evil laughter]

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.773

DRAGO: [groan]

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:16.175
DAN: Drago!

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:18.878
DAN: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:21.814
DRAGO: Dan something's not right. I can feel

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:25.051
a power surge flowing deep inside of me.

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:29.355
DAN: Yeah I can... feel it too...

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:34.226
DAN: I think it's, Bakugan Interspace calling us.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:43.035
DRAGO: We have to get back to Earth, before it's too late.

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:44.804
MARUCHO: I can't run the delete program with

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:46.705
Team Anubias still down there!

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:48.107
RAFE: Well you better figure something out

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:55.347
because we can't hold them off for much longer.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:56.849
PAIGE: Do something!

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:57.950
RAFE: Please, Marucho!

00:11:57.983 --> 00:12:02.421
MARUCHO: But... I...

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:06.092
MARUCHO: Ooohhhh!

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:09.528
PAIGE: What's that? RAFE: Dunno! MARUCHO: Maybe help?

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:14.867
SHUN: Or more Chaos Bakugan.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.871
[lightning blast]

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.673
[explosion]

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:27.046
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:32.184
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:37.156
SPECTRA: Hmmph. So this is Bakugan Interspace.

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:39.225
SPECTRA: It looks like the Brawlers could use a hand

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:41.360
getting things back in order.

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:44.830
SPECTRA: [chuckle]

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:50.603
SHUN: No way! MARUCHO: Whoa!

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:54.073
MARUCHO: It's Spectra!

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:57.776
SPECTRA: Let's show them your new powers, Helios!

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:02.381
DAN: We gotta hurry back, Drago! Our pals need us!

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:09.989
SHUN: I can't believe it. It's Spectra!

00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:11.891
SPECTRA: What kind of a greeting is that,

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:14.393
huh, my little friends?

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.428
SPECTRA: It looks like you've seen a ghost.

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:20.266
SPECTRA: We're still friends. Don't worry, I came to help.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.567
Shall we?

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.869
PAIGE: Who is that freaky hair jockey?

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:26.172
RAFE: Yeah man , fill us in here will ya?!

00:13:26.205 --> 00:13:28.507
MARUCHO: Spectra is an old friend from the past

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:31.477
who used to battle along side of us.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.613
I sent an SOS message out to all of our allies earlier,

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.482
so I guess he received it!

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:39.251
SPECTRA: I have to say these mindless Chaos Bakugan

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:44.089
are a disgusting sight.

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:46.358
SPECTRA: Let's clean house!

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:48.194
SPECTRA: Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:50.930
SPECTRA: Bakugan stand!

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:56.769
SPECTRA: Rise Darkus Helios!

00:13:56.802 --> 00:14:00.973
HELIOS: [rising mighty roar]

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:02.675
MARUCHO: Darkus Helios?

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:06.612
SHUN: But I thought he was a Pyrus Bakugan before!

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:09.281
HELIOS: Can't a Bakugan change?

00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:13.118
SPECTRA: Yes, in order to move forward one must evolve.

00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:16.956
For Helios that meant trading fire for darkness

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:20.492
to become Darkus Infinity Helios!

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:23.696
SHUN, MARUCHO, PAIGE and RAFE: [gasp]

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:26.131
SPECTRA: Helios! Give our friends a demonstration

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:31.604
of your new powers.

SHUN, MARUCHO, PAIGE and RAFE: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.121
HELIOS: Hmmmph.

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:24.356
HELIOS: Haaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.525
RAFE: Whoa. That guy's got some power!

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:29.461
PAIGE: I've never seen anything like it before.

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:32.131
SPECTRA: How did it feel to do that with the new body?

00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:39.138
HELIOS: Absolutely incredible. Let's fight some more.

00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:41.140
HELIOS: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:42.941
MARUCHO: Whoa! Helios!

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:44.877
SHUN: That was a hard hit!

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.912
SPECTRA: Hmmm. They might be mindless but,

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:48.647
I guess I shouldn't underestimate

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:50.883
the Chaos Bakugan.

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:52.685
COMPUTER VOICE: The 25% damage received from the

00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:54.453
direct blast recovered.

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:56.255
Repair and diagnostic run complete.

00:15:56.288 --> 00:16:00.459
Defense rate against further energy attacks 120%...

00:16:00.492 --> 00:16:02.027
PAIGE: He's not damaged at all?!

00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:04.997
RAFE: That's...incredible!

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.700
SPECTRA: Ability FARBAS Infinity.

00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:10.969
This means their attacks won't leave a mark on Helios.

00:16:11.003 --> 00:16:16.642
SPECTRA: Ability activate! [grunt]

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:20.446

[huge laser blast]

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:35.027
HELIOS: That was way too easy!

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.830
SPECTRA: Hmmph. You're right, it was.

00:16:37.863 --> 00:16:39.732
MARUCHO: They took them all down!

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:45.170
SHUN: Helios sure has some power!

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:46.672
ROBIN, BEN and JACK: [gasp]

00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:48.407
NOAH: Whoa He's awesome!

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.944
ANUBIAS: Well that was an irritating intrusion!

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:56.482
SELLON: Incredible, there is such beauty in his raw power.

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:59.585
ANUBIAS: Are you kidding me? Now who's the one

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:06.425
who's losing their focus, huh?

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:08.327
JACK: What's happening?

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.195
ROBIN: Where are they going?

00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:12.898
NOAH: [gasp] Huh?!

00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:14.733
JACK: [gasp] BEN: What the?!

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:23.709

NOAH: No Horridian!

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:30.816
HELIOS: Hah, a three-headed mutt.

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:32.084
MARUCHO: Helios, look!

WOLFURIO: [grunt, exertion reax] Whoa!

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:41.193
PAIGE: Why is he attacking us now?

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:43.762
MARUCHO: I have no idea. Maybe the Chaos rampage

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:48.767
had a negative effect on him.

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:49.835
RAFE: Oh no!

00:17:49.868 --> 00:17:51.370

BOULDERON: Haaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.342

TRISTAR: Haaaaah! I love this thing!

00:18:58.804 --> 00:18:59.938
MARUCHO: We did it!

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.240
SHUN: Sure did.

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:06.311
SPECTRA: No, not quite.

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.847
MARUCHO: It's Sellon's Bakugan, Spyron!

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:12.117

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.021
HELIOS: He's going dooooooown!

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:17.890
HELIOS: No way!

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:23.762
SPECTRA: Huh.

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:24.830
MARUCHO: Is that Krowll?

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:25.898
RAFE: Um... guys...

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:27.399
PAIGE: What's going on here?

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:29.801
SHUN: [gasp] MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.204
SHUN: Vertexx too?

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:35.207
MAG MEL: [evil laughter]

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.178
RAZENOID: [mighty roar]

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:50.255
MAG MEL: Fear and battle! My favourite combination!

00:19:50.255 --> 00:19:59.898
MAG MEL: Fear and battle! My favourite combination!

00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:06.205
PAIGE: We'll be buried...

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:11.243
RAFE: ...alive!

00:20:11.276 --> 00:20:12.444
NOAH: Huh?

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:18.250
JACK: You can't be serious!

00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:19.518
SHUN: What now?

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:23.155
MARUCHO: This is really bad.

00:20:23.188 --> 00:20:25.090
ANUBIAS: Huh?

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:29.795
ANUBIAS: I feel it...

00:20:29.828 --> 00:20:31.797
[chuckle]

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.765

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:37.736
[large explosion]

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:39.338
MARUCHO: Whoa! SHUN: [gasp]

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:40.639
ANUBIAS: Kuso's back!

00:20:40.672 --> 00:20:41.940

RAFE: Huh? PAIGE: Whoa!

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:08.300
DAN: What's up guys?

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:10.235
SHUN: It's good that Dan and Drago are back because

00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:13.605
we really need their help in protecting Bakugan Interspace

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:16.475
but does he really think he can start bossing us around again?

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:18.543
Who does he think he is? He's the one who left

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.612
Marucho and I to fend for ourselves,

00:21:20.646 --> 00:21:23.282
so if anything he should be taking orders from us!

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:25.050
Then he tells us he's got a connection to this

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:27.285
Mag Mel creep who is probably the one responsible

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:30.455
for the Chaos Bakugan rampage. Dan's got a lot of explaining

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:32.391
to do before we take him back.

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:35.260
Tune in to see what Dan has to say for himself.

00:21:35.293 --> 00:21:37.829
DAN: Come on, let me at those creeps!

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:38.864
