WEBVTT

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.675
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.143
after the Bakugan came to live with us,

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.979
but then out of nowhere, we were invaded by these

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.681
mysterious evil Mechtogan,

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.383
who were intent on destroying everything!

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:21.020
Coredegon, Slycerak, Exostriker, and Mandibor

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.757
were their names-- and leading them was this clown, Wiseman.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.291
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:26.559
called the Nonets.

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.828
Luckily for us, we had our own secret weapon

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.265
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer, so we fought back.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.601
Because no one is going to take our freedom!

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:35.702
Not now, not ever!

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.772
\u266a What are you gonna do

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.808
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.244
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:46.146
\u266a You gotta give it your all

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.581
\u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, this is the final stand \u266a

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.817
\u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.519
\u266a The power's in your hands

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:55.221
\u266a Two worlds collide on the inside \u266a

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.727
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.396
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.764
\u266a This is Bakugan \u266a

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.737
\u266a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.605
Okay, I can do this.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.376
Not bad.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.179
But I can go higher!

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:25.752
Even higher!

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.122
(Grunting)

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.628
Oof! Yes! That was awesome!

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.597
ALL: Bakugan brawl!

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:44.571
AEROGAN: All my practicing has paid off. I'm ready for a real fight.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:47.240
Finally, I think I'm ready to go for it.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.080
I hope Mistress doesn't get upset with me,

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:56.983
but I really believe that I'm ready for my first battle.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.052
Earth, here I come.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:05.458
\u266a

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:09.062
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in Jump to Victory!

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:14.968
(Horns honking)

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.404
Whoa! So this is Bakugan City!

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.607
It's even more awesome than I expected!

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.976
There's people and Bakugan everywhere.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.745
I should have no problem finding somebody to battle.

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:29.415
Now let's see, who looks like a good match?

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:30.750
(Grunting)

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:33.119
Nothing like a hard day's work to make you feel good.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:38.291
Whoa, he looks like a tough guy. Let's check it out.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.859
Hey pal, what's up?

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:41.394
Who the heck are you?!

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.897
I'm the baddest new Bakugan in town,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.732
and I'm looking for a battle.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.935
So why are you bothering me? Can't you see I'm busy here?

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.037
Now get lost, kid!

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.806
Hey, watch it! Dude needs to chill out,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.509
I'm just looking for a battle. What's the big deal, huh?

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.780
(Snoring)

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:05.752
Hm, those guys look friendly. I'll try them.

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.289
What's happening?!

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.823
(Groaning)

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.261
Whoops! I'll just come back later.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:21.601
Hey, hey, hey! Gather round and check out my sick moves!

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:24.804
Finally, sounds like this dude is looking for a battle.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:28.508
Hey, man! I'm ready to scope those sick moves of yours.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:29.776
You wanna battle right here, then?

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.811
Whoa! You got it wrong, pal! What?

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.980
I was only talking about my dance moves.

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:35.181
If it's a battle you want,

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:36.916
you have to go to one of the Battle Arenas.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.118
Battle Arenas? Yeah, man!

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.187
That's where all the competitive Bakugan battles

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.388
happen here on Earth!

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.691
Wicked! Thanks for the tip, bro.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.426
\u266a

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.629
What the heck do you mean all the Battle Arenas are closed?

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:51.064
Sorry pal, it's true.

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:53.433
But why? I don't get it!

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:55.201
With all the craziness happening around here

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:57.337
since Wiseman and the Nonets showed up,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.172
everyone thought it was a good idea to postpone

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.307
the games until things settle down a bit.

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:04.444
That stinks! I want to battle now! I'm ready now!

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:07.747
Huh? Are you really that selfish, or just crazy?

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.415
Scram, punk!

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.819
AEROGAN: Whoa! Oof! Big truck!

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:14.921
Phew, big bouncy truck.

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:17.390
Augh! Oh, come on!

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.759
Gross! Don't birds ever brush their teeth?

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.330
Geronimo!

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.465
Ow, my face!

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:28.001
I just want this to be over!

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.272
Augh! Land somewhere soft! Land somewhere soft!

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:35.074
Whoa! Oof! Huh?

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:40.046
Hm, I don't know what this stuff is but it sure is delicious.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.080
Augh!

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.749
Uh...

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.718
Uh, hi. Are you okay?

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:49.188
\u266a

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.157
It sounds like you've had a really rough day.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.294
Ugh, it's been pretty humiliating, actually.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.462
I came here to battle and I wind up getting bounced around

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:59.599
like a ping-pong ball! Thanks for being so nice to me.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:00.967
Well, of course!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.936
This is Bakugan City, where everyone lives in harmony.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.939
I'm just sorry your introduction here wasn't... the best.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.474
Anyway, what's your name?

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.410
Oh, right. My name is Aerogan.

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.578
Hey, Aerogan. Nice to meet to.

00:05:12.612 --> 00:05:15.014
Thanks! I'm really glad it's your drink that I landed in.

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:17.016
Say, what's your name? Mistress, uh...

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.486
Don't worry about the Mistress. Just call me Runo!

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.288
Well, Runo, I've traveled all this way

00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:23.723
and the arenas are closed!

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.425
Can you help me find someone to battle against?

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:28.394
I don't know, I don't think it's a good idea

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:29.896
with Wiseman still on the loose.

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.932
A friendly battle could be a costly distraction.

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.167
AEROGAN: Are you sure?

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.568
RUNO: My teammates, the Battle Brawlers and I,

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.537
have been keeping a vigilant watch for signs of trouble.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.239
We can't afford to slip, 'cause it would spell doom!

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:43.543
Did you saw the Battle Brawlers? Those guys are legends!

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.645
And you're a member? That's totally awesome!

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.781
Yeah, I just recently re-joined to help them out.

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:50.016
AEROGAN: As a battler?

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:51.984
Well, these days I'm acting more as a remote backup

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.253
for the Brawlers since I don't have a partner Bakugan

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.354
at the moment.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:58.057
Seriously? You're flying solo?!

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:00.093
That's right, but I don't mind.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:02.028
I'm still an important part of the team.

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:04.497
Speaking of partners, where's yours?

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.968
Did you guys get separated or are you flying solo too?

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:12.004
AEROGAN: Actually, that's another reason I came to Bakugan City.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.740
To find a partner?

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:16.109
That's right! But it looks like I can cross that item

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.443
off my list, doesn't it?

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:18.644
Huh?

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:20.980
Mistress Runo! Would you do me the great honour

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.682
of being my battling partner?

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.117
Huh?!

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.519
Think about it. You're a Brawler without a Bakugan,

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:29.122
and I'm a Bakugan without a Brawler. It's perfect!

00:06:29.155 --> 00:06:31.090
Besides, I'm tired of training by myself!

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:32.325
Hm...

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.396
\u266a

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.499
So anyway, that's how I first met Aerogan,

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.868
and he hasn't left my side ever since.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.270
All I've ever wanted to do was battle, guys.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:46.372
So what do you say? Can I join your team? Please?

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:48.107
Please, please, please, please, please?

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.609
(Laughing)

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:52.445
Well, I certainly have to give you points for enthusiasm.

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:54.046
(Chirping)

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.149
You can agree with Marucho all you want, Roxtor.

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:58.284
But I think the kid's being a bit pushy.

00:06:58.317 --> 00:06:59.652
(Chuckling)

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:01.020
He reminds me of you.

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:02.855
What are you talking about?

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.025
So tell us why you're so anxious to battle.

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:07.994
Well, my specialty has always been jumping.

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:09.328
It's what I'm good at.

00:07:09.362 --> 00:07:11.364
So that's what my Mistress always had me practicing.

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:15.268
That's all I would do, day after day. Jump up and down,

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:17.804
and up and down, from dawn til dusk.

00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:20.773
But eventually I got kinda bored of being up in the clouds

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.909
and began to wonder what was beyond them.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:25.978
So here I am, fellas. Ready to put my skills to the test

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.346
in an actual battle.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.916
Do you really think just because you're a good jumper

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.317
you'll be a good battler?

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.052
AEROGAN: Well, how am I ever gonna find out if I don't

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.320
give battling a try?

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:36.522
I'll never know if I just stick to jumping in the dirt.

00:07:36.556 --> 00:07:39.025
It's clear to me that you don't understand

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:40.726
what it truly means to be a battler.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.262
Why are you talking to me like I'm a kid?

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:45.164
You sound just like my Mistress.

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:48.401
So, Dan, tell me, what do you think, huh?

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:50.570
I think that Runo, you brought him home,

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:53.139
so he's your problem to deal with now.

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:56.676
Fine! You're no help.

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:59.812
So, do you see anything interesting, Mira?

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.650
MIRA: Well, he's definitely got superior jumping ability,

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:05.952
that's for sure.

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:09.822
I told you guys! That's all I do day in and day out.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:12.058
Speaking of which, my legs are cramping up,

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.459
which means I should practice.

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:14.760
You mean like, right now?

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.796
Yeah, it's the only way I can work out the stiffness.

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:19.232
Do you know anywhere around here that I might be able to

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:21.000
get some practice in, Mistress Runo?

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.902
Uh, practice?

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:28.608
\u266a

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:31.544
Whoa... this training in the mountains thing

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:33.946
is more Shun's kinda speed, not mine.

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:38.851
For a guy who left home because he was sick of training,

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:41.287
you're working it pretty hard there, Aerogan.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.990
AEROGAN: I said I wanted to do more than just train,

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.458
not quit it all together.

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:47.059
(Giggling)

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:49.095
But I've gotta tell you, I'm really happy to be here with you

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:50.897
even if it's only for a daily workout.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.765
But I'd love it if it were more!

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.800
So what do you say, can we be partners?

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:56.269
Please, please, please--

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:59.772
Stop with all this \"partner\" stuff!

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:02.642
I gave up battling a long time ago, anyhow. Okay?

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:05.611
What? Why the heck would you do that?

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:09.782
Well, you see, my old partner Bakugan, Tigrerra, and I

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:12.184
decided that rather than battle on the front line,

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.220
we would take a more defensive role instead.

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:15.755
You mean you focused on staying behind

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:17.189
and protecting your family?

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:20.259
Mm-hm. But enough talking about me.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:22.228
We're here so you can get your training in.

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:23.663
'Cause that's what you're gonna have to do

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:25.031
if you want to be a battler.

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:27.833
Okay, then. Get a load of this!

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:31.137
Wow!

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:39.378
\u266a

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.881
Well, well, well. Hmph.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.551
Dragonoid Destroyer! Get ready to rumble!

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:51.824
WISEMAN: Vengeance will soon be yours, Nonets!

00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:54.760
I thought Runo was merely the battle suit operator.

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:58.397
WORTON: I've never seen that Bakugan before, but if she's here

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:01.801
training him, then surely they are battling partners.

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:04.003
They should be easy to defeat.

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:06.973
Balista, why are you so quiet?

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:08.941
(Growling)

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:12.278
WORTON: Trust me, Balista, it's better that you forget what you saw

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:13.779
just for now.

00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:17.550
We need to keep our eyes on the main target, understood?

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:20.786
No reason. Just thinking about the battle ahead.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.756
(Panting)

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:27.159
That was great. Why don't you take a little breather?

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:30.830
AEROGAN: Nah, I've got a few more in me. Just give me a sec, okay?

00:10:30.863 --> 00:10:34.000
You really put 110% into things.

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:36.402
I bet your Mistress would be really proud

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:38.037
if she could see you now, Aerogan.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.240
Do you really think so?

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:43.075
Yup. Gee, thanks!

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:44.543
Huh?

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:46.178
RUNO: Wiseman!

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.681
So you were a battler too then, Runo.

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:51.250
Perhaps you should show me what you're made of.

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:55.454
Oh, I don't think so, pal. I left that life behind. Got it?

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:56.722
AEROGAN: Of course we'll fight, you creep.

00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:58.257
And we'll wipe the floor with you too, got it?!

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.458
Hold on!

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.761
Mistress Runo! You've seen how much strength

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:04.797
and endurance I have, we can do this! Trust me!

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:09.635
Hah-hah-hah. Looks like your Bakugan

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.737
has enough arrogance for the both of you.

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:13.372
Hm...

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:14.940
DAN: Wiseman!

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:17.143
If you wanna fight, take us on!

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:21.113
Dan!

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:22.548
AEROGAN: How did you find us?

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:24.817
Mira told us you were off to train, so we had her track you

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.385
from Runo's BakuMeter signal.

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:27.820
Looks like we got here just in time.

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:31.791
Dan Kouzo! If you're planning on lecturing me,

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:33.192
you better think twice, buddy!

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:35.494
Hold on, Runo.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.696
We didn't come here to lecture you.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.198
We came to apologize.

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:40.399
Huh? Wait a sec!

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:43.402
Well I guess I accept, then.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:44.704
(Groaning)

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:48.007
Let's do this, Wiseman.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.776
My pleasure, Kouzo.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.280
Bakugan... brawl!

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:55.681
Bakugan, stand!

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:58.617
Rise, Ventus Worton!

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:00.953
Rise, Aquous Balista!

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:04.757
Bakugan... brawl!

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.426
Baku Sky Raiders, jump!

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.863
Go Pyrus, using Dragonoid!

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:12.465
(Roaring)

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:14.633
Baku Sky Raider, jump!

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:16.936
Go Haos Reptak!

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:19.171
\u266a

00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:21.440
Ability activate!

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:22.975
Switch blizzard!

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:28.047
No way! So intense.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.316
Watch this!

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:32.551
Your turn, professor!

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:33.886
Ability activate...

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.521
Dawn tentacle!

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:37.790
(Grunting)

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:43.162
Ability activate!

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:44.830
Spar hook!

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:48.134
Target locked!

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.438
Engage!

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.175
Wicked!

00:12:56.208 --> 00:13:01.147
Ability activate... hyper agility!

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.282
No way!

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:06.919
Where do you think you're going?

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:10.623
Give it up! Your attacks are utterly futile against a Nonet!

00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:17.263
You won't get away with this, Worton.

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:20.099
Don't worry! I've got plenty to go around!

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:23.402
(Pained shouting)

00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:24.770
Drago!

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:29.508
Hah! Are you ready for this now? It's time to combine.

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:31.177
Say the words!

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.345
Bakugan fuse!

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:43.389
\u266a

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.925
(Roaring)

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:50.796
Whoa! This is crazy intense.

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:54.500
We are not gonna lose this! Do you hear me, Wiseman?!

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:57.436
Drago, Reptak! Time to combine, guys!

00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:58.470
Right!

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:01.674
Fusion ability activate!

00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:03.909
Hydro monsoon!

00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:05.578
(Roaring wildly)

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.085
Drago, Reptak, now!

00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:15.421
Oh no! Mistress Runo?!

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:20.492
It's okay, they can still win this fight.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:21.961
Uh...

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:29.034
Drago, you okay?

00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:30.436
Never better.

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:33.739
I thought I had strength and endurance, but these guys...

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:35.341
It's clear to me that you don't understand

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:37.276
what it truly means to be a battler.

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:41.247
Drago was right. I didn't then. But I sure do now.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.049
Ability activate!

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:45.317
Say what?

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:47.319
DRAGO: Once you've been hit by hydro monsoon,

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:50.022
you're paralyzed from activating any of your own abilities

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:51.390
for quite some time.

00:14:51.423 --> 00:14:54.560
Even in dark moments like this, Drago and Reptak

00:14:54.593 --> 00:14:57.096
will never give up the fight, Aerogan.

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:59.298
Because they want to protect us!

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:01.567
(Moaning)

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.436
That was a tough one, but we've faced worse. Right, Drago?

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.473
You bet. That was just a warm-up.

00:15:07.506 --> 00:15:10.409
Let's show him that the bond between Bakugan and humans

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:11.710
can't be broken!

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:14.680
You really need a new speech.

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:16.148
(Roaring)

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:20.619
What the...

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:23.422
Not again!

00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:25.224
(Shouting)

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.865
No way!

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:35.701
I finally understand what it truly means

00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:37.102
to be a battler.

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:41.073
Please, Mistress Runo. Let me help out with this battle.

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:44.843
Wiseman! You may have won that round, but we're not done yet!

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:47.346
You hear me? Not even close!

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.882
WORTON: That's tough talk for a loser!

00:15:49.915 --> 00:15:51.750
AEROGAN: This isn't about me testing my skills

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.352
or being bored with my training.

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:56.188
Dragonoid destroyer!

00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:58.657
AEROGAN: I finally found my true reason to battle!

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:00.259
Please let me help.

00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:05.197
Bakugan... brawl!

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.067
I can honestly say it's what my original mistress

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.401
back home would have wanted.

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.070
Yeah, you're right!

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:15.507
Dan, here comes a little help from your friends.

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:19.678
All right! Bakugan brawl!

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:21.847
Are you ready, Drago?

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.816
DRAGO: You bet!

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:26.285
Bakugan brawl!

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:27.953
Ride on!

00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:30.155
DAN: Jumping attack!

00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:33.225
Here I go!

00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:37.062
Spar hook!

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.497
(Roaring)

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:42.167
Earth revolver!

00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:44.870
Let 'em have it!

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:46.638
Attack!

00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:52.144
I told you your attacks were useless!

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:00.819
I see an opening!

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.589
Ability, activate!

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:06.558
Lightning smasher!

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:11.230
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:13.465
Huh?

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:15.167
(Booming)

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.503
(Groaning)

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:18.804
Nice one! Great job!

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:22.274
Huh? Whoa! I did it! I totally thrashed that dude!

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:24.743
Fusion ability, activate!

00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:28.781
Blast bow!

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:30.282
No way!

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:31.817
You'll never defeat me!

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:35.287
(Booming)

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.323
But I thought I destroyed him.

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:39.558
Keep your guard up, Aerogan.

00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:41.627
Nonets are the most evil of evil.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.930
They're not going to go down so easily. Remember that.

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:47.733
Aw, man. What are we gonna do now?

00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:49.468
(Roaring)

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:52.638
Watch out, Aerogan!

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:56.108
Yah! Oof!

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:59.078
We've gotta hold on!

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:01.280
Not the twister again!

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:03.849
We can't get through it, so we're going to have to

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:05.350
attack from above again.

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:07.119
I'm pinned down pretty good here.

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:09.288
I don't think I can make it that high.

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:14.526
Whoa... higher than before, but I think I can do it.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.464
\u266a

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:21.066
Dragonoid Destroyer only has enough juice for one more attack

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.734
so you're gonna have to do it on your own!

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:26.939
I'm on it! I'll just have to give it my best leap.

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:29.875
Hold on! Maybe I can give you some help!

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:31.243
Let's do it, then!

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:45.357
\u266a

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.460
This is my stop. The rest is up to you, kid.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.662
I've got this.

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:54.833
Okay, then! alley-oop!

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.802
Fight!

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:59.371
I'm gonna do this, because the Brawlers taught me

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:04.009
what it means to battle for all the right reasons!

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:05.744
Time to drop the hammer.

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:07.946
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.016
You think that lousy attack will work on me?

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:13.619
Absolutely!

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:16.855
Force cannon!

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:18.924
(Booming)

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:21.426
Now! Give it all you got, kid!

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.930
Go, Aerogan!

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:26.431
Whoa!

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:30.736
(Booming)

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:32.471
Now, Dragonoid Destroyer!

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:35.207
Hyper cross cannon!

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.842
(Roaring)

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:48.654
Hmph. I must confess, you took me by surprise today.

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:53.091
Yeah!

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:56.728
(Panting)

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:58.063
Uh, best jump ever!

00:19:58.096 --> 00:19:59.698
Thanks!

00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:02.534
So you actually found your true reason for battling.

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:03.869
Yeah, but I forgot it already.

00:20:03.902 --> 00:20:05.871
Uh, are you serious?!

00:20:05.904 --> 00:20:07.539
Nah, I'm just messing with you.

00:20:07.573 --> 00:20:09.508
Which is what partners do with each other, right?

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:10.976
Right!

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:12.544
I wanna thank you again, Mistress Runo,

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:14.179
for being so awesome to me.

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.748
I had an amazing time and learned so much.

00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:20.018
But I think it's time I go back home to finish my training.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:27.693
\u266a

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:30.362
Mistress, I'm sorry for running off like that

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:31.530
without telling you.

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:33.165
But I learned many valuable lessons

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:34.833
during my time on Earth.

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:37.436
I actually got to fight alongside the Battle Brawlers

00:20:37.469 --> 00:20:39.404
with my new partner, Runo.

00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:42.841
Runo? I know of her! No doubt you did much learning

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:44.676
during your time with her.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.512
But now you are back home, and your focus must return

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:49.781
to jumping practice. So off you go.

00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:51.750
Yes, Mistress.

00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:56.355
Runo, even though much time has passed and we are far apart,

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:59.157
our hearts still share a bond.

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:02.361
Wherever you may be, I wish only safety and happiness

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:04.263
for you and the rest of the Brawlers.

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.302
BALISTA: For too long, we have been awaiting the vengeance

00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:12.704
that Wiseman has promised us against Drago.

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.906
My Nonet brothers and I suspected

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.208
he was hiding something.

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:18.944
Hidden deep inside our hideout, I found a prisoner

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:22.581
who looked exactly like Wiseman. But who was he?

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.383
Before we could answer that question,

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:27.119
the Brawlers infiltrated our fortress.

00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:30.088
If you can muster the courage, I suggest you tune in to watch

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:33.458
what will surely be the demise of Drago and the Brawlers.

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:37.162
Who knows? Perhaps we'll even take out Wiseman!

00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:47.172
\u266a
