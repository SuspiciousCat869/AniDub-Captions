00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.775
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well,

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.110
after the Bakugan came to live with us,

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:11.611
but then out of nowhere,

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.681
we were invaded by these mysterious and evil Mechtogan

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.649
who were intent on destroying everything!

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.017
Coredegon,

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.086
Slycerak, Exostriker,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.354
and Mandibor were their names,

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.857
and leading them was this clown, Wiseman.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.425
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:26.826
called the Nonets.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.628
Luckily for us, we had our own secret weapon

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.897
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.265
so we fought back.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.134
Because no one is gonna take our freedom!

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.969
Not now, not ever!

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.872
\u266a What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:42.075
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.511
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:45.879
\u266a You gotta give it your all

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.113
\u266a Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.848
\u266a This is the final stand

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.917
\u266a Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.918
\u266a The power's in your hand

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.753
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:58.024
\u266a On the inside

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.994
\u266a You've gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:04.030
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone This is Bakugan \u266a

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.071
(Chuckling evilly)

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.073
Whoa!

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:17.977
(Chuckling evilly)

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.613
I don't believe it. Wiseman is...

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.781
Coredegon.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.117
This just gets weirder and weirder.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.718
You said it, pal!

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.154
The time has finally come

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:32.225
for me to fulfil my destiny!

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.360
(Gasping)

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.302
DAN: Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Evil Evolution.\"

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.679
(Groaning)

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:55.648
(Grunting)

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:56.649
(Chattering)

00:01:56.683 --> 00:02:00.019
(Groaning)

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:03.389
DRAGO: Dan, you have to throw me again.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:08.628
It's too late for that. Say goodbye.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.531
DRAGO: Dan!

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.500
Drago! (Straining)

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:14.934
(Chuckling evilly)

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:18.071
This is going to be...fun!

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.273
(Groaning)

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.409
Who dares?!

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:25.745
GLIDERAK: The pleasure of destroying Drago belongs to us!

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:27.780
We won't let you take that away.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:31.584
I'll take more than that, you insolent fool!

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.854
(Groaning)

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:37.724
(Screaming)

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.392
(Laughing evilly)

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:40.426
Huh?

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.962
Sneaky rodents!

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.998
You won't get far!

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:03.683
(All panting)

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:05.051
Aww, man.

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.420
That was way too close for comfort, you guys.

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:08.855
MARUCHO: No kidding.

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:12.458
I still can't believe Wiseman is really Coredegon in disguise.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:14.661
I guess in hindsight,

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.029
it makes perfect sense.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.630
If you think about it,

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:18.965
whenever Coredegon was around,

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:20.733
Wiseman was never in sight.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:23.069
But who would've figured a gigantor like that

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.504
would've shrank down to human size?

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:25.805
(Squawking)

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:27.106
DRAGO: Huh?

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.809
I wonder what's up with Reptak.

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:33.947
I can't believe I turned my back on my partner.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.816
No, that's-- that's not true, you guys, no!

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.686
Come on, it's me here! You gotta believe me!

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.324
REPTAK: I should've believed him!

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:47.260
I've gotta fix this.

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:48.628
Reptak, hold on!

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.163
Where do you think you're going?

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.864
I've gotta go find Gunz!

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:53.499
Get out of my way, Drago!

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:54.567
I mean it!

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:58.071
DRAGO: Reptak, you need to calm down.

00:03:58.104 --> 00:03:59.806
SENSEI: We need to stick together right now.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.842
If we let out emotions splinter the team, we're all doomed.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:03.910
Sensei's right.

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:05.311
You're being rash and impulsive.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:06.679
If you really want to help Gunz--

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:11.184
ORBEUM: You'll help us take down Coredegon first.

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:14.387
(Grunting)

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.557
I just hate the thought of him out there by himself.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.626
Don't worry, pal.

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.661
We're gonna get Gunz back, all right?

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.963
I promise.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.738
(Thinking:)

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:35.742
REPTAK: Gunz, if it is really you, then let me ask you,

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:39.212
do you remember the oath that we swore to each other?

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:43.483
If you're Gunz, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:44.817
Gunz!

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:46.619
I can only see bits of it.

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:48.655
Ugh, my brain's so fuzzy!

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.993
I just don't get it.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:56.095
Why-- why can't I remember?

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.799
There are these giant blank spots in my memory.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:02.735
I have no idea why!

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:05.738
Perhaps I could help with an explanation.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:06.939
Huh?!

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.742
As you know...

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:11.544
COREDEGON'S VOICE: The Brawlers defeated us.

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:13.346
DAN: Attack!

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.082
COREDEGON'S VOICE: Once again, the Mechtogan were cast into the abyss.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.717
Having been betrayed by the Nonets,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.752
we had no Bakugan to act as our hosts,

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:22.655
so we were doomed to wander between the dimensions.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.858
But still I swore vengeance against the Brawlers.

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:28.127
Escape seemed hopeless at best;

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.462
then I spotted you.

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:32.498
I could see your aura of hatred toward the Brawlers,

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:33.599
and I got an idea.

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:36.469
I would take that energy and repurpose it.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:40.440
It was not only strong enough to keep me connected to your world,

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:42.275
but I could also use it as a cloak

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:44.277
in which to disguise myself.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.780
And just like that, the Wiseman persona was born.

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:51.217
It's because the energy came from you

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.386
that I resemble you so closely.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.188
But it seems that along with your looks,

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:58.324
I also took part of your memory.

00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.593
So that's why my brain's like Swiss cheese

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:02.161
and I can't remember anything!

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:07.133
(Grunting)

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:08.534
It would be a grave mistake

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:11.904
for you to overestimate your current value to me, Gunz.

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:13.072
Don't get me wrong.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.874
I appreciate you providing me with a vessel

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:16.976
for which to enact my vengeance,

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.112
but I won't allow you to get in my way.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.113
COREDEGON'S VOICE: So...

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:21.347
(Gasping)

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:26.018
Be a good boy and cooperate, or else...

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.988
I'll be forced to do away with you for good.

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:32.291
I need out of here!

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.794
I can't stand it anymore!

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:35.795
Let me out!

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:37.764
Take it easy, Kodokor!

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:40.166
You're going to wind up hurting yourself!

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.068
What exactly is that out there?

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:43.503
STRONK: I'm not sure.

00:06:43.536 --> 00:06:45.004
What do you think, Professor?

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:47.840
It's a portal of some sort.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:49.275
(Grunting)

00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:50.343
Wiseman!

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:51.344
Who do you think you are,

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:53.513
holding us here after we helped you?

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:55.348
Obviously, he's just been using us this whole time

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:57.750
to help with his complete resurrection!

00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:01.320
Ha, it took you long enough to figure that out.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:03.289
Too bad for you, it's too late for the truth

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:06.225
to be of any use to you.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.860
Is that what happened to Balista?

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:10.429
He figured out your little secret too soon?

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:11.597
SPATTERIX: What did you do to him?

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:14.801
(Chuckling) Ah, Professor,

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:17.303
I can always count on you to be so perceptive.

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:24.343
COREDEGON'S VOICE: Unfortunately, I don't have time to sit and gloat.

00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:28.080
I must get back to fulfilling my true destiny.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.217
But in the meantime, I will leave you with a decision

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.985
to make regarding your fate.

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:34.620
BETADRON: What are you talking about?

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:37.089
As soon as I defeat the Brawlers,

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.025
I'm going to destroy the Earth.

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:42.328
You can stay here and be destroyed with it,

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:43.863
or you can return to the Doom Dimension

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:46.399
where you...

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:49.435
Can rot for eternity!

00:07:49.468 --> 00:07:52.738
(Laughing evilly)

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:55.708
(Screaming)

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:58.411
COREDEGON: So, what's it going to be?

00:07:58.444 --> 00:08:00.179
Quick and easy,

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.982
or long and miserable?

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:05.551
(Laughing evilly)

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:12.491
Whoa! What the...?

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:13.526
Look!

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:14.627
Up there, guys!

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.662
(Gasping)

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:24.670
Finally.

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:26.706
Let's crush some insects!

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:30.643
You said it!

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:33.212
Mandibor, Slicerak, Exostriker,

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:36.215
it's time to rid the universe of every last human and Bakugan

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:38.484
so that the Mechtogan may rise and rule,

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.353
as was written to be our destiny.

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:41.354
Are you ready?

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:42.388
You heard them, guys!

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:44.056
They're going all the way!

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.324
Let's smash 'em!

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:49.629
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:52.231
Baku-Sky Raiders, jump!

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.799
Go, Pyrus Fusion Dragonoid!

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:57.203
Go, Haos Reptak!

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:59.505
Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.540
Baku-Sky Raider, jump!

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:04.010
Go, Ventus Jaakor!

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.945
Baku-Sky Raiders, jump!

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:07.780
Go, Darkus Skytruss!

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:11.083
Go, Darkus Orbeum!

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:12.184
On our own, we're tough...

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.953
But together, we're unstoppable!

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:16.289
BOTH: Prepare for a ninja takedown!

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.524
Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:19.559
Bakugan, stand!

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:20.560
Oh, yeah!

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.495
MARUCHO: Go, Aquos Radizen!

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:25.164
I'm so ready to rock!

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:27.533
MARUCHO: Go, Subterra Roxtor!

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:28.801
No offense, dude,

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:33.439
but you've gotta work on your snappy one liners.

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.074
Bring it!

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:37.209
(Sighing)

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.544
Your arrogance makes me laugh!

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.712
Oh, yeah?

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:42.481
We'll see who's laughing when this is all over.

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.317
We're taking you all down.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.318
(Laughing)

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.687
SLICERAK: The mouthy kid is mine!

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.755
EXOSTRIKER: Get in line, Slicerak!

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:52.291
MANDIBOR: Are we talking or are we fighting here?

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:56.395
Let the destruction begin!

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.198
DAN: Get ready, Thorak. We need you.

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:06.172
MARUCHO: Look sharp, Flytris. We can't lose this one!

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:07.573
Ability, activate!

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.242
Power Bonus!

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:11.677
(Cheering)

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:14.613
Sludge Leap!

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:17.883
(Grunting)

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:21.454
(Laughing evilly)

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:23.422
Whoa, not even a scratch!

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.824
Try this.

00:10:24.857 --> 00:10:27.460
Ability, activate!

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:30.796
Ultimate Kazami Style - Rapid Fury!

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.432
(Grunting)

00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:41.641
Is that really your best?

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:43.843
If so, this will be a short battle.

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:45.177
Not a chance!

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.413
Ability, activate!

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:48.981
Grapple Buster!

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.616
(Grunting)

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.220
Dragon Exploder!

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:55.821
EXOSTRIKER: Counter Attack!

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.857
COREDEGON: You got it!

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:04.897
(Gasping)

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.799
(Groaning)

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:09.735
(Screaming)

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:13.272
Whoa!

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:14.340
Aww, man. Nothing's working.

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:15.341
Hey, guys!

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:17.610
It's time to combine!

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:19.245
You heard him, Reptak!

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:20.946
Let's do it!

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.315
BOTH: Bakugan, unite!

00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:35.194
Our turn, Jaakor!

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:38.597
This means you too, Skytruss and Orbeum!

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:43.135
JAAKOR: Bakugan, unite!

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:46.305
Combined ninjas, Herculean Power!

00:11:46.338 --> 00:11:48.708
Roxtor! Radizen!

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:51.310
RADIZEN: Here we go!

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:56.148
Bakugan, fuse!

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:57.950
Aww, yeah!

00:11:57.983 --> 00:12:00.820
Talk about a killer combo!

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:03.322
You know what this means, brothers.

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:05.958
Time to do our own combination.

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:08.594
These fools won't know what hit them.

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:11.197
COREDEGON: Positions, everyone!

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:18.337
Integrate!

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.773
Mechtavius Destroyer!

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:23.843
Say goodbye!

00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:26.178
(Groaning)

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:31.050
Oh, man!

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:33.385
I'm dancing as fast as I can here!

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:36.689
Time to make like an ostrich!

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:37.690
Oh, snap!

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:38.791
I wish Gunz was here!

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:40.292
We could sure use an extra hand!

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:41.360
Hey, you creeps!

00:12:41.393 --> 00:12:44.163
What did you do with Gunz?

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:47.900
Forget about him. He's ancient history now.

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:49.969
Just like you're going to be!

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:04.016
Huh?

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:14.927
(Laughing evilly)

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:22.034
Quick! You need to throw me!

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:25.137
Bakugan Brawl!

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.973
Baku-Sky Raider, jump!

00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:32.845
(Growling)

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:37.449
Coredegon has deceived, double crossed and left us all to die!

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:41.020
But that doesn't mean we have to just sit back and take it!

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:43.856
And there's still that matter of Drago to settle.

00:13:43.889 --> 00:13:45.357
Are you serious?

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:47.660
You still think we can take him down?

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:49.862
The burning desire to destroy Drago

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.998
is what fuelled us to break free of the Doom Dimension.

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:57.736
And it's what's going to free us from this place!

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.472
End of the line, Drago!

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.640
(Grunting)

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.142
Drago! Reptak!

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:05.177
(Screaming)

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:11.684
Shun, Marucho! We've gotta call out Mechtogan!

00:14:11.717 --> 00:14:14.086
Right! Come on, let's do it!

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:16.121
Dragonoid Destroyer!

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:23.929
Bakugan Brawl!

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:27.433
Right on!

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:30.135
I am here to do your bidding, masters!

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.608
Join us, Thorak!

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.643
(Thorak yelling)

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:43.482
We need you, Flytris!

00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:45.517
(Squawking)

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:54.193
I have come to fight on the side of all that is good

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.161
and defend my ninja brothers!

00:14:56.195 --> 00:15:00.899
Likewise, I will destroy all evil doers who oppose my master!

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:06.005
Don't think for a second that we won't destroy

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:09.842
you traitorous Mechtogan, along with the rest!

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:12.244
(Growling)

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:15.614
(Grunting)

00:15:15.648 --> 00:15:18.484
THORAK: Chain Dragon!

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:19.818
(Groaning)

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:21.453
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Don't forget about me!

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:26.392
(Grunting)

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:27.860
Yeah! Keep going!

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:30.996
United Ability, activate!

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.232
Supreme Jet Shot!

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:35.901
JAAKOR: We will vanquish you once again!

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:36.902
(Grunting)

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:39.104
Fusion Ability, activate!

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:40.606
Abyss Render!

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:41.607
Aww, yeah!

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.911
I love the swirly action!

00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:49.848
(Groaning)

00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:52.718
COREDEGON: You're all going to pay for that dearly.

00:15:55.554 --> 00:15:56.522
No mercy!

00:15:56.555 --> 00:16:01.060
Wha--

00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:04.229
(Growling)

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:08.167
(Screaming)

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.737
(Gasping)

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.606
(Screaming)

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.009
MUTABRID: But I don't understand, Betadron!

00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:19.178
Without Wiseman, we're helpless!

00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:21.814
We need a partner battler to do what you're talking about!

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:22.815
STRONK: Yeah!

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:23.816
You're all correct!

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:26.251
We do need a partner battler.

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:27.319
So how about it, Gunz?

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:28.988
Huh? Me?

00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:30.456
Sure! Why not?

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:33.225
I don't know. It's just that, I would--

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:36.395
Get your own revenge for all that Wiseman and the Brawlers

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:38.030
have taken from you!

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:39.465
Yeah, right, we know!

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:42.000
You and Wiseman are the same guy!

00:16:42.034 --> 00:16:45.170
COREDEGON'S VOICE: Do I...

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:47.272
Wha--

00:16:47.306 --> 00:16:49.475
COREDEGON'S VOICE: Look familiar to you?

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:01.387
(Thinking:) You stole my identity, Wiseman,

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.989
so now I'm taking it back.

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:06.024
It's mine!

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:17.202
BETADRON: Well, isn't that interesting?

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:18.637
Your rage is so strong,

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.374
it's changed the colour of the suit to reflect your inner fire.

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:23.475
This has been interesting,

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:25.544
but it's time for me to say farewell.

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:26.779
What ? Why?

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:29.181
This is one battle I don't think we can win.

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:32.451
I don't relish the idea of an eternity in the Doom Dimension,

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:34.887
but it's preferable to being blown to smithereens.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.657
Good luck.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.692
Let's get back at it!

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.728
Right! You bet!

00:17:47.065 --> 00:17:49.401
Attack!

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:50.436
Earth Revolver!

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:53.572
United Ability, activate!

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:55.841
Supreme Thunder!

00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:57.342
JAAKOR: Lights out!

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.745
Fusion Ability, activate!

00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:01.547
Terror Blue!

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.551
Open wide!

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:07.519
Unleash the Force Cannon next!

00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:12.191
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: You read my mind!

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:13.692
Universal...

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.928
Combine!

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:35.881
COREDEGON: What a truly pathetic display of your power.

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:38.984
Huh? How's that possible?

00:18:39.017 --> 00:18:42.254
Now pay attention while I show the unmatched power

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:45.757
of a mutated Mechtogan in its fully resurrected form!

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:46.758
(Growling)

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:50.929
(Screaming)

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:53.599
Jaakor, Skytruss, Orbeum!

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:57.836
Roxtor, Radizen!

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.174
(Growling)

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:04.676
We're not gonna lose to those creeps!

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.677
Never!

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:07.646
We can still win this!

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:09.982
Go, Dragonoid Destroyer!

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:12.017
Hyper Cross Cannon!

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:17.289
Diabolical Energy Cannon!

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:19.324
Engage!

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:28.367
(Groaning)

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.402
(Yelling)

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:35.107
Drago!

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.808
(Gasping)

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:40.646
(Screaming)

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.848
DRAGO: That's some incredible power.

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:44.516
He's too strong.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.617
SHUN: Dan!

00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:48.020
MARUCHO: Drago!

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:49.821
(Chattering)

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:51.223
Hmm?

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:54.326
Clearly, we've come to the end of the line, Brawlers.

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:57.196
But strangely, I don't think I'll find satisfaction

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.897
with destroying you.

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:01.166
Hmm...

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:03.368
Oh no! This sounds bad!

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.771
Instead, I'll extend your suffering

00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:08.106
by banishing you to the Doom Dimension!

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.142
VOICE: Bakugan Brawl!

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.388
Huh?

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:25.691
Is that...

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:32.197
Another Wiseman.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.133
Gunz!

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:36.768
(Laughing evilly)

00:20:36.802 --> 00:20:38.870
Playing dress up now, are we?

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:41.707
We're taking the Brawlers down, then you!

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.176
I doubt that very much.

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:46.645
(Roaring)

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:47.980
Huh? What?

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:49.815
What?

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:51.850
(Roaring)

00:20:55.687 --> 00:20:56.688
(Gasping)

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:58.357
(Screaming)

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.359
Huh?!

00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:02.394
(Screaming)

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:10.702
DAN: Things were looking pretty bad during our last battle.

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:12.771
With Octavius destroyed, we had our whole teamed pinned down,

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:14.873
ready to destroy us, but instead, decided to banish us

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:16.475
to the Doom Dimension, and now that we're here,

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:18.910
I don't know how we're ever gonna get out.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.879
Making things even crazier are the Nonets,

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:23.315
who are now being led by a new version of Wiseman,

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:24.483
or maybe it's Gunz.

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:26.418
We don't really know. It's insane.

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:28.854
All I know for sure is that we're in deep trouble.

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:30.722
Tune in and you'll see for yourself that we're up against

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.791
all kinds of deadly forces.

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:34.960
The hardest part of this battle is going to be figuring out

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:36.962
who we need to defeat first!

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:47.305
