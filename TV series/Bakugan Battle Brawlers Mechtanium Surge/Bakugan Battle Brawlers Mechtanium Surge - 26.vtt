00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.410
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:12.011
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.682
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:17.584
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:20.086
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.022
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:25.125
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:28.294
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.463
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.232
We just might have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.368
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.505
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.775
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:45.011
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:48.248
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:51.418
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:57.490
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:00.160
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:03.129
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.632
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.503
MARUCHO: So I guess Dan and Drago are on the other side

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.572
battling Mag Mel and Razenoid.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:17.544
TRISTAR: Then we need to do our part down here.

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.546
PAIGE: Yeah there's still a bunch of Titans

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.614
and Chaos Bakugan that need cleaning up.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:24.150
SPECTRA: Hmmmph, sounds like fun.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:27.787
SHUN: Quit joking. The fate of the world is at stake!

finally runs out, Drago!

DRAGO: We'll see who the unlucky one is, Razenoid!

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:50.743
DRAGO: Hmmmph!

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.378

MAG MEL: Time to disappear!

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.715
DAN: Drago!

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.651

DAN: [gasp] Huh!

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.595
DAN: Zenthon and Zenthon Titan...

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.331
DRAGO: But how? We didn't summon them?

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:49.836
ZENTHON: We are both connected at a core level to our masters.

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.938
ZENTHON TITAN: You needn't always call our names...

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.039
to summon us.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:54.374

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.611
with its own free will?

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:02.081
RAZENOID: You two have clearly lost control!

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.150
MAG MEL: Which is just further proof that you are...

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:07.353
doomed to suffer defeat at our hands!

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:10.290

MAG MEL: I'm going to take you down,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.379
but before I deliver the final blow,

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:37.584
I'm going to make you watch as I destroy Earth.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.219
DAN: What is your problem Mag Mel, huh?

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.589
What have these people ever done to you?

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.224
Why can't you just leave them alone?

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:46.593
MAG MEL: Such weak and pathetic creatures!

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.161
DAN: You're insane!

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.630
MAG MEL: Consider this payback. What better way...

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:52.732
to defeat your enemy than to destroy...

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.068
that which they treasure the most.

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:57.136
DAN: So that's the reason why you're doing this!

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.039
DRAGO: A real warrior would only battle his true enemy.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.308
There is no pride in harming the innocent!

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.843
RAZENOID: You're missing the point.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:06.145
Neither guilt nor innocence matter to us.

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.515
Those ridiculous concepts only matter to fools like you!

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.151
Our only goal is to see you sufffffeeerrrrrr!

MAG MEL: The sooner you realize that anger and hatred

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:18.791
is what fuels us, the better equipped...

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.593
you'll be to battle us!

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:23.796
MAG MEL: You see, Kuso, when we came into contact...

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.698
with the power of the Sacred Orb,

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:28.935
these characteristics were magnified in us.

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:32.071
It caused us to undergo a type of metamorphosis.

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:35.341
Our hunger for such things increased so much...

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.909
that just as our hearts hardened,

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.811
so too did our exteriors.

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:41.280
We were incased in an armour of evil.

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:44.550

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:19.531
but you've defeated me, once again, Kuso.

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:23.602
Still your victory will be short lived!

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:26.939
MAG MEL: My final demise will mean the immediate...

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:29.174
and uncontrolled release of the vast amount...

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:31.310
of energy I have collected.

00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:35.013
Which spells utter disaster and the end for you.

00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:39.184
So once again you've caused your own downfall.

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:43.021
MAG MEL: It's time for us both to fade awaaaaaaaay!

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:44.356

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.602
SHUN: Something's happening!

00:18:58.036 --> 00:18:59.538
PAIGE: Did you do that?

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:01.173
RAFE: Nope, wasn't me.

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:02.908
PAIGE: [grunt] [gasp] RAFE: [grunt] [gasp]

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:06.178
COMPUTER HYDE: High Intensity Laser penetration to...

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:09.281
the Earth's core has gone through total reversal.

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.683
COMPUTER HYDE: Threat level has been completely neutralized.

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:13.819

00:19:22.961 --> 00:19:24.563
MAN A: Hey look! It's gone!

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:25.731
WOMAN A: The dark moon?

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:26.965
MAN B: Yeah, that's right.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:29.868
KID A: Whoooa! Look at the Zams!

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:34.006
ROBIN: Think we should tell them...

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:36.008
how close they were to disaster?

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:38.110
JACK: Nah, why spoil the mood.

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:40.679

00:19:40.712 --> 00:19:43.916

MARUCHO: Hey guys you there?

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:47.452
TRISTAR: Maybe when the dark moon disappeared,

00:19:47.486 --> 00:19:49.087
they went with it.

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:53.158
MARUCHO: No Tristar. Don't talk like that!

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:57.396
SPECTRA: It looks like Kuso went down saving the rest of us.

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:59.531
SPECTRA: He was very brave.

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:01.433
HELIOS: What a waste.

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:04.136
HELIOS: How could you lose Drago?!

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:10.542
SPECTRA: Hmmm? What's this?

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.111

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:37.703
DRAGO: I'm not sure, but look...

00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:46.011
