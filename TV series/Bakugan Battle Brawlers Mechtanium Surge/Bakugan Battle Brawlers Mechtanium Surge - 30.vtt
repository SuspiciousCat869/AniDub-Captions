00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.308
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well,

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.076
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.112
But then out of nowhere, we were invaded by...

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:14.614
these mysterious and evil Mechtogan who were intent

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.049
on destroying everything.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.217
Coredegon

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.318
Slycerak

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.486
Exostriker

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.987
and Mandibor were their names.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.156
And leading them was this clown Wiseman.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.091
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.694
called the Nonets. Luckily for us, we had our own

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:30.463
secret weapon in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.465
So we fought back, because no one

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.235
is going to take our freedom! Not now, not ever!

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:38.204
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.508
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.744
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:47.981
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:51.151
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:54.988
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.929
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:05.198
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.337
JAAKOR: Hmmmph!

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.374
[multiple laser blasts]

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.547
JAAKOR: Haaaaaaah!

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.349
SHUN: Come and get me! If you can.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:24.350
JAAKOR: You're mine, now!

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.785
Hmmmph!

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.021
SHUN: His focus is good, but not perfect.

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.055
JAAKOR: Haaaaaaah!

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:30.957
SHUN: Hmmmph!

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.058
Haaaaaaah!

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.193
JAAKOR: Doppelgangers?

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.461
Whooooaaa!

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:36.463
JAAKOR: Haaaaaaaah!

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.466
JAAKOR: It's going to take more than that!

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.602
Haaaaaaaaah!

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.039
SHUN: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.077
SHUN: Whooooooa!

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:55.348
JAAKOR: Now it's time for the teacher to get schooled.

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.585
Huh?

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.454
JAAKOR: So the old dog still has some new tricks.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.423
SHUN: Who are you calling old?

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.058
JAAKOR: What?

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.633
SHUN: So do you remember what the point of...

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.235
today's lesson was Jaakor?

00:02:15.268 --> 00:02:17.237
JAAKOR: Of course: To get the upper hand,

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.973
you must know one's self as well as you know your enemy.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.442
SHUN: Hmmmph.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.410
JAAKOR: By recognizing your own weaknesses...

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:27.247
your enemy can't take advantage of them.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.883
SHUN: You are learning well.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.451
SHUN: It's important because we're facing...

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:34.187
a horde of new enemies. Mechtogan with no hosts,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.892
the evil Nonet Bakugan, and of course Wiseman.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.827
SHUN: I get the feeling Jaakor that we'll be...

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.662
seeing a lot more of them soon.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.264
JAAKOR: We'll be ready for them.

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.598
JAAKOR: I want you to know that no matter...

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:48.167
how difficult the path, I am your partner and...

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:51.771
will stand by your side until the very end.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.306
SHUN: Mmm-hmm.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.947
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: The Prodigal Bakugan

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.457
JAAKOR: Hmmmm. If only there were some way...

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:13.426
I could use my ninja skills to predict when...

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.428
the enemy will strike next.

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:18.197
JAAKOR: Huh?

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.701
Hmmmph!

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.069
JAAKOR: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:25.071
JAAKOR: Leaf darts? The last time I saw these was...

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:26.873
no, it couldn't be...

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:31.344
[heavy wood impact]

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:34.681
JAAKOR: Okay, you two. You've had your fun.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:37.383
JAAKOR: Now show yourselves while I'm still in a good mood.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.319
Skytruss, Orbeum!

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:42.755
SKYTRUSS: Hahaha! I told you he was onto us, dude.

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.357
SKYTRUSS: I told Orbeum, there's no way we can...

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.828
sneak up on Sensei, he's just way too good. Hahaha!

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:51.130
ORBEUM: Long time no see, Sensei! You miss us?

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:53.800
JAAKOR: Of course. You were my favourite students.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:56.069
ORBEUM: I hope we didn't scare you too bad sneaking up...

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:58.438
like that, but Big Bro thought it would be...

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:00.039
the best way to say 'hi'.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.874
SKYTRUSS: I just wanted to show how much our skills...

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:06.045
have improved since we last saw each other, Sensei. Hahaha!

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.380
ORBEUM: Okay he gets it.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.549
JAAKOR: I haven't seen either of you since the great Exodus...

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:12.719
from New Vestroia when the Bakugan came to live on Earth...

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.520
with the humans.

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:16.723
JAAKOR: But I'm guessing you are not here to reminisce.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.458
ORBEUM: Mmm-hmm. SKYTRUSS: Mmm-hmm.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.560
JAAKOR: Okay. Out with it.

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.328
ORBEUM: There's been talk amongst the Bakugan...

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.430
ever since that Wiseman creep showed up.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:27.667
A lot of them are scared. Really scared.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.336
SKYTRUSS: They want to go back home to New Vestroia, Sensei.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.571
JAAKOR: Hmmmm?

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:36.609
[rushing waterfall hum]

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:44.117
ORBEUM: Sensei, you always told us that the reason the Bakugan

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.119
race has been able to survive throughout the millennia...

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:48.621
is that they've stuck together like one giant family.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.923
And the thing is your family needs you now.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.159
SKYTRUSS: Our people need to be protected which means...

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:55.495
we need help from mighty Bakugan like you.

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:58.297
JAAKOR: I agree, there is tremendous evil all around,

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.400
and I intend to defend the innocent.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:02.935
SKYTRUSS: I'm so happy to hear you say that, Sensei.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.238
So when can we head back to New Vestroia, huh?

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:06.873
ORBEUM: A lot of Bakugan are itching to go,

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:10.276
so just say the word.

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:12.845
JAAKOR: Hold on you two. It's not just the Bakugan...

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.348
who are being threatened. We can't just run and turn...

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.417
our backs on our friends.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.552
ORBEUM: But Sensei we need...

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.421
SKYTRUSS: Who cares what the humans need?

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:22.689
They can fend for themselves.

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:25.058
We have to look out for our own kind, Sensei!

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.460
JAAKOR: Skytruss, I taught you better than that.

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.228
Of course I want to help my people, but I have...

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:32.098
loyalty to Shun. He is like a brother.

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.332
ORBEUM: Brother? SKYTRUSS: Brother?

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.068
SKYTRUSS: How can you talk that way, Sensei?

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.070
A battling partner is one thing, but a brother?

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:38.438
Come ooooon!

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.173
ORBEUM: The humans are the reason we're in this mess.

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:42.275
Wiseman doesn't want us living amongst them,

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:44.977
so why stick around and give him more chances to harm us?

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.714
We need to go home and hope he doesn't follow.

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:50.083
JAAKOR: The Brawlers have always helped the Bakugan,

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:52.819
we owe them the same in return.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.654
ORBEUM: I admire your loyalty Sensei,

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.289
but can you at least think about it?

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:57.657
SKYTRUSS: I'm sure if you explain it to Shun,

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.193
he'll understand. You're not running from a battle.

00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:02.662
You're protecting our people from one.

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:08.201
JAAKOR: Skytruss. Orbeum.

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:12.004
I need some time to meditate on things.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.339
ORBEUM: Mmm-hmm. SKYTRUSS: Mmm-hmm.

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:18.845
JAAKOR: I feel conflicted.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.246
SHUN: What are you doing up there?

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:24.383
JAAKOR: Huh? We must talk.

00:06:26.352 --> 00:06:29.422
BETADRON: This is...humiliating!

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:31.190
BETADRON: There were three of us and we still...

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.059
couldn't take down, Drago!

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:34.927
WISEMAN: You lost because you were weaker than him.

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:36.696
It's as simple as that Betadron.

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.599
Quit your whining. It's getting tedious.

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.267
BETADRON: You've got nerve!

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.935
WISEMAN: Let's see if any of your friends...

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:46.372
are up to the task. But perhaps this time we'll go after...

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:50.510
another member of the Battle Brawlers just to mix it up.

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:55.348
WISEMAN: Let's see what you've got, huh Spatterix.

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:57.884
SPATTERIX: You've chosen well, Wiseman.

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:00.720
I hope you are prepared to be impressed.

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:03.456
WISEMAN: For back up we'll take you Stronk.

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:05.858
STRONK: This is gonna be fun.

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:08.761
SPATTERIX: Don't worry, Betadron. We'll try not to...

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:11.197
embarrass you too much. [chuckle]

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:13.566
WISEMAN: Hmmmmph.

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:17.003
SHUN: So they were your students?

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:19.672
JAAKOR: Yes. I trained them from the time they were quite young.

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:22.675
They were my prized students, but it went beyond that.

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:25.278
We were very close, like family.

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.814
SHUN: Family...yes.

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:29.482
JAAKOR: I understand why the others want to flee...

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:32.985
to New Vestroia, but I hate that they feel they have no choice.

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:33.986
SHUN: Jaakor...

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.288
JAAKOR: Hmmm?

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:37.657
SHUN: You should go home and be with your family.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.592
JAAKOR: But Shun...

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:45.398
SHUN: Don't worry about us. We'll be just fine.

00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:48.434
SHUN: You need to protect the weak Jaakor.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.306
JAAKOR: Are you sure?

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.842
SHUN: The Bakugan on New Vestroia need you.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:58.945
They trust you. And we both know you're more than capable...

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:02.915
of protecting them if it ever comes to that.

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.953
[water splash]

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:11.490
JAAKOR: Very well if you think that's for the best,

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:16.295
I'll respect your wishes. Thank-you for everything.

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:19.298
SHUN: Farewell then.

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:27.506
SHUN: And the best of luck to you my brother.

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.010
SKYTRUSS: I'm telling you, Sensei's not coming.

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:33.913
That human partner of his must have tricked him into staying.

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:37.116
Those lousy, selfish humans make me soooo mad.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.819
ORBEUM: I don't think Sensei would give up on us like that.

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:42.188
I say we give him a few more minutes.

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:43.923
It's the least we can do.

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:47.260
SKYTRUSS: Okay, but this waiting is killing me. Huh?

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.396
ORBEUM: Sensei! SKYTRUSS: Sensei!

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:53.299
JAAKOR: Saddle up. It's time to go home.

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:57.203
ORBEUM: Awesome! Yes sir! SKYTRUSS: Awesome! Yes sir!

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.804
JAAKOR: Indeed.

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.517
SHUN: Haaaaaaah!

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.551
[cracking rock]

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:14.120
SHUN: [grunt]

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:19.525
SHUN: [panting]

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.227
ORBEUM: I admire your loyalty, Sensei,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.762
but can you at least think about it?

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.196
SKYTRUSS: I'm sure if you explain it to Shun,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.732
he'll understand. You're not running from a battle.

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:28.768
You're protecting our people from one.

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.536
JAAKOR: Skytruss. Orbeum.

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:34.273
I need some time to meditate on things.

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:37.276
SHUN: I know it wasn't an easy decision for Jaakor to leave,

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.080
and it was just as hard for me to pretend I was okay with it.

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:42.281
WISEMAN: What's with the sad face, Shun?

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.183
You lose something?

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:47.520
WISEMAN: Oh wait where's your little buddy Jaakor, huh?

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:48.921
SHUN: Wiseman!

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:53.025
WISEMAN: Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:55.328
WISEMAN: Bakugan stand!

00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:57.096
WISEMAN: Rise, Pyrus Spatterix!

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.331
SPATTERIX: Hmmmph!

00:09:58.364 --> 00:09:59.865
WISEMAN: Rise Subterra Stronk!

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.133
STRONK: Haaaaaaaah!

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.536
SPATTERIX: Why are you so slow on the throw, Shun?

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:05.471
Don't just leave us standing here.

00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:08.608
STRONK: Yeah punk! We're ready to brawl!

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:10.810
SHUN: [angry grunt]

00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:12.545
SPATTERIX: Hey, check it out, Stronk.

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:15.247
I think this guy wants to take us on by himself.

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.449
STRONK: Is he nuts?

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:19.251
SHUN: I shouldn't be any problem for you two, right?

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:21.988
WISEMAN: I've seen a lot, but this is the first time...

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.423
I've encountered a battler willing to fight...

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.525
without a partner Bakugan.

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.627
[finger snap]

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.794
SPATTERIX: Haaaaaaaaaah! STRONK: Haaaaaaaaaah!

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:29.929
SHUN: Hmmmmph!

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:34.567
SHUN: They're going to be sorry they ever crossed my path.

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:38.571
SHUN: It won't be the same fighting without you, Jaakor!

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:43.876
WISEMAN: Show me the extent of your powers, Spatterix!

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.846
SPATTERIX: I'm going to crush you!

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:49.582
SHUN: [grunt, exertion reax] Hmmmmmmmph!

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:53.786
SPATTERIX: [grunt, pain reax]

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:59.091
STRONK: Stay still so I can swat you, you annoying little fly!

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:03.162
STRONK: Whoa! I feel kinda dizzy.

00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:04.697
STRONK: [groan] Oooomph!

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.999
SPATTERIX: Stay down and out of my way, Stronk!

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:09.535
I'll finish him off myself! Watch!

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:12.304
SPATTERIX: Hmmmmph! Where'd you go?

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:13.339
SHUN: [grunt]

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:19.211
SPATTERIX: That was a neat little trick, Shun,

00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:20.513
but don't get cocky!

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:21.947
STRONK: We're still gonna smash ya!

00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:23.215
SHUN: Bring it on then.

00:11:23.249 --> 00:11:24.984
Hmmmph!

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:27.486
SPATTERIX: We're not going to fall for that one again!

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.654
STRONK: Attack!

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:30.856
SHUN: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.224
SHUN: Oooomph!

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:36.729
SKYTRUSS: I can't believe Shun didn't even try...

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:38.631
to keep Sensei here. So much for the bond...

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:40.900
between friends. I'm telling you Orbeum,

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:43.235
these humans only care about themselves.

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:46.439
ORBEUM: I'm with you on that one Skytruss.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.141
SKYTRUSS: You okay Sensei?

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:51.243
JAAKOR: I am just remembering the first time...

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:52.912
I ever saw this view.

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:54.880
JAAKOR: I thought I was seeing my new home.

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:57.416
The place where I would spend the rest of my days.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.518
JAAKOR: I thought home was where your family was.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:02.388
And I had arrived with the Bakugan, my original family...

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:05.791
to live with the humans, our new family.

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:09.895
JAAKOR: Something is wrong.

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:11.297
ORBEUM: Sensei? SKYTRUSS: Sensei?

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.300
JAAKOR: Shun!

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:16.302
SHUN: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:17.536
SHUN: Oooomph!

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:18.871
SPATTERIX: I told you humans were...

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.806
pathetically weak on their own.

00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:23.642
SHUN: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:24.944
WISEMAN: Stay down, Shun!

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:25.945
SPATTERIX: Hmmmph.

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:27.646
STRONK: He's a stubborn one!

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.349
SHUN: I need to win this so Jaakor can start his life over

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:33.185
on New Vestroia without worrying about me.

00:12:33.219 --> 00:12:34.753
No one threatens my family!

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:38.224
SPATTERIX: Foolish as it is, I admire your determination.

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:41.293
Too bad it won't do you any good. I hope you're ready...

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:42.661
for more pain?!?

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:46.665
SPATTERIX: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:48.701
What the heck was that?

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.136
JAAKOR: Are you okay, Shun?

00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:53.105
SHUN: Jaakor. When did you get back?

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:55.441
JAAKOR: I never left. I couldn't leave you behind...

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:57.810
with all of this unfinished business.

00:12:57.843 --> 00:13:01.013
JAAKOR: Besides, Family always sticks together.

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:03.616
SHUN: Always. [grunt]

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:07.486
ORBEUM: Sensei!

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:12.992
WISEMAN: So I guess you've had a change of heart...

00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:14.426
about battling solo.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.262
SPATTERIX: It doesn't matter Wiseman.

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:17.696
STRONK: We'll smash them both.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.232
SHUN: Bakugan Brawl! Ha!

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:22.134
SHUN: Baku Skyraider, Jump!

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:23.235
SPATTERIX: He just...

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:24.737
STRONK: ...disappeared!

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.771
WISEMAN: Heads up.

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.674
JAAKOR: [rising mighty roar]

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:31.277
JAAKOR: Smash this, creeps!

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.845
WISEMAN: Finally.

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:34.980
SPATTERIX: I hope you enjoyed that lucky shot.

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:36.815
You won't get another one.

00:13:36.849 --> 00:13:39.051
STRONK: Yeah! What he said!

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:41.754

SHUN: Ability activate!

JAAKOR: Be gone, evil scum!

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:53.799
JAAKOR: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:57.903
WISEMAN: Ability Activate!

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:11.116
STRONK: ...with firepower!

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.285

STRONK: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh! SPATTERIX: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.965
SPATTERIX: Now you're just making me angry!

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:28.067
JAAKOR: Hmmmph!

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.868
STRONK: Open wide, Jaakor!

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:32.638

JAAKOR: Haaaaaaaah!

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:39.478
SPATTERIX: He disappeared!

00:14:39.511 --> 00:14:41.347
STRONK: Not again! Where is he?

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.382
JAAKOR: Haaaaaaaaaah!

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:45.117
STRONK: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.119
STRONK: Oooomph!

00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:49.521
SPATTERIX: This is getting ridiculous!

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:50.689
Haaaaaaaah!

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.391
JAAKOR: [grunt, pain reax]

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:55.928
SPATTERIX: You feeling the heat, Jaakor? Huh?

00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.131
STRONK: I don't get it.

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:00.766
SPATTERIX: More ninja tricks!

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:03.102

SPATTERIX and STRONK: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:15.681
SPATTERIX and STRONK: Oooomph!

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:18.484
SKYTRUSS: Sensei still has the moves but I have to be honest,

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:20.152
Shun is awesome too.

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:22.988
ORBEUM: I agree with you, Bro. When you see them...

00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:25.424
battling together, you realize that they know themselves

00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:27.793
and each other as only true partners can.

00:15:27.826 --> 00:15:30.996
I hate to say it but their bond is, incredible.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.665
ORBEUM: I finally understand why Sensei...

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.366
didn't want to leave Shun behind.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.801
SKYTRUSS: I know what you're saying, Bro.

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:38.003
I've never seen anything like it.

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:43.742
WISEMAN: Well done Shun and Jaakor, a very impressive...

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.445
comeback indeed. Perhaps it's time for you two...

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:50.282
to work together if you know what I mean.

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:52.518
SPATTERIX: You want me to fuse with this thing?

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:53.852
Are you serious?

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:55.087
STRONK: Huh?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.656
SPATTERIX: Well, I guess it beats losing to these two.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.758
STRONK: Let's just get this over with!

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:00.826
SHUN: Oh no!

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:02.394

COMBINED SPATTERIX: This isn't so bad I guess.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.612
Just make sure you don't trip me up, Stronk!

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:22.815
STRONK: Yeah, yeah. Quit your yacking!

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:25.584
JAAKOR: No big deal. Two birds with one stone.

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:27.319
JAAKOR: Haaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:32.458

Huuuuaaaah!

COMBINED SPATTERIX: Don't make me laugh!

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:40.065
COMBINED SPATTERIX: You're so pathetic.

00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:42.801

SHUN: Oh Jaakor!

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:55.681
Huh? What the heck do you two want?

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:58.684
SKYTRUSS: To help of course! Whatever you and Sensei need.

00:16:58.717 --> 00:16:59.852
We've got your backs!

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.186
SHUN: Really?

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.788
ORBEUM: We were wrong to try and split you up!

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:04.690
Please, we owe it to you both to fix this!

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:06.392
SHUN: Okay!

00:17:07.393 --> 00:17:09.895

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.677
ORBEUM: So now you'll suffer the wrath!

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:28.781
SKYTRUSS: Of two Bakugan who are not only his students...

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:31.183
ORBEUM: ...but also his family!

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.687
SKYTRUSS: We stand united! ORBEUM: We stand united!

00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.322
SKYTRUSS: Just lead the way, Sensei!

00:17:37.356 --> 00:17:39.892
We're behind you 100%

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:42.861
ORBEUM: That goes for you too, Shun!

00:17:42.895 --> 00:17:45.264
SKYTRUSS: We're all in this together!

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:47.833

00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:49.468

SKYTRUSS: Don't count us out, yet!

00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:43.989
ORBEUM: We can take these creeps down,

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:45.791
but it means fighting on equal ground.

00:18:45.824 --> 00:18:47.593
We're ready if you are!

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:49.461
JAAKOR: Excellent.

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:51.630

COMBINED JAAKOR: United Ninjas! Herculean power!

SHUN: With the combined strength of three ninjas...

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:13.151
we will prevail.

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:16.155
WISEMAN: Interesting. These Bakugan never cease...

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:17.523
to surprise me.

to bring chaos and destruction to my family!

COMBINED SPATTERIX: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:17.115
WISEMAN: As disappointing as a loss is with every battle...

00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:18.884
I'm getting to know the Brawlers,

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:21.687
hmmmph, better and better.

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:32.164
ORBEUM: Sensei, when we were combined I could feel...

00:20:32.197 --> 00:20:34.866
for myself the bond you share with your partner Shun.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.904
SKYTRUSS: Yeah, I could too and I guess it wasn't so bad.

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:44.610
SKYTRUSS: I guess what I'm saying is I was wrong,

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:46.845
and I'm sorry. Sensei belongs here with you!

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:49.181
ORBEUM: Yeah. Besides, we can take care of things on...

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:52.484
New Vestroia. We were trained by the best after all.

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:55.554
JAAKOR: Thank-you from both of us.

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:09.635
MARUCHO: Ever since Wiseman showed up with those creeps,

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:12.304
the Nonets, we Battle Brawlers have been on high alert.

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:15.173
Unfortunately my partner Radizen has been off his game.

00:21:15.207 --> 00:21:17.576
I think he's upset because he doesn't have the ability...

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:19.845
to combine with other Bakugan like the rest of his teammates.

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:21.713
I've tried to tell him he's still a force to be...

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:24.283
reckoned with but he won't listen and that's no good.

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:26.351
All I know is that he'd better snap out of it,

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:28.754
because Wiseman is coming for us with a vengeance.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:31.490
There is too much at stake for us to lose focus now!

00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:34.293
Roxtor might be the key to solving our Radizen problem.

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.928
Make sure you tune into check out the action.
