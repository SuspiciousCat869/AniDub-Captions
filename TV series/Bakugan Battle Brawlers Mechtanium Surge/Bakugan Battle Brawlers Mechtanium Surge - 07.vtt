WEBVTT

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.774
DAN: It's been over a year since we defeated Gundalia

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:10.377
in the battle for Neathia and the Sacred Orb.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.946
Once we returned to Earth and rebuilt a mega Bakugan

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.981
Interspace the number of people accessing it

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.283
from around the world totally exploded!

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.285
DAN: Of course Drago and I are back in action, along

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.389
with our pals Marucho and his new partner Tristar;

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.759
and Shun who's rockin' the Battle Arena with Taylean.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.227
DAN: The flood of new Battlers means we're up

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.963
against some crazy serious competition now!

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:32.866
This is Bakugan battling like you've never seen before...

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.035
DAN: ...but we're in it to win it!

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:38.038
\u266a What are you going to do?

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.207
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.209
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.544
\u266a Gotta give it your all...

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.312
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.714
\u266a this is the final stand

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:49.582
\u266a Ah ha ah ha

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:50.917
\u266a the power's in your hand

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.153
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.587
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.826
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.829
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone \u266a

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.631
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.735
[\u266a]

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:11.871
DAN: Aaaahhhh!

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.541
RAZENOID: I am you, and you are me!

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.277
DRAGO: Get away from us!

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.212
DRAGO: Haaaah!

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.916
DRAGO: Haaaah!

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:28.288
[\u266a]

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:33.259
DAN: This is the end. Finish them Drago!

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.829
DRAGO: [mighty roar]

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:38.164
ANUBIAS: [gasp]

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.199
DAN: Drago!

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.468
DRAGO: [grunt]

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.472
DAN: [gasp]

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.544
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in:

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:54.013
BakuNano Explosion.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:55.415
MARUCHO: This is really bad, Shun.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.450
That last battle with Dan and Drago was really out

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.518
of control.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.720
MARUCHO: The battle arena got totally trashed.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.356
It's a miracle that no one got seriously hurt or worse...

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:04.824
MARUCHO: ...and now that Dan and Drago have

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.926
disappeared it looks like they don't care.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.229
MARUCHO: Word is spreading around Bakugan Interspace

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.497
and it isn't good.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.832
Everyone thinks they created Mechtogan Zenthon as a

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:16.436
secret weapon and now they've been labeled as cheaters.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.938
SHUN: It's useless. They're not coming.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.608
MARUCHO: Dan promised he'd be here.

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.076
SHUN: Right.

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.244
MARUCHO: Let's give them a few more minutes.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:27.147
We owe them at least that much.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.148
SHUN: I'm done waiting.

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:31.251
MARUCHO: Whoa, Shun. Hold on.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:35.955
SHUN: Dan wants to be alone so we let him be.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.857
SHUN: Tough love time.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.325
TAYLEAN: I hear what you're saying but,

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.896
are you sure you're right about this?

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.365
SHUN: Taylean time will tell.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:46.666
TAYLEAN: Let's hope.

BakuNanos soon.

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:07.780

TAYLEAN: Yeah really.

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:11.517
DYLAN: Well let me tell ya.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.019
DYLAN: A BakuNano dramatically increases a

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:15.154
Bakugan's power level and abilities, which means

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:18.324
it's the next \"must have\" gadget for every battler

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:19.759
in the know.

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:21.861
DYLAN: Team Anubias even used them to win

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:24.063
consecutive battles so you should. [grunt]

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:25.531
SHUN: Are you out of your mind?

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:28.134
Those things are dangerous in the hands of unskilled battlers.

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:31.437
DYLAN: Hey, take it easy. I didn't create the things.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.072
I'm just a facilitator.

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:34.073
SHUN: What?

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:35.107
DYLAN: Whoa!

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:36.742
SHUN: Who's responsible for them, then?

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:39.145
DYLAN: I dunno. The Data for the upgrade just appeared

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:42.548
on the Bakugan Interpspace main server one day.

00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:43.916
SHUN: [gasp]

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.017
DYLAN: I couldn't believe it either.

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.285
Why give it away for free?

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:49.956
Do you realize the kind of dough they could've made? Huh?

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:52.058
MARUCHO: Doesn't it make you suspicious, Dylan?

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:54.694
DYLAN: Not really. I mean, why care? Know what I mean?

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.662
DYLAN: Adding BakuNanos into the mix, has given

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:59.532
battling a new kind of wow factor.

00:09:59.565 --> 00:10:01.133
DYLAN: Seriously, you guys.

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.469
All the cool kids are using them now.

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:05.438
Why don't you let me hook you up, huh?

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:07.440
What do you say? I could get you something by...

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:08.441
SHUN: We're not interested!

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:10.343
We don't battle to hurt people, got it?

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:13.613
DYLAN: Huh? Hah!

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:16.115
I seem to recall Dan and Drago causing some pretty

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:17.416
heavy damage last battle.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.152
MARUCHO: [gasp]

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:21.921
DYLAN: People got really freaked out when Drago

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:23.356
started losing it like that.

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:25.224
They'd never seen that side of him before, but

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:27.627
afterward it kind of flipped a switch inside of them.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.397
DYLAN: That level of danger only added to their excitement.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.699
DYLAN: Now everyone wants to see crazy extreme

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:35.701

get out of hand, Taylean!

00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:51.717
DYLAN: That level of danger only added

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.319
to their excitement.

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:55.287

SELLON: It's hard to watch.

watching the Battle Brawlers fight, such a pleasure.

Now I fear those days are behind us for good.

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:44.036

SELLON: But Shun...

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.142
SELLON: You have the strength to do this.

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:51.410
SHUN: Huh.

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:54.013
SELLON: If anyone can return order and respect

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:57.650
to the battle arena surely it's the Battle Brawlers.

00:11:57.683 --> 00:12:02.121
After all don't forget it was them who created the game.

00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:04.156
SHUN: Without Dan and Drago around, I'm not sure

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.960
what good the Brawlers would be.

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:09.462

SHUN: [gasp]

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.267
with Dan Kuso in battle before, Shun.

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:17.837
What's to prevent you from taking over as leader of

the Battle Brawlers?

00:12:19.004 --> 00:12:22.341

You saw yourself how Drago lost control in there.

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:33.886
I know you would never allow that.

[\u266a]

00:21:07.265 --> 00:21:08.233

00:21:08.266 --> 00:21:09.434
struggling to get control

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:10.636
over his new powers but no matter how much we

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:13.105
practiced in Bakugan Interspace we just

00:21:13.138 --> 00:21:15.040
couldn't seem to get the hang of it.

00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:16.441
So we figured that a change of scenery is what

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:18.977
we needed, and what better place than the home of all

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:21.980
Bakugan, New Vestroia!

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:23.782

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:26.685
like our old pal Preyas, who were willing to help us out.

00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:28.887
It wasn't long before Drago was back in action,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.656
giving it everything he had.

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:32.991
DAN: You've gotta tune in and watch Drago let loose!

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:34.626
DAN: It's the only way he's ever gonna have

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.828
a chance of controlling things!
