WEBVTT

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.443
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.145
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.582
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.751
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.986
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.322
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.991
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:28.194
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.463
Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.866
We might just have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.435
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.438
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.708
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.911
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:48.148
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.351
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:57.357
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.226
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.096
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:11.004
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:12.539
LINEHALT: Aaaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.108
LINEHALT: I can't hold them much longer Ren!

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.243
REN: Hold strong, Linehalt!

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:23.783
If we let them get past, the capital will fall!

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:25.952
ARANAUT: [grunt, exertion reax] Aaaarrrrgggghhhhh!

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.287
ELRIGHT: Aranaut!

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.323
ELRIGHT: Even the Castle Knights can't stop them.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:39.199
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Unlocking the Gate

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.470
NURZAK: We believe that if the Chaos Bakugan

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.672
are successful in taking down Gundalia

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.475
they'll be heading for Neathia next.

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.910
FABIA: We'll have to put our faith in the Battle Brawlers

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.146
let us not forget, they were in fact

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.981
chosen by the Sacred Orb.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.350
NURZAK: Let's hope that they're up to it,

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:03.590
the task that lies ahead.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.426
DAN: I can't believe we got separated from the others.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.394
WOLFURIO: We'd better be careful down here.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.730
Who knows what kind of traps they could have set.

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:15.368
DRAGO: Agreed.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.270
DAN: It's getting way too crowded down here.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.772
We better find a way out before we get overpowered.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.941
RAFE: I wonder what Shun and Marucho would do?

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.110
DAN: Tell me to sit out.

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:27.113
RAFE: We should avoid any confrontation.

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.314
DAN: Leave the thinking to me.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.816
RAFE: Huh?

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.684
DAN: Up above, Drago!

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:34.454
Ability activate!

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.189
DAN: Dragon Blazer!

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:40.860
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.962
WOLFURIO: Very impressive indeed, Dan...

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:45.198
you managed to stop them without engaging.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.833
RAFE: But how did you know?

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:50.069
DAN: Y'know Rafe I didn't just fall off the turnip truck.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:54.707
I do actually have skills.

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.110
TRISTAR: Whoooooa! These suckers are everywhere!

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:58.645
We can't get away from them!

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.747
BOULDERON: Then we'll just have to keep taking them down!

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.148
PAIGE: You said it!

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.584
MARUCHO: [grunt, exertion reax] Man, I wish Dan was here

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:14.561
to help...Huh? Ooohhhh!

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:15.728
DAN: [grunt] RAFE: [grunt]

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.130
WOLFURIO: That should take care of all

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:19.432
the Chaos Bakugan in this area.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.668
DAN: Yeah but there's still a whole bunch of them

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.469
headed straight for the capital.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:24.704
RAFE: [gasp]

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:25.872
DRAGO: The only way we end this...

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:27.373
is to stop Mag Mel and Razenoid.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:30.209
DAN: You bet.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:33.479
DAN: I can feel him he's through there. I just know it!

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:36.249
RAFE: Dan we're going to go with you.

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:37.317
WOLFURIO: That's right.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.886
DAN: No way sorry guys, not this time.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:40.920
WOLFURIO: Why not?

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:43.122
RAFE: Yeah what's your problem?

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:44.424
DAN: You don't understand,

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:46.526
we trained for this, okay?

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.494
DAN: Mag Mel says he wants the Gate and the Key

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.063
that Drago and I have.

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.599
That's the whole reason he started this war.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.567
DAN: And he won't give up until he gets it.

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.202
RAFE: But, what are they?

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:57.937
DRAGO: We really don't know ourselves,

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.839
but we still have to stop him before he can get

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:02.208
his hands on them, whatever they are.

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:04.410
RAFE: But it's way too risky.

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.113
What if you're walking into another trap?

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:09.382
DAN: Well that didn't stop you and Paige

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.551
from storming off on your own, did it?

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.086
RAFE: Well, yeah but...

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.421
WOLFURIO: You guys and the others came and stopped us.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.689
DRAGO: Yes?

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.625
WOLFURIO: You knew that two people weren't strong enough

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.660
to take on Mag Mel and Razenoid.

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.762
So you stopped us from making a mistake,

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:23.997
and now we are stopping you.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.132
DRAGO: He's right.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:27.200
DAN: I guess.

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.535
RAFE: Come on what would Marucho and Shun say

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.572
if they were here? They'd tell you the same thing.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:33.973
SHUN: Don't do it!

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:39.045
MARUCHO: Quit trying to always be the hero!

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:41.047
DAN: Hmmmph, guess I was wrong.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.215
RAFE: Huh?

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:43.983
DAN: Here I was thinking that they were just trying

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:46.753
to boss me around when really they were just

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.188
watching out for me all along.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.624
Man I acted like such a complete dope.

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:54.794
RAFE: No, Dan... [gasp]

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:57.530
DAN: We're all good now!

00:04:57.563 --> 00:05:01.267
TRISTAR: Uh guys this shield isn't gonna hold much longer!

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.636
MARUCHO: You've got to hold on, Tristar!

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.905
PAIGE: We can't let them gain anymore ground!

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.775
RAFE: We need to shut these troublemakers down, Wolfurio!

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:13.713
RAFE: Now. [grunt]

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:17.116
RAFE: No mercy, okay. Not today.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.351
WOLFURIO: Got it.

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:22.321
RAFE: Bakugan Brawl!

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:25.792
WOLFURIO: Haaaaaaaaaah!

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.293
WOLFURIO: Are you guys, okay?

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:28.695
BOULDERON: We are now, pal.

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.730
SHUN: Go Taylean!

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:32.632
SHUN: Slash Rise Thunder!

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:37.837
TAYLEAN: Haaaaaaaah!

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.840
SHUN: Dan and Drago went after Mag Mel by themselves?

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:42.108
RAFE: Yes.

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:45.945
PAIGE: No way. I can't believe those two stubborn goofs.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:48.581
MARUCHO: He's angry. Now that I'm the new leader

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.784
of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers he's doing absolutely everything

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:54.721
he can to undermine my authority with the others.

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:59.292
RAFE: That's not true. He respects you a lot.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:02.628
DAN: I need you to go find the others while we plow ahead.

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:05.131
DAN: I could really use Marucho's help.

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:06.366
RAFE: Okay.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:07.700
DAN: Let's go, Drago.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:08.701
DRAGO: Ready.

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:11.204
DAN: Yeah!

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:13.706
SHUN: He actually said he could use Marucho's help?

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.374
SHUN: Are you sure about that?

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:16.709
RAFE: Yes.

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.077
SHUN: How odd.

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.546
PAIGE: Huh? Maybe he bumped his head.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.884
MARUCHO: No way it just means he's growing.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:27.086
TRISTAR: So then does this mean we're going to

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.222
help them out or what, huh?

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:30.556
TAYLEAN, BOULDERON and WOLFURIO: Yes.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.560
RAFE: You should know he also said that Mag Mel

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:37.964
is after a gate and key that he thinks Dan and Drago have.

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:39.599
SHUN: Huh, what gate and key?

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.000
PAIGE: Now I'm confused.

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.902
MARUCHO: Huh, hold on!

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:44.871
MAG MEL : I guess the gate and key will have to wait

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.339
for another day.

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:50.409
MARUCHO: I knew it. I thought it sounded familiar.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:53.780
DAN: [panting, exertion reax] I'm telling you,

00:06:53.813 --> 00:06:58.951
he's just up ahead. [panting, exertion reax]

00:06:58.985 --> 00:06:59.986
DAN: Mag Mel!

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.354
DRAGO: And Razenoid!

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:04.657
MAG MEL: Shouldn't you be on your knees, Kuso?

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.161
RAZENOID: Maybe these arrogant fools have come to battle.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.396
DAN: We came for answers. It's time you tell us

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:14.000
what this gate and key you're yapping about actually is.

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:18.304
MAG MEL: The key, my dear boy, is the Switch Code that has

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.406
undergone a mutation after coming

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.742
in contact with Code Eve.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.677
DAN: Think he's lying to us?

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.045
DRAGO: Who knows.

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:28.347
RAZENOID: And the gate is the original Bakugan DNA

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:32.318
that has also been mutated by Code Eve.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.754
DAN: Huh!?

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:37.790
MAG MEL: Razenoid and I have our own gate and key,

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:41.861
but they are, how shall we say...incomplete.

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:45.331
MAG MEL: They are, nevertheless of the same origin

00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:47.867
as yours, which is the reason why we share

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.369
this special link of ours.

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:54.240
MAG MEL: But soon this link will be severed.

00:07:54.273 --> 00:07:58.477
We will take your gate and key and we will be made whole.

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:02.148
MAG MEL: Once this happens our power will be unequalled,

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:05.852
and we will control every last Bakugan in existence.

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:07.820
DRAGO: That's a scary proposition.

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:09.722
DAN: No kidding Drago.

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.258
DAN: They'd be more powerful than even Code Eve.

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.460
DAN: We're not gonna let that happen!

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:23.502
MAG MEL: Hmmmph! Come my servants!

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:29.175
[computer beeps and trills]

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.711
DAN: Mechtogan!

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:33.880
ANUBIAS: You are about to be obliterated!

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:36.015
SELLON: But it will be a graceful affair.

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:47.393
DAN: We'll see about that!

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:49.896
BOULDERON, TAYLEAN,WOLFURIO and TRISTAR: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:56.869
BOULDERON, TAYLEAN and WOLFURIO: [grunt]

00:08:56.903 --> 00:09:03.542
DAN: We gotta take Mag Mel down, Drago!

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.480
MAG MEL: The gate and key are ours, Razenoid!

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:09.782
TAYLEAN: The back up crew is here.

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:10.883
ANUBIAS: Ha, how adorable.

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:13.052
SELLON: They're still no match for the Master.

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:14.554
DAN: Hey guys.

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:15.688
DRAGO: Thanks for coming.

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:17.223
PAIGE: You didn't think we were going to let you...

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:18.891
have all the fun did ya?

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:20.026
RAFE: Not a chance.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:21.894
MARUCHO: I'm sorry that things got so heated.

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:23.329
It's not that we don't trust you,

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:25.097
it just that there's so much at stake.

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.300
We lost site of who the true enemy is.

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:30.770
DAN: No sweat. It's my fault too, pal.

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:33.039
TRISTAR: Can we all hug and make up later?

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.574
TRISTAR: We've got some battling to do.

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:36.809
MARUCHO: You've got it.

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:38.644
MARUCHO: We'll take care of these guys, Dan...

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:41.414
while you go after Mag Mel.

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:43.516
SHUN: Take him down, my friend.

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.151
PAIGE and RAFE: Hmm.

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:49.822
DAN: Hmmph. Okay, leave it to me.

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:52.425
TAYLEAN, TRISTAR, WOLFURIO and BOULDERON: [rising mighty roar]

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:55.161

MAG MEL: Bakugan stand!

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.042
RAZENOID: I'm going to crush you into a paste!

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:12.678
Haaaaaah!

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:14.714
MAG MEL: Ability activate!

RAZENOID: What?

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:27.159
DRAGO: Is that all you've got?

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:28.160
WOLFURIO and BOULDERON: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:29.161

PAIGE: Boulderon!

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:32.732
SELLON: Hah! So much for their back up.

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:36.268
ANUBIAS: Let's finish them off.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.770
TAYLEAN and TRISTAR: Aaaaaarrrrrggggghhhh!

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:38.771
SHUN: Taylean!

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:40.172
MARUCHO: Tristar!

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:41.540
TAYLEAN: We're okay.

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:43.442
TRISTAR: Yeah, yeah, yeah we're just getting warmed up

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.177
for the next round, dudes.

00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:46.512
DAN: Oh man.

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:48.381
DRAGO: Dan! What about our powers?

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:49.615
DAN: Huh?

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:51.484
DRAGO: If we share our powers with the other Brawlers,

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:53.719
they might be able to take down those Mechtogan.

00:10:53.753 --> 00:10:56.389
DAN: Ya, good plan. Let's do it.

00:10:56.422 --> 00:11:01.327
DRAGO and DAN: [rising mighty roar]

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.295
WOLFURIO: What's this feeling? It's like something

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.031
growing inside of me.

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.733
RAFE: I...I can feel it too!

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:10.236
BOULDERON: Dan and Drago are sharing their powers with us!

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:13.072
PAIGE: I feel totally awesome!

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:14.707
TAYLEAN: With this coursing through my body...

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.810
I feel completely, indestructible!

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.712
SHUN: I know exactly what you mean.

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:22.615
TRISTAR: I'm so ready, dude! Bring on the Mechtogan!

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:26.152
MARUCHO: Awesome!

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:34.493
[explosion]

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.628
TAYLEAN: Hmmmph!

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:41.200
SILENT STRIKE: I am Silent Strike!

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:44.737
VEXFIST: And I am Vexfist!

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.840
ACCELERAK: You can call me Accelerak.

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:52.745
SWIFT SWEEP: I am Swift Sweep.

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:54.714
SELLON: They've summoned the Mechtogan.

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:57.550
They must be using Dan and Drago's powers.

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.351
ANUBIAS: That doesn't really matter!

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:02.788
MAG MEL: What a foolish move, Kuso. Spreading your powers

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:06.459
thin by sharing them? How pathetic.

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:08.594
RAZENOID: Who cares. It will only make them

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:14.266
that much easier to squash!

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.435
DREADEON: I will destroy everything in sight

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:23.375
and burn it to the ground.

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:28.114
DRAGO: You'll have to go through us first.

00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:29.982
ZENTHON: When I hear my Master's call,

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:32.585
I will race to his side to destroy anything

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:42.661
that opposes him or stands in his way.

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:52.304
that opposes him or stands in his way.

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:01.180
PAIGE: Nice one, guys!

00:13:01.213 --> 00:13:04.116
BOULDERON: That Vexfist is awfully strong.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.051
VEXFIST: Just point the way and I will blaze a trail

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:13.225
of scorched earth for you, Masters.

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:16.128
TRISTAR: Uh-oh!

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:19.632
TRISTAR: Whoa! Thanks a lot, buddy!

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:25.771
MARUCHO: Let's do this next one together!

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.641
ACCELERAK: When we three, connect and work as one

00:13:28.674 --> 00:13:38.717
nothing can stand in our way.

00:13:38.717 --> 00:13:45.257
nothing can stand in our way.

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:46.692
SHUN: He's really fast!

00:13:46.725 --> 00:13:48.394
TAYLEAN: Yes, and his flying skills

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:57.369
are most impressive as well.

00:13:57.403 --> 00:13:59.672
SILENT STRIKE: Our enemies may have tremendous might,

00:13:59.705 --> 00:14:02.441
but they are still no match for my speed and stealth.

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:04.343
WOLFURIO: Hmmmph!

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:06.946
WOLFURIO: Haaaaaaaaaaah!

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:19.191
WOLFURIO: [grunt, exertion reax] Whoooooaaaa!

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:20.759
RAFE: Unreal!

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:22.661
SWIFT SWEEP: I will fight the enemies of my Masters

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.130
and punish them like nothing before!

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:35.140
ANUBIAS: I'll show you what punishment really is!

00:14:35.174 --> 00:14:38.143
DREADEON and ZENTHON: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:41.380

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:47.753
DAN and MAG MEL: [rising mighty roar]

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:50.189
RAZENOID: There can only be one ruling Bakugan!

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:52.091
RAZENOID: And it won't be you, Drago!

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:53.092
DRAGO: Bring it on!

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.093
RAZENOID: Hmmmph!

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:56.095
DAN: Drago?

00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:57.896
DAN and MAG MEL: [grunt, pain reax]

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.199
MAG MEL: I won't allow you to use our link...

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:03.702
to inflict damage upon me. Be gone!

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:06.138
MAG MEL: Smasheon and Rock Fist destroy!

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:08.774
DRAGO: Dan, watch out!

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:17.249
DAN: Huh...

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.852
Uhhh, Spectra?

00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:21.687
SPECTRA: Mechtogan, huh?

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.088
SPECTRA: That's some serious firepower

00:15:23.122 --> 00:15:25.124
that they're facing off against.

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:26.725
HELIOS: Lucky for the Brawlers we're coming

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.093
to do some clean up.

00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:30.529
SPECTRA: Let's get on with it, then.

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:33.666

HELIOS: Choke on thiiiiiiiiis!

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:11.737
SPECTRA: So...think you're ready to jump back in here,

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.172
and have a go, Dan?

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:14.840
DAN: Yup.

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:17.543
HELIOS: Let's see what kind of power you're packing, Drago.

00:16:17.576 --> 00:16:23.749
DRAGO: You'd better stand back.

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:26.585

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:54.580
The more they fight and the more energy they use

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.915
the stronger your power will be in the end.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.262
ANUBIAS: For once it would appear

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:46.064
that you're right, Sellon.

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:48.267
RAZENOID: [evil laughter] Shrivel up until there's

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.102
nothing left, Drago!

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:54.773
DRAGO: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:55.841
RAZENOID: What's happening?

00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:58.043
DRAGO: I won't let you take me down, Razenoid.

00:17:58.076 --> 00:17:59.711
Not here! Not ever!

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.146
DAN: Ya that's right.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.082
We made a promise that we would win this thing buddy.

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:05.117
MAG MEL: Nonsense!

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.186
DAN: No it's not, sucker.

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:10.489
DAN: We're part of a team. With people who believe in us.

00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:12.758
And we're not gonna let them down. No matter what.

00:18:12.791 --> 00:18:15.594
DAN: So you better prepare yourself to lose, buddy.

00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:18.330
DRAGO: That's right. You're finished.

00:18:18.363 --> 00:18:26.205
DAN and DRAGO: Because victory is ours!

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:27.940
MAG MEL: They've activated it!

00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:29.508
DAN: Ability activate!

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:32.678
Dragon Maximum Striker!

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:34.279
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:35.981
RAZENOID: Aaarrrrggggghhhh!

00:18:36.014 --> 00:18:37.583
MAG MEL: Curse you!

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:42.654
RAZENOID: But I was so close!

00:18:42.688 --> 00:18:54.466
MAG MEL: I'll be baaaaaack!

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.901
REN: They're all disappearing.

00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:58.137
ELRIGHT: That's amazing.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.939
NURZAK: At last Gundalia has been saved.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:12.150
FABIA: And thanks to our friends all the Brawlers.

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:13.886
DAN: Alright, let me have it.

00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:15.087
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.356
DAN: OK, I deserve to be yelled at for all the grief...

00:19:17.389 --> 00:19:26.665
I put you through so let's get on with it.

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:29.501
MARUCHO: [gasp] Shun, wait!

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:32.304
DAN: [grunt] Hmmmm?

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:33.805
SHUN: I just wanted to shake the hand

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.009
of our fearless leader and say: Welcome back, Dan.

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.277
SHUN: We've missed you.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:43.081
DAN: [gasp] Thanks man.

00:19:43.115 --> 00:19:44.416
SHUN: So, how do you feel?

00:19:44.449 --> 00:19:46.151
DAN: [chuckles] Awesome dude.

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.319
And you?

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:49.788
MARUCHO: Amazing! Never better!

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:52.124
SPECTRA: Hmmph. I guess that's our cue then.

00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:54.560
HELIOS: Yes.

00:19:54.593 --> 00:19:58.230
DAN: Spectra! Helios!

00:19:58.263 --> 00:20:01.233
DAN: Thanks guys. You really helped us out!

00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:08.941
SPECTRA: Call us anytime, old friend.

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:10.275
MARUCHO: So I guess that means...

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:13.211
this horrible battle is finally over.

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:14.880
DRAGO: Huh? What's this?

00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:15.881
DAN: Drago...

00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:18.116
DRAGO: I feel this odd sensation...

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.986
like there's still another gate, like mine.

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:22.888
SHUN: Are you serious?

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:25.324
DRAGO: Yes, it's as though when Razenoid and I...

00:20:25.357 --> 00:20:28.961
touched he took a piece of me with him.

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:33.565
DAN: Are you saying that Mag Mel and Razenoid are still alive?

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:35.100
RAFE: No way!

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:36.868
PAIGE: This is bad news.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.871
DRAGO: This means the battle isn't over.

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:52.651
Far from it.

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:54.753
RAZENOID: The gate is finally mine!

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:58.824
At last, I am whole!

00:20:58.857 --> 00:21:02.394
MAG MEL: Excellent now all that is left is...

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:07.332
for me to get the key!

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:10.135
DAN: The battle for Gundalia may have ended in a victory for us,

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:11.870
but that doesn't mean our fight is over.

00:21:11.903 --> 00:21:14.172
Somehow Mag Mel and Razenoid are still alive,

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:16.475
and that can mean nothing but trouble for everyone.

00:21:16.508 --> 00:21:18.644
We were just in the process of figuring out our next move

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.946
when we got an urgent distress call from Earth.

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:23.148
Something bad was going down in Bakugan Interspace

00:21:23.181 --> 00:21:25.517
and we had to get back pronto to sort it out.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.819
Trust me when I say you won't believe what we found.

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:29.721
But don't take my word for it. Tune in yourself

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:31.023
and check it out.

00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:32.624
Man what I wouldn't give to be rid of this Mag Mel

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:34.559
creep once and for all. Come on guys!

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:37.095
We gotta take him down! For good!

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:38.130
