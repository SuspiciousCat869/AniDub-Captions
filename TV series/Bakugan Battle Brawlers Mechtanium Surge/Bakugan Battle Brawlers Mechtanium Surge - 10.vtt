WEBVTT

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:08.742
DAN: It's been over a year since we defeated Gundalia

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.244
in the battle for Neathia and the Sacred Orb.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.346
Once we returned to Earth and rebuilt a mega

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.116
Bakugan Interspace the number of people accessing it

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.284
from around the world totally exploded!

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.086
Of course Drago and I are back in action,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.356
along with our pals Marucho and his new partner Tristar;

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.559
and Shun who's rockin' the Battle Arena with Taylean.

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.361
The flood of new Battlers means we're up

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.830
against some crazy serious competition now!

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.633
This is Bakugan battling like you've never seen it before

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.869
...but we're in it to win it!

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:38.872
\u266a What are ya gonna do?

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:42.142
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.077
\u266a Back against the wall,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.180
\u266a You gotta give it your all, a-a-a-a-a-a \u266a

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.417
\u266a This is the final stand, a-a-a-a-a-a \u266a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.318
\u266a The powers in your hand!

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:57.857
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.527
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.530
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:07.233
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:08.968
TAYLEAN: Hmmmph!

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.370
Haaaaaah! [exertion, running reax]

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.638
Hmmmph!

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:15.141
Huuuuuaaaaaah!

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.344
TAYLEAN: Not good enough, punk!

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.647
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [wild cheering]

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.715
SHUN: Ability activate!

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.651
SHUN: Slash Rise Thunder!

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:28.922
TAYLEAN: Haaaaaaaah!

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.089
BOY BATTLER A: What?

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.324
BOY BATTLER B: No way!

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.059
SHUN: Ability activate!

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.628
SHUN: Shooting Wind Dust Slash!

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:36.996
TAYLEAN: Hmmmph!

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.700
Haaaaah!

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:44.404
ANNOUNCER: It's another \"Kazami Double Whammy\"!

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.940
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: Shun! Shun! Shun! Shun! Shun!

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.509
SHUN: Those two kids were using Chaos Bakugan as well.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.411
TAYLEAN: They're everywhere yet no one

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:55.048
seems to know how to use them properly.

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.584
MARUCHO: Hey Shun, hold up a second!

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.819
SHUN: No time to stop, Marucho.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:00.920
I've got a battle to get to.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.589
MARUCHO: Just stop!

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.157
MARUCHO: You need to take a break.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.259
You're gonna burn out. Listen to me. Please!

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.895
SHUN: There's too many reckless battlers running around.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:11.364
If I don't keep them in check Interspace is in trouble.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:16.669
MARUCHO: [grunt] Hey! But...But Shun.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.772
MARUCHO: Can't you see that you're heading down

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.308
the same path as Dan?

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:24.310
RAFE: Hmmph. Sounds like the Brawlers

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:26.613
are having some \"personality issues\" huh, Paige?

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:31.651
PAIGE: I think we arrived just in time, Rafe.

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:36.890
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: A Royale Pain.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:51.804
SELLON: Now! Time to bloom. And destroy your opponents!

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.606
SELLON: Mechtogan Braxion.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.747
Surge!

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.318
[computer beeps and trills]

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.586
BOY BATTLER C: Whoa!

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:12.058
BOY BATTLER D: Don't just sit there! Attaaaaaaaack!

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:16.362
[explosion]

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:23.803
BOY BATTLER C: Whoooooooa! BOY BATTLER D: Whoooooooa!

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:27.440
SELLON: [chuckle] A killer instinct is useless

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.709
in the absence of control, boys.

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:31.477
ANNOUNCER: For those of you just joining us,

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.313
we've got a doozy of battle in progress

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.114
in Battle Arena A.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:38.818
ANNOUNCER: And it's being dominated by Anubias.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.020
ANUBIAS: Now Horridian! Hah!

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:49.862
It's time to launch Mechtogan Smasheon!

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:53.833
BOY BATTLER F: [terrified gasp]

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:56.469
[heavy metallic impact]

00:03:56.502 --> 00:04:00.940
[computer beeps and trills]

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:05.745
ANUBIAS: Let's get our smash-on!

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:10.183
[laser blasts]

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:13.019
ANUBIAS: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:16.055
ANUBIAS: [gasp] [grunt, exertion reax]

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.957
SPECTATOR A: Now that's how you use a Mechtogan!

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.393
SPECTATOR B: Yeah, too bad Dan wasn't here to take notes!

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.195
ANUBIAS: That was close.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:24.230
If it weren't for the Chaos Bakugan that Master Mag Mel

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.500
gave me I would've lost control of my Mechtogan.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:31.437
How the heck was Dan Kuso able to control his, then?

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:34.340
ANUBIAS: [grunt, anger reax]

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:37.243
DYLAN: Hmmm. Interesting.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.345
DYLAN: I thought the BakuNanos made the battles

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.648
more intense but the Mechtogans have really

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.816
upped the stakes. I've gotta figure out how to

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.852
get my hands some of those things.

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:48.187
DYLAN: With the right supplier I could make

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:54.460
some serious cheddar!

00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:59.132
SELLON: What happened with Dan and Drago?

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:01.834
ANUBIAS: I don't know. I had them up against the ropes

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:04.003
but then somehow they managed to get control

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.872
over their Mechtogan.

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:08.274
SELLON: That's pretty interesting.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:11.311
SELLON: I don't think any of us anticipated that.

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:15.181
ANUBIAS: I know. It's just...

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:16.482
BEN: Hey, Boss...

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:17.684
ANUBIAS: What is it?

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:18.851
BEN: Check this.

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.153
NOAH: It's me Noah!

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:21.654
ANUBIAS: Noah?

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:24.023
BEN: We told him to scram but he wouldn't listen.

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:26.526
NOAH: I want a shot at joining Team Anubias.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:27.960
ANUBIAS: What's the deal, kid?

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.263
I thought you were Kuso's number one fan.

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:32.265
NOAH: Not any more I'm not.

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:34.434
NOAH: I've been watching you ever since Dan took off

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.537
from Interspace like a punk and abandoned his loyal fans.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.405
NOAH: You're an awesome battler, Anubias.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.642
You've got way more skill and courage than that loser Dan.

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:47.580
NOAH: You're the best! What d'ya say?

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:49.449
ANUBIAS: Sure, why not.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:52.485
NOAH: [gasp] Yeah!

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:56.622
JACK: Hahaha! Congrats squirt. Welcome to Team Anubias, pal.

00:05:56.656 --> 00:05:58.991
BEN: Just make sure you don't get in our way.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.027
NOAH: No problem!

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.965
ANUBIAS: Soon you'll have no fans left, Kuso.

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.134
SELLON: Is there a reason you're walking around

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.702
with your fist clenched like that?

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:11.604
ANUBIAS: [angry grunt]

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:14.874
SELLON: Try not to forget that the mission here

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:16.876
is to resurrect Master Mag Mel.

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.811
ANUBIAS: Hmmph.

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:22.482
SELLON: There. Can you hear it, Anubias?

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:27.787
SELLON: More evil is in bloom.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.288
SHUN: [panting]

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:31.858
TAYLEAN: Are you okay Shun?

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.693
SHUN: I'm all right.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:36.028
ANNOUNCER: Attention. This afternoon in Battle Arena A,

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.397
we'll be holding a Battle Royale!

00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:40.733
SHUN: What? A Battle Royale!

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:42.769
TAYLEAN: That's pure insanity!

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:45.104
TAYLEAN: Having a bunch of unskilled Battlers in one

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:47.573
giant fight will only end in disaster!

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.642
SHUN: Not if I can help it.

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:52.578
MARUCHO: Shun! [panting, running reax]

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:54.413
Did you just hear that announcement?

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:55.748
SHUN: I did.

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:57.316
MARUCHO: How can they just call a random

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.818
Battle Royale like that?

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:00.953
TRISTAR: Most of those kids can barely handle one-on-one.

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:02.755
This has bad news written all over it.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.658
MARUCHO: Things are way out of control in here.

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:08.961
First it was the BakuNanos and then the Mechtogans,

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:12.064
and now a dangerous free-for-all like this.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.233
It's just not right!

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:17.970
SHUN: I know. It feels like someone is manipulating things.

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.239
MARUCHO: Yeah, but who?

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.641
SHUN: No idea.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:23.910
I'll have to figure that out after the Battle Royale.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.178
MARUCHO: Wait!

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:26.813
TAYLEAN: The only way for us to keep this

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:28.981
Battle Royale from tearing Interspace apart,

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:30.817
is for us to win the whole thing.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.018
SHUN: Exactly.

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:35.488
MARUCHO: Hmmm!

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.323
ANNOUNCER: Heads up Battle Fans.

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:39.892
The environment for today's Battle Royale

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:47.934
will be Urban Combat!

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.970
DYLAN: Well, this is very curious indeed.

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:54.073
Both Sellon and Anubias are sitting this one out.

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:57.176
DYLAN: [chuckle] Kinda makes you wonder if

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.812
something fishy is going on.

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:01.581
ROBIN: Bakugan Brawl! SOON: Bakugan Brawl!

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:10.690
ROBIN: Bakugan Stand! SOON: Bakugan Stand!

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:13.159
BOY BATTLER G: Let's all gang up on the Robin and Soon.

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:16.629
BOY BATTLER H: Okay! GIRL BATTLER A: Okay!

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:23.069
ROBIN: I'm gonna teach you punks a lesson you won't ever forget!

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:25.571
ROBIN: BakuNano, Hyper Pulsor.

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:28.074
ROBIN: Destroy!

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:35.014
BOY BATTLER G: What kind of BakuNano's that, huh?

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:38.551
BOY BATTLER G: We can still take 'em! Relax.

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:40.887
BOY BATTLER G: Aaaaaarrrrrggggghhhh!

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.421
GIRL BATTLER A: Where'd that come from?

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:44.323
BOY BATTLER H: It sure wasn't from Bolcanon!

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:15.194
SHUN: Did you bring that Mechtogan?

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:17.930
SHUN: Because you seem to know an awful lot about it.

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:19.631
PAIGE: Come on.

00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:23.469
RAFE: We first learned about the Mechtogan far away on Neathia.

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:25.804
RAFE: A Mechtogan is the physical manifestation

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:28.373
of an ability, created when Bakugan

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:30.109
and Battler fall out of sync.

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:32.678
RAFE: In other words it's born out of chaos.

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:34.746
MARUCHO: They're from Bakugan?

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.116
RAFE: Yes, which means that theoretically

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:39.051
you should be able to command them...

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:41.420
...but only if the power balance between Battler

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:43.088
and Bakugan is in sync.

00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:44.289
SHUN: [angry grunt]

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:48.927
SHUN: Otherwise you have zero control.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.762
TRISTAR: So are you trying to tell me that Anubias

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:52.431
and Sellon are in perfect balance

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.932
with their Bakugan then?

00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:56.768
RAFE: No, we think they're using other control methods.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:59.538
MARUCHO: What kind of other methods?

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:02.140
RAFE: We're not entirely sure.

00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:04.076
PAIGE: The truth is, we've never seen a Mechtogan

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:05.210
in person before.

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:06.712
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:08.647
RAFE: Until now we've only studied about them

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.282
in the ancient texts.

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:12.851
PAIGE: Yeah, but we still know way more than you!

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:15.120
PAIGE: When word reached Neathia about the appearance

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:17.055
of Mechtogan Princess Fabia asked us to

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:18.957
come and give you guys a hand cleaning things up.

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.826
MARUCHO: Wow! Are you guys serious?

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:22.761
SHUN: We don't need a pair of babysitters

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:23.896
so you can get lost.

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:29.535
MARUCHO: Huh? Shun, hold on.

00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:33.539
MARUCHO: Shun, wait!

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:34.806
PAIGE: Just let him go.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.009
PAIGE: We don't have time for a sulker,

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.877
there's important work to be done.

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:40.445
RAFE: Who knew the Battle Brawlers

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.714
were such an awful mess?

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:49.488
MARUCHO: We're not that bad... [sigh]

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:51.023
TRISTAR: You can't just let them walk away!

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:54.059
They know about the Mechtogans.

00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:57.496
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:00.432
DAN: Drago!, C'mon, you gotta go faster, buddy!

00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:01.867
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaaah!

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.335
DRAGO: Hmmmph!

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.370
Huuuuuah!

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:07.673
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax] [panting]

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.741
DAN: Hmmmph! [grunt]

00:20:09.775 --> 00:20:11.810
DAN: Are you gonna be okay, pal?

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:13.211
DRAGO: Yes, I'll be fine.

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:24.056
DAN: Awesome!

00:20:24.089 --> 00:20:26.458
DAN: Oh yeah! We're gonna get out of this slump,

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:29.194
get control of our powers and be back on top!

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:35.400
DRAGO: In no time!

00:20:35.434 --> 00:20:37.135
MARUCHO: Oh man! This really stinks!

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:39.638
What am I gonna do?

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:40.872
KYOSUKE: Marucho.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:43.609
MARUCHO: Hey, Dad! This is a surprise.

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:45.210
Is everything okay?

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.879
KYOSUKE: I have something I need to discuss.

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:50.482
MARUCHO: Right well, I don't mean to be rude

00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:52.451
but can it wait. I'm kind of in the middle

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:54.386
of something really important.

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:56.488
Can I call you back in the morning?

00:20:56.521 --> 00:20:57.990
KYOSUKE: It will just take a second.

00:20:58.023 --> 00:20:59.758
MARUCHO: Oh, okay.

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:02.694
KYOSUKE: I want you to quit the Battle Brawlers.

00:21:02.728 --> 00:21:07.532
MARUCHO: Whaaaaaaaaaat?

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:09.101
TRISTAR: Life in Bakugan Interspace

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:10.902
really stinks these days.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.038
Those two cocky, young punks Rafe and Paige

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:15.574
have been hanging around and smack talking the Brawlers.

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:18.010
Shun is acting like King Grumpy-Pants because

00:21:18.043 --> 00:21:19.544
all he wants to do is battle.

00:21:19.578 --> 00:21:21.279
Those pesky Mechtogans keep popping up

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:23.682
and destroying stuff and now Marucho wants to quit.

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:25.751
I can't believe I'm saying this but,

00:21:25.784 --> 00:21:28.387
I wish Dan and Drago were around to straighten things out.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.522
Maybe you could tune in and give some advice

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:32.457
about the craziness you see.

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:34.526
All I know is, someone has to be

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:37.329
the voice of reason, before it's too late!

00:21:37.362 --> 00:21:38.363
