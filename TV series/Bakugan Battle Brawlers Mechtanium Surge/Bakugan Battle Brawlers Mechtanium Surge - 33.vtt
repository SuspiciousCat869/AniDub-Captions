WEBVTT

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.141
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well,

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.310
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.345
But then out of nowhere, we were invaded by

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.347
these mysterious and evil Mechtogan

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.249
who were intent on destroying everything.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.384
Coredegon

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.485
Slycerak

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.652
Exostriker

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.121
and Mandibor were their names.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.256
And leading them was this clown Wiseman.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.258
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.861
called the Nonets. Luckily for us, we had our own

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:30.663
secret weapon in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.866
So we fought back, because no one is going to

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.368
take our freedom! Not now, not ever!

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.438
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.741
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.944
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.248
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:51.418
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:55.455
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:00.260
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:03.096
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.499
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.436
JULIE: Welcome viewers, this is your favourite reporter Julie,

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.671
coming to you from the happiest place on Earth.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.740
JULIE: Bakugan Land!

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:16.509
JULIE: Built by the Bakugan as a thank-you to the humans...

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.578
for welcoming them to Earth, this state of the art...

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.680
theme park is a place for families, human and...

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:23.049
Bakugan alike, to come and interact.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.385
It's here that you'll see living proof that the spirit...

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:29.122
of friendship and cooperation can exist between all species...

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:31.024
no matter how different they are.

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.258
JULIE: Stay tuned for Bakugan Land like

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.293
you've never seen it before.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.134
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Battle for Bakugan Land

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.772
MARUCHO: Great news, the doctors say Mira is almost...

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.440
well enough to go home.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:51.311
SHUN: Terrific. I was very concerned when she fainted

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:55.982
after working herself so hard. I'm glad it wasn't serious.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:59.118
SHUN: I haven't seen Dan or Runo all day, have you?

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.421
MARUCHO: Dan thought it would be a good idea to show Runo...

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.089
around Bakugan City.

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.791
SHUN: They're sightseeing?

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.693
MARUCHO: No, it's not a casual day out.

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:09.362
Dan's plan is way more strategic than that.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.231
MARUCHO: Since it's Runo's first time here,

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.099
and now that she's back on the team and fighting...

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:15.468
alongside of us, Dan thought it would be a good idea...

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.170
for her to learn the layout of the town.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.305
The more familiar she is with Bakugan City...

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.974
the more effective she'll be in helping us...

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.609
to defend against Wiseman.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.511
SHUN: That's a really great strategy.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.246
It seems like no matter where we go,

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.648
Wiseman is always getting the drop on us.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.251
Knowing the city inside out, will keep our response time...

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:32.652
to a minimum.

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:34.654
MARUCHO: I wonder if they're on schedule.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.123
Dan mentioned he was going to enlist the help of someone...

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:39.826
who knows every possible corner of the city.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.928
SHUN: Huh, you mean Julie?

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.499
RUNO: Whoa! It's even better than I imagined!

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:47.600
What d'ya think?

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:50.837
DAN: Aw, it's totally awesome. The best.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.672
DRAGO: Yes, the best.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.407
REPTAK: The very best!

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.544
DRAGO, DAN and REPTAK: [laughter]

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.212
JULIE: Cut, cut, cut!

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.813
JULIE: You call that natural?

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:04.651
You guys are stiff as boards! Relax a little will you?

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.387
DAN: Look Julie, we're all trying our best, okay?

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.888
It's just not our thing.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.757
DRAGO: I'd say it's harder than battling.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.458
REPTAK: Huh, no kidding.

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:15.828
JULIE: Enough with your excuses. Can't you follow Runo's lead?

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.463
She's doing just fine.

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:20.800
RUNO: 'Cos I'm a natural! [giggles]

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:25.171
DAN: Whatever, besides, we're only here because you said...

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:28.141
you'd help me show Runo around; not force us in front of...

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:30.877
the camera to act in your silly news segment, okay.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.713
JULIE: But I am helping you. Bakugan Land is an iconic...

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.549
location so what better place to start the tour, right?

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:38.985
JULIE: Besides, by working in a quick segment,

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:41.754
it keeps the boss off my back and lets me play tour guide.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.457
DAN: Right, I guess, it makes sense.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.393
RUNO: Hey guys if this is such a major attraction...

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:50.897
then why is it totally empty?

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.545
JULIE: That is a really good question.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.114
We should get to the bottom of this. Let's go.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.217
FEMALE STAFF: [gasp]

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.386
JULIE: Hi! We were wondering if you could answer...

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.288
a few questions for us.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.025
FEMALE STAFF: Well, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to,

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:21.861
but I guess there's no harm in it.

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:26.366
JULIE: We noticed that attendance is super low...

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:29.602
at the park today. Is this a regular thing and if so, why?

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:30.937
LITTLE BOY A: Huh?

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.839
FEMALE STAFF: It didn't used to be normal.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:34.774
When we first opened this place it was packed,

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.442
but these days people are staying away...

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:38.344
because they're afraid of the Bakugan.

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:39.579
DAN: Afraid?

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.014
DRAGO: Of Bakugan?

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:42.348
REPTAK: But why?

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.584
RUNO: Yeah, that makes no sense. They're our friends.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:48.221
FEMALE STAFF: I guess, it's really Wiseman who's to blame...

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:49.889
for everything that's going on.

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:52.191
DAN: What do you mean Wiseman?

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.861
FEMALE STAFF: In many of his attacks, Wiseman has been aided

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:57.664
by the Nonet Bakugan and as you know they've unleashed

00:04:57.697 --> 00:05:00.166
a horrible amount of destruction upon the city.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.368
And even though they're a rare evil breed,

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:05.038
it's left most people distrustful of all Bakugan.

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:07.874
RUNO: But that's just not fair. Most Bakugan are nothing...

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:09.542
but good and kind.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.178
DRAGO: Of course they are. But all of that is easy for people

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.547
to forget when they're afraid.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.718
DAN: That lousy Wiseman! [angry grunt]

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.319
LITTLE GIRL A: [frightened squeak]

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:21.621
LITTLE GIRL A: [gasp]

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.391
LITTLE GIRL A: [crying]

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:27.193
RUNO, DAN and JULIE: Huh!?

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:29.128
DAN: Did I just do that?

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:34.300
LITTLE GIRL A: Thank-you clown.

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.342
JULIE: This is crazy. The Bakugan shouldn't be feared.

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.210
We have to get the word out.

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:47.613
Right! Of course!

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:48.748
RUNO: Huh?

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.916
JULIE: What a great idea!

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.617
JULIE: [panting, running reax]

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:53.619
RUNO: Julie!

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:55.188
DAN: Wait!

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.899
JULIE: Check it out, what better image to remind people...

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:09.602
of how humans and Bakugan are friends.

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.104
Make sure you get it in the shot behind me...

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:13.406
once we start rolling. Did you get that?

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.941
DAMDOS: What's with all the ruckus!

00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:16.442
I'm trying to nap over here!

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:17.744
JULIE: [gasp]

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:19.245
DAMDOS: Keep it down!

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:21.114
JULIE: We're here to do a story on the wonderful relationship

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:23.216
that exists between humans and Bakugan.

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:25.351
Can we interview you, sir?

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:27.487
DAMDOS: Not a chance, kid! Now scram!

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.855
You're bothering me!

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.456
JULIE: What did you say?

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.791
DAN: There you are, Julie!

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:33.793
RUNO: Why'd you run away on us like that?

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.762
JULIE: I was trying to shoot a piece to remind people that...

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:38.564
Bakugan weren't mean, but then I ran into this grumpy pants.

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:40.400
DAMDOS: I'm not gonna tell you brats again!

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:43.035
Enough with your chit chat. Hit the road!

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.605
And don't come back, you hear me?

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:46.639
DAN: What?

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:48.908
REPTAK: What the heck is your problem, pal?

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:52.078
DRAGO: Yes, there's no reason to be so rude.

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:54.981
DAMDOS: Me being rude? I'm not the one waking up peaceful...

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:57.617
Bakugan from their naps. Besides, why are you...

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.019
standing up for these lousy humans anyhow?

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.954
It's not like they'd do the same for you.

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:03.656
DAN: What are you talking about?

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.626
DAMDOS: You humans are only friends when it suits you.

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.895
DAMDOS: Back when we first came to live on Earth you were all...

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.998
smiles and happiness. You made such a huge production...

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:13.399
of erecting this monument.

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:18.938
CROWD OF PEOPLE: Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:24.177
DAMDOS: [grunt exertion reax]

00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:27.280
[wild cheers]

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:34.887
DAMDOS: Everyone said: Bakugan and humans could peacefully...

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:38.357
coexist, that they could live together in perfect harmony,

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:41.027
and for a time I actually believed it.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.532
DAMDOS: But not anymore, just look at this place!

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:49.569
JULIE: But this is all just one big misunderstanding!

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:50.803
Don't you get it?

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:52.638
DAN: Julie's right. This is only temporary.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:54.040
Once we get rid of Wiseman,

00:07:54.073 --> 00:07:55.908
people will come to their senses.

00:07:55.942 --> 00:07:58.744
DAMDOS: Don't you get it? By then the damage will be done,

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.646
and it will be too late to fix it,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.281
so why fight the inevitable?

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.250
DAMDOS: Humans and Bakugan living together happily...

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:07.253
ever after, was nothing more than an illusion.

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.821
DAMDOS: Just a silly dream.

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:09.822
DAN: Hold on...

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.157
JULIE: There's nothing silly about it!

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.792
DAMDOS: What?

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:15.194
JULIE: Bakugan and humans can be even more than friends.

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:17.897
They can be family! Just look at the Brawlers!

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.665
JULIE: I've stood alongside them as they've battled...

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:22.501
countless enemies, and saved the universe time and time again.

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:25.404
If you had been there there's no way you would question the bond

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:28.140
that exists between the Brawlers and their partner Bakugan.

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:31.644
It's real and it's incredible. But what's most important is...

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:34.413
that it can exist between all humans and Bakugan.

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.816
JULIE: So deep down you can't possibly believe all those...

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:39.719
things you've been saying. C'mon, admit it!

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:42.822
DAMDOS: Hah! You don't know what the heck you're talking about.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.790
I can't wait to leave this place behind,

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.325
and get back to New Vestroia.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:47.994
JULIE: Are you really going to sit there and pretend like...

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.929
you're going to flee back to your old home planet?

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:52.131
Sorry Damdos, but I just don't believe it.

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:54.500
DAMDOS: Believe what you want. It's true.

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.404
JULIE: But so many have already left.

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:00.907
DAMDOS: That's right. They were the smart ones.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.675
JULIE: If you really believe that then why...

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.443
are you still here, huh? Tell me.

00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:06.479
DAMDOS: I don't have to tell you anything!

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:08.347
Now for the last time, leave me alone!

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.917
JULIE: You stubborn ape! Just admit you're here because...

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.418
you want to be!

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:13.786
DAMDOS: What did you call me?

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:16.422
CLOWN: All of this bickering just proves my point.

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:18.724
JULIE, RUNO and DAN: [gasp]

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:24.196
CLOWN: It's unnatural for Bakugan and humans to coexist.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.332
CLOWN: It's time you accept this fact.

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.534
DAN: Why don't you mind your own business, clown.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.636
RUNO: Hey who are you, really?

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:36.909
CLOWN: [chuckle rising into laughter]

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.879
CLOWN: [grunt]

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.650
DAN: Wiseman!

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:45.885
JULIE and RUNO: [gasp]

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:47.353
DRAGO: What? REPTAK: Huh?

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:50.423
WISEMAN: What's wrong Kuso? You look surprised to see me.

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:52.725
WISEMAN: And here I thought you'd be excited to face me...

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.593
in battle once more.

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:00.199
Hmmph.

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:02.268
WISEMAN: Humans and Bakugan will never live together...

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.569
as long as I'm around!

00:10:05.838 --> 00:10:08.541
DAN: It's time to send Wiseman packing again, Drago!

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:11.610
DAMDOS: You're not welcome here, Wiseman!

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:12.645
WISEMAN: Hmmph.

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:14.480
DAN: You wanna fight? Let's do this you...

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:15.614
JULIE: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.183
DAN: Whoa!

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:20.519
JULIE: Okay Wiseman, this is your chance, it's time to tell

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:24.256
all the people of Bakugan City why it is, you believe that...

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.059
humans and their friends, the Bakugan, shouldn't live...

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:29.829
together in peace and harmony.

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:34.400
RUNO: What the heck is Julie doing?

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:37.203
DAN: That creep's not gonna tell you anything!

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:42.308
JULIE: I've got this under control.

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:44.610
WISEMAN: Sorry, but I don't give interviews.

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:48.347
So stand back and let's get on with things.

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:51.150
WISEMAN: Bakugan Brawl!

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:52.685
WISEMAN: Bakugan Stand!

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:53.986
WISEMAN: Hmmmph!

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.589
WISEMAN: Rise Pyrus Spatterix!

00:10:56.622 --> 00:10:57.990
SPATTERIX: Hmmmmph!

00:10:58.024 --> 00:10:59.158
WISEMAN: Rise, Subterra Stronk!

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:00.660
STRONK: Haaaaaaaah!

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:04.764
DAMDOS: Hey! Quit messing up my yard!

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:06.198
SPATTERIX: Pipe down!

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:08.167
DAMDOS: You're gonna pay for that!

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:11.237
STRONK: Haaaaaaaah!

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.305
DAMDOS: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:14.874
JULIE: Damdos! No!

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:16.709
WISEMAN: That's what happens when you stick your nose...

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:18.577
in other people's battles.

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:20.012
DAMDOS: Oooomph!

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:21.580
DAN: Aw snap! Are you okay?

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:23.449
DAMDOS: Yeah, but that's gonna leave a mark.

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:25.317
DAN: You lousy, creep!

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.586
WISEMAN: Save your anger for the battle.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.155
DRAGO: Let's do this!

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.289
REPTAK: Ya!

00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:32.658
RUNO: Hey Dan, I'll be right back. I've got an idea.

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:35.895
DAN: Sounds good. Julie, stand back okay?

00:11:35.928 --> 00:11:38.698
JULIE: No! It's a journalist's job to report the news,

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:41.867
no matter how dangerous. Besides it's a great opportunity...

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:44.503
to highlight Bakugan and humans working together.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.505
Which is the whole reason we're here today!

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:50.943
DAMDOS: Not this again!

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:54.246
DAN: Okay, just try and not get in our way while...

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.182
we take this guy down for good.

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:57.216
DRAGO: Ready, Reptak?

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:59.452
REPTAK: Just say the word guys, and it's on.

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:01.454
SPATTERIX: Don't get too cocky, punks.

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:03.689
Just because you got the best of us last time,

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.558
doesn't mean you'll do it again.

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.626
STRONK: Yeah! We're gonna crush you!

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.763

DRAGO: Hmmmph!

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:20.639
SPATTERIX: [grunt, pain reax]

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:22.775

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:24.410

00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:47.500
REPTAK: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:54.507
DAMDOS: They're fighting with everything they've got!

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.076
JULIE: That's what I'm talking about! Go get 'em!

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:03.282
CROWD OF PEOPLE: [concerned murmuring]

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:05.651

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:07.820
JULIE: This is Julie reporting to you from the scene of...

00:13:07.853 --> 00:13:09.755
the latest battle against Wiseman!

00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:11.891
JULIE: Where Dan Kuso, Drago and Reptak are fighting...

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:14.026
for humans and Bakugan alike!

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:15.427

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:32.464
DAMDOS: Boy this thing is heavier than I remember.

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:35.267
JULIE: Oh, Damdos!

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:39.238
DAMDOS: We worked too hard to build this place!

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:41.173
I'm not gonna let them destroy it!

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:43.108
LITTLE BOY B: [happy gasp] He's awesome!

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:45.411
WISEMAN: This is starting to bore me!

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:47.513
WISEMAN: Combined Ability activate!

00:15:47.546 --> 00:15:49.348
WISEMAN: Power Ditch!

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:51.283
COMBINED SPATTERIX: Haaaaaaaah!

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.786
DRAGO: What? [grunt, pain reax]

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:57.323
REPTAK: What's happening? [grunt, pain reax]

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:59.758
REPTAK: My energy's draining.

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:03.529
DAN: You have to get up guys! Come on!

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:05.097
COMBINED SPATTERIX: It's hopeless, Kuso!

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.666
Nothing can nullify my Power Drain ability!

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.537
So just accept the fact that your puny Bakugan are doomed!

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.573
WISEMAN: As much as I'm enjoying this, we should put them...

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:16.041
out of their misery.

00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:19.445
WISEMAN: Say goodbye now, Ability...

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:21.613
[gasp]

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:26.518
DAMDOS: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:16:26.552 --> 00:16:29.688
WISEMAN: The way you cling to this foolish dream...

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:32.091
makes me so sick!

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:34.393
DAMDOS: [grunt, pain reax] Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:37.096
JULIE: [shriek]

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:42.034
COMBINED SPATTERIX: Haaaaaaaah!

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:43.769
DAN: Stop! I'm the one you're battling, Wiseman!

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:45.704
WISEMAN: He's the one that stepped into the ring,

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:48.307
so this is what he gets for interfering.

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.514
RUNO: Coordinates, locked on.

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:59.284
RUNO: Battle Suits, teleport: Defendtrix to Drago

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:01.620
RUNO: Combustoid, over to Reptak!

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:11.063
DAN: Hmmm? Look!

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:14.199
DRAGO: Huh? REPTAK: Hmmmph!

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:19.438
COMBINED SPATTERIX: I'm gonna teach you a lesson...

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:21.507
for getting in our way!

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.075
DAMDOS: Oh-no!

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.080
COMBINED SPATTERIX: [rising mighty roar]

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:29.715
JULIE: [gasp] DAMDOS: [gasp]

00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:31.216
COMBINED SPATTERIX: Ready?

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.618
COMBINED SPATTERIX: [grunt, pain reax]

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:34.553
DAN: Nice one! Thanks for the help, Runo!

00:17:34.586 --> 00:17:36.088
RUNO: [giggles] Anything I can do to help...

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:37.589
the team out!

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:40.993
COMBINED SPATTERIX: [grunt, pain reax]

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:42.795
DAN: That's it! Stay on him guys!

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:44.029
DRAGO: Right! REPTAK: Right!

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:50.235
COMBINED SPATTERIX: Whooooa!

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:51.670
Oooomph!

00:17:51.703 --> 00:17:53.372
COMBINED SPATTERIX: Is that all you've got?

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:01.080
COMBINED SPATTERIX: Now I'm really mad!

00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:02.481
Haaaaaaah!

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:07.619
COMBINED SPATTERIX: [angry, frustrated grunt]

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:10.556
DRAGO: Where are you going? We're just about to show you...

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:12.524
REPTAK: ...the full power of our Battle Suits!

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:19.331
COMBINED SPATTERIX: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:21.300
SPATTERIX: Oooomph! STRONK: Oooomph!

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:22.768
WISEMAN: Their combination's broken!

00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:24.803
DAN: That's it guys! Finish 'em off!

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:26.572
DRAGO: You bet! REPTAK: You bet!

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:47.926
RUNO: Energy charge at one hundred percent!

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.428
DAN: Engage!

00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:51.997
DRAGO: Aaaaarrrrggggh!

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:56.134
SPATTERIX: No, no, no, noooooooo!

00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:58.103
STRONK: This is gonna hurt!

00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:00.405
WISEMAN: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:05.010
STRONK: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh! SPATTERIX: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:12.184
WISEMAN: Blasted Battle Suits, I should've destroyed...

00:19:12.217 --> 00:19:14.253
those things first.

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:15.287
DAN: [grunt]

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:29.001
JULIE: Dan!

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:30.669
DAN: Julie, are you alright?

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:36.775
CROWD OF PEOPLE: [cheers, excited voices]

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:39.611
JULIE: What's everyone doing here?

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:41.780
MARUCHO: You have your news report to thank for that.

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:44.783
SHUN: They saw your coverage and wanted to come help.

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:47.286
JULIE: Are you serious? For realz?

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:48.287
SHUN: That's right.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.256
MARUCHO: Mmm-hmm. You moved them.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.458
JULIE: Wow, that is so totally amazing.

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:08.473
CROWD OF PEOPLE: Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:10.842
[wild cheers]

00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:19.017
SHUN: Thanks to Julie, trust and goodwill between humans...

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:22.154
and Bakugan has been restored.

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:25.257
MARUCHO: No kidding. In fact, I don't think I'd be exaggerating

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.492
if I said that the bond that existed before this...

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:30.295
is now stronger than ever.

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:32.197
JULIE: It's this humble reporters opinion that if...

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.565
humans and Bakugan stick together,

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:35.467
Wiseman will be toast in no time.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.103
DAMDOS: Are you still talking Julie!

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:39.538
JULIE: [gasp] [laughter]

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:42.908
CROWD OF PEOPLE: [laughter]

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:46.678
RUNO: Take it easy guys, I think the winner today...

00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:49.281
has got to be Julie.

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:54.386
DAN: Ya, ya, I hear that Runo I couldn't agree more.

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:56.254
JULIE: This is your favourite roving reporter Julie,

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:58.957
signing off from Bakugan Land!

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:04.663
CROWD OF PEOPLE: [ooohs &amp; ahhhs, cheers]

00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:09.568
DAN: We had all just given up hope of ever seeing Gunz again

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:11.737
when suddenly he appeared one stormy day.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.939
Unfortunately, he had no memory of what had happened to him

00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:16.274
during his disappearance but we didn't worry about it too much.

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:18.577
We were all just glad to see him alive and well.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.013
It wasn't long before things got crazy again with Wiseman

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:23.815
and his Mechtogan showing up. The timing was so strange

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:25.484
we all wondered if Reptak was right.

00:21:25.517 --> 00:21:28.120
Was Wiseman really Gunz in disguise? If I told you what

00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:29.888
we'd discover you'd never believe me,

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:31.957
so you better tune in yourself to check it out.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.892
One thing's for sure, the battle you're gonna see

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:36.461
is gonna totally blow your mind!

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:46.538
