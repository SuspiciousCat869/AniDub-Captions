WEBVTT

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.777
DAN: A long time has passed since we took down Mag Mel,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.579
and things have never been better.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:14.848
DAN: Now that peace exists throughout the universe,

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.983
Shun, Marucho and I have been able to focus on training,

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:19.519
and battling just for the love of the game.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.622
It's brought the Brawlers way closer to our partner Bakugan.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:24.958
DAN: But it's not just us. Things have been so great...

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.560
that all of the Bakugan have immigrated from New Vestroia,

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.763
and now live here on Earth amongst us humans.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.232
It's like we're one giant happy family.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.235
DAN: I guess you could say things are perfect!

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:38.104
\u266a What are ya gonna do?

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:41.341
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:44.544
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.781
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:50.984
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:56.956
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.793
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:02.695
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.932
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.867
DAN: The first thing Marucho did when we returned...

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.070
was build this state of the art research lab.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.938
It's totally dope, which is cool because...

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.807
it's also the Battle Brawler headquarters.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.376
KATO: I trust you had a good run, Master Dan.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.812
Will you be joining Master Marucho now?

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:21.014
DAN: Ya, soon as I clean up.

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:22.982
KATO: Very well, sir.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:25.985
DAN: [gasp] Do you smell flowers?

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:27.220
MIRA: It's my new perfume.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.189
DAN: Huh? Oh hey, Mira.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:30.857
MIRA: You ready for today's match?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.659
MARUCHO: It's been a while since the Brawlers...

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:35.462
have battled as individuals. This should be interesting.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.163
MARUCHO: Just a couple more calculations and I think...

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.466
we'll have our own strategy figured out.

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:45.271
SHUN: My mind is clear and I'm ready for battle.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.575
DAN: Oh man, I am so psyched for today's battle.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.076
MIRA: Better stay hydrated.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.478
DAN: Hmmph.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:54.147
DAN: That's our old pal, Mira. She used to be our teammate...

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.049
back when we were battling Zenoheld...

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:59.018
and her mad scientist pops, Professor Clay.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:01.721
After we defeated those creeps, Mira turned her focus...

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.423
to developing high tech machinery...

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.192
using Vestal technology. She definitely inherited

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.827
her Dad's brain for science,

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:09.896
but luckily not his penchant for evil.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.531
MIRA: As soon as I'm done here, I'll come by...

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.199
and cheer you all on.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.001
DAN: Haaaah! Cool!

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:24.577
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Evil Arrival

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.579
DAN: We've brought Bakugan Battles out of...

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:29.048
the virtual world and back into the real one.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.818
We've even started a championship tournament.

00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:34.654
ANNOUNCER: Okay fans, it's the moment you've been waiting for.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.190
The start of the B1-Climax round.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:40.193
DAN: Me, Shun and Marucho are the top players

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.928
in the League of Champions.

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.229
MARUCHO: [laughter]

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:45.899
SHUN: Bakugan Brawl!

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.101
SHUN: Baku Sky Raider, Jump!

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:51.271
DAN: Shun's latest partner Bakugan is Ventus Jaakor.

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:53.573
DAN: He's a cool but deadly dude.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.642
SHUN: Ability activate!

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.046
SHUN: Fierce Demon Thunder Clap!

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.382
JAAKOR: I'll put down any evil that opposes me!

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.451
JAAKOR: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.987
DAN: Jaakor is a ninja Bakugan, which means that...

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.324
just like Shun he's a quiet and calculating warrior.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.893
MARUCHO: Bakugan Brawl!

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:16.896
MARUCHO: Baku Sky Raider, Jump!

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.198
DAN: And Marucho's now teamed up with a cool dude...

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.200
called Aquos Radizen.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:24.871
MARUCHO: Ability activate!

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.105
MARUCHO: Slam Leaf!

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.607
RADIZEN: It's slam-mer time!

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.275
Yeaaaaah!

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:33.646
DAN: Just like many of Marucho's partners...

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.482
from the past, Radizen loves to talk a lot of smack...

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:37.784
when he's battling.

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.955
DAN: Check out this walking tube of hair gel.

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:45.425
His name is Gunz and he thinks he's my number one opponent.

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:50.997
GUNZ: Bakugan Brawl!

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.433
GUNZ: Baku Sky Raider, Jump!

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:55.501
DAN: Gunz fights with Haos Reptak...

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.003
who's a bit of a bruiser.

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:59.606
GUNZ: Ability activate!

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.708
Spar Hook!

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.144
REPTAK: Lock on!

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:06.312
REPTAK: Attaaaaaaack!

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:09.315
REPTAK: Haaaaaaaah!

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.720
DAN: Reptak fights with deadly accuracy that can be...

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.422
pretty scary unless of course you're seasoned champs...

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:18.191
like me and Drago.

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:19.559
DAN: Ready Drago?

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:20.560
DRAGO: You bet!

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.861
DAN: Hmmmph!

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:24.831
Bakugan Braaaaaaawl!

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:28.067
DAN: Baku Sky Raider, Jump!

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:42.649
DAN: Drago's latest and greatest evolution has...

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:45.451
turned him into Pyrus Fusion Dragonoid!

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:50.757
DAN: Ability activate Dragon Trasher!

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.427
DRAGO: [rising mighty roar] Haaaaaaaah!

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.265
DAN: That's right!

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.437
FURY: Don't be foolish Coredegon.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.039
FURY: I am the one who created you here...

00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:08.474
in the Doom Dimension. To turn against me...

00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.643
would have dire consequences for you,

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.846
as a Mechtogan cannot survive without its Bakugan.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.049
FURY: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.154
COREDEGON: He was the fool to think...

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:24.323
that we needed him to survive.

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:27.393
COREDEGON: Our mutation has freed us from those shackles.

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:30.229
[evil cackle]

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:35.635
JULIE: Heeeeeeeey! Are you guys ready to see...

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:38.705
four of the baddest Brawlers ever?

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:42.008
JULIE: First up, it's Ventus battler Shun Kazami!

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:45.144
JULIE: Then it's our main Aquos dude, Ma-ru-chooo!

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:48.815
JULIE: After that, it's my best Pyrus buddy, Dan Kuso!

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:52.785
JULIE: And last but not least, Haos Battler Gunz Lizarre!

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:54.520
JULIE: Here comes the play-by-play...

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:55.855
as these guys go toe to toe.

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:58.458
JULIE: So buckle yourself in, guys, because today's action...

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.027
is going to be the most intense you've ever seen,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.495
I promise you!

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:04.630
MIRA: Daaaaan!

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:05.932
DAN: Huh?

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:08.668
MIRA: See? I told you guys I'd be here to cheer you on, right?

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:09.669
DAN: I knew it!

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:10.670
MARUCHO: Hi.

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:11.738
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyukyu

00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:13.840
RADIZEN: Roxtor, I've got a battle to fight.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.609
You can't be filling my head with your gibberish, right now.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.279
BETADRON: Mechtogan that can survive...

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:24.117
without their creator Bakugan? Impossible!

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.153
MUTABRID: They say it's their mutation that's allowed this.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.856
KODOKOR: Hmmmph. We'll see about that.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.492
EXOSTRIKER: Bakugan are like rotting old buildings.

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.594
SLYCERAK: Ones that need to be demolished.

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:36.596
MANDIBOR: And once we do that, we'll create...

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.064
an empire of Mechtogan.

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:40.333
TREMBLAR: You really think you can defeat the eight of us,

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:42.201
you arrogant punks?

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:45.605
COREDEGON: Hmmmph. We wouldn't waste our time on you.

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:48.374
SLYCERAK: You are evil Bakugan relics that have...

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:50.643
been banished here to the deepest region...

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:52.645
of the Doom Dimension.

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:54.881
EXOSTRIKER: You're already as good as dead,

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.451
so you are no threat to us. [evil laughter]

00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:00.186
MANDIBOR: We've been released from the shackles...

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.189
of our Bakugan, which means we are now free to leave this...

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:04.991
miserable place.

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:06.826
COREDEGON: New Vestroia is where we're heading...

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:08.895
so we can destroy every last Bakugan.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:12.198
SPATTERIX: You're over estimating your abilities.

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.833
STRONK: Yeah, but I do admire the hate...

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.601
you have in your hearts.

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:18.004
WORTON: I am afraid you won't find any Bakugan...

00:07:18.037 --> 00:07:19.605
in New Vestroia.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.275
WORTON: They've gone to Earth to live amongst the humans.

00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:23.709
SLYCERAK: You're lying!

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:25.044
EXOSTRIKER: How would you know?

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:28.481
BALISTA: Fool, don't you realize that Professor Worton...

00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:31.017
is all seeing, all knowing?

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.220
COREDEGON: It doesn't matter. If Earth is where they are...

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:36.455
then Earth is where we'll go.

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:39.759
Come Slycerak, Exostriker, Mandibor!

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.627
WORTON: They left before we could tell them about...

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:45.832
the mighty battler called Dan Kuso and his partner Drago,

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:49.035
but they'll meet them soon enough.

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:52.772
MARUCHO: Okay Radizen. It's just like the strategy...

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:54.941
we planned in the lab.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:57.109
MARUCHO: Ability activate!

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.511
MARUCHO: Deep Assent!

00:07:58.544 --> 00:07:59.779
RADIZEN: Oooooh yeeeeeeah!

00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:02.482
MARUCHO: Remember, Gunz uses the surprise attack strategy,

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:04.250
followed by head to head combat.

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:06.185
GUNZ: Remind me again, why I'm wasting my time...

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:07.854
with this twerp?

RADIZEN: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:16.362
RADIZEN: Aaaaaaaarrrrrgggghhh!

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:19.498
MARUCHO: How'd he do that?

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:20.733
JULIE: Wowzers!

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:22.535
JULIE: Gunz just made short work of Marucho,

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:24.503
which means he'll be advancing to the next round...

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:25.504
of today's tournament.

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:26.973
MARUCHO: I don't understand.

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.408
Our shield defense should have worked perfectly.

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:32.845
SHUN: I guess, Gunz just wanted it more than you did Marucho.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.213
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.482
SHUN: He was focused on his true goal...

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:37.950
...battling Dan.

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.552
DAN: Hah!

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:42.154
SHUN: Unfortunately for him, Gunz isn't going to get...

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.990
that opportunity.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.591
JULIE: Okey-dokey, pokies!

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:47.326
It's time for our second match of the day,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.530
which will see Shun facing off against Dan!

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:52.565
JULIE: Give us your best, guys!

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:54.300
GUNZ: Shun is definitely a tough opponent,

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.135
but you better not lose to him, Kuso.

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:58.638
You better not rob me of my ultimate destiny...

00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:00.406
which is to take you down in front of...

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:02.742
all of your adoring fans!

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:06.512
And watch you crumble under the weight of the humiliation.

Hmmmph!

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.358
JAAKOR: What?

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:55.227
JAAKOR: He duped me with a deception trick.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.762
SHUN: Jaakor! Watch out!

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:57.897
JAAKOR: Hmmm?

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:02.768

Oooomph!

00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:15.281
Lucky shot!

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:19.485
JULIE: Man oh man! Dan proves he's still king,

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:21.220
by taking Shun down.

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:22.955
GUNZ: Hmmmph.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:28.961
SHUN: So where'd you learn those ninja moves, huh Dan?

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:31.364
DAN: Oh, you know,TV. [chuckle]

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:35.868
SHUN: Hmmmph.

00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:40.106

GUNZ: These punks are no match for us Reptak!

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:48.080
JULIE: Awwwwwww yeeeeeeaaah!

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:50.316
It's the moment we've all been waiting for super fans!

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:53.753
We're about to see Gunz and Dan go head to head!

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:55.655
JULIE: Who will take the coveted title of being...

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:57.757
the first B1-Climax Champion?

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.661
GUNZ: Any final words Kuso before I take you down?

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:05.464

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:25.685
REPTAK: Hmmmph. I wouldn't dream of it, Drago.

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:26.685

JULIE: Whoooooaaa! Are those Mechtogan I see?

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:05.925
The use of those is a giant no-no...

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.561
in the B1 Climax tournament, gentlemen.

00:12:08.594 --> 00:12:09.962
GUNZ: Hey, they're not mine!

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:13.332
DAN: Well, Drago and I sure didn't call them.

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:15.868
DRAGO: Be careful Dan. Something's not right here.

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.937
COREDEGON: We heard the Bakugan were living amongst...

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.406
the humans, but we didn't know they were letting themselves...

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.575
be stared at like circus animals.

00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:24.577
REPTAK: This is no circus, fool.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.979
REPTAK: Bakugan Battling involves rules and honour.

00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:28.447

DRAGO: Why did you do that? Who are you?

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:38.424
SLYCERAK: It seems when a Bakugan is defeated on Earth,

00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:41.660
they turn to ball form, interesting.

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:45.131
EXOSTRIKER: Look around, they're everywhere.

00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:47.199
MANDIBOR: I wonder what would happen if we took them down...

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:49.101
while they're in ball form.

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:51.971
COREDEGON: Good question. Let's find out.

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:53.606
EXOSTRIKER: Yes sir!

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:54.607

SLYCERAK: Do you have any idea who you're up against right now?

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:40.586
DAN: A bunch of ugly tin cans that escaped from the junkyard?

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:41.887
MANDIBOR: Watch your mouth boy!

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:45.925
DAN: Nobody comes to my planet and hurts my friends, for real.

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.894
Leave now and we won't stop you. Stay and your done.

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:50.396
MARUCHO: All clear on the West side.

00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:52.932
The spectators have made it out safely.

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:57.169

we're not ready to leave yet.

00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.997
DAN: Nice one, pal!

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.032
DRAGO: Whooooaaa!

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:34.033
DAN: Drago!

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:35.034
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:36.568
DRAGO: Well that didn't work so well.

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:39.605
COREDEGON: Too bad for you, I'm not your average Mechtogan.

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:41.106
DRAGO: Ooooomph!

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.708
SLYCERAK: And you my friend are about to pay,

00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:44.343
for what you just did to me.

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:46.612
Only your pain will be a hundred fold.

00:15:46.645 --> 00:15:48.380
JAAKOR: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:50.249
MANDIBOR: Face it! You're no match for us!

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:53.886
So quit fighting the inevitable, haaah!

00:15:53.919 --> 00:15:55.721
RADIZEN: Keep talking big mouth!

00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:58.891
No one on our side is giving up yet!

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:01.927
GUNZ: [grunt]

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.964
GUNZ: Those guys totally messed up my match against Dan!

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:06.598
Think you can go again?

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.901
REPTAK: Absolutely. I'm ready when you are.

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:11.470
Just say the word.

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:13.205
GUNZ: Okay.

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:15.207

GUNZ: Arrghh!

00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:19.812
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:23.082
DAN: Oh Gunz! That's it, I've had enough!

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:26.719
COREDEGON: Don't worry. You'll get your turn too, boy!

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:29.822
JAAKOR: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:33.158

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:37.563
RADIZEN: [grunt, exertion reax] Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:40.099
MARUCHO: Whoooooaaaaa!

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:43.168
DAN: Marucho, Shun, Oh man!

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.837
DRAGO: You're gonna pay for that.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.440
COREDEGON: I've got something special in mind for you.

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:51.210
Slycerak, Exostriker, Mandibor!

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:53.679
Let's show them our true powers!

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:55.214
SLYCERAK, EXOSTRIKER and MANDIBOR: Yes, sir!

00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:57.116
SLYCERAK: You fools should have gone quietly...

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:58.684
while you still had the chance!

00:16:58.717 --> 00:17:02.287
MANDIBOR: It's about to get really ugly in here.

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:05.491
EXOSTRIKER: So don't beg for mercy.

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:10.329
COREDEGON: Integrate, Mechtavius Destroyer!

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:19.805
[heavy ground impact]

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:23.509
DAN: They combined!

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:25.878
DRAGO: Yes, but it's a fusion unlike anything...

00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:27.579
I've ever seen before.

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:29.848
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: You're about to learn first hand...

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:33.419
what it's like to get crushed by the ultimate battling machine!

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.121
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:38.791
DAN: Oooomph [grunt, exertion reax]

00:17:38.824 --> 00:17:40.025
DRAGO: Dan!

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.660
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: We may have broken the chains...

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:44.763
from our creator Bakugan, but we will never be truly free...

00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:47.466
until we destroy every last living Bakugan.

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:49.201
DRAGO: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:51.503
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Their extinction at our hands...

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:53.472
will give rise to the new age of the Mechtogan!

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:54.773
Haaaaaaah!

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:55.941
DRAGO: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:57.976
DRAGO: Ooooommmpphhh!

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:02.081
DAN: [groan] So that's your evil plan, is it?

00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:04.049
CROWD BAKUGAN: Get up, Dan!

00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:05.317
DAN: [gasp]

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.752
CROWD BAKUGAN: You can do it, Drago!

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:08.287
JULIE: Go Drago! Go Dan!

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.355
CROWD: Go Drago! Go Dan!

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:17.729
DAN: Don't worry I just needed a minute to catch my breath...

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:20.532
before getting back to thrashing these clowns.

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:22.134
DAN: Ready pal?

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:24.536
DRAGO: Yes. Let's do this!

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.773
DAN: [rising mighty roar] DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:35.781
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: What? How was he able...

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:38.884
to generate a Mechtogan Destroyer?

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:42.120
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: I am Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:43.222
SHUN: That's a...

00:18:43.255 --> 00:18:47.025
MARUCHO: ...Mechtogan Destroyer.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.360
DRAGO: Welcome.

00:18:48.393 --> 00:18:50.229
DAN: You're just in time for the fun stuff!

00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:52.631
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: It makes no difference at this point.

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:55.300
He'll fall just as hard as the rest of you!

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:56.969
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Hop in, Drago!

00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:58.437
DAN: What did he say?

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.839
DRAGO: Looks like we're going for a ride.

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:02.508
DRAGONOID DETROYER: Hurry!

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:03.509
DAN: [grunt]

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:05.477
DRAGO: Let's go!

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.682
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Activate!

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:13.652
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Attaaaaaaack!

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:15.387
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: [grunt, pain reax]

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.822
DAN: Nice one!

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.590
DRAGO: Impressive power!

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:20.893
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: You and I are now one, Drago.

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:23.862
Let's continue the attack, shall we?

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:26.098
DRAGO: You said it! Let's go!

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.299
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: I'm going to make you...

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:29.968
sorry for doing that!

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:31.570
DRAGO: Defense!

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:38.010
DAN: Look! There!

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:40.178
DRAGO: You heard the man. Go get him!

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:42.180
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: As you wish!

00:19:43.215 --> 00:19:45.184
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: I've had enough of you!

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:50.389
MECHATVIUS DESTROYER: Time to end this!

00:19:50.422 --> 00:19:52.391
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Brace yourselves!

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.863
DAN: Ha ha, nice reflexes, buddy!

00:19:57.896 --> 00:19:59.932
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Just doing my job.

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:04.002
DRAGO: I can feel our connection, becoming stronger.

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.205
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: I feel the surge too!

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:08.340
DAN: Drago! Nooooooow!

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:10.409
DRAGO: Atttaaaaack!

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:11.643
DRAGONOID DESTROYER: Haaaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:13.679
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Aaaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:18.517
SLYCERAK: This isn't over!

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.286
EXOSTRIKER: You haven't seen the last of us!

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:25.824
MANDIBOR: We'll be back for you!

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:29.061
COREDEGON: And when we are, we'll show you pain...

00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:32.264
unlike anything the universe has ever seen!

00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:36.368
So enjoy your final fleeting moments of life!

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:41.907
DAN: Catch you later, suckers!

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.175
CROWD: They did it! Way to go!

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:44.710
JULIE and MIRA: Yeeeeeah!

00:20:44.743 --> 00:20:46.245
SHUN: You pulled it off!

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:48.280
JAAKOR: That was pretty impressive, Drago!

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:50.916
RADIZEN: Dragonoid Destroyer is one scary dude!

00:20:50.949 --> 00:20:52.584
I wouldn't want to fight him!

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:55.621
MARUCHO: Yeah, but I can't stop wondering who those other...

00:20:55.654 --> 00:20:58.457
evil Mechtogan were and whether we'll ever see them again.

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:04.529
[sinister chuckle]

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:10.502
DAN: Just when we thought thing s couldn't be better on Earth,

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.404
our peaceful existence was shattered.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.539
A bunch of mysterious Mechtogan showed up

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:17.109
and said they wanted to destroy every last living Bakugan!

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:19.578
But who were they? And where did they come from?

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:21.880
Before we could answer, a weird dude in a mask

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:24.916
calling himself Wiseman appeared and he had eight evil Bakugan

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.519
with him! All of a sudden we found ourselves surrounded by

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:29.821
enemies again. So we did what we always do,

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:32.491
we put up a wicked fight. You gotta tune in to see

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:34.860
the craziness for yourself! I'm telling you guys

00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:36.962
it's unbelievable!
