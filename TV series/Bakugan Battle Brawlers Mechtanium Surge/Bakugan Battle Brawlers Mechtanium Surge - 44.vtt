WEBVTT

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.441
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.909
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.344
But then, out of nowhere,

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.746
we were invaded by these mysterious

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.180
and evil Mechtogan

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.149
who were intent on destroying everything!

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.718
Coredegon, Slycerak,

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.787
Exostriker, and Mandibor were their names,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.523
and leading them was this clown Wiseman.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:24.858
They also had help from an evil pack

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.359
of Bakugan called the Nonets.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:27.961
Luckily for us, he had our own secret weapon

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:31.331
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer, so we fought back,

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.299
because no one is gonna take our freedom,

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.502
not now, not ever!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.804
\u266a What are you gonna do?

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:41.608
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.044
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.946
\u266a Got to give it your all

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.883
\u266a This is the final stand

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.451
\u266a The power's in your hand

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.921
\u266a Two worlds collide on the inside \u266a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.226
\u266a You got to fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.929
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.597
\u266a This is Bakugan

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:07.834
If we don't stop him,

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.769
it could mean the total destruction of Earth.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:13.473
You filthy human and Bakugan swine!

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.576
We must hurry! Time is of the essence.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.047
MECHTAVIUS: Behold the terrifying might of my powers!

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.317
(Roaring)

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.561
(Laughing)

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:41.968
DAN: The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"Blast From the Past.\"

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.977
DAN: What're you talking about?!

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.513
What do you mean Bakugan City is gone?

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.082
WORTON: We Bakugan share a collective energy.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:59.352
I just felt a tremendous loss in this energy,

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.721
like several Bakugan have just disappeared.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.256
But a whole city disappearing?

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.924
That sounds a bit extreme.

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.894
What it really sounds like to me,

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:10.864
is something that Mechtavius Destroyer would do.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:13.833
Gunz, are you sure?

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.236
Although Bakugan City's fate is worrying,

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.537
I think we need to be concerned

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.239
about what he's going to do next.

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:22.642
Mechtavius Destroyer is intent on annihilating all Bakugan,

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.277
which suggests only one thing...

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.813
He's heading for New Vestroia.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:27.914
We have to stop him!

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.282
RADIZEN: We gotta take that creep down!

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.584
JAAKOR: What are we waiting for?

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:51.571
So this is where those pathetic creatures call home.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:55.208
New Vestroia is every bit as unimpressive

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.610
as the Bakugan who inhabit it.

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:03.016
Huh? What's this?

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.685
We got a distress signal from our brothers on Earth!

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.487
So we knew your ugly face was heading this way!

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.722
(Chuckling)

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.430
Hilarious! Does this guy think

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:18.798
just because he's a giant gorilla,

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.433
we're going to run away scared?

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.302
He doesn't look like much to me!

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:25.305
Then, why don't you come closer?

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:28.474
And I'll show you just how big a deal I am!

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:29.676
AMAZON: You heard the creep!

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.311
ELFIN: Let's do this, guys!

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:42.455
AMAZON: How do you like this, pal? Sting a little bit?

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.524
Well, there's lots more where that came from!

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:52.432
Whoa-whoa! What? Watch out, guys! Take cover!

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:57.337
(Groaning)

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.606
(Screaming)

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.408
(Groaning)

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:07.080
Oh no! This is bad!

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:09.182
Did you think your miniscule powers

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:11.384
would have had any effect against my might?

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.286
But I haven't shown you my favourite move yet!

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.722
Amazon Aquos Bomber!

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:26.132
Uh-oh! (Groaning)

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.735
Amazon! You're gonna pay for that!

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.070
Elfin! Don't do it!

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.473
Here's a little drop kick! Yah!

00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:36.876
I should have silenced you first!

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.211
Hi-yah!

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:39.646
(Whimpering)

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:43.616
(Screaming) I'm sorry, Preyas!

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.852
(Screaming)

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:48.621
Elfin! Oh no.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.690
(Whimpering) Oh no.

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:52.625
Your sentimentality makes me shake!

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.662
It's worthless in battle.

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:58.931
Slash Rise Thunder!

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:01.768
What?

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:05.972
Huh? Taylean! Ingram! Skyress!

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:07.440
How dare you show up and think

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.976
that you can destroy our home and bring chaos to our lives?

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:11.177
We are peaceful,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.445
but you're about to get a taste of our fury!

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.013
This ought to be amusing.

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:16.149
Show me what you've got, fools!

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:18.284
Smile for the cannons! Ha-ha!

00:05:19.652 --> 00:05:21.554
RADIZEN: Guys, if New Vestroia's in danger,

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:24.323
then why the heck are we still standing around here yakking?

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:27.026
We've gotta do something to help out before it's too late!

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.428
(Speaking gibberish)

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:30.096
Why are you arguing with me? You see?

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.631
This is what I'm talking about!

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.399
It shouldn't even be a discussion!

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.601
We should just go now, time is wasting!

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:36.969
Radizen, have you forgotten

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.805
that we're in the deepest part of the Doom Dimension?

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.207
If Drago couldn't teleport us out of here and back to Earth,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.576
what makes you think we could get back to New Vestroia?

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.119
Oh, right. I forgot what an epic fail that was.

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:55.488
Aw man, what the heck are we going to do?

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:58.357
There is another possibility.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:06:01.194
We could ride the Current of Time.

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:03.296
DAN: Are you serious?

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.433
Slash Hyper - Sword Storm!

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:11.804
I'm going to crush you!

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:13.606
Armoured Intense Mode!

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:18.845
Now you're really starting to make me mad!

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.616
You're making it worse for yourselves!

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:26.586
And Glimmering Shadow Slash!

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:29.255
That's it! Stay on him!

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:31.624
Shooting Destruction Slash!

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:41.834
(Groaning)

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:46.272
This should finish him off! Blue Whirlwind!

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:49.375
(Groaning)

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:50.843
That should do it.

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:52.245
Yes! He's finished!

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.183
Hold on a second.

00:06:58.684 --> 00:07:00.153
I don't believe it!

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.554
Is he invincible?

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:04.223
Your determination is almost admirable,

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.559
if it weren't for your arrogance!

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:09.128
How dare you presume to be a threat to me!

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:12.598
(Groaning)

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:16.002
(Groaning)

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:18.805
(Screeching)

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:20.006
It might not be us,

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.774
but someone's going to take you down!

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:24.710
(Wailing)

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:26.679
This is so much fun!

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.381
I might actually be sad

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:31.951
once I've destroyed every last one of you!

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.991
Check it out - the Current of Time.

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:41.494
It's a vortex where the present and the past collide

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:43.863
and create a spiral in the time-space continuum.

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:45.598
WORTON: Up until a short while ago,

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.300
I thought this place was only a myth.

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.402
When I came back to the Doom Dimension,

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:51.070
I found myself wandering around

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:53.372
and stumbled upon it quite by accident.

00:07:53.406 --> 00:07:55.408
Whoa!

00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:59.645
I just kept falling and falling, until suddenly I found myself

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:02.348
back in Wiseman's hideout on volcano island.

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:05.084
At first, I had thought I just landed back in the hideout,

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:07.019
but then I heard something familiar

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:09.889
that made me feel like I was experiencing Deja-vu.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:11.757
BALISTA: Worton!

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.226
I saw Balista, which seemed impossible!

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:15.628
Coredegon had already destroyed him,

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:19.665
so either I was dreaming or somehow I had gone back in time.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:21.200
That's when I realized

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:24.604
I must've travelled on the Current of Time.

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:27.874
There is something that I need to talk to you about.

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.208
Is it Wiseman?

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:34.113
Once again, you amaze with how all-seeing you are.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:35.581
WORTON: And doubts that I had were obliterated

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:37.183
when I saw myself talking to Balista

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:40.319
about how he found a Wiseman double hidden in the cave.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.687
Who could it have been?

00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:43.623
Perhaps it was this Gunz character

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:45.491
that the Brawlers were always speaking of.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.760
But if so, where did he come from,

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.896
and why did he look identical?

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:52.531
Trust me, Balista. It's better that you forget what you saw.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:53.532
What?

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.067
Just for now.

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:57.236
We need to keep our eyes on the main target.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.505
We can revisit this at another time.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.307
Understood?

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.009
Wait a second!

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:06.279
WORTON: Immediately, I thought that I had to somehow stop Balista

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.147
from following the same path.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.518
By changing the past, I might just save his life.

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.694
That was close. I have to find Balista... fast.

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:24.797
(Yelping)

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.033
I didn't have enough energy to stay there on my own,

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:29.335
but I think we need to try and get on the Current of Time

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:30.803
and ride it back to the past!

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:32.271
BETADRON: Agreed.

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:34.073
DRAGO: But if you didn't have enough energy to stay there,

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:35.641
how can we make the leap permanently?

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:39.245
I was just one Bakugan alone who had stumbled upon

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:41.147
the Current of Time purely by accident.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.583
If we all focus our minds and our energy

00:09:43.616 --> 00:09:45.117
and make another attempt together...

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:47.019
Our collective energy might be strong enough

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:49.522
to transport us back to the real world for good.

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:52.158
It'll be in the past, but we'll have escaped from this place.

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:53.159
DAN: What?

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.627
MARUCHO: I say it's worth a shot!

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.295
WORTON: I must warn you

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:58.531
that there is some danger involved.

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:00.032
There is no way to guarantee

00:10:00.066 --> 00:10:02.702
exactly where we will land in the past.

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:04.603
BETADRON: Since when have you been unable

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:07.406
to predict such things without certainty, Professor?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.343
The incredible energy created by the Current of Time

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:12.111
coupled with the ripples it makes

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:13.512
in the space-time continuum

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:15.348
cause too much interference

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:17.416
and block my psychic abilities.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.485
We will go in blind, but I don't think we have a choice.

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:21.387
DAN: That's good enough for me, Worton.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.622
You need out of here as badly as we do,

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:25.091
so we trust your opinion.

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:28.494
DRAGO: We're in this together, Professor.

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:30.062
Very well then.

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:31.564
Betadron?

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:33.332
Yeah, yeah. I'm with you!

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:36.168
Trust me, I want to get out of here so I can take down

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:39.038
Mechtavius Destroyer for all he's done to the Nonets!

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:40.272
Understood.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.041
Okay, let's go!

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:51.484
WORTON: Stick together, everyone, and we'll get back home!

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.588
DAN: Keep it together, guys,

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:57.456
and we'll take down Mechtavius Destroyer!

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.459
(Roaring)

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:15.541
\u266a

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:22.114
(Laughing)

00:11:22.148 --> 00:11:23.883
Huh?

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:27.386
This is the end of the line for you, Mechtogan Scum.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.855
You're about to be schooled by both of us!

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:32.658
Well, I hope you prove to be more of a challenge

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:35.628
than those who have already fallen!

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:37.897
AEROGAN: Keep talking, creep, you're the one who's going to fall next!

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.665
Whoa!

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:43.069
I doubt you can shoot as high as I can jump!

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:44.770
Don't bet on it!

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:49.608
Velocity Fang! Yah!

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:52.011
(Groaning)

00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:55.948
Nice one! How about a little Lightning Smasher for desert?

00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:58.951
Oh no!

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:01.887
(Groaning)

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:04.657
We did it, mistress! Wait a second.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.925
(Laughing)

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.493
No way!

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:11.130
What's wrong, boy? You seem so surprised!

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.934
Hi-yah!

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:16.535
Aerogan!

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.804
Hold on, Mistress, I'll hit him from up high again!

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:23.776
I gotta play this right.

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:26.846
Just hold on and look for his blind spot, then attack!

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:29.915
I see you, fool!

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:31.383
Aw snap!

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:34.587
(Screaming)

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.791
Aerogan! You're gonna pay for that!

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:42.394
(Roaring)

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:45.798
I'm gonna make you hurt!

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:49.568
Volting Fang! (Roaring)

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.571
(Groaning)

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:56.175
Got ya!

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.446
I will never be taken down by a Bakugan!

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:03.115
Do you understand?

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:09.221
You should be thankful that your destruction

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:13.259
comes at the hands of one as mighty as me!

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.628
(Groaning)

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:22.835
The time of the Bakugan is over!

00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:26.238
(Laughing)

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:37.616
That's it, guys! Keep the formation tight!

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:40.753
Whoa! Are you okay Gunz?

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:44.790
Yeah, thanks, pal. That was a really huge bump.

00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:47.660
Hold on, guys. The Current is getting stronger.

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:48.727
DAN: Hey, look!

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:49.795
What?

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:58.003
Ability Activate!

00:13:58.037 --> 00:13:59.772
Dragon Crasher!

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:03.809
(Roaring)

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:08.147
See that?

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.084
That's back when we battled in the V1 Climax round!

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:16.121
BOTH: Whoa.

00:14:16.155 --> 00:14:18.290
You're mine now!

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:20.359
SHUN: His focus is good but not perfect.

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:23.362
Who are you calling old?!

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.396
What?

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:28.801
Do you remember that, Shun?

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:30.369
I do.

00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:32.738
It's when we were first training in the mountains, Jaakor.

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:34.206
(Speaking gibberish)

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.843
(Yelping)

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:48.554
Check it out!

00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:51.657
That was the day you and Roxtor first combined in battle!

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.459
Uh, yeah.

00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:55.427
It wasn't my most graceful moment.

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.896
Good thing we've got our combo moves down to a science now.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.432
That was so embarrassing.

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:01.834
(Speaking gibberish)

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:03.802
What are you talking about 'I'm the clumsy one'?

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:05.838
The reason that happened is because you tripped me up!

00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:07.773
Do we need to watch another instant replay

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:08.907
to refresh your memory?

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:10.409
If we're all done pointing fingers,

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:12.244
could we get back to the task at hand, please?

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:17.616
Ability Activate!

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.485
Spar Hook!

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:21.854
Attack!

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:23.689
(Grunting)

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:30.729
(Crowd cheering)

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:38.304
Why are we seeing these visions?

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:41.140
WORTON: They are the manifestations of our most powerful memories.

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:43.142
The Current is picking up on our mental energy

00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:44.376
and using them as markers

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.211
while it tries to pick a destination point.

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:50.716
Well, I don't want it picking my brain!

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.518
Oh, no, no, no!

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.753
(Screaming)

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:58.857
Destroy... him...

00:15:58.891 --> 00:15:59.992
Go down, you!

00:16:00.025 --> 00:16:02.394
(Screaming)

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:06.665
Ahh...

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.600
(Screaming)

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:14.006
BETADRON: He took down our brothers!

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:15.541
(Screaming)

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:19.578
(Roaring)

00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:22.514
I lived through this once! I don't want to see it again!

00:16:22.548 --> 00:16:26.518
(Mechtavius laughing)

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:32.658
(Laughing)

00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:37.296
(Laughing)

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:39.131
Lousy scum!

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:42.101
I'm going to make you pay!

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:45.070
I want to crush him. I want to crush him bad!

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:47.339
Betadron, calm down!

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:49.341
This is ramping up.

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.076
Stay sharp you guys, okay?

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:01.887
(Screaming)

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:10.829
What just happened?

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:14.666
WORTON: This is where the current of Time decided to deposit us.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.802
It's somewhere back in the past

00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:19.805
that we all have a connection to.

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:21.006
Huh?

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.575
Look! The statue!

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.314
This is Bakugan City.

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:30.783
GUNZ: Impossible!

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:32.918
MARUCHO: Worton was right about it disappearing.

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.353
SHUN: Well, almost right.

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:37.122
Bakugan City didn't so much disappear as it was destroyed,

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:38.690
along with everyone in it!

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:42.528
And we were helpless to stop it from happening!

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.272
DRAGO: New Vestroia! Oh no!

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:56.241
Are we too late to save it as well?

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:58.911
All of our brothers and sisters are gone.

00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:00.546
Uh-huh.

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:02.648
ORBEUM: Is there nothing we can do?

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:05.551
Unfortunately, no. Whoa!

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.392
\u266a

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:19.131
DRAGO: The Current of Time has brought us back to it for a reason.

00:18:19.164 --> 00:18:21.700
Maybe it showed us those horrible things as a warning.

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:22.968
Maybe there still is hope.

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.870
There has to be!

00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:27.539
We can't let Mechtavius Destroyer get away with this!

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:30.242
The Current of Time has given us a gift here.

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:32.177
It has shown us the horrible truth of the future,

00:18:32.211 --> 00:18:35.581
and now is giving us an opportunity to make things right

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:37.683
and save all those who have been lost.

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:39.284
We must take advantage of this!

00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:41.420
You bet, Professor!

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:44.056
It's time to rewrite history everyone!

00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:45.991
Yes! Let's do it!

00:18:46.024 --> 00:18:48.994
Okay, Professor, now that they have a plan,

00:18:49.027 --> 00:18:53.232
we need to guarantee these guys get off at the right stop!

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.267
(Grunting)

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.802
What are you doing?

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:02.441
Betadron! Worton!

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:05.043
With our combined energy,

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:07.479
we can temporarily stop the Current of Time

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:10.415
at the spot in history where you need to get off!

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:11.617
Betadron is right.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.386
You mustn't hesitate for even a second!

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:17.289
But what will happen to the two of you if you get left behind?

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:18.524
It's too risky!

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:20.959
Hands off! You can't talk us out of this!

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.361
But--

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:23.762
No buts!

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:27.065
I have never loathed anybody as I have Mechtavius Destroyer!

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:30.102
So, if taking him down means sacrificing myself,

00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:31.870
then that's the way it has to be!

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:34.573
Just make sure you don't let me down!

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:37.843
Finish him for good! Do you understand, Drago?

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:40.279
It's okay.

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:42.848
Good luck, my friend.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.824
Right there!

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:55.294
I think that's where we need to get off, you guys!

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:56.528
Let's do it!

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:03.268
MARUCHO: The portal is closing!

00:20:03.302 --> 00:20:04.836
RADIZEN: Time to giddy up, you guys!

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.238
We might not make it,

00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:09.241
but we still have to go for it, everyone!

00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:10.943
ALL: Right!

00:20:10.976 --> 00:20:13.679
You heard the man, failure is not an option here, guys!

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:16.915
BAKUGAN: Right.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:19.685
Ability Activate!

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:27.459
Dragon Eternal Force!

00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:31.063
(Roaring)

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:36.935
MECHTAVIUS: Finally, I am rid of all the vermin

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:39.071
who have stood in the way of my master plan.

00:20:39.104 --> 00:20:42.007
Now I can get on with the business

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.777
of destroying Bakugan City and all of those who inhabit it!

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:47.079
(Roaring)

00:20:47.112 --> 00:20:48.180
(Laughing)

00:20:48.213 --> 00:20:50.048
What?!

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:54.019
Where did you miserable insects come from?!

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:56.955
We've come back from the future to stop you in your tracks!

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:59.291
Your days of destruction are over!

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:01.526
We're gonna wipe you from the history books!

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:10.836
DAN: After we saw the complete annihilation of Bakugan City

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:13.572
and New Vestroia by Mechtavius Destroyer,

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.641
we thought everything was over.

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:17.409
But then, Professor Worton figured out a way

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.144
to go back in time, so we could try and keep it from happening.

00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:20.479
Luckily for us, Mira and Julie

00:21:20.512 --> 00:21:21.713
were around this time this time to help out

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:23.949
and they totally had our backs.

00:21:23.982 --> 00:21:25.050
Dragonoid Destroyer also came out to battle,

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.318
but for some reason,

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.819
he still wasn't fighting at 100%

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:29.354
I know it sounds really nuts,

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:32.190
but you should tune in to see us completely rewrite history.

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:34.226
We've learned from our past mistakes, so this time,

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:37.963
our battle moves are gonna be perfect!

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:49.007
