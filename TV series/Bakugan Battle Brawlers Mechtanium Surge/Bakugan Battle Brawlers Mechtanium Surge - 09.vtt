WEBVTT

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:08.624
DAN: It's been over a year since we defeated Gundalia

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:10.893
in the battle for Neathia and the Sacred Orb.

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:13.162
Once we returned to Earth and rebuilt a mega

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:15.465
Bakugan Interspace the number of people accessing it

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:17.734
from around the world totally exploded!

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.669
Of course Drago and I are back in action,

00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:23.006
along with our pals Marucho and his new partner Tristar;

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.175
and Shun who's rockin' the Battle Arena with Taylean.

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:28.211
The flood of new Battlers means we're up against

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:30.446
some crazy serious competition now!

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.316
This is Bakugan battling like you've never seen before...

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:35.518
... but we're in it to win it!

00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:38.488
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.791
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.824 --> 00:00:45.094
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.297
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:51.467
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The powers in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:57.507
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.343
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:03.179
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.212 --> 00:01:09.952
\u266a This is BAKUGAN! \u266a

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.587
RAZENOID: [mighty roar]

00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:13.823
DRAGO: Aaaaaarrrrggggghhhh!

00:01:13.856 --> 00:01:16.659
AMAZON: Aquos Bomber!

00:01:16.692 --> 00:01:18.561
AMAZON: Haaaaaaaaaaaah!

00:01:18.594 --> 00:01:19.762
DRAGO: [grunt, pain reax]

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:21.731
DAN: Drago! Whoooooaaaa!

00:01:21.764 --> 00:01:24.534
AMAZON: Get up. I'm not done with you yet!

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:27.770
DAN: [groan] Drago.

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:30.039
DRAGO: [groan] Don't worry.

00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:33.342
I'm good.

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:39.882
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:43.419
DRAGO: Ooooomph!

00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:45.455
DAN: I don't know!

00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:48.524
DAN: I don't know anything, anymore.

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:50.593
DRAGO: If only I was faking,

00:01:50.626 --> 00:01:53.629
that kid put me down really hard.

00:01:56.866 --> 00:02:02.472
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Chaos Control

00:02:06.886 --> 00:02:09.288
ANUBIAS: Is it true you've found them, Master Mag Mel?

00:02:09.322 --> 00:02:12.558
MAG MEL : Yes. They are in New Vestroia,

00:02:12.592 --> 00:02:15.561
the birthplace of all Bakugan.

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:19.131
ANUBIAS: In New Vestroia?

00:02:19.165 --> 00:02:29.208
Well that never even occurred to me.

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:34.413
Well that never even occurred to me.

00:02:34.447 --> 00:02:41.420
[shell cracking]

00:02:41.454 --> 00:02:44.090
[explosion]

00:02:44.123 --> 00:02:48.861
MAG MEL: I gift to you this new Chaos Bakugan

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:50.830
and a new Mechtogan.

00:02:50.863 --> 00:02:53.799
MAG MEL: Take this new pair as your battling partners.

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.501
Go now to New Vestroia...

00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:57.570
MAG MEL: Find Dan and Drago ...

00:02:57.603 --> 00:03:01.240
... and bring them both to me!

00:03:01.274 --> 00:03:04.777
ANUBIAS: It will be my honour and pleasure, sir.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.046
MAG MEL: Do not fail me, Anubias.

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.285
MAG MEL: [evil chuckle]

00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:17.423
ANUBIAS: I'm coming for you, Kuso and your buddy Drago!

00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:23.095
[finger snap]

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.567
[laughter]

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.634
DRAGO: Hmmmmph!

00:03:28.668 --> 00:03:30.636
Haaaaaaah!

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.839
Huuuuuuaah!

00:03:33.873 --> 00:03:40.246
DRAGO: [panting, exertion reax]

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.549
DRAGO: I think we should train separately for a while.

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:45.818
DAN: What the heck are you talking about?

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.486
DAN: Why would we do that?

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.055
We're a team, dude.

00:03:49.088 --> 00:03:51.524
DRAGO: Perhaps that's where the problem lies.

00:03:51.557 --> 00:03:53.826
Before we're able to fight effectively as a team,

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.964
we need to re-examine who we are as individuals.

00:03:57.997 --> 00:04:01.033
DAN: That's crazy talk man. We just have to have to ...

00:04:01.067 --> 00:04:03.035
DRAGO: I need to be alone!

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.971
DRAGO: I'm in bad shape, Dan.

00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:07.707
I'm no good to anyone like this.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.210
DAN: Okay ...

00:04:11.243 --> 00:04:13.045
I guess ...

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.184
DRAGO: [sigh]

00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:21.854
DAN: [grunt, exertion reax] Drago!

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:25.725
DAN: Come back Drago!

00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:28.995
DRAGO: I'm sorry Dan.

00:04:29.028 --> 00:04:30.496
DRAGO: Dragon String!

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:32.265
DRAGO: Haaaaaaah!

00:04:32.298 --> 00:04:34.467
Huuuuuuaaah!

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.969
DRAGO: Dragon Blazer!

00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:40.306
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:43.075
DRAGO: Dragon Force Striker!

00:04:43.109 --> 00:04:46.479
DRAGO: Aarrgh!

00:04:46.512 --> 00:04:50.650
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:04:50.683 --> 00:04:52.918
DRAGO: I have to stop being afraid,

00:04:52.952 --> 00:04:56.022
of these blasted ghosts inside my head.

00:04:56.055 --> 00:04:59.025
Lack of focus is why I'm losing control.

00:04:59.058 --> 00:05:02.328
DRAGO: It's pathetic! [growl]

00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:06.232
PREYAS: Hey um, sorry to interrupt old friend but ah ...

00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:09.135
DRAGO: [gasp] Huh?

00:05:09.168 --> 00:05:10.569
DRAGO: Preyas?

00:05:10.603 --> 00:05:13.039
PREYAS: [laughter] I don't 'spose

00:05:13.072 --> 00:05:16.609
you've seen Amazon around, huh?

00:05:16.642 --> 00:05:21.280
[stone plopping in water]

00:05:21.313 --> 00:05:23.182
DAN: I wish I knew what I could say or do,

00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:28.287
to help Drago get past all of this.

00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:31.691
DAN: Aw man! [grunt]

00:05:31.724 --> 00:05:35.328
What kind of a partner am I?

00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:36.796
DAN: Huh?

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:37.797
What the?

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.932
Whoa!

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:41.534
DAN: [gasp]

00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:44.470
AMAZON: I'm back for more, boys. Where's Drago?

00:05:44.503 --> 00:05:46.939
Let's have a real battle this time.

00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:50.609
DAN: Huh?

00:05:50.643 --> 00:05:53.012
AMAZON: Uh ... are you alone?

00:05:53.045 --> 00:05:55.147
PREYAS: Well, I told the kid

00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:56.649
I thought you were holding back.

00:05:56.682 --> 00:05:58.417
That you would've smoked him if you'd gone all out.

00:05:58.451 --> 00:06:00.319
He got upset and said he wanted a rematch.

00:06:00.352 --> 00:06:02.254
Then he just got up and took off.

00:06:02.288 --> 00:06:04.457
DRAGO: I'm sorry, Preyas.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.227
There's a lot going on that you don't know about.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.463
DRAGO: It's complicated.

00:06:10.496 --> 00:06:13.499
PREYAS: [sigh] It's okay, Drago.

00:06:13.532 --> 00:06:14.934
You don't have to tell me anything

00:06:14.967 --> 00:06:16.602
unless you don't want to.

00:06:16.635 --> 00:06:18.404
We're still buddies.

00:06:18.437 --> 00:06:22.174
Awww, where is Amazon?

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:24.310
AMAZON: What d'ya mean he's afraid of losing control?

00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:25.778
AMAZON: That has to be the most ridiculous thing

00:06:25.811 --> 00:06:27.580
I've ever heard! [giggle]

00:06:27.613 --> 00:06:29.348
DAN: What does that mean, dude?

00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:31.650
AMAZON: Having that much power would be awesome!

00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:33.352
How could anyone be afraid of it?

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:35.955
If it were me, I'd let it all go! Wouldn't you?

00:06:35.988 --> 00:06:38.591
DAN: You don't understand ...

00:06:38.624 --> 00:06:41.060
AMAZON: What's to understand? He's afraid of his powers,

00:06:41.093 --> 00:06:43.829
which meant he chickened out and let me win our battle.

00:06:43.863 --> 00:06:46.365
He treated me like a chump. That's not cool, dude!

00:06:46.398 --> 00:06:49.668
Bakugan are supposed to embrace power, not fear it.

00:06:49.702 --> 00:06:51.670
AMAZON: I thought Drago was supposed to be

00:06:51.704 --> 00:06:53.339
the baddest Bakugan that ever was.

00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:54.774
That might have been true once,

00:06:54.807 --> 00:06:56.408
but it's ancient history now.

00:06:56.442 --> 00:06:59.044
AMAZON: Drago is just a washed up coward.

00:06:59.078 --> 00:07:00.646
DAN: Watch it!

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:01.847
You don't know what you're talking about, punk!

00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:03.149
AMAZON: Huh?

00:07:03.182 --> 00:07:04.683
DAN: Drago's no coward!

00:07:04.717 --> 00:07:06.085
He's just smart enough to know that with great power

00:07:06.118 --> 00:07:07.286
comes great responsibility!

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:09.822
But you wouldn't understand that.

00:07:09.855 --> 00:07:16.529
Nobody does.

00:07:16.562 --> 00:07:22.067
[mighty roar]

00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:28.174
DAN: Drago is doing ... what's best.

00:07:28.207 --> 00:07:32.344
AMAZON: Huh? How do you mean?

00:07:32.378 --> 00:07:34.013
DAN: [gasp]

00:07:34.046 --> 00:07:38.584
AMAZON: What's happening? I feel kinda weird.

00:07:38.617 --> 00:07:41.453
DAN: It's a ripple in the dimension.

00:07:41.487 --> 00:07:48.594
Someone must've just teleported here.

00:07:48.627 --> 00:07:51.297
DAN: [gasp] Drago!

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:55.467
DRAGO: Huh? PREYAS: Huh?

00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:58.237
ANUBIAS: So this is New Vestroia, huh?

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.841
It seems like a perfect habitat for losers.

00:08:01.874 --> 00:08:03.309
DRAGO: Who are you?

00:08:03.342 --> 00:08:05.744
ANUBIAS: You can think of me as a messenger.

00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:07.246
DRAGO: What?

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:10.082
ANUBIAS: I don't see Kuso anywhere. No matter.

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:14.386
I'll have fun with Drago in the meantime.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.988
ANUBIAS: Let's skip the introductions.

00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:17.957
There will be time for that later!

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:24.463
Right now we battle!

00:08:24.496 --> 00:08:26.499
[loud growl]

00:08:26.532 --> 00:08:28.200
DRAGO: Huh? What is that?

00:08:28.234 --> 00:08:30.569
PREYAS: I've never seen a Bakugan like that before!

00:08:30.603 --> 00:08:32.504
ANUBIAS: Go Darkus Iron Dragonoid!

00:08:32.538 --> 00:08:33.706
Ability Activate!

00:08:33.739 --> 00:08:35.040
Olin Terror!

00:08:35.074 --> 00:08:39.478
DRAGO: Watch out! PREYAS: Whoa!

00:08:39.511 --> 00:08:41.647
DRAGO: Uh oh!

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.781
PREYAS: Oh no Drago!

00:08:42.815 --> 00:08:44.850
DRAGO: [grunt, pain reax]

00:08:44.884 --> 00:08:46.752
ANUBIAS: Don't just lay there. Get up!

00:08:46.785 --> 00:08:48.420
Come on and fight!

00:08:48.454 --> 00:08:50.322
DRAGO: [groan] [grunt]

00:08:50.356 --> 00:08:52.024
PREYAS: Hold on a second pal!

00:08:52.057 --> 00:08:53.292
ANUBIAS: [gasp]

00:08:53.325 --> 00:08:54.527
DRAGO: Preyas?

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.663
PREYAS: If you wanna fight how 'bout you take me on then?

00:08:57.696 --> 00:09:05.704
ANUBIAS: Let's go!

00:09:06.705 --> 00:09:11.477

00:18:20.826 --> 00:18:23.161
AMAZON: No kidding. I hope he smoke's that turkey!

00:18:23.195 --> 00:18:26.498
ANUBIAS: How did Drago win over his Mechtogan?

00:18:26.531 --> 00:18:29.101
ANUBIAS: Who do you think you are?

00:18:29.134 --> 00:18:31.803
ANUBIAS: You're not going to make a fool out of me!

00:18:31.837 --> 00:18:33.905
Ability activate!

00:18:33.939 --> 00:18:36.808
ANUBIAS: Ocelot!

00:18:36.842 --> 00:18:39.544
DAN: [angry grunt] Ability activate!

00:18:39.578 --> 00:18:41.913
DAN: Titanium Screen!

00:18:41.947 --> 00:18:43.148
DRAGO: Hmmmmph!

00:18:43.181 --> 00:18:45.116
DAN: Ability activate!

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.954
Dragon Blazer!

00:18:48.987 --> 00:18:50.989
ANUBIAS: What are you squawking about?

00:18:51.022 --> 00:18:53.925
Stand up and fight back!

00:18:53.959 --> 00:18:55.360
Pathetic.

00:18:55.393 --> 00:18:59.164
Don't you dare shame me!

00:18:59.197 --> 00:19:00.499
ANUBIAS: [gasp] Huh?

00:19:00.532 --> 00:19:03.168
[metallic body hit]

00:19:03.201 --> 00:19:07.405
[crash impact]

00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:10.575
[laser pulsing]

00:19:10.609 --> 00:19:13.979
[electronic ringing]

00:19:14.012 --> 00:19:15.747
[mighty roar]

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.417
ANUBIAS: Venexus! Aaarrgh!

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:21.753
ANUBIAS: This can't be.

00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:24.689
I was given my Bakugan as a gift by Master Mag Mel.

00:19:24.723 --> 00:19:27.893
They ...They were supposed to bring us a victory!

00:19:27.926 --> 00:19:31.329
Ability activate!

00:19:31.363 --> 00:19:32.597
DRAGO: Now, Dan!

00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:34.266
DAN: You got it, pal.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.368
Ability activate!

00:19:36.401 --> 00:19:43.408
DAN: Dragon Force Striker!

00:19:43.441 --> 00:19:48.580
ANUBIAS: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:19:48.613 --> 00:19:51.816
AMAZON: Oh yeah! You really thrashed those guys!

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.653
AMAZON: [nervous chuckle] Easy there, big fella.

00:19:54.686 --> 00:19:57.289
I'm on your side, remember?

00:19:57.322 --> 00:19:59.090
DAN: We did it, pal.

00:19:59.124 --> 00:20:01.593
Together we're the best!

00:20:01.626 --> 00:20:04.563
DRAGO: I guess. [groan]

00:20:04.596 --> 00:20:07.732
DAN: Drago!

00:20:07.766 --> 00:20:12.504
AMAZON: [sigh] That was crazy intense, guys!

00:20:12.537 --> 00:20:14.439
AMAZON: But man are you two awesome

00:20:14.472 --> 00:20:16.007
when you battle together!

00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:17.876
PREYAS: Yeah, but it looks like there's still some kinks

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:19.544
to work out with the new powers.

00:20:19.578 --> 00:20:21.212
But don't worry, we'll help you

00:20:21.246 --> 00:20:24.249
'cos that's what friends are for!

00:20:24.282 --> 00:20:26.651
ANUBIAS: [angry grunt] Useless Chaos Bakugan!

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:32.490
ANUBIAS: [angry grunt] Dan Kuuuussssoooooo!

00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:35.393
RAZENOID: How did Drago break free from our clutches?

00:20:35.427 --> 00:20:37.529
[mighty angry roar]

00:20:37.562 --> 00:20:40.699
MAG MEL: It seems that Dan and Drago have both grown

00:20:40.732 --> 00:20:43.702
since returning to New Vestroia.

00:20:43.735 --> 00:20:45.670
Which means that ...

00:20:45.704 --> 00:20:48.273
... they have even more to offer me

00:20:48.306 --> 00:20:50.842
than I ever expected.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:21:03.955
MAG MEL: [crazed maniacal laughter]

00:21:07.792 --> 00:21:09.294
MARUCHO: Ever since he's taken the reigns

00:21:09.327 --> 00:21:10.695
as the leader of the Battle Brawlers,

00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:12.530
Shun has been battling non-stop.

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:14.332
It's like he's on some kind of mission

00:21:14.366 --> 00:21:16.301
to prove himself, but he has no reason to.

00:21:16.334 --> 00:21:18.370
He signed up to fight in the Battle Royal,

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:19.971
even though I told him not to.

00:21:20.005 --> 00:21:22.040
He needed a break after all the action he'd seen

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:23.675
but he wouldn't listen.

00:21:23.708 --> 00:21:25.877
As a result of that, Taylean suddenly created

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.078
his own Mechtogan.

00:21:27.112 --> 00:21:29.014
That's the last thing we needed!

00:21:29.047 --> 00:21:31.249
You have to tune in to see the chaos it caused.

00:21:31.283 --> 00:21:33.685
I'm telling you it was epic!

00:21:33.718 --> 00:21:37.055
I really hope Dan gets back here soon!
