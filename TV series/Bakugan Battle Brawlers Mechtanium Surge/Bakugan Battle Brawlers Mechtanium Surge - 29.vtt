00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:09.042
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well, after the Bakugan

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.378
came to live with us. But then out of nowhere,

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.313
we were invaded by these mysterious and evil

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:16.216
Mechtogan who were intent on destroying everything.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.484
Coredegon

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:18.518
Slycerak

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:19.652
Exostriker

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.221
and Mandibor were their names.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.256
And leading them was this clown Wiseman.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.258
DAN: They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.894
called the Nonets. Luckily for us, we had our own

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.663
secret weapon in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.899
So we fought back, because no one

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.435
is going to take our freedom! Not now, not ever!

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.405
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:41.708
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.878
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:48.148
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.351
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.321
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.093
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.062
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.398
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:10.470
[bird cry]

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:14.307
[crowd murmur]

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:22.315
DAN: Tell me did you find out anything more about the Nonets?

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.818
MIRA: I've been analyzing the data from the last battle...

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:26.719
repeatedly but it's all so cryptic,

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.688
I haven't been able to crack it yet.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.024
SHUN: I'm more concerned about that Wiseman guy.

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:33.993
DAN: Me too, all that crazy talk he was spewing...

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:37.130
about his ideal world was really freaking me out.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:40.366
MARUCHO: He clearly wants to do us harm but we need...

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.103
to figure out his plan before it's too late.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.772
DRAGO: What could it be?

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.440
RADIZEN: We need to figure this out.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.575
JAAKOR: Hummmm?

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:52.112
DAN: Well we can't just sit here.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.016
DAN: We have worked too hard for the peace we have right now,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.352
and I am not gonna give it all up!

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:02.021
DAN: We have to protect it at all costs, am I right?

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.022
DRAGO: Yes!

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.891
SHUN: Right!

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.192
MIRA: Reptak?

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.527
REPTAK: Hmmmm?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.697
MIRA: If you're up for it, we could sure use your help too.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.998
REPTAK: Really?

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.602
MIRA: Yes! Don't forget, you and Jaakor are the only ones...

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.438
compatible with Dragonoid Destroyer's Jumping Attack.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.573
So you're a crucial member of the team.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:23.109
MIRA: We've all discussed it and think it would be a good idea...

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:26.479
if you partner with Dan and Drago in all future battles.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:27.514
REPTAK: Uhhhh...

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:28.681
RADIZEN: What's wrong, Reptak?

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.717
Partnering with those two is a real honour.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.018
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:33.686
RADIZEN: That's what I just said, Roxtor!

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.755
Will you please quit repeating everything I say?

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.557
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.159
MARUCHO: Hey, take it easy.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.461
REPTAK: [sigh]

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:45.798
DRAGO: Reptak. What's your reluctance?

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.734
We must stay focused.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:50.503
REPTAK: I don't mean to be ungrateful guys,

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:55.008
it's just that I'm Gunz's partner Bakugan.

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.246
DAN: Really awwwk-ward.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.781
DRAGO: You can say that again.

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:03.082
ROXTOR: Kyukyukyu

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:05.118
RADIZEN: It's a figure of speech you numbskull!

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:13.626
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Mysterious Bond

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:26.339
\u266a [thoughtful music]

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:31.077
REPTAK: Gunz, is that you behind the mask?

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.212
DAN: Hey, there you are.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:33.313
REPTAK: Huh?

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.882
DAN: Why'd you take off like that, huh?

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:39.852
DAN: We were all pretty worried about you pal.

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:42.789
REPTAK: Sorry guys.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:44.657
DAN: Listen, we don't want to pressure you into...

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:47.327
doing something you don't want to but I'm telling you,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.330
you've got what it takes to be part of the team.

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.799
REPTAK: It's not that I don't want to battle with you Dan.

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:55.335
I just worry I'll be more of a handicap to you...

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:56.869
because I'm distracted.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.839
REPTAK: I can't stop thinking about Gunz.

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.476
DRAGO: You're worried. We understand.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:04.777
REPTAK: Really?

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.113
DRAGO: When Dan and I were apart it was the hardest thing ever.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:10.850
REPTAK: Wow, I had no idea you had ever been separated before.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.485
DAN: Ya, you know it.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.754
DRAGO: When you've been together as long as we have...

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.623
you're bound to have your ups and downs.

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:18.491
DAN: Hmmph! Exactly.

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.460
And it's surviving those down times that makes...

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:22.962
the partnership stronger in the end.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:24.430
REPTAK: I see.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:28.434
DAN: Reptak, if Gunz is out there you gotta believe...

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:31.437
he wants to find you just as bad pal.

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:34.140
REPTAK: You really think so?

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.808
REPTAK: I guess you're right.

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:42.148
DAN: Ha, cool! Now let's go look for your partner dude!

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:53.693
BETADRON: That blasted Drago! I can't believe we were...

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:58.064
defeated by a Bakugan who is only a fraction of our age!

00:04:58.097 --> 00:05:00.633
KODOKOR: Then why are we sitting here with our tails...

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:04.671
between our legs? We should go back and crush those insects.

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:05.805
MUTABRID: Enough you two.

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:06.973
KODOKOR: What?

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:09.008
MUTABRID: We lost because we weren't powerful enough.

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.543
Isn't that right, Wiseman?

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.646
[footsteps]

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.650
WISEMAN: [sinister chuckle] It's impressive...

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:20.887
you know your limitations, Mutabrid.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.057
KODOKOR: We're not powerful enough? That's absurd!

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.692
WISEMAN: Is it Kodokor?

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:28.027
WISEMAN: Your collective powers may be able to summon...

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.196
Mechtavius Destroyer but they're not enough...

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.599
to sustain him for very long. And once he has been defeated,

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:36.903
they are too depleted to bring him forth again any time soon.

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:39.472
You need to find a way to recharge your powers faster,

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:41.140
and more efficiently.

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:46.946
MUTABRID: Hmmmm. Recharge them?

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.717
Are you saying Bakugan of our ability are unable to summon...

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.618
a Mechtogan at will?

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:53.720
WISEMAN: Mmm-hmm.

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:56.589
BETADRON: I don't need Mechtavius Destroyer!

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:59.258
I'll take the Brawlers down myself!

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.594
WISEMAN: It would be futile to try.

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:02.929
BETADRON: What?

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:04.797
WISEMAN: The Battle Brawlers have a mighty bond...

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:07.133
as you've already witnessed. To try to take them on...

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:10.603
single handedly would be foolhardy of you, Betadron.

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:11.771
BETADRON: Whatever.

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.573
WISEMAN: If you changed tactics and were successful...

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:16.442
in isolating one of them, you might have a chance...

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:19.645
of defeating them all. But it's only a theory.

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:21.881
MUTABRID: I see.

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.750
KODOKOR: Let's do it!

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:26.786
WISEMAN: I admire your enthusiasm.

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:36.329
YOUNG MAN A: Did you say Gunz? No, sorry dude.

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:37.363
YOUNG MAN A: You?

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:38.798
GREN: Nope.

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:45.505
DAN: Have you guys seen Gunz at all?

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:48.207
GIRL A and GIRL B: Hmmm? Un-uhh.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.510
JECT: Sorry we can't help.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.044
DAN: You seen Gunz dude?

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.446
YOUNG MAN B: Nope.

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:55.414
DAN: We were hoping maybe you've seen him.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.551
DAN: [panting, running reax]

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.630
REPTAK: This isn't going so well.

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:11.898
DRAGO: Be patient.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.834
DAN: Let's call it a day. Then we'll bring the others with us

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:18.237
tomorrow and widen the search perimeter. Sound cool?

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.473
DRAGO: Sounds good.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:23.576
GUNZ: Reptak!

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:24.977
REPTAK: [gasp]

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:30.249
DAN: What's going on?

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.250
DRAGO: What's wrong?

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.418
REPTAK: It's Gunz!

00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:33.886
DAN: Huh, where?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.128
REPTAK: Over there!

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:43.196
DAN: [gasp]

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.231
REPTAK: Gunz! Wait up!

00:07:45.264 --> 00:07:46.732
DRAGO: Reptak! Hold on!

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:48.701
DAN: Let's go!

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:50.603
DRAGO: Right!

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:56.108
REPTAK: [gasps, exertion reax] Huh? Where'd he go?

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.880
REPTAK: Gunz! It's Reptak!

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:04.116
REPTAK: Come on! It's me!

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:15.394
REPTAK: [grunt, exertion reax] Guuuuuuuuuunz!

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:17.663
DAN: Reptak!

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:19.799
DRAGO: Did you find Gunz?

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:23.069
REPTAK: I could have sworn I saw him come in here.

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:26.906
DAN: Hey are you sure it was him buddy? Maybe it was a mistake.

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:29.876
REPTAK: It's no mistake! I'm positive it was him!

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.711
WISEMAN: [sinister chuckle]

00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:35.681
DAN: [gasp] You again!

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.551
DRAGO: Wiseman!

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:39.552
REPTAK: [gasp]

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.020
DAN: What now?

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:42.154
WISEMAN: I've been waiting for you.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.756
WISEMAN: [grunt]

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:46.292
DAN: What do you want?

00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:01.186
DAN: What the... Did you see that thing?

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:05.357
DAN: What the heck is it?

00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:08.460
DRAGO: It looks like a big ugly bird.

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:10.696
DRAGO,REPTAK and DAN: Huh?

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:14.466
DAN: [gasp] Whooooa!

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:18.203
COMBINED BETA: [rising mighty roar]

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:21.306
DRAGO: They've combined!

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.975
DAN: That's craziness!

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:26.078
WISEMAN: It's not crazy. They've consolidated all of...

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:29.615
their energy to enter into the ultimate attack mode.

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:32.251
COMBINED BETA: And now it's time to put an end to you Drago.

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:33.919
Once and for all!

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:36.622
WISEMAN: Combined Ability, activate!

00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:38.323
WISEMAN: Sky Panzer!

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:41.660
DRAGO: No point in waiting around.

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.929
REPTAK: Let me take the lead Drago.

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.633
[laser blasts]

00:17:48.967 --> 00:17:49.935
REPTAK: What?

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:51.503
DRAGO: That's some shield!

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:54.306
WISEMAN: With Sky Panzer, a defense shield can be put up...

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:57.242
to defend the entire body while still allowing for attacks...

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:59.445
to be launched from the three individual parts.

00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:03.949
REPTAK: [grunt, pain reax]

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:05.017
DRAGO: Reptak!

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.351
DRAGO: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:09.121
DRAGO: [groan] [grunt]

00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:13.192
DAN: Drago! Reptak! Get out of there!

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:14.660
COMBINED BETA: Too late, fools!

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:18.597
DRAGO: [grunt, pain reax] REPTAK: [grunt, pain reax]

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.099
DAN: [grunt, exertion reax] Guys!

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:21.500
DAN: Can you hear me?

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.068
DRAGO: We've gotta shake them off !

00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:25.404
REPTAK: I can't let them take me down. Not until I know...

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:28.107
for sure what Wiseman's true identity is.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.009
I need to know if he and Gunz are one and the same.

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:33.946
DRAGO: You okay?

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:35.414
REPTAK: I need your help.

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:38.550
DRAGO: We're a team. I'll help you find out the truth.

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:42.221
DRAGO: But first I need you to give me your strength.

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:43.689
REPTAK: It's yours.

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:45.190
DRAGO: Then here we go Reptak!

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:48.127
REPTAK: I'm ready, Drago!

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.129
DRAGO: Bakugan Unite! REPTAK: Bakugan Unite!

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:03.709
COMBINED BETA: That light! What's happening over there?

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:05.944
DAN: Drago! Reptak!

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.449
COMBINED DRAGO: [rising mighty roar]

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.518
COMBINED DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaaah!

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:13.585
COMBINED BETA: It can't be!

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:14.720
DAN: They combined!

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:17.189
WISEMAN: How interesting.

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:18.290
COMBINED DRAGO: Hmmmmph!

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.558
COMBINED DRAGO: Now Dan!

00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:22.895
DAN: Yeah! Combined Ability activate!

00:19:22.928 --> 00:19:25.464
DAN: Flame Harvey Cannon!

00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:27.633
COMBINED BETA: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.304
COMBINED DRAGO: This speed is incredible.

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:34.940
The potential of our powers is amazing Reptak!

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:38.343
REPTAK: I know Drago! I can feel them too!

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.312
DAN: Come on! Let's do this guys!

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:41.446
COMBINED DRAGO: Right!

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.648
COMBINED BETA: I don't understand!

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:44.583
How were they able to combine as well?

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:47.052
COMBINED DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:48.720
COMBINED BETA: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:50.989
DAN: Consecutive Ability activate!

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:54.259
Dragon Eternal Force!

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.529
DAN: Flame Harvey Cannon!

00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:59.531
COMBINED DRAGO: Haaaaaaaaah!

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:07.172
COMBINED DRAGO: Go doooooooown!

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:10.242
COMBINED BETA: Whoa!

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:13.245
COMBINED BETA: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.049
COMBINED BETA: Ooooomph!

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.522
COMBINED DRAGO: [grunt]

00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:31.730
REPTAK: Wiseman!

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:36.568
WISEMAN: Well this didn't go as I had planned.

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:40.772
I see you two will be more trouble than I had expected.

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:44.910
WISEMAN: However I did learn something very valuable today.

00:20:44.943 --> 00:20:46.311
REPTAK: What's that?

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:49.848
WISEMAN: I think I'll wait until next time before I share it.

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:53.185
DAN: Get back here! Coward!

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:56.688
DAN: Do you still think that could've been Gunz?

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:59.157
DRAGO: I can't say for sure.

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:02.527
REPTAK: I'm not sure either. But if it is how do I open...

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:06.098
his eyes and bring him back to the side of good?

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:10.135
DAN: Shun and his new partner Bakugan, Jaakor,

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:12.504
make an incredible team. If you didn't know any better

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:15.307
you'd think these guys had been battling together for years.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.676
That's why I was surprised when I heard a couple of Jaakor's

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.611
old buddies were trying to convince him to head back

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:22.147
to New Vestroia. I guess some of the Bakugan have been

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.950
rethinking life on Earth after Wiseman and his evil crew

00:21:24.983 --> 00:21:28.020
showed up. Luckily, Jaakor is an honourable dude and refused

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:30.389
to leave until he helped us to get rid of Wiseman.

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:33.492
Tune in to see just how intense Jaakor gets in battle.

00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:37.095
It's so impressive it will blow your mind.

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:47.172
