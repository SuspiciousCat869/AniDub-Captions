WEBVTT

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.475
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.943
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.911
But then out of nowhere, we were invaded

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.414
by these mysterious evil Mechtogan,

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.182
who were intent on destroying everything!

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.752
Cordegon, Slycerak,

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.820
Exostriker, and Mandibor were their names.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.556
And leading them was this clown, Wiseman.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.091
They also had help form an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.359
called the Nonets.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.595
Luckily for us, we had our own secret weapon

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.331
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.833
So we fought back, because no one is gonna take our freedom.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.502
Not now, not ever!

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.638
\u266a What are you gonna do

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.608
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.044
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.945
\u266a You gotta give it your all

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.381
\u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, this is the final stand \u266a

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.617
\u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.318
\u266a The power's in your hands

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:55.021
\u266a Two worlds collide on the inside \u266a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.527
\u266a You gotta fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.196
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.564
\u266a This is Bakugan \u266a

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.535
You'll never take me down!

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.103
Stay strong, buddy!

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:14.074
You can do this! Mechtavius Destroyer's got nothing on you!

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:17.911
Sorry, my brothers. He's too powerful!

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:20.647
I... can't... hold... on!

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.854
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: I'm giving you 12 hours to destroy your own pod of Bakugan.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.757
If you don't, we will wipe out the entire population

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.758
of the Earth.

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.059
Human and Bakugan alike.

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.061
We won't back down!

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:42.669
Bakugan Battle Brawlers in \"The Eve of Extermination.\"

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:45.972
What's the word, Mira?

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.141
How's Dragonoid Destroyer doing?

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:51.444
MIRA: Well, as you can see here,

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:54.514
Mechtavius Destroyer did quite a number on him last battle.

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:56.282
I estimate it will be at least 18 hours

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.284
before he's back to battling condition.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.385
Huh?

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.855
But we don't have that kind of time!

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.556
There's gotta be something you can do,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.558
to get him to full power!

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:07.560
Help us out, Mira!

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:09.195
MIRA: I'm not the one you should be appealing to.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.065
You should be making your pleas directly to Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:13.500
What are you talking about?

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:18.104
While I was running my diagnostic analysis on him,

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:20.373
I noticed something curious.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.742
Apparently Dragonoid Destroyer has only been fighting

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.677
using 70% of his energy.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.180
You mean he still has an energy reserve?

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.615
MIRA: It would appear so.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.884
Now I'm not sure if he's been holding back on his own,

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.153
or whether it requires something special to trigger it,

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:34.888
but one thing is for sure.

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:37.323
If we're able to get Dragonoid Destroyer to access this reserve

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:40.727
it would take his power levels to unparalleled heights.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.162
I just don't understand why he wouldn't use this extra boost

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:45.131
in his last battle against Mechtavius Destroyer.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.533
It would have given him the win.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.736
Whatever his motives were at the time, they don't matter now.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.137
We need to focus on the deadline

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.439
that Mechtavius Destroyer has given us.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:56.309
Come on, Dragonoid Destroyer. You gotta snap out of it, dude.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.744
We really need your help!

00:02:57.777 --> 00:03:00.413
If you don't wake up soon, we're all in trouble.

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:06.853
JULIE: As you can see below us, viewers,

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.189
the streets of Bakugan City are packed with cars

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:11.724
making a mass exodus ahead of the deadline to doom

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.459
set my Mechtavius Destroyer.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.995
We'll continue to cover the events as time ticks down

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.097
to the hour when he has promised to rid the world

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.767
of Bakugan and humans alike.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.335
(VOICEOVER): Come on, Brawlers. Where are you?

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.804
Please tell me you have a plan.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:27.807
MIRA: We've got six hours left until the deadline.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.043
RADIZEN: Oh man, and still now plan!

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:31.444
What the heck are we gonna do, guys?

00:03:31.477 --> 00:03:33.513
I don't wanna just sit around to see if Mechtavius Destroyer

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:34.747
is only blowing smoke!

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.549
(Chirping)

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:39.586
Huh? I never said I wanted to surrender, you numbskull!

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.188
We couldn't, even if we wanted to.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.891
Surrender was never offered to us as an option.

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.759
Our only choice was to be destroyed at the hand

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.828
of our battling partners, or Mechtavius Destroyer.

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:52.065
So then, we just have to take that creep down instead.

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:54.801
Yeah, that's the spirit, my brother.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:57.570
It's not exactly that easy, you guys.

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.973
This is the situation we find ourselves in, Dan.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.575
We have to figure out some way to fight back.

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.645
I don't know how without Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.747
Why do you have to be so negative, Dan?

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.015
It sounds like you're giving up!

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.250
You're wrong, pal! Those Mechtogan

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.319
that Wiseman is fighting with are the biggest and baddest

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:14.654
we've ever seen!

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:16.623
And when they connect to make Mechtavius Destroyer,

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:18.391
they've got the power of four!

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:19.993
We can't match it! Ugh!

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:21.661
(All gasping)

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:24.864
Are you trying to say the rest of us are useless?

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:27.367
I never said that, don't put words in my mouth!

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.204
We used to fight fine without Dragonoid Destroyer, Dan.

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:33.606
Shun's right. The fact that we used to fight together

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.775
as a team used to be enough to be victorious.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:37.844
We didn't have to rely on Mechtogan at all.

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:41.280
Marucho, Shun, take it easy. Dan was only saying--

00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:43.249
They're just jealous, Drago!

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:45.752
It's because we're the only ones who can summon a Mechtogan

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.153
to fight alongside of us!

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.988
You and your ego are out of control.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:50.590
We're not jealous of anything.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.925
We're just trying to keep it together and not give up.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.527
At least we're going down fighting.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.629
DAN: So why don't you get out of here and lead the charge then,

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:57.630
tough guy?

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:58.631
This is my lab!

00:04:58.665 --> 00:04:59.699
You're the one who can get out!

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.634
Have you guys lost it?!

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:04.704
Things are at their worst right now so the last thing we need

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.539
is to be fighting amongst each other.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:09.575
We need to come together. Like a family.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.990
Follow me, professor. This way.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:27.894
There is something that I need to talk to you about.

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:29.762
Is it Wiseman?

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.564
Once again, you amaze me

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:34.600
with how all-seeing you are, Professor.

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:37.470
I've found something. It's a secret room.

00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:42.141
I stumbled onto it by accident one day.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.877
I found someone else inside,

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:48.081
who looked just like Wiseman.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:51.050
Who could it have been? Perhaps it was this Gunz character

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:52.985
that the Brawlers were always speaking of.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.588
But if so, where did he come from?

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:57.590
And why do they look identical?

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.559
Trust me, Balista! It's better that you

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:00.993
forget what you saw. What?!

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:05.331
Just for now. We need to keep our eyes on the main target.

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:09.569
We can revisit this at another time. Understood?

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:10.803
Wait a second!

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:26.152
\u266a

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:35.962
DAN: This stinks.

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:38.164
I can't believe the guys think that I'm doubting them.

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:40.299
We're nothing without each other.

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:46.472
Don't worry, Dan. The other guys won't stay mad at you for long.

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:52.178
They're both frustrated with the situation, just like you are.

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:53.679
That's all, okay?

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:56.382
I guess so. It's just that...

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:57.517
I'm the leader of this team,

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.786
and for once, I don't have an answer.

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:07.193
(Floorboards creaking) Huh?

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:09.262
MIRA: There you are, Shun. Huh?

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:11.030
I thought I might find you here.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.102
Sorry about earlier.

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:19.405
It's very rare that I lose my temper like that.

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:22.742
Mm-hm. But even a ninja can lose his cool

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.744
every once in a while, you know?

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:27.680
Dan was right. We need Dragonoid Destroyer

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:30.383
to guarantee victory, but we don't have him now.

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:33.920
What's even worse is that none of the rest of us

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.989
has the ability to summon a Mechtogan of our own.

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:38.991
We're in an impossible situation right now

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:42.328
and I'm feeling completely helpless about things.

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:45.264
Mira, I don't like not having a solution for this.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.167
I've never been at a loss for having a strategy.

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:50.303
I don't know what happened to us out there, Mira.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:52.905
Don't lose faith, Shun.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:54.173
You guys will find a way.

00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:56.375
Mm...

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:03.716
I think it's important that you don't lose sight of one thing.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:06.986
Fear of the worst is often greater than the actual danger.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:10.122
If you keep your focus and stay loyal to your teammates,

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:12.258
you will always find a way through the darkness

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.826
and ultimately, to success.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.695
Huh, I guess you're right, Kato.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.267
(Siren wails in the distance)

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:25.538
It is time.

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:30.409
(Clock strikes 12)

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:37.149
Shun, Marucho. I'm sorry about before.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.118
I got carried away.

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:42.421
Me too. You guys are my brothers.

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:44.857
Together, no one can stop us!

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.158
Hm...

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:56.969
So, Battle Brawlers. What's your decision, then?

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.473
We can do this combined, Radizen!

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:06.078
SHUN: Dan, Marucho! We've got your backs!

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:16.355
So, Battle Brawlers, what's your decision, then?

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.425
Yeah, pal. Our answer is the same as ever!

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:21.861
You can stick it, 'cause we're never gonna turn on our own.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:23.229
You understand that?

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:27.266
So, punk, let's go! If you're man enough!

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.503
Hm... very well, then.

00:09:30.536 --> 00:09:32.905
Bakugan Brawl!

Bakugan stand!

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:44.584
ALL: Bakugan Brawl!

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:46.886
Bakugan stand!

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:50.623
Baku Sky Raider jump!

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:52.625
(Growling)

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:54.760
I'll make short work of you, Jaakor!

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.197
(Grunting)

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:03.402
NONET: I can't believe they fell for that again!

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.371
SECOND NONET: It hurts more every time.

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:07.607

Let's see how you enjoy this!

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.723
(Booming, groaning)

(Shrieking)

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.386
Let us get back in there, Wiseman!

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:55.755
Yeah! I wanna stomp them into the ground!

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:58.391
(Snapping) You can step back, Nonets.

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:00.726
Your services are no longer needed here.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.062
(Grumbling)

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:05.831
NONET: So just like that we're dismissed again?

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:07.933
All wandering Mechtogan!

00:11:07.967 --> 00:11:10.736
Descend and join us in battle

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.672
so that we may destroy the enemy!

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:24.684
\u266a

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.425
(Thudding)

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:35.594
Mechtogan are here, Mira, so...

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:38.497
how's Dragonoid Destroyer doing?

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:42.068
Unfortunately, he's still not fully recovered.

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:43.135
You're going to have to wait.

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:48.040
Okay then. Drago, Reptak, let's go!

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:50.443
BOTH: Ready! Bakugan unite!

00:11:50.476 --> 00:11:54.213
\u266a

00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:57.216
Jaakor! Skytruss! Orbeum!

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:59.552
Bakugan unite!

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:01.887
ALL: Combined ninja Herculean power!

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:04.056
Roxtor! Radizen!

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.425
On it, boss!

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:11.197
Bakugan fuse!

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.733

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:15.134
(Roaring)

00:12:18.804 --> 00:12:19.805
Let's go, guys!

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:21.040
Right! Right!

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:26.245
\u266a

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:27.747
Aw, yeah!

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.748
Will these fools never learn?

00:12:29.782 --> 00:12:31.150
Obviously not.

00:12:31.183 --> 00:12:34.453
Then perhaps it's time we remind them!

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.957
Attack!

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.727

Wing Harvey Cannon!

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.806
NONET: Every time we get close to exacting our vengeance

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:56.742
on Drago, Wiseman pulls us out.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.911
Well, maybe it's time we share what drives us

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:00.045
with the Mechtogan.

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.480
That way, we get the same results,

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:03.315
even if it's by remote.

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:05.885
ALL: Destroy the descendant of the original Dragonoid

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:08.254
who imprisoned us for all those years!

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:10.790
Destroy Drago! Destroy Drago!

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:13.259
Destroy Drago!

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:16.495
Ugh, what are they rambling on about?

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:19.932
They're chanting for the destruction of Drago.

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:22.401
It's like I can feel their hatred

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:24.203
coursing through my veins.

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:27.640
It's feeding us with more energy for the battle.

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:31.210
Then perhaps we should grant the Nonets their wish and return.

00:13:31.243 --> 00:13:34.113
Slycerak! Exostriker! Mandibor!

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:36.315
Let's take Drago down first.

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.719

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:42.388

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:46.992
Whoa!

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:50.429
Jaakor! We have to jump in for back up!

00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:52.398
Copy that!

Chew on this!

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:13.686
(Shouting)

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:15.454

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:18.557
No more wasting time. Slycerak!

Exostriker! Mandibor!

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:21.860
Augh!

Integrate Mechtavius Destroyer!

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:42.114
\u266a

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:45.117
Time for the vermin to be exterminated!

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.518
(Groaning)

00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:50.789

(Shouting)

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.896
Marucho! Shun! Augh!

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.398
(Drago groaning)

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.668
Drago!

(Crashing)

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:10.209
No!

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.353

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.103
Who's the vermin now, huh?!

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:39.672
You scum!

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:41.607
It's time for you to disappear!

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.075
Once and for all!

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:45.110
Yeah, that's right!

00:15:45.144 --> 00:15:48.247
DRAGO: You're not the only ones who can use combined energy to fight!

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.682
JAAKOR: You tell him, Sensei!

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:51.016
Better yet, let's show them!

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.485
Shun, Marucho!

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:55.688
Let's do this, my brothers.

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:59.091

Together we're unstoppable!

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:18.377
Fear of the worst is greater than the actual danger.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.079
We need to keep focused!

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.615
(Booming)

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:31.790
When will you accept that you're no match for us?!

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.459
(Growling)

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:38.297
End of the line, insects.

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:41.467
Get out of there, you guys!

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.536
(Shouting)

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.706
(Booming)

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:54.680
Huh?!

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:57.850
(Gasping)

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:08.260
I am the Mechtogan Thorak, born of my master Shun

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:10.429
and his partner Bakugan.

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:13.599
Whoa!

00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:17.569
I am the Mechtogan Flytris, born of my master Marucho,

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.838
and his partner Bakugan.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:24.643
What's this? They created new Mechtogan?

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:26.345
Thorak and...

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:28.313
Flytris!

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:31.116
That's unbelievable!

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.286
Wow! Who knew we had the power this entire time!

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:37.956
MIRA: Huh, that's weird.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.992
What is it, Mira?

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:43.328
20% of Dragonoid Destroyer's mysterious energy reserve

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:44.696
just got used.

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:50.035
Is that supposed to be intimidating?

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:56.642
If you're going to turn against your fellow Mechtogan,

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:58.844
then I have no trouble taking you down as well.

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:07.553

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:22.301
Nicely played, but you'll never get through this shield.

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:24.203
We gotta keep hammering him.

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:25.370
Right! Yeah!

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:28.407

00:18:36.648 --> 00:18:40.752
Brothers, attack!

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:41.920
(Groaning)

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.722
You'll never defeat us!

00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:44.957
Now!

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:52.664
(Glass shattering)

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:54.600
What?! Impossible!

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:07.446

00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:21.226
\u266a

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.328
This isn't over!

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:29.701
Incredible! Whoa, dude!

00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:42.381
\u266a

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:49.221
Hm... I must admit,

00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:52.124
those new Mechtogan surprised even me.

00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:53.659
We'll return!

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:58.130
Come back!

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:08.674
Huh?

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:16.615
JULIE: So, once again Bakugan City has been saved

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:18.350
by the Bakugan Battle Brawlers!

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:21.520
Until next time, this is your favourite roving reporter

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:25.023
Julie signing off for now!

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:28.026
(VOICEOVER): I just hope that next time isn't anytime soon.

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:32.431
MARUCHO: So Dragonoid Destroyer is finally recovered?

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:35.801
DAN: Yeah, and now that you and Shun have your own Mechtogan,

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:38.337
there's no way that creep Wiseman can ever take us down!

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.705
Just let him try to.

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:42.708
And it still appears that there is at least 10% remaining

00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:45.544
untouched in Dragonoid Destroyer's energy reserve.

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:49.247
Really? That's totally insane, Mira.

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:51.450
MIRA: I think if we learned anything today,

00:20:51.483 --> 00:20:53.418
it's that if we stick together and don't panic,

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:55.220
no matter how dire the circumstances,

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.555
we'll make it through.

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:57.823
True.

00:20:57.856 --> 00:20:59.725
MARUCHO: There's definitely no arguing that.

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:03.762
I wonder if we'll ever find out what that final 10% does.

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:10.402
RUNO: Things were finally starting to quiet down around Bakugan City

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:11.670
after the Brawlers' last battle against Wiseman

00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:13.939
when I came across this strange character.

00:21:13.972 --> 00:21:16.208
His name was Haos Aerogan, and he said he was looking

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:17.576
for a battling partner.

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:19.611
I kinda felt torn, because technically Tigrerra

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:22.381
was still my partner Bakugan, but he seemed so nice.

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:23.849
While the rest of the Bakugan practiced battling

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:25.484
with their Mechtogan, it only made sense

00:21:25.517 --> 00:21:27.786
that I add to the team by taking on a new partner.

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:29.821
I must admit that things did go a bit chaotic,

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:31.757
but it's better that you tune in

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.425
to see what I'm talking about.

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:34.926
Even I'd forgotten how intense the battle action

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.962
could be around here!

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:46.972
