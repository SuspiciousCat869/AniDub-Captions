00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:09.008
DAN: Things on Earth were going really well, after the Bakugan

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.478
came to live with us. But then out of nowhere,

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.347
we were invaded by these mysterious and evil Mechtogan

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.182
who were intent on destroying everything.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.384
Coredegon,

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.485
Slycerak,

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.652
Exostriker,

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.154
and Mandibor were their names.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.223
And leading them was this clown Wiseman.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.225
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:27.861
called the Nonets. Luckily for us, we had our own

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:30.630
secret weapon in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.832
So we fought back, because no one is going to

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.368
take our freedom! Not now, not ever!

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.438
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.641
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.878
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:48.181
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.351
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The power's in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.121
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.093
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.062
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.398
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.872
KATO: Ah, good. They're finally asleep.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:16.443
DAN: [snoring]

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:20.480
KATO: Things have been so hectic since that Wiseman showed up.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.983
MARUCHO: [gentle snores and sighs]

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.186
KATO: They need their rest more than ever.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.856
SHUN: [breathing]

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:34.627
MIRA: Okay, let's see how this set of calculations works.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:37.931
KATO: Miss Mira it's well after midnight,

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.233
shouldn't you be fast asleep now?

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:44.704
MIRA: Don't you worry Kato, I'm almost done here for the night.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.906
KATO: Very well then miss.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.543
KATO: Just be careful you don't overwork yourself.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:02:00.687
MIRA: I'll get all the rest I need, as soon as...

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.755
these battle suits are perfected.

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:13.666
BETADRON: Wiseman we need to talk.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.468
WISEMAN: What is it now?

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.704
BETADRON: Our losses have been useful in learning about...

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:20.540
the Brawlers but it's time we turn things around.

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:21.841
WISEMAN: Yes.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.377
BETADRON: As much as I hate to say this, I think we have to...

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.647
face facts and realize that it may be necessary to summon...

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.783
Coredegon and the rest of the Mechtogan to help us.

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.986
WISEMAN: I never thought I'd hear you say those words,

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.322
Betadron. Whatever changed your mind?

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:38.491
BETADRON: You think this is easy for me?

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.694
BETADRON: I may despise Coredegon for betraying Fury...

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.764
and the rest of us, but I despise Drago even more!

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.733
BETADRON: Right now it's about choosing between...

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.601
the lesser of two evils!

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.937
BETADRON: Just tell me what we have to do in order to...

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.073
summon those swine, so we can get things over with...

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.708
once and for all.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:03:00.013
WISEMAN: As you know, they're no longer linked to the Bakugan.

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.882
WISEMAN: The only way around their newfound autonomy,

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.717
is building up enough power of your own to...

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.219
override their abilities.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:09.289
WISEMAN: Hmmph.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.663
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Enemy Allies

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:26.706
DAN: [panting, running reax]

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:34.647
JULIE: Heeeeeey! It's your favourite roving reporter Julie,

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:37.784
coming to you live. Today we're at Battle Brawlers HQ,

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.352
where we're gonna go behind the scenes with...

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:42.789
the Brawlers themselves. How totally cool is that huh, guys?

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:44.824
DAN: Hey, Julie. What's going on?

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.025
JULIE: Just stuff.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.294
DRAGO: This sounds like trouble.

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.797
JULIE: Tell us! Who is this mysterious battler...

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.365
Wiseman, huh, Dan?

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.900
DAN: [gasp]

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.835
JULIE: Marucho! What can you tell us about...

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.503
the evil Nonet Bakugan?

00:03:57.537 --> 00:03:58.671
MARUCHO: Uhhh...

00:03:58.705 --> 00:03:59.906
JULIE: And what about this creepy...

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.408
Mechtavius Destroyer thing?

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.377
SHUN: [clears throat]

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.912
DRAGO: Take it easy, Julie!

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:08.114
RADIZEN: Yeah, 'no comment', lady!

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:10.683
JULIE: But the viewers want to know!

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:18.391
MIRA: [sigh] Finished.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:21.160
JULIE: Come on! The people have a right to know.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:23.363
Don't you care about freedom of the press?

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.731
SHUN: Not really.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:26.566
DAN: You know we can't talk on the record about...

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.568
an on-going mission.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:30.570
MIRA: You guys...

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.771
ALL: [gasp]

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:32.939
MIRA: ...I did it!

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.544
MIRA: Check it out, everyone.

00:04:38.578 --> 00:04:39.812
DRAGO: Incredible.

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:41.748
MIRA: The new Battle Suits are ready.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.117
SHUN: Wow, they're amazing, Mira.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.020
DAN: So this is why you've been pulling those all-nighters.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:48.988
Looks like it's definitely been worth it.

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.691
MARUCHO: I can't believe you completed all four of them.

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:55.595
MARUCHO: Does this mean we call you Professor Mira, now?

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:58.698
MIRA: I'm just happy to share our Vestal Technology.

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:01.034
JULIE: Whoa! What a scoop!

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:03.336
Hurry up! Roll the camera!

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:06.439
MIRA: Defendrix has superior mobility,

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.675
and is best used for aerial combat.

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:11.010
MIRA: Combustoid has two pillars for legs,

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:12.178
and a low center of gravity,

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.546
making him best for ground fighting.

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:15.682
MIRA: [soft moan]

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:16.983
DAN: You okay?

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.351
MIRA: [groan]

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:19.652
DAN: Mira!

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.395
MIRA: [grunt] [groan]

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.664
DAN: Hey sleepyhead!

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:33.099
MIRA: Hi guys.

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:35.802
MARUCHO: You gave us a real scare but the doctors say...

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.337
you'll be okay.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.039
DAN: You're just suffering from a case of exhaustion.

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:43.109
JULIE: Thank goodness Dan was there to catch you.

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.311
SHUN: The important thing is that you take it easy.

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:47.513
The doctors have ordered a week of bed rest for you.

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:49.682
MIRA: A whole week?

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:51.851
MIRA: That's silly. I'm totally fine.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:53.352
ALL: [shocked grunt]

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:54.721
MIRA: I just needed a little nap is all.

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:56.022
[gasp]

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.757
DAN: Whoa! Slow down!

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.093
MIRA: But Dan, if I'm in here who's going to guide you...

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:02.228
through using the new Battle Suits?

00:06:02.261 --> 00:06:03.896
DAN: Don't worry about that right now.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.765
MARUCHO: Yeah. The only thing you need to focus on...

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:07.700
is getting better, Mira.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.636
SHUN: We'll just hold off on using the battle suits.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.538
DAN: Night night.

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:14.073
MIRA: Bye.

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:17.210
JULIE: Get well soon, hon!

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:19.946
KATO: If there's anything you require,

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.950
please don't hesitate to call me, miss. Goodnight.

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:26.819
MIRA: Kato, wait.

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.221
KATO: Yes?

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:31.324
MIRA: There is actually something you can do.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.129
MARUCHO: Shun has the right idea. We should wait...

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:38.831
until Mira is back before we use the Battle Suits.

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:41.768
RADIZEN: Awwww man! But they looked so totally sweet!

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.636
RADIZEN: Can you imagine the thrashing we could give...

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.005
the Nonets with those? Just like that they'd be pounded...

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:48.141
into dust. It would be so awesome!

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:50.576
JAAKOR: We won the last few battles just fine on our own.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.246
DAN: That's right! When Wiseman shows up we'll give him...

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.014
an old fashioned whooping.

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:56.149
SHUN: You bet.

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:58.618
JULIE: Yeah! That's the spirit!

00:06:58.651 --> 00:06:59.919
DRAGO: Are you guys still here?

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:02.155
JULIE: Mmm-hmm.

00:07:02.188 --> 00:07:06.526
KATO: Marucho I'm afraid I must step out momentarily.

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:09.662
MARUCHO: No problem, but is everything okay, Kato?

00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:13.666
KATO: Yes, I just have to run an errand for Ms. Mira,

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.736
I'll be right back. Bye.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.178
DAN: An errand for Mira?

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:27.213
MARUCHO: Yeah, I wonder what it is?

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:31.984
LITTLE GIRL: Yum!

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.387
TODDLER: [cooing]

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:41.527
MAN A: Whooooaa!

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:42.895
WOMAN A: Who the heck is that?

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:44.664
MAN A: It's that creep we saw on the news!

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:46.666
WOMAN A: You mean the one who used Bakugan to trash...

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:47.900
the construction site?

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.837
[phone ringing]

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:54.307
JULIE: It's the station manager!

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.143
DRAGO: Maybe he's wondering why you're not at work.

00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:59.512
JULIE: Hey, ya, boss, Julie here.

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:01.147
Yeah, I'm just finishing up my interview with...

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.651
the Brawlers and...whaaaat? Wiseman is back in town?

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.353
DAN: Man, no way!

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:08.754
CROWD OF PEOPLE: [panicked screams]

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:10.990
RANGER: Everyone! Please, please remain calm!

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:15.094
RANGER: Hold up! You can't go in there!

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:17.096
DAN: Relax, we're the Battle Brawlers.

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:19.999
ALL: [exertion, running reax]

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:22.568
JULIE: Come on, we're missing it!

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:27.640
DAN: [frustrated grunt] Wiseman!

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.041
WISEMAN: [evil chuckle]

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.881
WISEMAN: Your response time is impressive...

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:01.620

RUNO: Connection complete!

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:27.513
Battle systems fully operational.

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:30.149
Synchro rate operating at 100%

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:32.651
DAN: Oh yeah! There's no way those clowns...

00:17:32.684 --> 00:17:34.153
are gonna stop us now!

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:37.256
JULIE: Whoa! How exciting folks!

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:40.359
JULIE: You're getting a first look at the new battle suits!

00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:42.227
MIRA: Way to go, Runo!

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:46.131
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Hmmmph! Even with your new toys,

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:49.068
you're no match for me, Brawlers!

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:50.436
DAN: Ready, Drago?

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:52.371
DRAGO: Leave it to me, Dan!

00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.039
DRAGO: Haaaaaaaah!

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:55.607
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Hmmmph. Pathetic!

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.410
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.013
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Get back here!

00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:06.018
DRAGO: Whoa! These suits are phenomenal!

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:09.154
DAN: You can thank Mira! Let's go, Reptak!

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:10.522
REPTAK: You got it!

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.091
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: [grunt, pain reax]

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:15.661
Now you're just annoying me, little bug!

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:18.263
REPTAK: Hmmmmph!

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:21.934
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: [grunt, pain reax]

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:23.268
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Oooomph!

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:24.403
MARUCHO: Get 'em!

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:25.671
RADIZEN: Haaaaaaah!

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:26.939
SHUN: Now Jaakor!

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:28.173
JAAKOR: Hmmmmph!

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:30.542
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:32.411
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Not again!

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.015
ALL NONETS: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:39.785
EXOSTRIKER: These pathetic Nonets aren't...

00:18:39.818 --> 00:18:41.920
going to last much longer.

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:44.256
MANDIBOR: You're right. We'd better do something now!

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:46.992
SLYCERAK: Time to take the Brawlers down!

00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:48.660
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Let's go then!

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.966
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: [rising mighty roar]

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:55.200
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:56.568
DAN: Whoooooa!

00:18:56.602 --> 00:19:00.205
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: I'm going to grind your bones to dust!

00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:02.975
JAAKOR: All of you, take cover!

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:05.244
JAAKOR: Hmmmph!

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:07.613
SHUN: Rush forward, Jaakor!

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:09.681
JAAKOR: [rising mighty roar]

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.085
DAN: Now guys! MARUCHO: Now guys!

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:14.319
ALL: Haaaaaaaaaah!

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:15.654
DRAGO: Open wide!

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:16.655
REPTAK: You creeps!

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:17.890
RADIZEN: It's time...

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:18.991
JAAKOR: ...to vanish!

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.526
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: Nooooo!

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:23.862
ALL NONETS: Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:33.872
MECHTAVIUS DESTROYER: This isn't over Brawleeeeeers!

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:38.544
DAN: Huh? Oh, Wiseman

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:45.017
WISEMAN: Your new Battle Suits are quite impressive, Kuso.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.319
DAN: [grunt, exertion reax] Show your face coward!

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:48.353
DAN: Hey!

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:49.354
Huh?

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:50.889
DAN: Aw man!

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:58.530
JULIE: Runo darling! Oh it's so good to see you!

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:00.799
RUNO: Hahaha! Good to see you too!

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:02.234
I missed you Julie.

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:04.937
DAN: Yeah, well all I wanna know is how you wound up...

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.406
bringing us the Battle Suits just in time.

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.241
MARUCHO: I'm guessing that fetching Runo was...

00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:11.543
the errand Kato had to run for Mira, right?

00:20:11.577 --> 00:20:13.779
KATO: That's right.

00:20:13.812 --> 00:20:16.848
MIRA: Runo knows Vestal Technology really well,

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:19.017
I need your help.

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:24.256
MIRA: Will you please go and get her?

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:25.857
KATO: Of course I will.

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:31.263
MIRA: Let me run you through the teleportation protocols.

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:33.999
RUNO: I'm listening.

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:36.969
KATO: I'm just glad I could help.

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:38.737
RUNO: Kato's the one you should thank.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.907
His crazy flying is what got me here in time.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.111
KATO: Oh my. You're much too kind Miss Runo.

00:20:46.144 --> 00:20:48.347
DAN: Well, I gotta tell you we're all psyched...

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.115
to have you back on the team.

00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:52.951
DRAGO: Yes. We've missed you, Runo.

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:56.421
RUNO: Oh Gee, thanks guys!

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:58.857
RADIZEN: Um, excuse me but I don't think we've been...

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.792
formally introduced.

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:03.128
DRAGO: Don't mind him. He talks too much!

00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:05.430
RUNO: Then we're gonna get along just fine!

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:09.468
JULIE: Hey, it's everyone's favourite roving reporter,

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:12.304
Julie here. You may not know this but Bakugan Land was

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:14.306
a fun park that the Bakugan erected as a thank-you to

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:16.608
the people of Earth for letting them live here.

00:21:16.642 --> 00:21:19.378
It used to be a super fun place for families to hang out,

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:22.114
but all of that's changed now, ever since that creep Wiseman

00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:25.317
showed up. So me and my trusty microphone are gonna get to

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.153
the bottom of this by asking Wiseman what the heck

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:31.223
his problem is. I mean, why does he have to spoil it

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:34.092
for everyone? Tune in to see how my interview goes.

00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:36.261
Until then, this is Julie signing off!

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:47.305
