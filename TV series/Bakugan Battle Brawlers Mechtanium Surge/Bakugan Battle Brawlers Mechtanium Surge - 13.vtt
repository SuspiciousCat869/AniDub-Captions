WEBVTT

00:00:08.104 --> 00:00:10.573
DAN: When Drago inherited the powers of the Sacred Orb

00:00:10.606 --> 00:00:12.075
we thought it would be a blessing,

00:00:12.108 --> 00:00:15.878
but instead it's a curse. He can't control his energy.

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:18.047
And both of us are being haunted by visions

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.450
of a sinister masked man called Mag Mel

00:00:20.483 --> 00:00:22.485
and his Bakugan Razenoid.

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:25.354
Everywhere we turn, evil forces like Teams Anubias

00:00:25.388 --> 00:00:28.357
and Sellon are infiltrating Bakugan Interspace.

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:30.893
DAN: Luckily we can count on Marucho and Shun.

00:00:30.927 --> 00:00:32.628
We might just have a chance of regaining control

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:35.832
of Bakugan Interspace and banishing Mag Mel for good!

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:38.501
\u266a What are ya gonna do? \u266a

00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:41.871
\u266a The odds are stacked against you, \u266a

00:00:41.904 --> 00:00:45.007
\u266a Back against the wall, You gotta give it your all, \u266a

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:48.344
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a This is the final stand, \u266a

00:00:48.377 --> 00:00:51.514
\u266a -a-a-a-a-a The powers in your hand! \u266a

00:00:51.547 --> 00:00:57.453
\u266a Two worlds collide, On the inside, \u266a

00:00:57.487 --> 00:01:00.323
\u266a You got to fight for what's right, \u266a

00:01:00.356 --> 00:01:03.218
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone... \u266a

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:05.889
\u266a This is BAKUGAN!

00:01:15.145 --> 00:01:21.385
SHUN: Huh?

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:24.054
SHUN: I'm trying to relax here. What's up?

00:01:24.088 --> 00:01:26.991
MARUCHO: Well Shun, I've been reviewing your battle

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:31.261
stats lately and I've noticed something rather troubling.

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:34.631
Your dive-in access times are way over the safe limit.

00:01:34.665 --> 00:01:36.000
If you don't take a break soon,

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.569
you're in danger of doing yourself harm.

00:01:38.602 --> 00:01:43.874
SHUN: I'm fine, okay? I've never felt better.

00:01:43.907 --> 00:01:46.243
MARUCHO: Well if that's true then prove it.

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:49.046
Why don't you fight me next, huh?

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.581
SHUN: Huh?

00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:52.883
MARUCHO: But here's the deal ... if I win

00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:54.518
you have to dive out of Interspace immediately

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:57.254
and take a rest in the real world, okay?

00:01:57.287 --> 00:01:59.823
SHUN: And why on Earth would you think I'd agree to that?

00:01:59.857 --> 00:02:02.426
I don't have time for your nonsense, Marucho.

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.128
Stay out of my way!

00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:13.137
MARUCHO: Shun, please.

00:02:14.138 --> 00:02:17.474
The Bakugan Battle Brawlers in: Re-connection

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.542
DAN: I'm sure the light we saw was...

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:26.513
DRAGO: Code Eve.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:28.781
Could it really be, Dan?

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.251
WYVERN: What is Code Eve?

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.086
DRAGO: We first encountered it in Neathia

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.321
while fighting off the Gundalians.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:38.024
The locals referred to it as the Sacred Orb.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:40.293
WYVERN: I'm not sure I understand, Drago.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.695
Why do you think Code Eve is responsible

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.898
for you losing control of your powers?

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:48.635
DAN: Because she's the one who gave them to him.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:54.107
DRAGO: That was right before she flew away and disappeared.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.011
DAN: Man! If Mag Mel hadn't interrupted us,

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:00.146
we could've pushed Code Eve for some answers.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.714
WYVERN: Perhaps, there is another way

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.183
to get those answers.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.250
DAN: Huh?

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.718
DRAGO: How?

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.554
WYVERN: What if the solution is to go back through

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.455
your own memories, to the first time you

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.857
encountered Code Eve?

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.126
DRAGO: How will that help, Wyvern?

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.662
WYVERN: You might find a clue to the truth that

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.565
perhaps you've forgotten along the way.

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:24.971
WYVERN: Come on. Let's give it a try.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.639
DAN: I remember this!

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:29.075
It's the place we first saw Code Eve.

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:32.278
WYVERN: That shining ball of light. It's so beautiful.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:33.479
Is that her?

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:37.016
DRAGO: Yes. The mother energy of all Bakugan.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.218
Inside of her are the DNA codes

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.721
for every Bakugan that has ever existed.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:43.723
DRAGO: I feel it too, but behind it

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:46.259
there's a strange foreboding. It's like I'm connected

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.361
to the orb and it can sense danger.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.863
I've never felt anything like this before.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.099
WYVERN: Tell me about that memory, Drago.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:55.134
DRAGO: Those feelings I was having were because of

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.570
the fact that I was one of the two original Bakugan

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.539
who were created by Code Eve.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.474
I didn't understand it at the time,

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.776
but what I was feeling was that original connection.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.945
Like the bond between mother and child.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.781
WYVERN: Interesting.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.016
DAN: Check it out, dude!

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.918
It's the first time we fought against Dharak.

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.319
DRAGO: Yes, I remember.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:16.389
That was an intense battle. Just when it came to a head,

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:26.633
Code Eve's light appeared and tried to separate us.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:29.402
DAN: Code Eve really saved our bacon that time.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.104
DRAGO: Are you kidding me?

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:35.141
She saved the entire planet from destruction.

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:37.076
WYVERN: And what about this?

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.779
DAN: That's when she put Dharak and us to the test.

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:42.382
DRAGO: She had Dharak and I battle each other

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:46.552
by telling us that she would give the winner her powers.

00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:49.422
DRAGO: Spire Dragon!

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.991
DHARAK: [grunt, pain reax]

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:54.727
DAN: You are one tough cookie, Drago!

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.063
DRAGO: Thanks, Dan. It certainly helps a lot

00:04:57.096 --> 00:05:01.034
having a partner with skills like yours.

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:02.902
DAN: Let's go!

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:07.640
DAN: Blitz Superior! DRAGO: Blitz Superior!

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:08.841
DHARAK: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:11.911
DRAGO: [grunt, exertion reax]

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:15.014
DHARAK: Aaaarrrggghhhh!

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:17.083
BARODIUS: Dharak!

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:21.054
DHARAK: Aaaaarrrrrrggggghhh! Drago!

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:24.290
CODE EVE: Congratulations, gentlemen. You were victorious

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:26.526
in your battle against Barodius and Dharak.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.662
Now, as promised I will bestow my powers onto you.

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:32.699
Use them wisely.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:34.233
DRAGO: [gasp] DAN: [grunt]

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:35.802
DRAGO: I just remembered something.

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.838
DAN: You and me both, pal.

00:05:51.884 --> 00:05:55.755
DAN: That feeling when you went through your last evolution.

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:57.323
DRAGO: It was the same as when we lost control

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.092
for the first time.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:01.160
WYVERN: It appears that you two have discovered

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:06.799
an important clue.

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:10.737
MAG MEL: [evil chuckle]

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.740
ANNOUNCER: Alrighty Battle Fans, it's that time again!

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:16.409
Today's Battle in Arena A features the new leader

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.544
of the Battle Brawlers, Shun Kazami!

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:20.012
ANNOUNCER: Let's check it out.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.848
SHUN: Ability activate!

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.750
SHUN: Shooting Wind Dust Slash.

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:25.651
TAYLEAN: Hmmmmph!

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:28.888
Haaaaaah!

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.556
ENEMY BATTLER: [angry grunt]

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.358
ANNOUNCER: Whoa! Shun really schooled

00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:33.559
his opponent with that one.

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:37.063
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [wild cheering]

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:40.400
PAIGE: Aw man, that Shun is a total monster.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.335
When was the last time you saw him take a break

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:43.803
from battling Rafe?

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:45.905
RAFE: Never. It's like he's afraid

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:50.042
that if he stops brawling, he'll just die.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.744
ANNOUNCER: Shun Kazami continues his

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:54.013
unbeatable streak as he blazes his way up

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.482
the tournament ranks. Up next will be his final match

00:06:56.516 --> 00:06:58.417
in Arena A where he will face the leader

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.020
of Team Anubias himself, Anubias.

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:03.156
The winner of that match, will then face-off against

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.258
the winner of the battle happening simultaneously

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:08.027
in Arena B. That mighty brawl features Marucho

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.463
of the Battle Brawlers against the head of Team Sellon,

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:11.964
Sellon!

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:16.068
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [woots and cheers]

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.172
SHUN: Maybe I'll be fighting Marucho after all.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:23.643
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: Ma-ru-cho! Ma-ru-cho! Ma-ru-cho!

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:26.412
SELLON: Time for a change of tune.

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:30.716
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: Sell-on! Sell-on! Sell-on!

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.718
SELLON: Can you hear me Anubias?

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:34.887
ANUBIAS: Every word. Loud and clear.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:38.224
SELLON: Then are you ready to proceed as planned?

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.259
ANUBIAS: Don't worry about me.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:51.971
ANNOUNCER: Bakugan Field, open!

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:55.374
ANUBIAS: Gate Card, set. [grunt]

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:57.443
ANUBIAS: Bakugan Brawl.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.345
ANUBIAS: Bakugan Stand.

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:05.651
ANUBIAS: Rise Darkus Horridian!

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:09.222
SELLON: Ability activate.

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:13.359
SELLON : Ancient Levity!

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:15.328
TRISTAR: Whooooooaaa!

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:16.796
MARUCHO: Tristar!

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.931
Ability activate!

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.032
MARUCHO: Shield Cyclone.

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:25.738
TRISTAR: Yeeeeah!

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:27.506
TRISTAR: You like that?

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.243
SELLON: You managed to nullify Spyron's ability.

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:31.744
Very well then.

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:46.292
SELLON: BakuNano, Daftorix. Destroy!

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:49.896
MARUCHO: Well this stinks. [grunt, exertion reax]

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:51.731
TRISTAR: Marucho!

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:54.300
TRISTAR: Aaaaaaaarrrrrrggggh!

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.769
SELLON: BakuNano Daftorix, can create an array

00:08:56.802 --> 00:09:00.640
of artificial weather phenomenon.

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:03.276
MARUCHO: She's totally crazy if she thinks

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:06.279
a little rain is all it will take to stop me.

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.781
MARUCHO: Gate Card, open!

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:16.422
MARUCHO: Clim Freeze!

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:47.086
comes from behind to claim the victory!

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:51.290
MARUCHO: Nice one.

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:52.725

No way.

BEN: So what's the matter kid?

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:56.455
Are you having second thoughts about joining

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.491
Team Anubias as our number one fan?

00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:01.927

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:12.104
'Cos normally he could take him down in a snap.

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:13.305

one another for the title of Interspace Champion!

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:27.086
MARUCHO: I'm sorry. I wish it didn't have to come to this

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:33.092
but you left me no choice.

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:37.263

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:52.078

RAFE: Yeah he is but, check out Marucho's face.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.668
RAFE: That's one determined battler.

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:51.737
MARUCHO: This is so absurd that we're fighting each other Shun.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.173
And it's all because you feel like you need to fill the void

00:12:54.206 --> 00:12:56.509
left behind by Dan.

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:40.019
RAFE: Yeah maybe, but I wouldn't count Shun out.

00:13:40.052 --> 00:13:41.487
Not this early.

TRISTAR: Aaaarrrrrggggghhhh!

00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:05.010

MARUCHO: I know it's been tough since Dan left us

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:22.494
but no one asked you to take things on

MARUCHO: You got so mad when Dan wouldn't ask for help

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:39.845
then you did the same thing!

00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:41.880

TAYLEAN: Haaaaaah!

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.115
MARUCHO: You're not the only one who's in pain

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:19.318
over this situation, Shun. Dan was my best friend too.

00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:20.719
Remember?

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.788
The Brawlers are a family, so when one of us

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:24.323

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:25.758

MARUCHO: Egon Mainzer is a command card that boosts

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.206
the power level of the Bakugan who activated it.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.142

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:38.697
MARUCHO: I can't believe it. I just lost.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.899
SHUN: Marucho, please stand up.

00:16:40.933 --> 00:16:44.103
MARUCHO: Huh?

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:46.338

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:49.975
Thank-you, my friend.

00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:51.677
MARUCHO: Really?

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.847
SHUN: I was so concerned about protecting Interspace,

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.250
that I completely lost sight of what was really important here.

00:16:58.283 --> 00:16:59.718
MARUCHO: Our team!

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:04.022
SHUN: From now on we need to stick together, okay?

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:06.792
MARUCHO: Yeah! No matter what!

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:09.395
MARUCHO: Oh but first, promise me you'll pop out

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:11.930
to the real world to rest up for a while, okay?

00:17:11.964 --> 00:17:14.800
SHUN: Sure. You bet.

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:22.307
CROWD OF SPECTATORS: [applause]

00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:25.177
RAFE: So conflict made their bond stronger.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.080
PAIGE: I gotta say, Marucho is an impressive little dude.

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:30.282
I think I'm becoming a real fan Rafe.

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:32.651
RAFE: Yeah, I think this battle has shown

00:17:32.684 --> 00:17:37.556
what a strong character he is. He's tough.

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:41.693
SELLON: Hmmmph. Now, the Brawlers will be fighting

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:46.131
as a team again. The results should be spectacular!

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:47.599
ANUBIAS: Are you serious?

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:50.402
Hah! Why should I care at all?

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:52.571
SELLON: The strength of the energy produced by

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:55.274
their battles will free Mag Mel faster.

00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:56.442
ANUBIAS: Whatever.

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:59.144
Just don't expect me to lose on purpose again.

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:02.881
SELLON: Hmmmph. You'll do whatever the Master requires.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:09.154
And you'll do it with a smile, do you understand?

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:11.223
DRAGO: So we're in agreement that the lack

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.292
of control I have over my powers

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:15.227
is somehow connected to Code Eve.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.197
DAN: Yeah, but we still don't have a clue

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.632
on how to put a leash on them do we?

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:23.135
DRAGO: Perhaps there was something faulty in my evolution

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:26.238
where I was unable to handle the strength of my new gifts.

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.640
After all, whenever a Bakugan evolves they're

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:31.243
supposed to get better, faster, stronger.

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:34.246
Maybe the defect isn't in the powers but in me.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:36.215
DAN: It's not just you buddy.

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:37.783
DRAGO: What?

00:18:37.816 --> 00:18:40.119
DAN: Whenever a Bakugan evolves, their partner needs to

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:42.454
advance as well. If you're having trouble

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:44.089
with your powers maybe it's because

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:46.725
I'm the one who hasn't come along as far as I need to.

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:48.227
DRAGO: Maybe you're right.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.895
DAN: You and I need to work together

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:52.231
and push each other to be the best that we can be.

00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:54.066
Then we can figure this thing out!

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:56.602
DRAGO: That sounds like the best plan I've heard in a long time.

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:58.203
DAN: Glad to hear it.

00:18:58.237 --> 00:18:59.771
DAN: Well, I don't know about you, but I'm ready

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:01.440
to jump into some training exercises.

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:02.808
What do ya say?

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.109
DRAGO: Let's do it!

00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:05.811
WYVERN: We may not have solved the entire riddle,

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:08.647
but these two are finally on a solid path to finding

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.717
the answers they need. Now if they can just remember

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:16.622
that the key to succeeding is working together. Always.

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:19.791
Good luck, friends. Until the next time we meet.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.426
I'll be watching over you.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.761
DRAGO: Huh?

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:24.830
DAN: Where did Wyvern go?

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:34.439
DRAGO: I don't know, but I wanted to say thank-you.

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:36.742
SELLON: The key and the gate, Sire?

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:38.076
MAG MEL: Correct.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.780
MAG MEL: Humans are joined to their Bakugan by a switch code.

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:44.750
When Code Eve bestowed her powers upon Drago,

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:47.519
Dan's switch code became a type of key

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:49.788
and Drago's DNA became a gate.

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:51.557
ANUBIAS: I'm not sure I understand Master.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.358
What is it you're saying?

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:55.527
MAG MEL: The reason Kuso and Drago have failed

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.863
to control their powers is because they haven't

00:19:57.896 --> 00:20:01.066
been able to get their gate and key to work properly.

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:04.570
They're out of synch. I need you to steal both

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:06.805
elements before they figure it out.

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:09.575
MAG MEL: With the gate and the key I can take

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:13.478
Code Eve's powers and use them. Not only will I have total

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:16.515
control of all Bakugan but I will also be able

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:18.450
to make myself whole again.

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:21.086
ANUBIAS: I will gladly fetch that for you, Master.

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:22.754
MAG MEL: Sellon. ANUBIAS: [gasp]

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:25.190
MAG MEL: Go to New Vestroia and retrieve

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:26.858
that which I have asked for!

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:29.227
SELLON: And what if I have to destroy Dan and Drago

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:30.829
in the process, Sire?

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:33.865
MAG MEL: [evil chuckle] Do whatever it takes.

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:38.203
SELLON: Very well. I will make you proud Master Mag Mel.

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:40.138
SELLON: Try not to let things fall apart

00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:42.207
while I'm gone, Anubias.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.843
ANUBIAS: [angry grunt] SELLON: Hmmmph.

00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:51.450
I will be back before you know it.

00:20:51.483 --> 00:20:56.355
SELLON: So this is what New Vestroia looks like.

00:20:56.388 --> 00:21:07.532
Good thing I won't be staying long.

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:09.635
DAN: After Wyvern's help, thing s were starting to look up for

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:12.404
Drago and I. We were starting to get our groove back.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.406
Not only that, but back on Earth Marucho and Shun

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.308
had patched up their differences and were fighting

00:21:16.341 --> 00:21:19.478
as a team again. But then we got thrown another curve ball.

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.880
Some creepy chick who was sent by Mag Mel showed up

00:21:21.913 --> 00:21:24.916
and started causing trouble. She was serious business too.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.153
She could control multiple Mechtogan at the same time!

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:30.355
It was gonna take everything we had to stop her!

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:33.492
Don't believe me? Tune in to se e the insanity she unleashed!

00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:36.628
DAN: It's chaos like no one's ever seen before!

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:37.663
