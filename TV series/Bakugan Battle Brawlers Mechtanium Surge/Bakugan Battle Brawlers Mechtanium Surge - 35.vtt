WEBVTT

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.941
DAN KOUZO: Things on Earth were going really well

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.409
after the Bakugan came to live with us.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.245
But then out of nowhere, we were invaded

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.847
by these mysterious evil Mechtogan

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.648
who were intent on destroyed everything!

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.017
Coredegon,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.218
Slycerak,

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:19.252
Exostriker,

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.387
and Mandibor were their names,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.022
and leading them was this clown, Wiseman.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.724
They also had help from an evil pack of Bakugan

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:25.892
called the Nonets.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:27.427
Luckily for us, we had our own secret weapon

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.263
in the form of Dragonoid Destroyer.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.766
So we fought back, because no one is gonna take our freedom-

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.968
not now, not ever!

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.703
\u266a What are you gonna do?

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.074
\u266a The odds are stacked against you \u266a

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:43.510
\u266a Back against the wall

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.845
\u266a Gotta give it your all

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.349
\u266a This is the final stand

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.917
\u266a The power's in your hand

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.153
\u266a Two worlds collide

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:54.387
\u266a On the inside

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:59.993
\u266a You got to fight for what's right \u266a

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.662
\u266a Before it's gone, gone, gone

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.130
\u266a This is Bakugan

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:20.847
\u266a

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.318
It's so good to be back.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.892
Hey, guys. Look who it is!

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.427
Welcome back, Mira.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.495
You look really great!

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:38.665
Hey there, everyone.

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.667
(Excited babbling)

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.435
It's good to see you too.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.972
I trust you're feeling way better.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.440
Oh, yes.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:51.144
The doctors kept me in for an extra week in the end!

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.313
Better safe than sorry.

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.248
Just make sure you don't push yourself too hard

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.349
like you did before.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.652
Don't worry, I've learned my lesson.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.621
And besides, I've got help.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.656
From Runo, now.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.326
Uh-- yeah! Of course.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.296
But are-- are you sure you're not mad at me?

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.431
Mm-hm.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.999
It wasn't your fault.

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:14.767
The Battle Suits were stolen.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:15.768
You sure?

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.904
Take it easy on yourself, Runo.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.739
That scumbag Wiseman tricked us all!

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:20.740
(Growling)

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:22.442
Hey! Take it easy.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.110
(Gibberish)

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:25.378
I know that Gunz is Wiseman

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.280
and that he and Reptak used to be partners.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:28.281
So what?

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.984
It's okay, Roxtor. Radizen is right.

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.386
The Gunz we were fighting isn't the person I used to know.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.921
What's wrong, Kouzo?

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:36.890
You look disappointed.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:41.127
Perhaps you were looking for...

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.463
your old friend, Gunz?

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.331
So then,

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.967
it was you all along, Gunz!

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.370
You creep!

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:52.805
Gunz, Wiseman, whatever his name is,

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.574
he's the enemy now.

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:57.043
I understand that and I'm ready to fight no matter what.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:58.344
That's the spirit.

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.513
We're gonna get to the bottom of this multiple personality

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:02.582
one way or another. (Grunting)

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.656
DAN: Bakugan Battle Brawlers in--

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.197
MIRA: As unfortunate as it is

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.200
that Wiseman stole a bunch of Battle Suits,

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:23.236
luckily for us he didn't get Defendtrix.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.672
What makes you say that, Mira?

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:29.642
So why is Defendtrix so special?

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:33.346
Well, Defendtrix has an EMPS,

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.916
which stands for electro-magnetic pulse system.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.585
DAN: Um, yeah. Great.

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:39.852
So what the heck is that?

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:44.157
It's a device that shoots out an electrical disturbance signal,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.793
rendering other Battle Suits useless in three minute bursts.

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.127
So once we use it,

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.930
we'll only have a short window to get our BakuMeter back.

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:52.765
Do you understand, Dan?

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.435
Three minutes should be plenty.

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:56.836
You said it, pal.

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.539
I don't think Wiseman's going to wait very long

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.475
before trying to use our own suits against us in battle.

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:06.412
I bet that creep's chomping at the bit.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:09.015
You're right, so let's not sit around and wait

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.483
for him to get the first shot in, okay?

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.691
Let's take the fight to Wiseman!

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.331
Wiseman!

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:26.799
Mm?

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.835
You haven't said much since you came back

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:31.771
from your last battle with your tail between your legs.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:34.741
What are we waiting around for?

00:04:34.774 --> 00:04:36.509
(Softly chuckling)

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.811
Don't take your frustrations over your own failure

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:40.880
out on me, Kodokor.

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.282
What did you say?

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.717
Every battle we've lost against the Battle Brawlers

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:46.319
has been the result of you Nonets

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:48.955
not having enough power to defeat Drago.

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:51.457
How dare you speak to us like that?!

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.326
Take it easy, Kodokor.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:56.195
I wasn't finished speaking yet so listen up.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.632
Inside this device are the new Battle Suits Mira developed

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.067
that I managed to steal

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.136
from Battle Brawlers headquarters.

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.203
Interesting.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:07.006
Yes, what can these suits do?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.042
Why talk more

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:12.011
when we can take this thing out for a test drive instead?

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.647
Excellent. Now you're speaking my language!

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:18.184
So does this mean you're done trying to shift the blame to me,

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.153
and that I have your trust?

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:25.625
Okay, let's get to it.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:28.061
Who wants to join me for the next round against the Brawlers?

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.630
The rest of you can stand back.

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.031
I'm first in line for this.

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:33.866
I'm going too.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.735
I've got unfinished business with those rodents.

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:39.172
This better not be another one

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:42.208
of your failed strategies, Wiseman!

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.210
Ha! (Chuckling)

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:53.419
Balista, are you in or out?

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:55.388
Thanks, but I'll pass.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.538
Ready to roll, guys?

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:14.307
Yeah. MARUCHO: You bet!

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.276
Bakugan-- brawl!

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.645
Baku Sky Raider, jump!

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.282
Go for it, Fusion Dragonoid!

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:32.625
\u266a

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.994
Bakugan, brawl!

00:06:35.027 --> 00:06:38.598
Baku Sky Raider, jump!

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:40.366
Go! Haos, Reptak!

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.367
Ha!

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.336
Bakugan, brawl!

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.304
Bakugan, Spin!

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:47.774
Go Aquos Radizen!

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:49.876
Bring on the brawling!

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.412
Bakugan, brawl!

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.814
Baku Sky Raider, jump!

00:06:54.847 --> 00:06:58.317
Go get 'em, Jaakor!

00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:00.386
(Roaring)

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.888
(Thundering landing)

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:06.192
RUNO OVER RADIO: Everyone in position, Dan?

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:08.161
We're good to go.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:09.829
Okay!

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.631
Here we go, guys!

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:14.133
(Beeping)

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.570
Coordinates set.

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:20.540
Battle Suit Defendtrix,

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.308
teleport to Drago.

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:26.212
Battle Suit Doomtronic 02,

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:28.881
teleport to Reptak.

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.420
Are you ready, Marucho?

00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:35.421
MARUCHO: You bet!

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:37.290
(Beeping)

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:38.891
Battle Suit Blasterate,

00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:41.394
teleport to Radizen!

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.201
(Fire roaring)

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:49.368
(Grunting)

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:53.005
(Epic music playing)

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:55.174
Uagh!

00:07:55.208 --> 00:08:00.179
\u266a

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:01.948
Oh, yeah!

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.282
Connection complete.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:04.951
Now powering up battle system.

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.652
(Beeping)

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.421
Synchro-rate full power!

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:10.923
(Rumbling, birds chirping)

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.698
Flying around with those Battle Suits

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:21.467
requires a lot of physical and mental stamina.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.937
I hope Wiseman doesn't keep us waiting for long.

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:29.008
Luckily, our Bakugan seem to have more power than the Nonets.

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:32.445
What happens if Wiseman doesn't fall for our trick?

00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:34.981
Maybe it's too obvious!

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.482
It doesn't matter.

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:39.085
Wiseman will want nothing more than to try to defeat us

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:40.953
using our own suits.

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:42.955
He'll come, don't worry.

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:45.758
Reptak, Radizen.

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:46.959
Since we're out here anyway,

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:49.428
we might as well get some practice in.

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:51.330
You read my mind, Drago.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.132
I'm totally down with that plan.

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:55.601
I am way ahead of you guys. Let's do this!

00:08:55.635 --> 00:08:57.370
Whoa!

00:08:57.403 --> 00:08:59.338
(Blasting)

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.439
That's right.

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:03.809
You gotta stay on your toes when you're battling me.

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:05.678
Too bad you left your back completely open. Hah!

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:08.648
Whoa! Where did that come from?

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:09.649
(Crashing)

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:11.851
Maybe I shouldn't have spoken so soon!

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:13.586
Uagh!

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.855
(Grunting)

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:16.956
Oh yeah, pal?

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.925
Whoa!

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.460
Oh, man, this is awesome!

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.396
Look at those guys go out there!

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:24.397
Wow!

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.632
You do know they're just practicing, right?

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:28.301
It's not a real battle.

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:31.370
Well, of course I do but sometimes I just--

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.439
get carried away.

00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:40.212
You hear that?

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.514
Yeah.

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:45.084
It sounds like Wiseman's here.

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:50.489
There you are!

00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:51.590
(Growling)

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:53.492
It was hard to miss you.

00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:55.661
You practically sent flares up.

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:57.863
I didn't expect the welcome wagon.

00:09:57.897 --> 00:09:59.999
(Groaning)

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:01.467
What do ya say, Kouzo?

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.602
Shall we get down to business?

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:05.504
I'm ready whenever you are, Wiseman.

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:06.973
Okay, then.

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:13.346
Bakugan, brawl!

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:16.916
Baku Sky Raider, jump!

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.684
Rise, Darkus Kodokor!

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:19.685
Rah!

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:23.155
Baku Sky Raider, jump!

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:25.324
Rise, Darkus Mutabrid!

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:28.060
Baku Sky Raider, jump!

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:30.162
Rise, Darkus Betadron!

00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:31.230
(Growling)

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:34.834
Deploy Battle Suits!

00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:40.473
Combustoid, Clawbruk, Fortatron!

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:50.616
\u266a

00:10:56.389 --> 00:11:00.259
Does anything here look familiar to you, Dan?

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:03.662
Maybe, but we'll be taking those back!

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:07.733
Well then, come and get them, Kouzo!

00:11:07.767 --> 00:11:11.237
Prepare to have your Battle Suits turned on you, Brawlers!

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:17.176
Get ready, Radizen. We can do this.

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:23.749
DAN: Drago! Run interference on Combustoid!

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:25.351
You got it.

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:29.422
Where are you going, Drago?

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:31.590
Hah!

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:34.193
(Grunting)

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:36.062
(Blasting)

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:38.330
DAN: Time for our secret weapon, Drago!

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.333
Electro-magnetic pulse system engage!

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.701
I don't think so!

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:44.937
(Grunting)

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.974
So, Betadron, how do you like fighting in the new Battle Suit?

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:51.444
Not too bad!

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.946
I could get used to this. (Snickering)

00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.183
Get back here!

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:59.118
(Grunting)

00:11:59.151 --> 00:12:01.120
You're too slow!

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:02.188
(Grunting)

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:04.290
DAN: Stay on him, Drago!

00:12:04.323 --> 00:12:06.258
No problem.

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:09.462
Hold on. You didn't forget about me, did you?

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:10.796
Agh!

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.998
He can't use the pulse!

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:14.834
(Whooshing)

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:18.938
Give it up, Drago.

00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:22.408
(Blasting)

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:25.945
Marucho, you have to get them away from Drago.

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:26.946
MARUCHO: Okay!

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:29.215
You heard the man, Radizen.

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:30.916
You got it, Boss!

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.186
Reptak, we need you to act as backup for Drago.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.254
No problem.

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:37.189
Let's go, Jaakor.

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:38.457
Right.

00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:40.693
(Blasting)

00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:42.328
Ha, ha, ha!

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:48.067
Let go of me, you fool!

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.203
Ability Activate!

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:54.073
Moonlight Shadow Slash!

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:55.508
Hah!

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:57.409
Agh, ungh!

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:04.483
We need some one-on-one time, Mutabrid.

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:16.162
Okay, Wiseman.

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.863
You think no one has seen you

00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:21.333
come down this hallway at night, but I have.

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:23.669
Now that you're out of the way,

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:26.805
it's time to see if you've been hiding something.

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:29.775
Hmm.

00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:32.778
What do we have over here?

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.614
(Growling)

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.449
Hmm.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.351
(Grumbling)

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:43.923
Should be right here.

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:44.924
Hmph!

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:45.925
(Straining)

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.027
(Stone rumbling)

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:53.732
I knew it!

00:13:56.268 --> 00:13:57.870
What?

00:13:57.903 --> 00:14:00.206
What the--

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:06.412
Those annoying little gnats are getting on my nerves.

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:10.783
You're not gonna take me down!

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:12.818
Are ya sure about that?

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:14.086
(Cackling)

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:16.088
Catch me if you can!

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:18.557
(Chuckling) Oh, snap.

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:20.559
(Babbling)

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:22.428
What do ya mean, this Battle Suit doesn't have air brakes?

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:23.729
Of all the places to cut corners!

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:24.730
Whoa!

00:14:24.763 --> 00:14:27.700
Ooh! Ah! Aye-yi-yi-yi!

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:29.335
I got this, I got this--

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:30.402
Here we go!

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:31.403
Yah!

00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:32.538
(Crashing, grunting)

00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:36.208
Well, that didn't go as planned.

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:38.277
(Babbling)

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:43.215
I thought you wanted to fight, Jaakor,

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:45.150
not play a game of tag.

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:47.620
But I've had it with your nonsense.

00:14:47.653 --> 00:14:49.154
(Grunting)

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:50.289
(Blasting)

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:51.290
(Grunting)

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:53.559
Your strategy to pull me away from Wiseman

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:55.261
is pathetic and transparent,

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:58.230
not something I would expect from a Ninja battler

00:14:58.264 --> 00:14:59.565
such as you.

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:02.001
If my plan is so transparent,

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:03.269
then why are you here chasing me?

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:05.304
It's simple.

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:07.306
I have a Battle Suit and you don't!

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:09.074
That gives me the upper hand

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:12.544
and means I'll make short work of you.

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:13.646
(Crashing)

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.814
Ah! Where'd he go?

00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:17.316
Looks like your Battle Suit

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:19.451
is no match for my Ninja stealth after all!

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:20.452
Huh?

00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:23.255
Ability Activate!

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.460
Fierce Demon- Thunder Clap!

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:29.928
Let's see how you like this!

00:15:29.962 --> 00:15:32.765
Quit running, you coward!

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.600
Not again!

00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:35.834
(Grunting)

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:37.469
(Blasting) Agh!

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:39.438
It's not enough.

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:40.539
DAN: I know!

00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:43.042
We need to figure out a way to inflict greater damage.

00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:44.443
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? Yes.

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:46.712
I'm reading your mail too.

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:48.947
Okay then, let's do this!

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:57.990
(Roaring)

00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:01.560
(Clanging)

00:16:01.593 --> 00:16:03.295
(Crashing)

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:08.534
I just clipped the wings of the mighty Drago!

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:14.973
Today's the day I finally get my revenge

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:17.309
by putting you down for good!

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:20.446
(Explosion)

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:23.916
Give it up. There's no point in hiding.

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:26.685
It's over for you, Drago!

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:28.153
(Grunting)

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:34.493
(Straining)

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:37.963
(Explosion)

00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:39.565
Hold on.

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:45.471
What?

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:48.073
(Chuckling)

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:50.142
Where did Drago go?

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:54.413
Betadron! It's a trap!

00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:57.383
Thanks, Reptak.

00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:59.385
(Whooshing) Oh, no!

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:00.719
EM pulse--

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:01.920
--engage!

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:04.423
(Energy humming)

00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:08.060
(Zapping)

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:10.229
(Straining)

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:15.000
I can't-- move my body!

00:17:15.033 --> 00:17:18.003
It's-- got me-- too!

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:21.507
Okay, we've shut them down temporarily.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.541
Now what?

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:24.109
Ram into them, hard!

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:26.612
We're trying to get his BakuMeter back, not crush them.

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:27.880
Are you sure that's going to work?

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:29.214
Trust me, pal.

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:31.583
It seems too heavy-handed.

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:33.585
Wiseman said we had to take it from him,

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:35.220
so that's what we're gonna do!

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:40.125
Okay, then.

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:42.094
Hang on!

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:50.202
(Screaming)

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:52.671
(Grunting)

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:54.873
Hand it over, you slimy creep!

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.875
Never, punk!

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:02.214
Time to feel my rage!

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:05.083
(Blasting)

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:06.185
MARUCHO: Oh, no!

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:07.719
He's deflecting all of your attacks!

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.189
(Both straining)

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:11.957
You're a thief and a cheat!

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.158
Yeah, so what, Kouzo?

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:14.860
You're unbelievable!

00:18:14.893 --> 00:18:16.328
Back off!

00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:17.329
Hand it over.

00:18:17.362 --> 00:18:20.032
No! Not-- (Straining)

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:21.300
I can't!

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:23.068
Gunz!

00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:26.672
Any final words, Kouzo, before I take you down?

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.476
Is it really you?

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:33.545
I told you to let go of me!

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:34.813
(Grunting)

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:37.616
(Screaming)

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:38.817
(Blasting)

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:39.818
Had enough yet?

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:41.253
MARUCHO: Jump, Radizen!

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.955
Whoa!

00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:45.224
(Explosion) Aah!

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:49.962
Dan.

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:55.901
(Dizzy groaning)

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.039
(Grunting)

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:03.775
(Panting)

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:08.013
(Soft chuckling)

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:10.682
You are a stubborn one, aren't you?

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:11.750
I guess you really did

00:19:11.783 --> 00:19:14.052
want the BakuMeter back, huh, Kouzo?

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:19.024
What we want is the BakuMeter

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:21.627
and the real Gunz back!

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.030
Sorry to tell you, but that guy is long gone.

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:27.366
(Grunting)

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:28.967
Agh!

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:32.771
I'm gonna have to take a rain check on today's battle, Kouzo.

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:34.773
Wait! (Groaning)

00:19:35.807 --> 00:19:38.210
Nonets! Time to retreat.

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:41.046
(Growling)

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.180
(Beeping)

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:44.683
But I was winning!

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:48.187
This isn't over!

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:54.092
Until we meet again, Brawlers.

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:56.261
Come back here, you!

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:57.863
(Groaning in pain)

00:19:57.896 --> 00:20:00.198
Are you okay, Dan?

00:20:00.232 --> 00:20:01.233
What happened?

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:05.037
We saw you fall, Dan!

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.905
But you put up a good fight, though.

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.173
I guess.

00:20:08.206 --> 00:20:09.841
(Groaning)

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.613
He's not gonna get away with this!

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:22.487
\u266a

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:25.824
(Stone rumbling)

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:32.898
I told you to-- let go of me!

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:34.833
(Internally) It looks like I borrowed more from Gunz

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:36.768
than just his appearance.

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:54.553
\u266a

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:55.754
No matter.

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:58.957
I'll be done with this body soon enough.

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:01.727
(Sinister chuckling)

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:09.368
WISEMAN: I know that the Nonets

00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:11.169
are seething with anger and frustration

00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:13.839
at not having beaten the Brawlers in battle yet,

00:21:13.872 --> 00:21:15.774
but it is still crucial that they trust me.

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:17.809
This has all been part of my greater plan,

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:20.278
and if they hold out just a short while longer,

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:21.680
they will finally enact the vengeance

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:24.349
that they have been waiting countless millennia for.

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:26.284
Now that we have the Battle Suits in our possession,

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:27.552
it is only a matter of time

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:29.321
before Drago and the rest of his Bakugan brethren

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:30.389
are put down for good!

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:33.025
Tune in, because after this next fight,

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:37.095
you may never see the Brawlers or their Bakugan ever again!

00:21:38.096 --> 00:21:48.106
